	   LOVELAND, Ohio (AP) -- It has been a long time since Janet Kalven slept in a
stall in a cow barn or pumped water for bathing. Grailville, the women's
spiritual and educational center that she helped establish and where she has
lived for much of the last 55 years, has grown a lot less primitive, but its
basic vision is unchanged, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we first settled on this farm, we shared a vision of changing the
world through spiritual renewal," said Ms. Kalven, 86. "Grailville was to be a
countercultural oasis where we integrated manual and intellectual work with
spiritual deepening, and that is still true today even though we've adapted to
changing times."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Kalven was 31 years old when she and 13 other women settled on the
183-acre farm in the rural community of Loveland in 1944. The women belonged to
the Grail, an organization of Roman Catholic lay women founded in the
Netherlands in 1921 and dedicated to promoting religious and social change. It
spread to the United States with a temporary center set up in Chicago in 1940.
</P>
<P>
	   Four years later, a member's inheritance and a loan from the Cincinnati
archdiocese provided the $49,250 to purchase the farm at Loveland, about 20
miles northeast of Cincinnati. The rolling acres of fields, woods, ponds and
creeks surrounding a three-story Victorian mansion and numerous outbuildings
became the Grail's national home.
</P>
<P>
	   "We moved the animals out of the barns and ourselves in. I lived the first
summer in a box stall 45 by 110 feet," said Ms. Kalven. "We all shared one
shower in the main house, which was the only building with plumbing and central
heating."
</P>
<P>
	   The group also used outdoor privies and fashioned orange crates into shelves
and washstands. Over time, the buildings were transformed into meeting rooms and
living quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, the private, nonprofit center remained mostly self-sufficient
with as many as 100 women in residence at times. They raised dairy and beef
cattle, chickens, corn and wheat and maintained vegetable gardens and an
orchard.
</P>
<P>
	   Catholic rituals, prayer, meditation, study and manual labor made up the
daily routine. But with the societal shifts brought by the 1960s, some
Grailville women saw communal living as less attractive than other, newly
available opportunities for bringing social change.
</P>
<P>
	   "The growing interest in civil rights, women's rights and the antiwar
movement combined with major changes in the Catholic church affected us
greatly," said Ms. Kalven.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was difficult to see friends leave -- that was very hard," she added,
her voice catching with emotion. "But we survived."
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next three decades, Grail membership was opened up to women of
other faiths, and more married women and divorced women became involved. The
Grail, which now numbers about 1,000 members in 21 countries also became more
vocal on global issues such as peace, social justice, women's rights and
ecology.
</P>
<P>
	   Grailville now consists of 300 acres and 18 buildings. While only six women
live at Grailville, 40 to 50 Grail members living in the region take part in its
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Grailville's income comes from sales at its bookstore and gardens,
lease payments for the farmland and fees for conferences and retreats.
</P>
<P>
	   "Grailville attracts groups and individuals from all over the world," said
director Karen Zerhusen. "I think they are drawn not only by the peace and
tranquility of the surrounding nature but also by the energy that seems to flow
throughout this place."
</P>
<P>
	   One of many organizations that have held conferences at Grailville is
Cincinnati-based Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. A group of P&AMP;G women sales executives who
met there gave Grailville high marks, said Chuck Moore, a company official.
</P>
<P>
	   "It allowed them to ratchet-down the adrenaline flow and get away from their
cell phones and other distractions," said Moore. "At Grailville, they could get
to know and support each other better while working and reflecting on bigger
issues."
</P>
<P>
	   The cream-colored Victorian mansion with its high ceilings, stained wood
floors and glass-walled dining room still serves as the centerpiece. Grailville
can accommodate about 70 people overnight and up to 150 for day meetings, Ms.
Zerhusen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The gardens are now completely chemical-free, and Grailville sells an
increasing amount of its organic produce to area restaurants. Community-oriented
programs such as the Women's Resource Center, which provides transportation,
clothing and other support services to lower-income women attempting to find
jobs, are also thriving.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have been a divorced, single mom for 10 years, and one of the things that
drew me to the Grail was the support I received," said resource center director
Lynn Louchart-Kiefer. "The energy that flows when women come together here is
great. They encourage your dreams and aspirations."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Kalven agreed. "The utopian community may be gone," she said, "but the
intensity of spirit that has sustained us through the years is still here."

<HEADLINE> Bruno proposes paying counties' new health plan costs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Legislature's top Republican wants the
state to pick up the extra costs facing counties from New York's expanded health
plan for the poor approved in December.
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said Thursday that his plan would
save the state's 57 counties and New York City $340 million over the next three
years. Bruno called it a property taxpayer relief proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   When the state adopted its Family Health Plus program in December, Bruno and
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, had lobbied for the state to pick
up any extra cost that might be charged to the counties and New York City. They
were rebuffed by Republican Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the state's Medicaid rules, the federal government picks up 50 percent
of the cost of such programs while the state and its counties, including New
York City, each cover 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki aides had argued in December that the counties could cover the extra
costs by dipping into their share of the national tobacco settlement and from
their savings under Medicaid cost-containment provisions that were being
extended as part of the health package. The counties had argued they wanted to
use the tobacco money for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said Thursday that he felt the extra costs for the state could be
financed as part of the new state budget that is for the state fiscal year that
begins April 1. The Senate leader said his proposal would be part of the budget
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, in Florida on Thursday for the start of a three-day, fund-raising
trip to benefit his campaign committee, issued a statement that seemed to kick
sand on Bruno's proposal. The governor reiterated the savings from Medicaid
cost-containment for the counties and the tobacco settlement money they would be
getting.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will work to ensure the adopted budget continues to provide record tax
relief for New Yorkers while protecting the state's fiscal integrity," Pataki's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bruno repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether he and
the governor, usually political allies, were at odds over the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're trying to get me to pick a fight with the governor," Bruno said.
"The governor and I are buddies and partners and this is the year of love, not
war."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno conceded that with all 211 legislative seats up for election this
year, a proposal like his might have extra appeal to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly in an election year, it's a hell of a lot nicer to be cutting
taxes than the alternative," the Senate leader said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Bruno plan, New York City would save $200 million over the next
three years while the state's remaining 57 counties would save $140 million. The
expanded health program expires after three years unless it is extended by the
Legislature and governor.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for Silver said Thursday that he still supported relieving
counties of the extra costs.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush ballot battles to continue in federal court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge might be Sen. John McCain's last
hope to run in the New York Republican presidential primary in most of the
state.
<P>
	   An Albany County judge on Thursday threw the Arizona senator off the March 7
ballot in eight of the state's congressional districts, saying McCain didn't get
enough GOP signatures to compete in those districts. If the decision stands,
McCain's name will not be on the Republican presidential ballot in a fourth of
the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   However, McCain's lawyers planned today to ask a federal judge in Brooklyn
to put McCain on the ballot in all 31 of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know that I'm a qualified candidate," McCain told reporters after a
town hall meeting at Nashua High School in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would take the issue to the floor of the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia this summer if the courts fail to satisfy him.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed, calling the signature requirements "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Cannizzaro late Thursday overturned the state
Board of Elections' decision to allow McCain to compete in the challenged
districts despite challenges from state Republicans, most of whom support GOP
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In the challenged districts, the Arizona senator did not have the number of
signatures on his presidential petitions to qualify for the state primary.
However, McCain supporters argued that since he was a valid national
presidential primary contender, the signature requirement should not apply to
him.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed, calling the signature requirements "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not the prerogative of any single candidate to interpose his or her
own judgment in place of that of the state Legislature in this regard," the
judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to
qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31
congressional districts. In effect, there are 31 separate GOP primaries in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters had challenged McCain in 16 of those districts. Cannizzaro's
decision leaves McCain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Buley, a state Republican Committee lawyer working in support of Bush,
cheered the decision. "We're pleased and think it was the proper decision," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign lawyer Henry Berger said they had not yet decided whether
to appeal Cannizzaro's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are disappointed," Berger said Thursday. "But I'm going to see what
happens in federal court tomorrow and then make a decision whether to appeal."
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has become even more important.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats helped McCain stay on the ballot in those eight districts. The two
Republican members of the state Board of Elections had voted on Wednesday to
uphold the challenges to McCain's petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   But the board's two Democrats abstained, thus depriving the Bush camp of the
third vote it needed to have the petitions invalidated for a lack of signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no clear indication Thursday when the ballot for New York's March
7 primary would be final. The state board had hoped to complete the ballot by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cannizzaro's decision is part of the battle over New York's March 7
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Developer Donald Trump won the right to compete for Independence Party
backing and Steve Forbes lost his spot on the Republican ballot in three Long
Island congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump, who is not an announced presidential candidate, is considering
running for the Reform Party's presidential nomination. His New York supporters,
who operate as the Independence Party, are seeking to run delegate slates for
him in the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But a coalition within the Independence Party has been trying to have
Trump's delegates thrown off the ballot. The Democracy Coalition supports
Trump's nemesis and Reform presidential candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   In retaliation for the Long Island challenge to his petitions, Forbes is
seeking a court order to remove frontrunner George W. Bush from the GOP ballot
in six districts in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Gore: I've got more gay delegates than Bradley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Al Gore, looking to bolster his standing with an
increasingly politically active constituency, is boasting of having more openly
gay potential convention delegates in New York than Bill Bradley does.
<P>
	   On Thursday, the Gore camp said that its slate of delegates for the state's
March 7 Democratic presidential primary included 11 openly gay candidates while
slates for the former senator from New Jersey had just five openly gay people.
</P>
<P>
	   But within a few hours, the Gore campaign was wiping egg off its face after
state party officials said the Bradley campaign had reported having seven openly
gay prospective delegates, not five as Gore had claimed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Al Gore campaign continues to distort the facts in an attempt to win
the Democratic primary against Senator Bill Bradley at any cost - even the cost
of the truth," the Bradley campaign said in a statement. The staff accused the
Gore campaign of "lies and distortions."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp noted that the former senator had proposed expanding the
1964 Civil Rights Act to include protections for gays and lesbians, a move Gore
has opposed.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Gore's New York campaign team, conceded the
mistake in the number of openly gay delegates Bradley had. Ragone said the error
was the result of incorrect information given the Gore campaign by the state
party.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a new statewide poll showed Gore ahead of Bradley among likely
Democratic New York primary voters. On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush had a 2-1 lead over his closest rival, Sen. John McCain, among likely GOP
primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore forces staged a news conference on the steps of City Hall in New
York City to boast about the number of openly gay delegates the vice president
was running in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Vice President Gore has shown a commitment to lesbian and gay equality that
Senator Bradley's record does not reflect," said Thomas Duane, a Manhattan
Democrat and the only openly gay member of the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp continued to maintain that Bradley's proposal to replace
Medicaid with subsidies that would allow people to buy health insurance "could
put millions of New Yorkers, especially those living with AIDS, in jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp reacted sharply, saying the Bradley health plan would
provide continued benefits for AIDS sufferers.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an outrageous and misleading attack from the Gore campaign,"
Bradley delegate contender Daniel O'Donnell, the openly gay brother of Rosie
O'Donnell, said.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakdown of delegates by ethnicity, supplied by the campaigns to the
state party, showed 25 percent of the vice president's proposed delegates were
black compared to 23 percent for Bradley. Hispanics were 11 percent of Gore's
delegate slates to 9 percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattanville College's poll found Gore leading Bradley, 48 percent to 34
percent, among likely Democratic primary voters. Among likely Republican voters,
Bush led McCain, 53 percent to 27 percent, with Steve Forbes trailing at 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A statewide poll out earlier this month from the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute had Gore at 44 percent to 39 percent for Bradley, a former star with
the New York Knicks basketball team. In that poll, Bush led McCain, 47 percent
to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Manhattanville poll, 43 percent of Democratic voters said they felt
Gore would wind up as the next president while one in three of them said Bush
would be the next to occupy the White House. Among likely Republican primary
voters, 68 percent said Bush would be the next president while just 10 percent
said Gore would win the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattanville College's telephone poll of 507 Democrats and 302 Republicans
was conducted Jan. 20-23. The margin of error for the Democratic sample is plus
or minus 4.5 percentage points and 6 percentage points for the Republican
sample.

<HEADLINE> Revenue-sharing aid: Part fact, part fiction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - For all its apparent precision spelled out across
hundreds of pages of facts, figures and legalese, a state budget is a slippery
document.
<P>
	   Appropriations are authorized but money unspent. Positions in the state
workforce are created but not filled.
</P>
<P>
	   And municipal governments around New York are due to get more than $3.03
billion in the 2000-01 budget through the state revenue-sharing aid program.
</P>
<P>
	   That is another sort of fiscal fish tale spun by Albany budgeteers, the
notion that the state will share 8 percent of its general fund revenues with
municipalities with no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue-sharing is the aid of choice among local officials because they can
use it for anything: street sweeping, street people, street festivals, it makes
no difference. Just count heads locally and line up for the checks based on how
many people live in a town, village or city.
</P>
<P>
	   But the 8 percent figure is a mirage. Gov. George Pataki actually wants
state revenue-sharing aid to be $550.5 million for the fiscal year which begins
April 1. That is about 1.4 percent of the general fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The state budget eventually enacted by the state Legislature and the
governor will contain language superseding the 8 percent-of-general-fund
stipulation with the lump sum.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature for a time actually rescinded the 8 percent rule pending
possible changes to the delivery of general aid to localities, but those changes
were not enacted and the stipulation has technically gone back into effect just
to be ignored for another year.
</P>
<P>
	   The whole exercise is a little dishonest, Rome Mayor Joseph Griffo said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Revenue-sharing is a matter of good faith," he said. "There is a formula in
place and the state has neglected it. To keep it on the books and to neglect it
is offensive to local leaders."
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the state Conference of Mayors and Municipal Officials, Edward
Farrell, said mayors see the state with billions of dollars in recent surplus
reserves and find it "appalling" that local governments have not gotten more
revenue-sharing money.
</P>
<P>
	   "The underfunding of revenue sharing - the state's original property tax
relief program - is a primary factor in New York's dubious distinction as having
the nation's highest property tax burden," he told a legislative hearing in
Albany this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of revenue-sharing aid have drawn a link between the funds and
easing the local property tax burden since the aid program first emerged in
1946. At that time it was called "per capita aid." Former Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller noted in a budget address two decades later that the feeling was
widespread in Albany when per capita aid was created that local officials needed
the flexibility offered by revenue sharing to cope with widely varying
challenges, be they the delivery of services in booming suburban areas or
stemming the deterioration of urban centers.
</P>
<P>
	   So sacrosanct was revenue-sharing that in perhaps the tightest budget of the
last half of the 20th century in New York - for fiscal 1975-76, with possible
bankruptcy hanging over both New York City and the state - former Gov. Hugh
Carey still boosted revenue-sharing aid by $87 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The high-water mark for the program came in the late 1980s when nearly $1
billion a year went to localities under revenue sharing - though by that time
the governor and Legislature were routinely ignoring the 8 percent stipulation.
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with closing a budget gap of some $7 billion, however, former Gov.
Mario Cuomo dealt a thunderbolt to local leaders by championing a
revenue-sharing reduction in fiscal 1991-92 of $410 million. Officials in that
administration were surprised to find few state legislators willing to fiercely
oppose the cut to the revenue-sharing program amid all of the other layoffs and
cost-saving moves advocated by Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki has sweetened revenue-sharing a bit, from $529 million in 1995-96,
when he ignored a promise Cuomo made to raise revenue-sharing by 10 percent, to
the proposed $550.5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   To be fair, Griffo said Pataki and the Legislature have developed other
general-purpose aid programs to municipalities, such as the Supplemental
Municipal Aid program, as well as more targeted programs for the most distressed
cities. Last year, state leaders committed to accelerating the payment of about
$150 million in revenue-sharing to cities and since Pataki became governor, his
budget aides say local governments have enjoyed some $3.3 billion in cost
containment measures.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, more than $700 million in general purpose aid will be available to
localities if Pataki's budget becomes law, Pataki aides say. That is nearly 25
percent more than when he took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, the Pataki administration argues, it and the Legislature have
embarked on the kind of meaningful reductions in local property taxes through
the "STAR" program that most local governments were not able to achieve when
they were getting twice as much revenue-sharing aid.
</P>
<P>
	   But the billions of dollars in "lost" aid during the last decade remains on
the minds of many local officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think - I know - it is just frustration from urban leaders saying the
problems are centered here and we still need to do more," Griffo said.

costs by dipping into their share of the national tobacco settlement and from
their savings under Medicaid cost-containment provisions that were being
extended as part of the health package. The counties had argued they wanted to
use the tobacco money for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said Thursday that he felt the extra costs for the state could be
financed as part of the new state budget that is for the state fiscal year that
begins April 1. The Senate leader said his proposal would be part of the budget
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, in Florida on Thursday for the start of a three-day, fund-raising
trip to benefit his campaign committee, issued a statement that seemed to kick
sand on Bruno's proposal. The governor reiterated the savings from Medicaid
cost-containment for the counties and the tobacco settlement money they would be
getting.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will work to ensure the adopted budget continues to provide record tax
relief for New Yorkers while protecting the state's fiscal integrity," Pataki's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bruno repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether he and
the governor, usually political allies, were at odds over the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're trying to get me to pick a fight with the governor," Bruno said.
"The governor and I are buddies and partners and this is the year of love, not
war."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno conceded that with all 211 legislative seats up for election this
year, a proposal like his might have extra appeal to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly in an election year, it's a hell of a lot nicer to be cutting
taxes than the alternative," the Senate leader said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Bruno plan, New York City would save $200 million over the next
three years while the state's remaining 57 counties would save $140 million. The
expanded health program expires after three years unless it is extended by the
Legislature and governor.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for Silver said Thursday that he still supported relieving
counties of the extra costs.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush ballot battles to continue in federal court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge might be Sen. John McCain's last
hope to run in the New York Republican presidential primary in most of the
state.
<P>
	   An Albany County judge on Thursday threw the Arizona senator off the March 7
ballot in eight of the state's congressional districts, saying McCain didn't get
enough GOP signatures to compete in those districts. If the decision stands,
McCain's name will not be on the Republican presidential ballot in a fourth of
the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   However, McCain's lawyers planned today to ask a federal judge in Brooklyn
to put McCain on the ballot in all 31 of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know that I'm a qualified candidate," McCain told reporters after a
town hall meeting at Nashua High School in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would take the issue to the floor of the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia this summer if the courts fail to satisfy him.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed, calling the signature requirements "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Cannizzaro late Thursday overturned the state
Board of Elections' decision to allow McCain to compete in the challenged
districts despite challenges from state Republicans, most of whom support GOP
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In the challenged districts, the Arizona senator did not have the number of
signatures on his presidential petitions to qualify for the state primary.
However, McCain supporters argued that since he was a valid national
presidential primary contender, the signature requirement should not apply to
him.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed, calling the signature requirements "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not the prerogative of any single candidate to interpose his or her
own judgment in place of that of the state Legislature in this regard," the
judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to
qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31
congressional districts. In effect, there are 31 separate GOP primaries in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters had challenged McCain in 16 of those districts. Cannizzaro's
decision leaves McCain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Buley, a state Republican Committee lawyer working in support of Bush,
cheered the decision. "We're pleased and think it was the proper decision," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign lawyer Henry Berger said they had not yet decided whether
to appeal Cannizzaro's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are disappointed," Berger said Thursday. "But I'm going to see what
happens in federal court tomorrow and then make a decision whether to appeal."
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has become even more important.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats helped McCain stay on the ballot in those eight districts. The two
Republican members of the state Board of Elections had voted on Wednesday to
uphold the challenges to McCain's petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   But the board's two Democrats abstained, thus depriving the Bush camp of the
third vote it needed to have the petitions invalidated for a lack of signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no clear indication Thursday when the ballot for New York's March
7 primary would be final. The state board had hoped to complete the ballot by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cannizzaro's decision is part of the battle over New York's March 7
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Developer Donald Trump won the right to compete for Independence Party
backing and Steve Forbes lost his spot on the Republican ballot in three Long
Island congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump, who is not an announced presidential candidate, is considering
running for the Reform Party's presidential nomination. His New York supporters,
who operate as the Independence Party, are seeking to run delegate slates for
him in the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But a coalition within the Independence Party has been trying to have
Trump's delegates thrown off the ballot. The Democracy Coalition supports
Trump's nemesis and Reform presidential candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   In retaliation for the Long Island challenge to his petitions, Forbes is
seeking a court order to remove frontrunner George W. Bush from the GOP ballot
in six districts in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Witness in 1973 murder claims police terrorized him into lying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A key witness in a 1973 murder trial says a
police detective used various terror tactics to force him to lie on the stand,
once by spinning the barrel of his gun as they sat in a jail cell.
<P>
	   Wayne Wright was one of two teen-age runaways whose testimony helped lead to
the convictions of two prostitutes for the murder of Timothy Haworth, 52, a
Philadelphia businessman who was battered and strangled in a Rochester alley on
May 25, 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   At the retrial of John Duval, whose conviction was overturned last spring
after he'd spent 25 years in prison, Wright testified Thursday that chief
detective William Mahoney beat him in custody and threatened to charge him with
murder if he didn't testify against Duval.
</P>
<P>
	   On one occasion, a day before he was to appear in court, Wright said the
detective nudged him awake in a jail cell and pulled out his revolver.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was just sitting there spinning the barrel of his revolver" and asking
if "you know what you're going to say" on the stand, Wright recounted.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got up on the stand and regurgitated what they (police) fed into me," he
added during cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval and fellow prostitute Betty Tyson got 25 years to life imprisonment.
In the absence of physical evidence, they were convicted of murder on the basis
of confessions they insist were beaten out of them by Mahoney, and on the
testimony on the two teens.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Joe Curran pointed out that Wright took an oath at trial in which
he "swore to tell the truth." During his testimony in 1973, Wright also denied
that he'd been beaten or threatened by police, Curran noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright spent seven months in jail as a material witness. After the trial, he
ran up a string of convictions for prostitution and robbery in California. He
began rebuilding his life here in the mid-1980s and retracted his testimony in
late 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The convictions were overturned a few months later when prosecutors came
upon a buried synopsis of a police interview with the other teen, Jon Jackson,
in which he denied seeing Duval or Tyson with the victim - contrary to what the
teens had testified at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahoney, investigated at least 10 times for allegedly abusing suspects,
resigned in 1980 after he was found guilty of fabricating evidence in an
unrelated case. He died of heart failure in 1981 at age 55.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors decided not to retry Tyson - the city gave her $1.2 million in
compensation - but went after Duval again. While Tyson had steadfastly
maintained her innocence, Duval had twice admitted his guilt before a parole
board. He says he lied because he didn't think he would be freed until he
admitted guilt.

<HEADLINE> Gore: I've got more gay delegates than Bradley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Al Gore, looking to bolster his standing with an
increasingly politically active constituency, is boasting of having more openly
gay potential convention delegates in New York than Bill Bradley does.
<P>
	   On Thursday, the Gore camp said that its slate of delegates for the state's
March 7 Democratic presidential primary included 11 openly gay candidates while
slates for the former senator from New Jersey had just five openly gay people.
</P>
<P>
	   But within a few hours, the Gore campaign was wiping egg off its face after
state party officials said the Bradley campaign had reported having seven openly
gay prospective delegates, not five as Gore had claimed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Al Gore campaign continues to distort the facts in an attempt to win
the Democratic primary against Senator Bill Bradley at any cost - even the cost
of the truth," the Bradley campaign said in a statement. The staff accused the
Gore campaign of "lies and distortions."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp noted that the former senator had proposed expanding the
1964 Civil Rights Act to include protections for gays and lesbians, a move Gore
has opposed.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Gore's New York campaign team, conceded the
mistake in the number of openly gay delegates Bradley had. Ragone said the error
was the result of incorrect information given the Gore campaign by the state
party.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a new statewide poll showed Gore ahead of Bradley among likely
Democratic New York primary voters. On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush had a 2-1 lead over his closest rival, Sen. John McCain, among likely GOP
primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore forces staged a news conference on the steps of City Hall in New
York City to boast about the number of openly gay delegates the vice president
was running in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Vice President Gore has shown a commitment to lesbian and gay equality that
Senator Bradley's record does not reflect," said Thomas Duane, a Manhattan
Democrat and the only openly gay member of the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp continued to maintain that Bradley's proposal to replace
Medicaid with subsidies that would allow people to buy health insurance "could
put millions of New Yorkers, especially those living with AIDS, in jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp reacted sharply, saying the Bradley health plan would
provide continued benefits for AIDS sufferers.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an outrageous and misleading attack from the Gore campaign,"
Bradley delegate contender Daniel O'Donnell, the openly gay brother of Rosie
O'Donnell, said.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakdown of delegates by ethnicity, supplied by the campaigns to the
state party, showed 25 percent of the vice president's proposed delegates were
black compared to 23 percent for Bradley. Hispanics were 11 percent of Gore's
delegate slates to 9 percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattanville College's poll found Gore leading Bradley, 48 percent to 34
percent, among likely Democratic primary voters. Among likely Republican voters,
Bush led McCain, 53 percent to 27 percent, with Steve Forbes trailing at 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A statewide poll out earlier this month from the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute had Gore at 44 percent to 39 percent for Bradley, a former star with
the New York Knicks basketball team. In that poll, Bush led McCain, 47 percent
to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Manhattanville poll, 43 percent of Democratic voters said they felt
Gore would wind up as the next president while one in three of them said Bush
would be the next to occupy the White House. Among likely Republican primary
voters, 68 percent said Bush would be the next president while just 10 percent
said Gore would win the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattanville College's telephone poll of 507 Democrats and 302 Republicans
was conducted Jan. 20-23. The margin of error for the Democratic sample is plus
or minus 4.5 percentage points and 6 percentage points for the Republican
sample.

<HEADLINE> Revenue-sharing aid: Part fact, part fiction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - For all its apparent precision spelled out across
hundreds of pages of facts, figures and legalese, a state budget is a slippery
document.
<P>
	   Appropriations are authorized but money unspent. Positions in the state
workforce are created but not filled.
</P>
<P>
	   And municipal governments around New York are due to get more than $3.03
billion in the 2000-01 budget through the state revenue-sharing aid program.
</P>
<P>
	   That is another sort of fiscal fish tale spun by Albany budgeteers, the
notion that the state will share 8 percent of its general fund revenues with
municipalities with no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue-sharing is the aid of choice among local officials because they can
use it for anything: street sweeping, street people, street festivals, it makes
no difference. Just count heads locally and line up for the checks based on how
many people live in a town, village or city.
</P>
<P>
	   But the 8 percent figure is a mirage. Gov. George Pataki actually wants
state revenue-sharing aid to be $550.5 million for the fiscal year which begins
April 1. That is about 1.4 percent of the general fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The state budget eventually enacted by the state Legislature and the
governor will contain language superseding the 8 percent-of-general-fund
stipulation with the lump sum.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature for a time actually rescinded the 8 percent rule pending
possible changes to the delivery of general aid to localities, but those changes
were not enacted and the stipulation has technically gone back into effect just
to be ignored for another year.
</P>
<P>
	   The whole exercise is a little dishonest, Rome Mayor Joseph Griffo said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Revenue-sharing is a matter of good faith," he said. "There is a formula in
place and the state has neglected it. To keep it on the books and to neglect it
is offensive to local leaders."
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the state Conference of Mayors and Municipal Officials, Edward
Farrell, said mayors see the state with billions of dollars in recent surplus
reserves and find it "appalling" that local governments have not gotten more
revenue-sharing money.
</P>
<P>
	   "The underfunding of revenue sharing - the state's original property tax
relief program - is a primary factor in New York's dubious distinction as having
the nation's highest property tax burden," he told a legislative hearing in
Albany this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of revenue-sharing aid have drawn a link between the funds and
easing the local property tax burden since the aid program first emerged in
1946. At that time it was called "per capita aid." Former Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller noted in a budget address two decades later that the feeling was
widespread in Albany when per capita aid was created that local officials needed
the flexibility offered by revenue sharing to cope with widely varying
challenges, be they the delivery of services in booming suburban areas or
stemming the deterioration of urban centers.
</P>
<P>
	   So sacrosanct was revenue-sharing that in perhaps the tightest budget of the
last half of the 20th century in New York - for fiscal 1975-76, with possible
bankruptcy hanging over both New York City and the state - former Gov. Hugh
Carey still boosted revenue-sharing aid by $87 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The high-water mark for the program came in the late 1980s when nearly $1
billion a year went to localities under revenue sharing - though by that time
the governor and Legislature were routinely ignoring the 8 percent stipulation.
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with closing a budget gap of some $7 billion, however, former Gov.
Mario Cuomo dealt a thunderbolt to local leaders by championing a
revenue-sharing reduction in fiscal 1991-92 of $410 million. Officials in that
administration were surprised to find few state legislators willing to fiercely
oppose the cut to the revenue-sharing program amid all of the other layoffs and
cost-saving moves advocated by Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki has sweetened revenue-sharing a bit, from $529 million in 1995-96,
when he ignored a promise Cuomo made to raise revenue-sharing by 10 percent, to
the proposed $550.5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   To be fair, Griffo said Pataki and the Legislature have developed other
general-purpose aid programs to municipalities, such as the Supplemental
Municipal Aid program, as well as more targeted programs for the most distressed
cities. Last year, state leaders committed to accelerating the payment of about
$150 million in revenue-sharing to cities and since Pataki became governor, his
budget aides say local governments have enjoyed some $3.3 billion in cost
containment measures.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, more than $700 million in general purpose aid will be available to
localities if Pataki's budget becomes law, Pataki aides say. That is nearly 25
percent more than when he took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, the Pataki administration argues, it and the Legislature have
embarked on the kind of meaningful reductions in local property taxes through
the "STAR" program that most local governments were not able to achieve when
they were getting twice as much revenue-sharing aid.
</P>
<P>
	   But the billions of dollars in "lost" aid during the last decade remains on
the minds of many local officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think - I know - it is just frustration from urban leaders saying the
problems are centered here and we still need to do more," Griffo said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doug Sosnik, one of President Clinton's top advisers,
plans to leave the White House for a high-ranking job with the National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
	   A veteran political operative, Sosnik was senior adviser to the president,
filling the job once held by George Stephanopoulos and later Rahm Emanuel.
Unlike his predecessors, Sosnik was a frequent traveling companion with the
president and a card-playing competitor in hearts games.

<P>
	   He will be a senior vice president for the NBA for communications and
strategy. Sosnik is the first member of Clinton's inner circle to leave this
year, the final year of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president did not have a closer or more trusted adviser,'' Jake
Siewert, White House deputy press secretary, said Thursday. ``Doug will be
sorely missed.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> State attorney continues grilling witness in land claim damages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -A state attorney continued to raise questions about
the accuracy of a federal appraiser's $335 million valuation in the Cayuga
Indian Nation land claim during a second-day of cross-examination.
<P>
	   At one point, Assistant Attorney General David Roberts tried to suggest that
federal appraiser Arvel Hale had breached accepted professional standards by
allowing the federal government's attorneys to dictate how the appraisal would
be conducted.
</P>
<P>
	   "Isn't it misleading to give an opinion because a lawyer told you?" Roberts
said as the damages trial concluded its fourth day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   During his four days on the witness stand, Hale has testified that the
64,015 acres New York illegally acquired from the Cayugas two centuries ago has
a present-day market value of $264.7 million. Additionally, the Cayugas should
receive $70.4 million for the use and occupancy of that land over 204 years,
Hale has said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts has tried to show the nine-member jury that the appraisal was
grossly inflated.
</P>
<P>
	   Focusing on the data Hale collected from the late 1700s and early 1800s,
Roberts questioned the sample sizes Hale used to derive the land's current
fair-market value and his use of property outside the claim area, which is
located around the northern shore of Cayuga Lake in Seneca and Cayuga counties.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale told jurors that more than 60 percent of the property he analyzed was
inside the claim area, although he admitted that some lots he looked at were as
far as 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts also said that Hale's approach did not account for improvements made
to the land to make it more cultivable, or buildings or structures that would
have increased property values.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the first hundred years, I did not consider those things," Hale said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn previously ruled that appraisers were not to
consider any private improvements, buildings or structures when determining the
land's value, although they could consider roads, utilities and other public
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't know one way or the other if any of these properties had
buildings?" Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale admitted he did not, but added that his analysis used only parcels of
20 acres or more because any structures would have minimal impact on the value
of a larger lot.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts also tried to show that Hale's appraisal was bloated because he
added value for infrastructure without deducting acreage for the space the
infrastructure took up.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Roberts turned his questioning to electronic and written
correspondences between Hale and federal attorneys. In those documents, Hale
used the word "summation" and referred to appraising tracts and parcels of land.
McCurn also directed that the claim area be appraised as one single tract.
</P>
<P>
	   "So what you are doing in your analysis is not appraising a single tract but
a summation of existing parcels, correct?" Roberts asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "No," Hale said, repeating that he had appraised the claim area as one
single tract even though the land is divided into nearly 5,700 separate parcels.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts said he expected to finish his cross-examination of Hale Friday.
Once Roberts is finished, Hale will be questioned again by federal lawyers and
will then likely face another round of queries from Roberts.
</P>
<P>
	   After Hale is finished, the state will begin presenting its witnesses,
including its own appraiser who has said the Cayugas should receive no more than
$46 million as compensation.

    PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan and Portland Trail
Blazers forward Rasheed Wallace were ejected late in the fourth quarter of
Thursday night's game during a heated argument between the teams.
</P>
<P>
	   After Brian Grant's layup gave the Blazers an 85-73 lead with 2:28 to go,
Wallace and Utah's Armen Gilliam exchanged words and were hit with technical
fouls.

	   Wallace, who had received a technical earlier in the game for arguing from
the bench, was ejected.
</P>
<P>
	   Sloan, who also had gotten whistled for a technical earlier, argued
strenuously with referee Leroy Richardson. After Richardson tossed him, Sloan
spat profanities at Richardson and had to be restrained by assistant coaches.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace's technical was his 18th of the season, which leads the league, and
his third ejection in the past six games.

<HEADLINE> Hillary As Candidate At Address  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
	   Last January, the Monica Lewinsky scandal still swirled as Hillary Rodham
Clinton watched her husband's State of the Union speech. Seated next to her was
slugger Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, for whom the first lady rooted while
growing up in suburban Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, she is an ardent New York Yankee fan and owner of a $1.7 million
home north of New York City that will serve as a base for her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is raising millions of dollars to take on New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani in what is shaping up as one of the nation's top political
contests this year.
</P>
<P>
	   As her husband delivers his last State of the Union, Mrs. Clinton's
political career is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   She has moved out of the White House and into the home in Chappaqua, N.Y. In
a sign of just how much things have changed, she commuted to Washington for her
husband's address from fund-raisers for her own campaign in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton paid tribute to his wife in his speech, praising her work
to streamline adoption and foster care programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, I am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts
from the beginning, and who has worked so tirelessly for children and families
for 30 years now: my wife, Hillary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton smiled at her husband and mouthed `thank you' as she stood to
acknowledge applause from her front-row seat in the visitors gallery. The
president applauded with the crowd for his wife, who sat between daughter
Chelsea and home run king Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
	   He also called on the entertainment industry ``to accept the first lady's
challenge'' and to develop a single, voluntary rating system for all children's
entertainment that would be less confusing to parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is drawing heavily from Hollywood and the entertainment
industry in her fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   The president focused his speech on broad issues such as ambitious plans to
spend more to improve health care and education -- some of the same issues Mrs.
Clinton will make key in her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the specific initiatives the president mentioned -- making college
tuition tax deductible -- first was advanced by Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer
of New York in his successful bid to oust GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, too, is expected to campaign on that issue as she tries to
appeal to some of the same middle-class suburban voters who helped Schumer get
elected.
</P>
<P>
	   If she is successful in her bid for office the first lady will trade in her
coveted seat in the gallery for a spot on the crowded House floor she now
overlooks. There she will be elbow-to-elbow with some of the same lawmakers who
voted to impeach her husband.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Mark Madsen had 18 points and Casey Jacobsen added
17, including four 3-pointers, as No. 2 Stanford beat Washington 92-62 Thursday
night, the Huskies' sixth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Collins also had 17 points for the Cardinal (16-1, 5-1 Pac-10), who
had a 28-point lead in the first half and led by 45 in the second half. Stanford
shot 53 percent for the game, including 60 percent (9-for-15) from 3-point
range.
</P>
<P>
	   Madsen, who also had nine rebounds, moved within four points of becoming the
27th Stanford player with 1,000 career points.
</P>
<P>
	   Reserve Will Perkins had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Huskies (6-13,
1-6), whose losing streak is their longest since a nine-game skid in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Deon Luton was held to 13 points, two below his season average, but still
moved up four spots on the Washington career scoring list. He is tied for 12th
with 1,326 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Washington starters, Thalo Green and David Dixon, went scoreless.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskies were missing forward Chris Walcott, who had arthroscopic knee
surgery earlier Thursday and will be sidelined for up to three weeks. Walcott
has been Washington's top percentage shooter and 3-point shooter this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was decided early in the first half. After falling behind 6-2 in
the opening two minutes, Stanford went on a 23-2 run -- holding the Huskies
scoreless for 4:33 at one point during that span -- to take control.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal built their lead to 50-22 late in the first half, and led by 26
points at halftime. Consecutive 3-pointers by David Moseley and Jacobsen made it
63-31 with 16:41 remaining, and Stanford doubled the Huskies' score at 78-39.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford took its biggest lead, 89-44, with 6:10 remaining on a bank shot by
Curtis Borchardt.

    HOUSTON (AP) -- The Golden State Warriors scored the final nine points of
the game and overcame a triple-double by Rockets rookie Steve Francis to defeat
Houston 115-110 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the third win in five games for the Warriors (9-32), who began the
night with the NBA's worst record.
</P>
<P>
	   Mookie Blaylock hit a 3-point shot with 38 seconds left and Vonteego
Cummings hit four free throws in the final 18 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis had 25 points and career-highs in rebounds (17) and assists (14). He
tied the club record for assists by a rookie.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rockets, who led by four, 110-106, with 1:15 to play, have lost two in a
row after winning six straight.
</P>
<P>
	   Blaylock's 3-pointer from the right side make it 111-110. He finished with
18 points. Cummings tied his season-high with 23 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Antawn Jamison continued his hot streak by scoring 25 and grabbing 10
rebounds. Jamison was averaging 27.3 points and 13.8 rebounds over the previous
four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis helped the Rockets pull away from a one-point lead at the end of the
third quarter by scoring nine of his points in the fourth quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Greg Anthony hit two big 3-pointers in the fourth
quarter and the Portland Trail Blazers pulled away from the Utah Jazz to win
85-75 Thursday night in a physical, intense game.
</P>
<P>
	   Jermaine O'Neal, getting his most significant playing time of the season,
added 14 points and Damon Stoudamire had 13 for the Blazers, who won their
fourth straight.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah's Karl Malone had a season-low 12 points, leaving him 12 short of
joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA
history to score 30,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah, coming off an embarrassing home loss to Vancouver on Wednesday night,
shot a season-low 32 percent. Bryon Russell had one of the worst nights of his
career, going just 1-for-16 and finishing with four points.
</P>
<P>
	   A layup by Malone pulled the Jazz to 69-65 with 9:23 to go, but Bonzi Wells
hit a short jumper and Anthony nailed a 3-pointer to make it 74-65. Anthony's
next 3-pointer rattled in after several bounces and sealed the game at 79-67
with 6:26 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah coach Jerry Sloan was ejected with 2:26 left for arguing with the
officials, shortly after Portland's Rasheed Wallace and Utah's Armen Gilliam
were assessed technical fouls for shoving.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace, who received a technical earlier in the game, also was ejected.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland's Brian Grant added 12 rebounds and epitomized the emotion for the
Blazers. Portland stepped it up after trailing 22-17 at the end of the first
quarter and didn't let up, frustrating Malone and the rest of the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before the ejections, Grant wrestled a rebound away from Malone, laid
the ball in and scowled furiously at Malone's back. The players had tussled
during the playoffs last season, when Malone opened up a gash over Grant's eye
in Game 5 of their semifinals series. The Blazers went on to win in six games.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony's 3-pointer put the Blazers ahead 36-34, but Utah scored the last
four points of the half to tie it at 42. Wallace was hit with a technical, from
the bench. After a free throw, Stockton hit a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left in
the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace has a league-high 18 technicals this season and has been thrown out
of three of the Blazers' last seven games.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony has made six of his last seven from 3-point range.

<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Michael Dickerson hit a fallaway jumper
at the buzzer and the Vancouver Grizzlies snapped a seven-game home losing
streak by beating the New Jersey Nets 108-106 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   With three seconds remaining, Dennis Scott inbounded the ball to Dickerson,
who dribbled right from the top of the key and put up a 10-footer over New
Jersey's Johnny Newman, the ball going through the hoop just as the buzzer
sounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson, who finished with 29 points, spoiled Stephon Marbury's remarkable
effort.
</P>
<P>
	   Scoring 23 of his career-high 42 points in the fourth quarter, Marbury tied
the game at 106-106 when he banked in a 3-point shot with three seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second loss at the buzzer in as many nights for the Nets. Chuck
Person of Seattle beat them with a 3-pointer on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   With the win, the Grizzlies improved to 8-12 since Lionel Hollins took over
as coach following Brian Hill's dismissal last month.
</P>
<P>
	   At 12-30, the Grizzlies are five wins ahead of last year's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nets have now lost three straight and are 2-6 in their last eight
outings.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 23 points while center Bryant Reeves scored eight
of his 18 points in the fourth quarter as all five Grizzlies starters hit
double-digits for only the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
	   After going 0-6 all-time against the Nets, the Grizzlies beat New Jersey for
the second time this month to sweep the season series.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Van Horn scored 19 for the Nets, who trailed by 14 points in the first
half and 98-90 after Reeves sank two free throws with 1:40 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies blew a chance to seal the win earlier by missing four of 10
free throws in the final 45 seconds, including one by Dennis Scott with 13.3
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Coming off Wednesday's heady 116-99 win at Utah, the Grizzlies played with
poise and confidence going 15-for-22 in the first quarter and shooting 58
percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind Abdur-Rahim's 14 points and Bibby's 10 assists, the Grizzlies opened
up a 58-45 lead at the half. The Nets didn't help themselves, going 5-for-18
from the field and being outscored 24-14 in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> 3d America's Cup Race Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- The third race of the America's Cup challenger
finals was postponed Friday because of light winds, continuing the weather
problems that have plagued the competition between AmericaOne and Prada of
Italy.
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-9 series, tied 1-1, is scheduled to resume Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	The race committee postponed Friday's race 1 hour and 25 minutes after its
scheduled start of 1:15 p.m., local time.
</P>
<P>
	For a race to begin, a breeze of at least five knots over a 10-minute period
must be measured, and its direction must be relatively constant. But during the
85-minute wait, the wind on the Hauraki Gulf was stronger than five knots for
just a few minutes and the direction shifted dramatically.
</P>
<P>
	The boats were already on the course when the race was postponed at 2:40 p.m.
While their boats bobbed around in the placid waters, crew members relaxed.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne skipper Paul Cayard lay down on the deck, his hands behind his head.
Other sailors chatted and laughed, waiting for the race committee's decision.
</P>
<P>
	America's Cup sailors use some sophisticated technology to gauge the speed and
pressure of the wind -- anemometers, barometers and birds.
</P>
<P>
	Until 10 minutes before the race, the yachts are allowed to receive data from
their weather boats. After that they're on their own. Instruments on the mast
feed data into a laptop computer on board.
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, though, crew members use other sources.
</P>
<P>
	``They'll watch the way birds are flying,'' Bob McDavitt of the Metropolitan
Weather Service of Auckland, said Friday. ``They'll see what helicopters are
doing in the sky because, quite often, the choppers need to face the wind to
steady themselves so that tells you what the weather is like that high in the
air.''
</P>
<P>
	Better sailing conditions were forecast for Saturday, a northerly breeze from
10 to 20 knots.
</P>
<P>
	The series had been scheduled to begin last Tuesday but was delayed for 24
hours by heavy seas, strong winds and a rainstorm that limited visibility.
</P>
<P>
	It did start Wednesday, when Prada won by 24 seconds in moderate winds that
ranged from 10 to 14 knots.
</P>
<P>
	The sailors awoke Thursday to rain and lighter winds. The rain stopped, but the
third race was delayed by 65 minutes until the breeze picked up. Prada appeared
headed for another victory, leading by 1:49 after the first of six legs.
</P>
<P>
	But AmericaOne came back to win by 1:33 in a race in which the shifting winds
caused problems for sailors and spectators.
</P>
<P>
	Because three legs of the race must be sailed as directly upwind as possible
and the other three directly downwind, the committee had to change the course as
the wind shifted after the race began.
</P>
<P>
	That meant boats in the spectator fleet which originally were outside the
course ended up in the middle of it before being ushered away by boats assigned
to that job.
</P>
<P>
	However, skippers Paul Cayard of AmericaOne and Francesco de Angelis of Prada
each steered their yachts into the spectator fleet once, a move that may have
hurt Prada because of the wash kicked up by the wayward boats .
</P>
<P>
	Barring further postponements, Races 4 and 5 will be held Sunday and Tuesday.
No racing is scheduled Monday, with the sixth race set for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	If the series goes to nine races, it would not end until next Saturday, Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-9 America's Cup finals against defending champion New Zealand are
scheduled to start Feb. 19.

Clinton Addresses Taxes, Spending
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- During his final State of the Union address, President
Clinton proposed a $350 billion tax cut, spending increases for schools and
health care and photo ID licenses for handgun purchases. The tax cut proposals
were intended primarily to promote educational opportunities and expand health
insurance and child care for lower- and middle-income Americans. Five days
before the New Hampshire primary, Clinton seized the chance to boost Al Gore in
his race for the Democratic presidential nomination. In his speech, there were
six references to the vice president. Clinton also recognized another candidate:
the first lady, running for the U.S. Senate seat in New York.

delivery of two rebuilt F-4 warplanes, part of an ambitious multi-billion dollar
modernization program that foresees the country as a major regional power. The

instability in the nearby Balkans and Caucasus, saying that "such
uncertainties... require the Turkish armed forces to be more powerful." The
fighters were upgraded in Israel and also highlight the growing military

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- More black and Hispanic students have applied to
attend the University of California, Berkeley, next fall, despite officials'
fears that the end of affirmative action would put off minorities. The most
significant increase came in Hispanic applications for the fall freshman class:
3,382 Hispanic students applied for the fall semester, up 20 percent from 2,818
last year. Applications from black students increased 9.7 percent, from 1,135
last year to 1,245. UC regents voted to stop considering race in admissions in
1995, and the change took effect for freshmen in 1998. That year, black and
Hispanic admissions tumbled at Berkeley.

Barak's Party Faces Criminal Probe
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A criminal inquiry launched Thursday into Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's campaign finances threatened to erupt into a scandal that could
hinder his efforts to secure a comprehensive peace by year's end. The
investigations stems from a report from Israel's comptroller detailing financial
transfers from overseas sources -- banned under Israeli law -- into nonprofit
groups set up to back Barak's election bid last May. The comptroller, Eliezer
Goldberg, fined Barak's party $3.2 million -- almost three times the $1.2
million he says they raised illegally. Barak denied any wrongdoing and said he
would appeal the fine.

CDC: Fewer Teen Smokers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Smoking among high school students dropped in 1999 for the
first time since the government began keeping track at the start of the decade.
But nearly one in 10 children have already smoked cigarettes by middle school. A
nationwide survey of 7,529 high schoolers in September and October found that
28.4 percent reported using tobacco products in the preceding month, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday. In 1997, the last time the
CDC looked at high school smoking, 36.4 percent of students said they had smoked
in the preceding month.

	   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp., a maker of missiles and stealth

aeronautics and space divisions. But analysts said the company will need to do
far more, and its stock fell more than 3 percent. The plans for a 2 percent
reduction in a work force of 140,000 were announced Thursday and follow a series
of disappointments in those sectors. The Bethesda, Md.-based company, which is
the second-largest defense business after Boeing Co., said the cuts would save
$200 million a year.

<HEADLINE> Dog track owner loses license; Track to stay open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - State gambling regulators have settled
long-standing disputes with the owner of a Bridgeport greyhound track, in an
agreement that keeps the track open but removes the owner's gaming license.
<P>
	   The Gaming Policy Board reached the negotiated agreement Thursday with
Robert Zeff. It allows him to transfer ownership of the Shoreline Star Greyhound
Park to wife, Susan Zeff, who can run the track under her license.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeff can reapply for a license in two years and will be required to undergo
a background check as far back as the summer of 1999, the agreement states. Over
the next two years, Zeff will be barred from the track property.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeff was accused of taking a former gambling regulator on a junket to Las
Vegas and of interfering with state police on a raid at his Westport home in
1996. The agreement does not require Zeff to admit any wrongdoing but requires
him to donate $75,000 to Bridgeport charities.
</P>
<P>
	   "Throughout this process, I have maintained that I engaged in no
inappropriate behavior or violation of any state gaming rules or regulations,"
Zeff said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that some of his actions may have created "a contrary perception,
and it is for this reason that I accepted the settlement that has been reached."
</P>
<P>
	   Zeff's problems with gambling regulators began when he tried to avoid a new
background check when he wanted to convert his jai alai fronton into a greyhound
track. State law requires applicants to pay for the background checks, and Zeff
said he wanted to avoid that expense.
</P>
<P>
	   Just after the Gaming Policy Board voted against requiring a new background
check, Zeff and former board chairman Francis Muska boarded a plane together for
Las Vegas - a violation of rules that bar contact between regulators and the
people they regulate.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Ethics Commission fined Muska $2,000 for accepting a limousine
ride and a hotel room from Zeff. The commission fined Zeff $15,000 for the Muska
incident and for faulty record-keeping of his lobbying activities.
</P>
<P>
	   State police arrested Zeff after he threw about 100 audio tapes over a fence
when police arrived with a warrant to search his home. The tapes had been
secretly made using a hidden tape recorder in his briefcase.
</P>
<P>
	   Charges of interfering with police and destroying evidence were dropped
after Zeff completed probation requirements.

<HEADLINE> Man convicted of lesser charge in fatal shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DANIELSON, Conn. (AP) - A 20-year-old man has been convicted of
manslaughter with a firearm in the 1998 shooting death of a teen-ager outside a
house party in Plainfield.
<P>
	   Ryan Thompson had been charged with murder, but was convicted of
manslaughter Thursday after deliberations that began two weeks ago but had been
interrupted three times by weather and illness.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury found Thompson acted with extreme indifference, but did not find an
intent to kill, which is required for a murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson could have been sentenced to up to 60 years in prison if convicted
of murder in the April 18, 1998 death of Rob McCaffery. He rejected a plea
bargain that would have allowed him to plead guilty to manslaughter in return
for a 17-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   He now faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced March 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Thompson was not invited to the party and became involved in
a fight with several guests before the shooting occurred. McCaffery, 17, was
shot while sitting on the roof of a garage watching the altercation, authorities
say.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-week trial was marked by questions over the tactics of state police
detectives who interviewed Thompson and key witnesses, several of whom said they
were prevented from recanting statements implicating Thompson.
</P>
<P>
	   State police admitted that, even after Thompson's trial had started, they
were investigating whether another person fired the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Mark Solak defended the state police, saying the verdict
validates their investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state police, as always, conducted a superb investigation which
resulted in justice being done," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the verdict was read, Thompson, 20, stood straight-backed; his parents,
Scott and Jane Thompson, fought back tears as they huddled on a bench behind
him. The two have stood behind their son, vocally maintaining his innocence and
writing letters to high-ranking officials - even to the governor - citing what
they see as the biased nature of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Thompson said later that he planned to visit his son Thursday night in
Corrigan Correctional Institution.
</P>
<P>
	   "What do you say to an innocent person who's just been voted guilty by a
jury?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies 108, Nets 106  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Michael Dickerson hit a fallaway jumper
at the buzzer and the Vancouver Grizzlies snapped a seven-game home losing
streak by beating the New Jersey Nets 108-106 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   With three seconds remaining, Dennis Scott inbounded the ball to Dickerson,
who dribbled right from the top of the key and put up a 10-footer over New
Jersey's Lucious Harris, the ball going through the hoop just as the buzzer
sounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson, who finished with 29 points, spoiled Stephon Marbury's remarkable
effort.
</P>
<P>
	   Scoring 23 of his career-high 42 points in the fourth quarter, Marbury tied
the game at 106-106 when he banked in a 3-point shot with three seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second loss at the buzzer in as many nights for the Nets. Chuck
Person of Seattle beat them with a 3-pointer on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   With the win, the Grizzlies improved to 8-12 since Lionel Hollins took over
as coach following Brian Hill's dismissal last month.
</P>
<P>
	   At 12-30, the Grizzlies are five wins ahead of last year's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nets have now lost three straight and are 2-6 in their last eight
outings.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 23 points while center Bryant Reeves scored eight
of his 18 points in the fourth quarter as all five Grizzlies starters hit
double-digits for only the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
	   After going 0-6 all-time against the Nets, the Grizzlies beat New Jersey for
the second time this month to sweep the season series.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Van Horn scored 19 for the Nets, who trailed by 14 points in the first
half and 98-90 after Reeves sank two free throws with 1:40 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies blew a chance to seal the win earlier by missing four of 10
free throws in the final 45 seconds, including one by Dennis Scott with 13.3
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Coming off Wednesday's heady 116-99 win at Utah, the Grizzlies played with
poise and confidence going 15-for-22 in the first quarter and shooting 58
percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind Abdur-Rahim's 14 points and Bibby's 10 assists, the Grizzlies opened
up a 58-45 lead at the half. The Nets didn't help themselves, going 5-for-18
from the field and being outscored 24-14 in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Report: Teen Smoking Down  </HEADLINE>
   By RUSS BYNUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- With a cautious tone, the government announced that smoking
among high schoolers has dropped for the first time since it began tracking the
age group in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   A nationwide survey of 7,529 high schoolers in September and October found
that 28.4 percent said they had smoked in the last month, 8 percent fewer than
the last survey in 1997, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the report also showed that nearly one in 10 children have smoked
cigarettes by the time they reach middle school.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine percent of students in grades six through eight said they had smoked
cigarettes and nearly 13 percent -- one in every eight students -- said they had
used some sort of tobacco product, including chewing tobacco, pipes and cigars.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey was the first in which the CDC surveyed an equal number of middle
school students and high schoolers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it was that surprising, because we see such high rates in
high school that we know it begins in middle school. We just didn't know at what
level,'' said Michael Eriksen, director of the CDC's Office on Smoking and
Health.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, the last time the CDC looked at high school smoking, 36.4 percent
of students said they had smoked in the preceding month. At the time, teen
smoking was on the rise, from 34.8 percent in 1995 and 27.5 percent in 1991, the
first year the CDC started keeping track.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said it expected teen smoking rates to drop -- just not by so much.
The agency said differences between the 1999 survey and earlier studies may have
exaggerated the decline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We may have peaked in terms of smoking rates among high school students,''
Eriksen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop in smoking rates had been expected because tobacco companies raised
cigarette prices about 45 cents per pack last year to help pay for a $206
billion settlement with 46 states over lawsuits filed by attorneys general. The
industry previously settled for $40 billion with the other states.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the larger settlement, billboard ads for cigarettes were banned
and the tobacco industry was barred from running advertisements with cartoon
characters such as Joe Camel that anti-smoking activists say are aimed at
youngsters. In many places, cigarette billboards have been replaced by signs
with anti-smoking messages.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Todd, director of tobacco control for the American Cancer Society,
agreed that higher cigarette prices should result in fewer smokers of high
school age.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he said the CDC's numbers surprised him, ``It still says more than
one-in-four children in high school are smoking cigarettes, and that's not good
enough,'' Todd said. ``While the news is encouraging, we want it to be better.''
</P>
<P>
	   The questions used in the surveys and the one in 1997 were the same, said
Wick Warren, a CDC statistician. But response rates varied. About 90 percent of
schools responded to the 1999 tobacco survey. The earlier surveys, which also
included questions about sex, got responses from about 75 percent of schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also found that the wide gap in smoking rates between white and
black high school students does not exist among middle-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
	   The proportion of blacks smoking in high school was nearly 16 percent --
half the percentage of white smokers. But in middle school, both racial groups
were about 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Though it is too soon to tell, this could signal the end of a 25-year trend
in which blacks started smoking later than whites.
</P>
<P>
	   Two trendy types of imported cigarettes -- bidis and kreteks -- are being
smoked by about 5 percent of high schoolers and 2 percent of middle-schoolers.
That makes them almost as popular as chewing tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   Bidis are skinny, unfiltered Indian cigarettes that come in flavors such as
vanilla. Kreteks are a kind of clove cigarette.

<HEADLINE> Burger King To Run Recall Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Burger King plans to run national ads next week
publicizing a second recall of its Pokemon toy balls after a 4-month-old
Indianapolis boy suffocated in his crib on one of the toys.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami-based restaurant chain's announcement came Thursday, hours after
the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued its second nationwide alert in a
month about the dangers posed by "Poke Balls."
</P>
<P>
	   More than 25 million of the toys were handed out with Burger King children's
meals late last year. The packaging contained no warnings and described them as
"safety tested and recommended for all ages."
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary Jones was the second infant to suffocate when half of the hollow
ball, about the size of a tennis ball, covered his mouth and nose. He died
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Another plastic ball was blamed for the suffocation death of a 13-month-old
California girl in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Burger King said it will start running 15-second television advertisements
on Tuesday warning parents about the toys. The ads will run for one week on all
major networks and more than 20 cable outlets, spokeswoman Kim Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer alert says parents should "immediately take the balls away from
children under the age of 3. They should discard the ball or return both halves
of the ball and the clip to a Burger King restaurant for a free order of fries."
</P>
<P>
	   The Pokemon toys were safety tested only for choking, not for suffocation.
Burger King spokesman Charles Nicolas said it's not an industry practice to test
for suffocation.
</P>
<P>
	   When the recall was first announced Dec. 27, Burger King placed an ad in USA
Today, posted signs in its restaurants and sent out notices to 56,000
pediatricians. It had also put the recall announcement on its tray liners and
carryout bags.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Gov. Apologizes for Scandal  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER WILLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Gov. George Ryan says he has learned a lesson
watching federal prosecutors chalk up convictions in a bribes-for-licenses
scandal during his time as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryan apologized Thursday for corruption in the secretary of state's office,
which he headed before becoming governor a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers in the office have admitted taking bribes in exchange for granting
drivers licenses to unqualified people. The workers donated some of the bribe
money to Ryan's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal grand jury investigation has led to the indictments of 28 people.
Seventeen have pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm angered because this corruption case has overshadowed the good things
that we've done in the office,'' the Republican governor said at a news
conference. ``I'm angry at myself for not recognizing the problem a lot
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ryan has not been named as a target of the investigation and has repeatedly
denied having any knowledge that his employees were collecting cash in exchange
for fixing driver's license tests.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said he believes his campaigns were given around $150,000 by
bribe-takers. He said he has donated about $90,000 to charity to make up for the
tainted donations and will be giving more.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryan said he now sees that it was a mistake to let his government employees
contribute to his campaigns. Ryan stopped taking such contributions once he
became governor and said he may pursue legislation to ban the practice
throughout state government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This has been a very difficult lesson for me, but I've learned it and I've
learned it very well,'' Ryan said.

<HEADLINE> Wen Ho Lee Defense Challenges Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Attorneys for a former Los Alamos scientist accused
of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets want to overturn a law that requires them
to reveal details of their case to prosecutors before trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Wen Ho Lee filed a motion Wednesday to have parts of the
Classified Information Procedures Act voided as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   The law's interest in protecting national security ``cannot justify the
burden'' on Lee's rights, his attorneys argued. The defense team said the
prosecution is under no obligation to disclose similar details of its case.
</P>
<P>
	   Criminal defendants generally do not have to reveal details of their defense
to prosecutors before trial. But the 1980 law demands such details. It was
passed to prevent someone accused of spying from disclosing so many secrets that
prosecutors would find the case too damaging to the nation's security interests.
</P>
<P>
	   The law requires Lee's defense attorneys to list and justify any secrets
they expect to use, with the filings made in sealed documents and closed
hearings. They must tell prosecutors what questions they might ask government
witnesses and what Lee might say if he testifies. If challenged, they must
explain why the information is important to their case.
</P>
<P>
	   The law has withstood several such challenges. A spokeswoman for the U.S.
Attorney's office did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, 60, could face life in prison if he is convicted of breaching security
by moving classified material to unsecure computers and computer tapes. The
prosecution has called the data he downloaded the ``crown jewels'' of American
science.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, who has not been charged with espionage, is being held without bail.

<HEADLINE> NYPD seize first car in reckless driving campaign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Speeders beware. Police are serious about the new
reckless driving crackdown, which can result in your car being seized.
<P>
	   Just ask Peter Ruggeri. The Brooklyn man was caught driving 117 miles per
hour and was the first person to have his car seized under the new policy, First
Deputy Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruggeri, 38, was charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving and
driving while intoxicated. Ruggeri faced a double whammy - under the city's DWI
seizure policy, any person charged with DWI automatically has their car seized
if the vehicle belongs to him.
</P>
<P>
	   The reckless driving crackdown, which went into effect this month, is
similar to the DWI policy. A motorist is slapped with reckless driving, a
misdemeanor charge, when caught driving double the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, if a motorist is seen by an officer committing three hazardous driving
violations - such as following too closely, unsafe lane changing and driving in
unauthorized lanes - he or she will be charged with reckless driving and other
traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
	   As with the DWI crackdown, if the driver owns the car, it will be seized,
and a person must be acquitted of the charges to get their car back. However, if
someone other than the owner was driving the car, it will be returned to the
owner.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruggeri owns the blue 1988 Buick LeSabre he was driving, Kelleher said. The
reckless driving charge was for driving 117 mph in a 50 mph zone on the Belt
Parkway. Police also felt Ruggeri's actions were so indifferent to other
motorists, he was charged with reckless endangerment, a felony, punishable by up
to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Highway officers in a marked car spotted Ruggeri at 2:40 a.m. Thursday as he
was driving westbound on the highway. The officers gave chase and Ruggeri
stopped soon after near an area where two people were killed earlier this month
in a speeding accident, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruggeri faces arraignment in Brooklyn criminal court. He has one previous
speeding violation from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Cartier-Bresson Photos Exhibited  </HEADLINE>
    By MARILYN AUGUST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) - Henri Matisse, aging and infirm, grips a struggling dove in one
hand and sketches intensely with the other. A shriveled old woman from Cape Cod
celebrates the Fourth of July with an American flag draped around her neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Familiar and still poignant decades after they were shot by Henri
Cartier-Bresson, these images are among 90 black and white photographs on sale
in what is being billed as the first ever commercial exhibit by France's most
famous living photographer.
</P>
<P>
	   Widely credited with bringing the sensitive eye of a trained artist to
photojournalism, Cartier-Bresson, 91, was on hand -- somewhat reluctantly -- for
the VIP opening at the Claude Bernard gallery in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The show, which runs until Feb. 26, brings together Cartier-Bresson's most
famous shots taken around the globe between 1932 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Cartier-Bresson turned his back on a lucrative family textile business to
study art at the age of 20. He went on to found the legendary Magnum photo
agency in 1947 and became known for seemingly simple shots of ordinary people in
ordinary situations.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never think about photography," he told Associated Press Television News
in a rare interview.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a way of recording what I see in an instant," he said, and he summed
up his lifelong credo: "As (Gen. Charles) De Gaulle used to say: 'Aim well,
shoot fast and get the hell out."'
</P>
<P>
	   The results are "decisive moments" -- also the title of one of
Cartier-Bresson's 12 books. An elderly woman, hand outstretched, wears an
American flag almost like an apron, on July 4, 1947 on Cape Cod. An anonymous
couple sunbathe, their heads hidden behind a parasol, on a rocky Normandy beach.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's a picture?" Cartier-Bresson said, clutching his cane. "What counts
in photography is geometry, a sense for form where everything is in place. It's
not trivial."
</P>
<P>
	   The collection also features intimate portraits of some of the century's
greatest intellectuals -- Samuel Beckett, Jean-Paul Sartre, Alberto Giacometti,
Andre Breton and Albert Camus, among them.
</P>
<P>
	   "These photographs are little pieces of Cartier-Bresson's life," said
gallery owner Claude Bernard. "He was very close with these people."
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard said he and the photographer sorted through several thousand
photographs before deciding on the final selection -- and their price tags.
</P>
<P>
	   "He agreed to the sale because he wanted to share his work with the younger
generation, and for that reason, he kept prices modest," Bernard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices range from $3,000-$5,700.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the highlights is "Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare," considered by many
critics as his greatest photograph with its subtle contrast of geometrical forms
and feeling of complete spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
	   The photograph depicts a man leaping over a puddle and frozen in midair,
with his shadow forming a symmetrical V-shape, contrasting to the circular forms
in the water and the vertical fence above the railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
	   Cartier-Bresson has always shot with his trusty Leica, the quietest of
cameras, working only with black and white film, and notably, without a flash.
Thrusting a subject in the limelight, he said, was a sure way to destroy it.
</P>
<P>
	   He also opposes cropping pictures, saying it dilutes their meaning.
</P>
<P>
	   These days, Cartier-Bresson spends his days either in his studio, sketching
live models, or at his window, capturing the street scenes he once photographed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Drawing is meditation. You can take your time," he said. "You think with
your fingers. It's very dangerous to think with your brain. That's rationalism.
When it comes to drawing, sensuality is better. It's sensitivity over sense."
</P>
<P>
	   Cartier-Bresson, however, still keeps his camera handy. Two years ago, at
89, he leaped out of a boat in Venice to shoot a picture of a young woman drying
her hair with a throng of young men around her.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was like a gazelle, suddenly jumping off the boat and circling around
the young woman until he could get exactly what he saw," Bernard recalled.
"That's when I understood the magic of Bresson."

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Take Part in Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Congo's rebels were not officially invited to this
week's talks at the United Nations on ending Congo's 1 1/2-year war. But they
showed up anyway, and the visit has revived hopes for a beleaguered peace deal.
</P>
<P>
	   While African leaders such as Congolese President Laurent Kabila stole the
spotlight at the United Nations, leaders from two of the three rebel factions
spent the week quietly meeting with African, U.N. and U.S. officials in hotel
suites around town trying to revive a cease-fire agreement signed last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Those talks, and public pledges by the half-dozen African leaders involved
in the continent's most intractable dispute to recommit themselves to a
cease-fire, have left the rebels with a sense of hope that the agreement signed
in Lusaka, Zambia is still viable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without New York, I think in some few months Lusaka would be dead,'' said
Bizima Karaha, intelligence chief for the main rebel faction, the Congolese
Rally for Democracy. ``New York has rescued the Lusaka peace process.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels launched an insurrection in the eastern part of the vast Central
African country in August 1998 to oust Kabila from power. They signed the
cease-fire accord with Kabila and his allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia --
in July, but fighting has continued, with both sides accusing each other of
violations.
</P>
<P>
	   In a bid to resurrect the failing peace process, U.S. Ambassador Richard
Holbrooke invited the key players to New York to recommit themselves to the
cease-fire agreement so the United Nations could move to deploy a mission of
military observers to oversee implementation of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels couldn't be invited officially to participate in the U.N. talks
because they don't represent a country. But the United States let it be known
that the rebels would be granted visas if they wanted to come.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels and presidents alike praised the impetus given to the peace process
by the New York talks -- even though there were no concrete breakthroughs
achieved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we thought was very good was that there was some unity of viewpoints
from the African leaders,'' said Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, who leads a splinter
faction of the main Congolese Rally for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They made basically the same request on the U.N. for rapid deployment, for
support, and to give some push to the implementation of the Lusaka agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Lusaka agreement calls for a cease-fire, deployment of U.N. peacekeepers
and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council vowed Wednesday to authorize deployment of the military
observers quickly and to consider sending in a full-fledged peacekeeping force
in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has recommended a core force of 500 observers be
supplemented by 3,400 security troops and other personnel for a total of 5,500
people.
</P>
<P>
	   Karaha, the rebel intelligence officer, said he was optimistic that the
Security Council would follow through and deploy and that Kabila and his allies
were being sincere when they recommitted themselves to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am optimistic, hopeful, but careful,'' Karaha said. ``Because what
happened here, these are just good declarations of good intentions. What
determines the future in that country is what happens on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila, meanwhile, managed to work in some business with all the talks on
the Lusaka accord. Chevron on Thursday announced it would invest $75 million
over three years in Congo for a drilling program.

<HEADLINE> Anti-drug colonel's wife faces 9 years in prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The colonel's wife says she's a cocaine addict. Worse,
she admits smuggling drugs into the United States by mail from her husband's
post in Colombia.
<P>
	   Laurie Anne Hiett also claims Col. James Hiett, the former commander of the
U.S. Army's anti-drug operation, was in the dark about her bungled scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never told him what I was doing," Hiett said Thursday after pleading
guilty to drug conspiracy charges in Brooklyn federal court. Free on bond, she
faces up to 9 years in prison when she is sentenced on April 28.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rambling interview with reporters, Hiett, 36, clutched a copy of the
self-help book "Emotional Blackmail," talked openly about battling a drug
addiction and lamented making headlines while the United States is waging a
costly war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are people dying every day to fight this, and then I did what I did,"
she said. "I'm not proud of it. ... I just truly apologize."
</P>
<P>
	   Hiett surrendered to federal authorities in August after they intercepted
two 1.2-kilo packages of heroin that she mailed to Queens and Manhattan from a
post office at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
	   The parcels had Hiett's return address. But she claimed she sent them for
Jorge Ayala, a civilian driver for U.S. military commanders in Colombia, and
that they contained books, candy, coffee and Colombian artifacts.
</P>
<P>
	   Hiett pleaded innocent. However, in recent months, Hiett's Miami attorney
sought a plea bargain with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   A codefendant, Hernan Arcila, 54, pleaded guilty on Jan. 5 to drug
conspiracy, admitting that he accepted shipments from Colombia at his Queens
address. Ayala, who was also named in a 13-count indictment, remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of her plea Thursday, Hiett told Magistrate Marilyn Go she shipped
six packages from Bogota to New York City, believing they contained cocaine.
Tests on the two seized shipments revealed they were heroin.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendant admitted flying to New York City two times to collect drug
proceeds in Queens. Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Dunst also said Hiett once took
another trip to Miami carrying a half kilo of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   An Army investigation cleared Col. Hiett, saying he had "no prior knowledge"
of the crimes. The colonel has since been transferred to Fort Monroe, Va. New
York authorities are still investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   Hiett told reporters she purposely tried to keep her husband in the dark.
</P>
<P>
	   "At one point, he may have asked me why I was going to New York," said
Hiett, who still lives with her husband and two young sons in Virginia. "I just
told him, 'Don't ask me."'
</P>
<P>
	   Hiett told the judge she's battled a cocaine addiction for years, but has
been clean since her arrest. She said her problem clouded her judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have everything to lose," she said. "When I look back, I don't understand
it myself. ... It never occurred to me when I was doing it that my husband was
in charge of all of that stuff. I know it sounds crazy."

<TEXT>
<P>
	   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Alex Scales scored 18 points and A.D. Smith added 15 as
Oregon beat No. 23 Southern California 68-67 Thursday night, the Trojans' first
conference loss this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon (14-3, 5-1 Pac-10) was leading 68-67 when Brian Scalabrine of
Southern California missed a jumper with 10 seconds left. The Trojans (12-6,
5-1) got another chance when Oregon's Darius Wright missed a free throw, but
they lost control of the ball trying to set up a shot and the Ducks emerged from
a scramble with possession -- and the win.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss broke a seven-game winning streak for USC, which was off to its
best conference start ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon led by four points at halftime but the lead seesawed back and forth
over the first 12 minutes of the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon took a 66-61 lead -- the biggest either team had the entire game --
with 3:53 to play as the Trojans went more than four minutes without scoring.
</P>
<P>
	   USC was able to close to 66-65 on a basket and two free throws by David
Bluthenthal, but an inside basket by Julius Hicks pushed the Ducks' lead to
three.
</P>
<P>
	   Nate Hair of the Trojans missed two free throws, and nine seconds later
Brandon Granville missed his first of two when the Trojans complained that
jumping fans in small McArthur Court were causing the baskets to shake.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon coach Ernie Kent used a microphone to ask the fans to stop jumping.
Granville was allowed to shoot again, and he made both free throws to make it
68-67.
</P>
<P>
	   Scalabrine led the Trojans with 18 points, while Bluthenthal added 17 points
and nine rebounds, and Hair had 13 points, nine on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Trojans, who shot 52 percent from the field in the first half, shot just
39.3 percent in the second half. The Ducks' shooting also suffered in the second
half -- 41.4 percent compared to 54.8 percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The score was tied seven times in the first half and neither team led by
more than four points.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith made a jumper for the Ducks with two seconds left for the 40-36 lead
into halftime.

<HEADLINE> No. 13 Tulsa 89, Texas-El Paso 71  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHELLE KOIDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Tulsa was the preseason No. 2 pick in the Western
Athletic Conference. On Thursday night, the 13th-ranked Golden Hurricane became
the first Division I team to win 20 games ths season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're on an emotional roller coaster ride right now, and we feel we can
compete with anyone in the country," said reserve David Shelton, who scored 21
points in the 89-71 victory over Texas-El Paso.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one expected us to do this," added Tony Heard, who had 16 points. "We
work very hard in practice and it's paying off during the games.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can go real far this year," he said. "The fact that people don't give us
much respect is great for us. We can sneak up on the rest of the country."
</P>
<P>
	   With Eric Coley adding 14 points and Greg Harrington scoring 12, Tulsa
(20-1, 5-0) extended its winning streak to 13 games. Shelton was 7-of-12 from
the field, 6-of-8 from the free throw line and pulled down eight rebounds as the
Golden Hurricane won by 18 points, just off their 20.5 average margin of victory
which leads the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke was last season's first 20-game winner, reaching the figure on the same
date as Tulsa with an 89-77 victory over North Carolina that gave the Blue
Devils a 20-1 record.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Self, who in his third season as Tulsa coach has compiled a 62-23
record, attributed the success to depth.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a different guy every night," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight Tulsa players played at least 17 minutes, while UTEP had six who
played at least 25 minutes. Rico Nelson of the Miners, who was averaging 5.4
points and 1.8 rebounds a game, sat out with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
	   UTEP (10-8, 1-4) got as close as 56-50 with 10:52 left in the game, but
missed 11 free throws in the second half and committed a total of 16 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarvis Mullahon had 18 points for UTEP, which shot 52.4 percent from the
field, while Brandon Wolfram added 14 and William Smith had 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Escobedo of UTEP went 1-for-6 from the line in the second half.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Economy, Drought Spur Tree Shortage  </HEADLINE>
    By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The boom economy and last year's drought have
combined to create a national shortage of ornamental trees and shrubs for home
and commercial landscaping, growers say.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I had 3,000 trees I could sell them in one day," said Dan Mooney, a
sales representative for Robert W. Baker Cos. in West Suffield, Conn. He was
among hundreds of participants at a nursery convention meeting in Columbus this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Zampini of Lake County Nursery in northeast Ohio said he had 15,000
fewer trees to sell last summer after the drought pinched their growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Zampini said he has seen a lot of frustration over growers' inability to
meet high demand after two consecutive years of drought in his part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   "It may take anywhere from five to 10 years to recover, to have enough
product out there to recover for cities, landscapers, garden centers," Zampini
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Powell Dykes is a grower from McMinnville, Tenn., which advertises itself as
the nursery capital of the world, boasting more than 400 nurseries in the town
and surrounding Warren County.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy's been so good, there's so much building going on, people are
buying everything they can get hold of," Dykes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of wholesale nursery growers from up and down the East Coast and the
Midwest showed off their greenery at the three-day Central Environmental Nursery
Trade Show in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
	   Many said they're still feeling the effects of last year's drought, and
won't know until summer -- when trees have bloomed and put out leaves -- the
full extent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The most harm was to trees' growth. Trees that didn't grow enough weren't
ready for sale, worsening the shortage.
</P>
<P>
	   But the economy is the real culprit, they say.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1990s, a glut of ornamental trees pushed prices down from about
$100 to $50 or $60 a tree, said Brian Champion, president of the Ohio Nursery
and Landscapers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Growers, tired of giving the trees away or burning them, cut back
production. Now, they can't provide enough, said Champion, 35, of Herman Losely
&AMP; Sons Inc. in Perry, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Trees in especially high demand include shade trees such as maple, oak and
ash and several ornamental trees and shrubs including Vibernums -- a fragrant
flowering shrub -- crabapples, and flowering trees such as service berry and
magnolia.
</P>
<P>
	   Joel Albizo, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based American Nursery &AMP;
Landscape Association, said the shortage has branched out to retailers as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's wonderful that people are coming into the garden center and buying,
that they have money to spend," he said. "But it's not so wonderful if you don't
have plants in the store."
</P>
<P>
	   Gretchen Mallory, a retail landscaper in Columbus, said dealing with the
shortage means careful planning.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to be more aware of what you can offer someone as a customer, and
what the cost is -- you might be eating it because of the expense," Mallory
said. "Making the customer aware is half the battle. Be up front, 'There is a
shortage, I think this would be the best for you, but I'm going to have to find
it."'
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Mallory has more to worry about than just the tree shortage.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's drought has also caused a shortage of sod, she said.

<HEADLINE> GOP: Clinton Tax Cut Just a Start  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans in Congress cheered President Clinton's
proposal to cut taxes by $350 billion over the next decade, but they said that
should represent only the starting point given the enormous projected budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we can do more,'' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman William
Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton outlined a series of targeted tax proposals Thursday night in his
final State of the Union address to Congress, but he cautioned that tax relief
should occur ``without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline'' that led to the
budget surplus. The president also said lawmakers must not forget that Social
Security and Medicare face insolvency as baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Indeed, we must make these investments and tax cuts in the context of a
balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and
Medicare and pays down the national debt,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., agreed with each of those points but
added another: ``We will not use the current surplus as an excuse to go on a
government spending spree.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tax cuts and how to use the huge projected budget surpluses are a hot
political issue this year, particularly for the Republicans. Clinton's plan
gives Vice President Al Gore a tax cut to promote if he wins the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP presidential frontrunner, is pushing a
five-year, $483 billion tax cut, while Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., proposes
cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   One GOP priority embraced by Clinton would partly fix a tax code glitch in
which millions of two-income married couples pay more income taxes than if they
were single. Clinton wants to gradually double the standard income tax deduction
for married people, cutting taxes for more than 9 million couples at a cost of
$45 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans intend to move legislation dealing with the marriage penalty to
the House floor by mid-February, although it is likely to be broader in scope
and also help married people who itemize their tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of Clinton's fiscal 2001 tax relief plan has been released over the
past weeks, including an expansion of the earned income tax credit for the
working poor, adjusting the minimum tax so it affects fewer middle-class people,
and credits or deductions for long-term health care, college expenses and people
who need health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   New items unveiled Thursday include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Retirement Savings Accounts for low-income families in which the
government would provide a 2-for-1 match for the first $100 contributed by each
person. Cost:$54 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --A package of tax breaks and incentives to encourage philanthropy,
including allowing non-itemizers to take a tax deduction for charitable giving.
Another measure would be designed to make it easier to donate appreciated assets
like stocks and real property. Cost:$14 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --Increasing the dependent child care credit and extending it to parents who
stay home with their children. Cost:$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --A tax credit for pharmaceutical companies that develop new vaccines
against malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS. Cost:$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said the president will use some of the projected surplus to pay for
the tax cuts but is also likely to advocate closing corporate tax loopholes and
shelters -- and possibly other tax increases -- to foot roughly $100 billion of
the cost. Similar proposals in the past have received a cool reception in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans said they also intend to push for abolition of inheritance
taxes, economic development credits in poor areas and savings accounts for
college tuition, among others. They added that their tax cuts would be much
larger than the president's.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, pointed
out that Clinton's proposals to ease the marriage penalty and to protect the
middle class from the alternative minimum tax were similar to items in the $792
billion GOP tax cut vetoed by the president last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Congress fixed these problems last year and we will do so again this year,
and we hope the president won't veto tax relief again,'' said Archer, R-Texas.

<HEADLINE> GOP Responds To Clinton's Speech  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In their official reply to President Clinton's State of
the Union address, Republicans joined the president in seeking improvements in
health care and education while denying the need for further growth in
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The debate in Washington is not about money. It is about who makes the
decisions. We need a change of approach,'' Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said
Thursday night in arguing the GOP approach to education reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins and fellow first-term Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, both known for
working well with Democrats, generally took the high road in their 17-minute
response to the president, concentrating on the pluses of their proposals rather
than the perceived minuses of the president's approach.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Republicans were more direct in swiping at Clinton's big-dollar
solutions. ``As Washington digs out of the latest winter blizzard, the Congress
will dig out of an avalanche of presidential spending initiatives,'' said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Five years ago we put the nation on a fiscal diet and he tried to put all
its weight back on in one night,'' said Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins enumerated several top GOP priorities -- protecting Social Security,
eliminating the $3.6 trillion public debt in 15 years, significant tax relief
and a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
	   But the former college administrator focused on differences in education
policy. Republicans too will spend more on elementary and secondary education,
she said, but want control of that money shifted to the local communities. She
said Republicans will also increase federal grants to local communities for use
in recruiting and training good teachers, and would increase the amount families
can contribute to education savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Frist, a heart-lung transplant surgeon, said Clinton's proposal to extend
health insurance to more Americans ``makes government even bigger and more
bloated because each new program we heard about tonight -- and there were about
11 of them in health care alone -- comes with its own massive bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that Clinton was again leading the nation toward the national
health care plan that Congress rejected in 1993. He recalled working as a
surgical fellow in England and said he ``learned that socialized medicine --
whether in England or in Canada, where patients are fleeing to the United States
for treatment -- just do not work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, Frist said, would work to overhaul Medicare, pass a patients'
rights bill that makes lawsuits against HMOs a last resort and ensure that
Americans have choice and security in their health care alternatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert earlier Thursday also spoke of a Republican plan to improve
prescription drug coverage for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Clinton, who has proposed creating a new Medicare prescription drug
plan open to all, Hastert said the GOP would focus on helping the one-third of
senior citizens who now lack access to or cannot afford private options. Tax
credits and block grants to states were among the options, he said.

<HEADLINE> Big-Name Authors Releasing Books  </HEADLINE>
    By HILLEL ITALIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hollywood won't be the only industry with star power over
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
	   An unusually high number of big-name literary authors have new novels coming
out, including Nobel laureate Saul Bellow and Pulitzer Prize winners Philip
Roth, John Updike, Jane Smiley and Carol Shields. Books also are expected from
E.L. Doctorow, Susan Sontag, Michael Ondaatje, Joyce Carol Oates and Mary
McGarry Morris.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a dearth of literary-commercial novels last fall," said Laurie
Brown, vice president of marketing for Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, which is
releasing the Sontag novel. "This year, there are a lot of candidates for
front-page book reviews."
</P>
<P>
	   Bellow's novel, "Ravelstein," is his first full-length work of fiction in
more than a decade. It's based on his friendship with the late Allan Bloom, a
fellow professor at the University of Chicago and author of a widely read attack
on modern culture, "The Closing of the American Mind."
</P>
<P>
	   The 84-year-old Bellow, winner of the Nobel Prize in 1976, also recently
became a father for the fourth time. His fifth wife, Janis Freedman, gave birth
to Naomi Rose in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth's new novel, "The Human Stain," has a scenario Bloom might well have
thought of: an aging classics professor is forced to resign after being accused
of racism. Updike's "Gertrude and Claudius" imagines what happened before Act I
of "Hamlet." Sontag's latest, "In America," is set in part on a farming commune
in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctorow, best known for such historical novels as "Ragtime" and "Billy
Bathgate," at least begins his new novel in contemporary times. "City of God"
opens in Manhattan in 1999, where a cross has disappeared from a downtown church
and mysteriously landed on the roof of an Upper West Side synagogue.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Hollywood studios, publishers try to time releases so high-profile
titles don't end up competing. But this year, so many prominent writers had
novels ready that putting them out at the same time proved unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
	   "When writers like those deliver a book, you publish it," Brown said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Publishers also look at commercial novels differently than they do literary
ones. Audiences for Updike or Bellow are considered smaller, but more dependable
than those for Tom Clancy or Michael Crichton.
</P>
<P>
	   When Thomas Harris came out last summer with "Hannibal," his sequel to "The
Silence of the Lambs," publishers adjusted their schedules for commercial books.
But a fan of Bellow is considered likely to buy "Ravelstein" regardless of
whether Roth has a book out.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do try to give each other a little space for the megasellers," Brown
said. "But none of us look at literary books in the same way. Those authors have
a more dedicated readership."
</P>
<P>
	   The seemingly permanent residence of the Harry Potter stories at the top of
bestseller lists has made it hard for literary writers to break in, but at least
a couple should make it this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Ondaatje's "Anil's Ghost" is his first novel since the widely acclaimed "The
English Patient" and has a first printing of 200,000. Smiley, author of such
bestsellers as "A Thousand Acres" and "Moo," has a printing of 150,000 for her
novel about horse racing, "Horse Heaven."
</P>
<P>
	   Fans of commercial novels will also have plenty to choose from, including
new books from Clancy, Faye Kellerman, Patricia Cornwell, Mary Higgins Clark,
Barbara Taylor Bradford and the late Harold Robbins.
</P>
<P>
	   And at least one other major literary "name" will appear on an upcoming
book: Mailer. But not Norman. The debut novel of his wife, Norris Church Mailer,
is due in May.

<HEADLINE> Reaction to State of Union Speech  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Some reaction to President Clinton's State of the Union address:
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president's agenda will help sustain record economic growth by paying
down the national debt by 2013. It will make prudent use of the surplus to
extend the life of Social Security and Medicare and to provide a fiscally
responsible middle-class tax cut. Unfortunately, Republicans have no plans to
use one penny of the surplus to strengthen Social Security or Medicare.'' --
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without the Republican Congress to block big government programs and
higher taxes proposed by the Clinton-Gore administration, we wouldn't have a
balanced budget much less the surplus we have now.'' -- Jim Nicholson,
Republican National Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just as we plan ahead to safeguard Medicare and Social Security, we need
to plan for our natural security -- saving land always stands the test of
time.'' -- William Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ''... Waiting for Clinton's so-called marriage tax relief would be like
waiting for food in a Russian bread line.'' -- Janet Parshall, spokeswoman for
the Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``The national debt is a serious matter. Republicans have supported paying
off the debt by 2015, the administration by 2013 with the new surplus. This is
not a game of one-upmanship. It is imperative that we take politics out of this
and do what is best for the future of this nation.'' -- Rep. Steven Kuykendall,
R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fortunately, because of our founding fathers' foresight in creating a
balance of power in our democracy, Congress will once again serve as the reality
check for the President's 'Kid in the Candy Store' spending spree.'' -- Rep.
Steve Largent, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Medicare, we are pleased that the President's proposal recognizes that
it should be modernized with a prescription drug benefit that takes advantage of
the advances in medicine. Likewise, we welcome the proposal to expand health
insurance coverage for working families. And, although the administration's
proposal for a long-term care tax credit doesn't address every need, it would
certainly help many families.'' -- Horace Deets, AARP executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the most comprehensive and significant package I've seen for
promoting charitable giving. It means more private resources will go to
improving America's schools, hospitals, libraries and the like.'' -- Dorothy
Ridings, Council on Foundations president.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Parents, teachers and school board members should be wary of the
president's proposal to help them build new schools. As usual, the Democrats'
promise of `free help' from Washington comes with plenty of strings attached.''
-- Rep. Joseph Pitts, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Clinton is partially right. Congress must pass health care
reform legislation this year. However, his proposals to dramatically expand
government-run health care are wrong-headed.'' -- Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tonight, President Bill Clinton gave the nation his wish list for this
session of Congress. There are many things we can accomplish if the president
decides to work with us. But if the president is forced by House Democrats to
cast aside bipartisan cooperation in favor of election-year politics, the result
will be gridlock and a failed agenda.'' -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``The speech tonight was a distortion of the seriousness of this country's
fiscal crisis. We need to sober up and realize that there are no surpluses and
won't be unless we get serious about controlling runaway spending and tax cuts
the country can't afford.'' -- Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president appears to be on the verge of taking our hard-fought fiscal
prosperity and throwing it away with both hands. The president is proposing to
spend budget surpluses, which may or may not materialize, faster than they can
be counted.'' -- U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clinton's health plan would cover at best 5 million of the 45 million
uninsured. That's less than the 7 million who have lost their insurance since he
took office, many because of his welfare reform.'' -- Ida Hellander, Physicians
for a National Health Program director.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. is the richest country in the history of the world in the midst
of an unprecedented economic boom -- of course, we should increase spending on
education.'' -- Bob Peterson, fifth grade teacher in Milwaukee.

<HEADLINE> Calls To End Chechnya Conflict Grow  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL AMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Russia has escaped a Council of Europe suspension
for its conduct in Chechnya, but international pressure is growing on Moscow to
settle the bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   The Council of Europe handed Russia a three-month deadline Thursday to start
cease-fire talks and ease the suffering of Chechen civilians, or face suspension
from the human rights organization. A suspension would be a blow to Moscow's
efforts to link itself more closely with Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan added his voice to calls for a speedy end
to the war during his visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While we all support efforts to rout out terrorists, we should take every
step to protect the rights of the civilians and ensure that they don't suffer
undue hardship,'' Annan said Thursday at the start of a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia contends its 5-month-old campaign against Chechnya is aimed at rebels
it considers to be terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   The International Red Cross also appealed for protection of Chechen
civilians, reminding Russians ``of their obligations under international
humanitarian law, notably to spare civilians and their property.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Cross statement from Geneva, Switzerland, estimated 20,000-40,000
civilians remain trapped in Grozny, the Chechen capital, which is under near
constant bombardment from besieging Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The city's remaining inhabitants are facing perilous conditions and have
extremely limited access to food, water, medical care, electricity or gas,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Cross also complained that it had not been granted access to
prisoners being held by Russian forces, contrary to international agreements.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union has also repeatedly condemned the Chechen war, but
stopped short of imposing trade sanctions. The 15-nation group did agree Monday
to suspend some $90 million in aid or redirect the money to humanitarian
projects.
</P>
<P>
	   The 41-nation Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights body,
decided against imposing immediate sanctions on Moscow, underscoring western
European fears of leaving Russia isolated and prone to anti-Western sentiment.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the threat of suspension from the council was taken very
seriously in Moscow and impacts on Russian aspirations for closer ties with
western institutions. Russia gained entry in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a real point of pressure,'' said Peter Bouckaert, Chechen specialist
with Human Rights Watch, a private monitoring group. ``We hope the Council of
Europe will stick to its word.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow dispatched Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to the council's meeting,
where he heard the Russian military operation firmly condemned.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech to the council, Ivanov denied Russian troops in Chechnya were
using excessive force and said they were defending Europe's common borders
against ``a barbarian invasion of international terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The assembly approved a motion demanding Russia stop ``all indiscriminate
and disproportionate'' military action, halt attacks on civilians, start
cease-fire talks, and improve access for humanitarian agencies, news media and
international observers.
</P>
<P>
	   Failure to meet the demands by assembly's next meeting in April will
``inevitably necessitate'' a review of Russia's membership in the Council of
Europe, the motion said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the tough words, the European legislators disappointed those hoping
for swifter action against Russia. An amendment calling for the expulsion of the
assembly's 36 Russian members was soundly defeated. Another proposing suspension
of the Russians' voting rights narrowly failed to pass.

Clinton Seeks Tax Cut, New Gun Controls
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed a $350 billion tax cut, big
spending increases for schools and health care and photo ID licenses for handgun
purchases Thursday night as he offered the final agenda of his presidency.
Clinton offered a litany of initiatives, many of them sure to be rewritten or
ignored by Congress. His tax cut proposals were intended primarily to promote
educational opportunities and expand health insurance and child care for lower-
and middle-income Americans. The initiatives included relief from the "marriage
penalty" -- an idea first championed by Republicans -- and a new program of
retirement savings accounts.

Congo Rebels Take Part in Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Congo's rebels were not officially invited to this
week's talks at the United Nations on ending Congo's 1 1/2-year war -- but they
showed up anyway, and the visit has revived hopes for a beleaguered peace deal.
While African leaders such as Congolese President Laurent Kabila stole the
spotlight at the United Nations, leaders from two of the three rebel factions
spent the week quietly meeting with African, U.N. and U.S. officials in hotel
suites around town trying to revive a cease-fire agreement signed last summer.
Those talks have left the rebels with a sense of hope that the agreement signed
in Lusaka, Zambia is still viable.

Thursday to charges of involvement in the alleged plot. Ressam, an Algerian, was
arrested Dec. 14 for allegedly trying to smuggle bomb-making components from
Canada into the United States. Three other Algerian nationals and a woman
married to an Algerian are in custody, and police in the United States and

fears that the end of affirmative action would put off minorities. The most
significant increase came in Hispanic applications for the fall freshman class:
3,382 Hispanic students applied for the fall semester, up 20 percent from 2,818
last year. Applications from black students increased 9.7 percent, from 1,135
last year to 1,245. UC regents voted to stop considering race in admissions in
1995, and the change took effect for freshmen in 1998. That year, black and

Barak's Party Faces Criminal Probe

<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A criminal inquiry launched Thursday into Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's campaign finances threatened to erupt into a scandal that could
hinder his efforts to secure a comprehensive peace by year's end. The
investigations stems from a report from Israel's comptroller detailing financial
transfers from overseas sources -- banned under Israeli law -- into nonprofit
groups set up to back Barak's election bid last May. The comptroller, Eliezer
Goldberg, fined Barak's party $3.2 million -- almost three times the $1.2
million he says they raised illegally. Barak denied any wrongdoing and said he

October found that 28.4 percent said they had smoked in the last month, 8
percent fewer than the last survey in 1997, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control

<HEADLINE> Clinton Emphasizes Election Issues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's final State of the Union address was
a tour de force of unfulfilled legislative dreams and projects. The chances of
his getting favorable action on much of this fountain of legislation in the
Republican-controlled Congress in a presidential election year may be slim.
</P>
<P>
	   But in emphasizing a look ahead instead of a look back, Clinton sought to
frame issues for the upcoming election -- and to give a boost to his choice of a
successor, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   This strategy, of course, was not lost on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The debate in Washington is not about money. It is about who makes the
decisions,'' Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, observed in the GOP rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans weren't overly anxious to buy in on a Clinton-Gore wish-list
agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   But many of Clinton's proposals are popular ones -- a prescription drug
benefit for the elderly, big spending increases for schools, a $10,000 tax
deduction for college tuition. And Republicans don't want to be viewed as
naysayers, either.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP leaders awkwardly paused -- if only for a moment -- before joining their
Democratic colleagues in rising to their feet to applaud Clinton when he called
for ``preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every American
-- Social Security and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP criticism of Clinton's 89-minute performance was cautious, reflecting a
desire not to get on the wrong side of an important issue in an election year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While I am in agreement with many of his goals ... generally it is
important that we restrict increases in spending,'' said Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's array of proposals -- some new, some old, many repackaged --
included an expanded $350 billion tax cut, a revised health-care plan and big
spending increases for schools. Clinton also proposed a new handgun-licensing
plan, urging states to issue photo IDs for purchasers and require gun-safety
courses.
</P>
<P>
	   He called for tax incentives for clean fuels, an increase in the Head Start
program and for paying off much of the $3.6 trillion national debt in 13 years.
He renewed a call for an overhaul of campaign finance laws, a patient's bill of
rights and an increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
	   By the count of House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio,
Clinton's program entails 132 ``new or increased government spending initiatives
and tax preferences.'' Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., suggested
Clinton ``will be spending money faster than the government can print it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fortunately for Clinton, the state of the world -- both his private one and
the world at large -- is far more serene than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only did he deliver last year's State of the Union address while facing
a Senate impeachment trial, but the United States had just concluded an air war
against Iraq and was close to beginning one against Yugoslavia. And the Asian
financial crisis -- now just a fading memory -- was still roiling Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   While Republicans fumed about pricetags, Democrats were happy to embrace
Clinton's farewell agenda. House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri
called it a ``starting point for our debate in Congress this year about our
nation's future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gephardt would become speaker if Democrats reclaim the House in November.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore, seated beside House Speaker Dennis Hastert -- and looming behind
Clinton -- was clearly the primary intended beneficiary of Clinton's litany.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton mentioned his vice president a half dozen times and even borrowed
items from his platform -- including the call for photo-IDs for gun owners. Gore
adviser Bob Shrum helped write the address.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus, Republicans registered open delight over a rare Clinton slip of the
tongue -- when he praised Gore for helping to ``make communities more liberal.''
Whoops. Make that ``more livable,'' Clinton corrected.
</P>
<P>
	   If Clinton was not above openly praising Gore, neither were Republicans
reluctant to get in their own plugs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look forward to working with the president to achieve a commonsense
agenda, based on the sound principles of fiscal responsibility and compassionate
conservatism,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a not-very-subtle bow to GOP front-runner George W. Bush's signature
``compassionate conservatism'' mantra.
</P>
<P>
	   Few could lose sight of the fact that it is, after all, an election year.

<HEADLINE> States, Banks Ally for Child Support  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using new powers granted by Congress, the federal
government found $1 billion in the accounts of parents who owe overdue child
support payments. States are seizing the accounts and getting parents to pay up.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington state officials have seized hundreds of accounts and collected $2
million from deadbeat parents. Florida has seized 232 accounts and collected
$191,706.
</P>
<P>
	   In Ohio, one county child support office froze the accounts of 40 people who
owed $90,000. So far, more than $40,000 owed to children has been collected and
paid back. An additional 17 people have been notified their accounts could be
seized.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a very important tool for us,'' said Maricarol Torsok, director of a
county child support office near Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Torsok received the names of parents with bank accounts from the Department
of Health and Human Services, which has been working with 2,300 banks across the
country since August to find the accounts of 3 million parents who owe child
support.
</P>
<P>
	   The department sends a computer tape with the names and Social Security
numbers of delinquent parents to large multistate banks and brokerages, which in
turn search their records to find a match.
</P>
<P>
	   So far 662,000 accounts were matched with names. States get the information
within 48 hours of the match and move quickly to freeze the account and collect
what's owed.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank account match system is part of a tough law passed by Congress in
1996 to track down parents who owe child support payments and tap their wages,
tax refunds and bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The law was revised in 1998 to give HHS the authority to do matches with
large banks with branches in many states. States have until October to work out
agreements with local banks to conduct their own matches.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are working harder than ever to ensure children get the support from
both parents they deserve and need,'' HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 30 million children are owed $50 billion in child support and funds are
being collected in only 23 percent of all cases, according to The Association
for Children for Enforcement of Support Inc., an advocacy group
</P>
<P>
	   One-third of all child support cases involve parents who live in a different
state than the one that has ordered them to pay.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials say the bank account matching system works best when the
parent has an account at banks within the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Torsok said her office received over 5,000 hits from HHS, many involving
parents whose accounts were at out-of-state banks. Seizing those accounts
involves many steps, so the state focused first on accounts at banks in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Account holders are sent a notice saying that the state can take a variety
of steps to seize their assets, including freezing bank accounts. They can
request a hearing, but few do. Most deadbeats do not find out that their
accounts have been seized until they try to access their account.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The notice doesn't say in big bold letter that we're going to take your
money, so if they choose to ignore the letter, they find out when they go to
withdraw money,'' Torsok said.
</P>
<P>
	   Notification rules vary from state to state.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington state, parents already under notice that they owe money do not
receive any warning that their bank accounts are in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
	   If the contents of the account holds less than what the parents owe, the
state can take everything.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a last resort collection tool, it's someone who owes arrears and
is not cooperating,'' said Charles Donnelly, policy manager at the state's
division of child support.
</P>
<P>
	   Many states have had serious problems delivering to families the fruits of
collection efforts because of problems with new computer systems created to
allow states to share information and track down deadbeats more easily.
</P>
<P>
	   Debbie Kline, project director at The Association for Enforcement of
Support, applauded the bank match system, but questioned how quickly money
collected will get to the kids that need it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This whole thing would work a lot better if the state systems worked,''
said Kline.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ethics Complaint Reviewed  </HEADLINE>
   By KELLY P. KISSEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton could be suspended or banned
from practicing law in his home state, depending on the results of an
investigation ordered by the Arkansas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The court on Thursday ordered its professional conduct committee to
investigate complaints that President Clinton lied and obstructed justice in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not commenting on it,'' White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyer L. Lynn Hogue filed a complaint on behalf of the Southeastern Legal
Foundation of Atlanta on Sept. 15, 1998, days after Clinton testified before
then-Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   The court order was issued after Hogue said he thought his complaint had
been ignored for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   A second complaint was filed by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright last
April after she found Clinton in contempt of court during the Jones case. Wright
said Clinton testified falsely when asked about his relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a victory not only for SLF, but also for the nation's legal
community and the millions of Americans who still believe that lawyers who lie
under oath have forfeited their right to practice law,'' foundation president
Matt Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
	   James Neal, director for the court's professional conduct committee, did not
return calls seeking comment. In the court proceedings, the committee argued
that confidentiality prevented release of information about the case.
</P>
<P>
	   According to committee guidelines, if the committee finds sufficient
evidence to support a complaint, a docket number will be assigned and Clinton
notified.
</P>
<P>
	   After Clinton and the accusers respond, the committee will consider the
evidence and possible punishments. The most serious would be to refer the case
to circuit court for disbarment proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Reagan Campaign Committee Operating  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sixteen years after his last campaign, Ronald Reagan's
presidential committee remains in operation with a half-million dollars in
leftover donations and a treasurer paid several thousand dollars a year. The
treasurer, longtime Reagan loyalist Bay Buchanan, has received more than $45,000
from the fund this decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan is the sister of Reform Party presidential candidate and former
Reagan White House speechwriter Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Reagans did not know about the leftover funds, which as of September
totaled $494,230, until the account was brought to their attention by The
Associated Press this month, an aide to the former president said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Naturally, it would be wonderful to see that kind of contribution made to
the Reagan library,'' Reagan's chief of staff, Joanne Drake, said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the campaign committee's trustees, former Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, said such a donation would have to wait until the campaign committee
could redeem the long-term notes that it has invested its money in.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At some point, it will go to the Reagan library,'' Meese said.
</P>
<P>
	   For most of the 1990s, the Reagan-Bush '84 committee has simply earned
interest and dividend payments, paid taxes and doled out a consulting fee to Bay
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Election Commission records show she has collected $45,715 in
consulting fees and expenses from the Reagan fund this decade, ranging from $869
in 1992 to as much as $7,500 in 1997. She has filed quarterly reports with the
FEC and paid the necessary taxes on the fund's earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Bay Buchanan did not immediately return phone calls to her office seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign finance experts expressed surprise that the fund has been left open
this many years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's amazing,'' election lawyer Kenneth Gross said. ``In the modern era,
I can't think of a committee that would continue to exist and pay salary to
somebody. That is unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
	   The average presidential campaign committee shuts down within five years of
the election, according to Republican consultant Stan Huckaby, who was treasurer
of George Bush's 1988 and 1992 campaign committees. Both have been closed, as
has President Clinton's 1992 committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Gross said the only reason to keep a campaign committee around for more than
a decade is to enable the candidate to raise money to pay off debts. John
Glenn's 1984 presidential campaign -- still $2.6 million in debt -- continues to
exist for that reason.
</P>
<P>
	   But Reagan's 1984 committee has no debts.
</P>
<P>
	   Between Jan. 1, 1997, and Sept. 30, 1999, the committee took in $42,180 --
all from dividends and interest. It paid out $31,942, with $17,766, or 56
percent, going to Bay Buchanan. Most of the rest went for taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Meese said the campaign committee trustees decided to put the money in
long-term investments until they could decide where the leftover funds should
go.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The money was invested pending a decision on what to do with it,'' Meese
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law would allow the money to be given to other federal candidates or
political action committees, to be refunded to contributors, or to be donated to
a charity or educational institution, such as Reagan's presidential library.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, Reagan's 1980 presidential committee donated its leftover
money to Republican candidates and the former president's leadership PAC,
Citizens for the Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   There could be tax consequences down the road if the committee does not
eventually give away the money, Gross said. The Internal Revenue Service can
declare the money personal income, and require Reagan to pay income taxes on it.
</P>
<P>
	   The former president, who lives in Los Angeles, is in declining health due
to Alzheimer's disease. He disclosed in 1994 that he had the incurable brain
disorder.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Hill Wary on Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez may have been
frustrated in their attempt at bringing the 6-year-old home to Cuba any time
soon, but they're apparently gaining ground in their effort to persuade Congress
to reject legislation granting the boy citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   Having won at least a delay in congressional action on the proposed
legislation, the grandmothers were to return Saturday to Cuba without the child,
after more planned congressional visits today.
</P>
<P>
	   They were also seeking a meeting with President Clinton, but White House
aides suggested that seemed unlikely -- despite Clinton's support for their
cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Raquel Rodriquez, the maternal grandmother, and Mariela Quintana, the
paternal grandmother, predicted they would eventually prevail -- even if not on
this trip.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will keep fighting,'' said Rodriquez. ``We're going to bring him back.
Right now, we can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the center of controversy since he was found clinging to an
inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and others traveling with
him in an effort to flee Cuba had drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that the youngster
should be returned to his father in Cuba, but relatives of the boy in this
country are fighting to keep him here.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional support for the citizenship bill seemed to be dwindling,
however.
</P>
<P>
	   On some issues, ``politicians just have to step aside,'' said House Speaker
Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
	   After a meeting of GOP House members, Hastert, R-Ill., would only say
``there's a difference of opinion'' among Republicans about how to proceed.
Hastert has supported the legislation but declined to predict its fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert said that the bill would not be rushed to the floor, as its sponsors
had hoped.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, he said, it would be referred to the House Judiciary Committee's
immigration subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Stratman, a spokesman for Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., said it was doubtful the panel would act until it received a report from
the Justice Department on the boy's immigration case.
</P>
<P>
	   That almost certainly guarantees there won't be action anytime soon, the
bill's opponents said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Senate, there was strong Democratic opposition to the bill and
Republicans were divided. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, waged a strong battle to keep the measure off the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., backed off his attempt to bring
the bill up this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, said spokesman John Czwartacki, it may -- or may not -- come up next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Thursday, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a leading congressional
proponent of returning Elian to Cuba, claimed the rounds made by the
grandmothers, both on Thursday and earlier in the week, had helped to build
congressional opposition to the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   He called the entire matter ``a tragic human experience and a tragic
political experience.''
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, who met in Miami Beach on Wednesday with their grandson,
claimed that he appeared withdrawn and fearful during the session.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our grandson is a whole different boy. He has changed completely. We have
to save this boy as soon as possible,'' said Quintana.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers filed in Miami, the boy's father claims that
relatives in Florida offered to give him money, a home and a car if he would
join Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a delegation that included two of the boy's Florida cousins also
made the rounds on Capitol Hill, urging support for the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He doesn't want to go back,'' said Marisleysis Gonzalez, a cousin of
Elian. ``I saw him approach his grandmothers and had the opportunity to see his
face, and it was still the face of fear.''
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers disagreed. ``We told him we wanted to bring him back to
Cuba. He nodded his head yes,'' Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler on Thursday gave attorneys
for the great-uncle of Elian -- who has temporary custody of him -- the extra
time they asked for to fight the U.S. government's efforts to return the boy to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler gave the Florida relatives until Feb. 24 to respond to the
government's motion to dismiss their challenge, and gave the government until
March 2 to file their response. The judge said he would begin hearing arguments
on the motion to dismiss the week of March 6.

<HEADLINE> Indie Filmmakers Get New Forum  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Director S. Lee Taylor admits that "Social
Intercourse," his independent film about a cybergeek looking for love, has
limited appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   But there it is, on video shelves alongside Hollywood's top hits. Taylor
couldn't be more thrilled.
</P>
<P>
	   The film is one of the first 10 movies in Hollywood Video's First Rites
program, an effort launched this month to showcase independent films that
generally have only been seen on the festival circuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood Video picks up the movies as exclusive rentals available only at
its stores. Blockbuster, the nation's largest video chain, has been doing the
same for the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   In an indie world where only a fraction of films ever get seen outside
festivals -- and even those that make it to theaters rarely pack in big crowds
-- such direct-to-video deals offer filmmakers a new shot at reaching a wide
audience.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm assuming I won't garner a following from this. I don't think anyone's
going to be looking for the next Steve Taylor film," Taylor said. "But when you
have someone really championing your film like this, it makes a difference."
</P>
<P>
	   Blockbuster, which bills itself as the biggest independent film distributor,
picked up seven films that played at last year's Sundance Film Festival and
expects to cut deals for 10 to 12 from this year's festival, which ends Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood Video also expects to go home with new films from Sundance and is
sponsoring a contest during the festival, asking filmmakers to drop off copies
of their movies. At least one of those films will be added to the retailer's
independent movie catalog.
</P>
<P>
	   Both video chains have been trolling other film festivals looking for
movies, and they receive a steady stream of movie submissions by mail. The
companies say adding exclusive independent titles gives consumers a wider
selection and exposure to quality films that otherwise might never have been
seen.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to make sure our customers are satisfied and keep coming back,"
said Dean Wilson, Blockbuster executive vice president for merchandising.
</P>
<P>
	   Blockbuster offered 70 exclusive titles last year and plans on 120 more this
year. The deals range from outright purchase of movies to short-term contracts
where filmmakers receive a percentage of rental fees in lieu of money upfront.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood Video cuts six-month exclusive deals for its movies, offering
filmmakers a share of rental fees. After the initial 10 titles, the company
plans to add six new movies each month.
</P>
<P>
	   "More customers are looking for independent films," said Jonae
Kurtenbach-Woodruff, Hollywood Video rental marketing director. "They don't just
want to see big studio films. People are interested in movies they can't see
anywhere else."
</P>
<P>
	   While independent filmmakers dream of wide theatrical releases, landing
their movies in video stores can bring them exposure and cash that helps get
their next films going.
</P>
<P>
	   "This sounds really magnanimous, but if I weren't to see a penny, it
wouldn't bother me," Taylor said. "My movie's gotten exposure, and that's worth
it all right there."

<HEADLINE> NH Independents Savor Crucial Role  </HEADLINE>
   By HOLLY RAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Becoming an independent businessman 10 years ago
turned Jerry Moylan into an independent voter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once I became a businessperson, I decided I couldn't align myself to a
party,'' said Moylan, a 36-year-old clothing and gift shop owner from Tilton.
``I have to look for the best person to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Moylan, like many voters unaffiliated with either of the two major
parties, had yet to find that best person just days before the New Hampshire
primary. He was leaning toward Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat, but also was
considering Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Between the Democrats, frankly, the experience of Gore is going to sway me
more than (Bill) Bradley's proposals,'' Moylan said. ``Bradley seems a little
far reaching. I think I have more faith in the incremental steps Gore is
proposing on health care.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moylan thinks McCain's military background would make him the most qualified
on foreign policy, but that's not the only reason he may vote for him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd just really like to not see (George W.) Bush get in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Call it the New Hampshire Declaration of Independents. For a key group of
New Hampshire voters this week, the pursuit of the perfect candidate --
regardless of party -- ranks right up there with life, liberty and happiness.
</P>
<P>
	   Just under 275,000 of the state's approximately 738,000 registered voters
are unaffiliated with either party. They outnumber Republicans or Democrats for
the first time and can vote in either primary Tuesday, making them a potentially
powerful force.
</P>
<P>
	   Glenn Martin, of Amherst, also was still deciding whether to vote Republican
or Democratic, but his top choices were McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain's good with the military -- he understands that,'' said Martin, a
business manager for a defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He just comes across as being a pretty square shooter,'' he said.
Likewise, Bradley ``also comes across as less political, more for the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   But while polls continue to show McCain with strong support among
independents, a survey released Thursday showed that Bradley's lead among
Democratic-leaning independents has eroded or disappeared. Self-identified
independents favored Gore over Bradley, 50 percent to 40 percent, in the
Franklin Pierce College-WNDS-TV poll, the exact opposite of the same poll a few
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Robin Marra, director of Franklin Pierce's polling institute, said 18
percent of independents have not committed to voting in either the Republican or
Democratic primaries, while the rest are split with 44 percent planning to vote
Republican and 36 percent voting Democratic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think some of the Democrat-leaning independents are probably
disappointed with Bradley's performance in Iowa and his seeming inability to
catch fire here, so they're probably reverting to their traditional party
loyalties,'' Marra said.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Bill Gardner said Thursday he expected only 81,000
independents to vote, which would be 23 percent of the 351,000 votes he predicts
will be cast.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollsters estimate that between 10 percent and 25 percent of independents
actually switch parties from election to election. The rest consistently support
Republicans or Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Cousins, another independent, is sure he'll vote Republican, but
continued to ponder his choices Thursday while juggling cash and customers at
his Concord deli. In contrast to the hectic pace at work, he is taking his time
deciding.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes had been his favorite, but Wednesday night's debate ``made me
look at Alan Keyes a little more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he'd be really good talking to foreign leaders,'' he said.
``Forbes and Keyes both seem like they would use U.S. law instead of trying to
change it or make new laws on the fly for their own personal agendas when
dealing with foreign countries.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked when he planned to make up his mind, Cousins smiled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By Tuesday,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Rebels' Base Overrun  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McDOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Myanmar government forces have seized the base of
the fringe rebel group God's Army, sending the rebels' leaders, twin 12-year-old
boys, fleeing into the jungle.
</P>
<P>
	   God's Army's 100 guerrillas had split up into three separate bands headed by
the boys, Johnny and Luther Htoo, and a veteran adult guerrilla, Su Bia, a Thai
military intelligence officer said.
</P>
<P>
	   They were apparently headed for Karjom mountain, near their fallen camp at
Ka Mar Pa Law on the Myanmar side of the Thailand-Myanmar border, the officer
said. He asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
	   A local dissident radio station with good rebel contacts also reported the
fall of God's Army headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   God's Army was one of the rebel groups involved in the siege of a Thai
hospital earlier this week. On Tuesday, 10 gunmen from God's Army and an allied
group, the Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors, were killed by Thai commandos who
stormed the hospital and freed hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
	   Thais were outraged by the seizure of the Ratchaburi provincial hospital, 60
miles west of Bangkok. Fears have risen of a backlash against 100,000 mostly
Karen ethnic minority refugees living in camps along the border.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karen National Union, the biggest rebel army still fighting Myanmar's
military regime, has disavowed God's Army. But the group has operated on the
edges of KNU territory and received material support from it.
</P>
<P>
	   Saw Ba Thin, the new KNU leader, said that the group considers Ka Mar Pa Law
its territory. He said KNU guerrillas were fighting Myanmar forces nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's difficult to say if they will survive,'' Saw Ba Thin said of God's
Army. ``It depends if they stand or regroup.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like many Karen, God's Army's soldiers are fundamentalist Christians in a
predominantly Buddhist country. The group was formed in 1997 when KNU fighters
abandoned the village where Johnny and Luther Htoo lived, leaving it unprotected
against a Myanmar offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   According to legend, the twins rallied some men and waged a successful
counterattack. Their followers now believe they have magical powers that
guarantee them victory and protect them from harm.
</P>
<P>
	   The boys' word is obeyed without question. They constantly smoke cigarettes
and cheroot cigars, but forbid drinking, gambling and swearing.
</P>
<P>
	   God's Army was an insignificant group until October, when it gave refuge to
another fringe group -- the Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors, who had just
seized Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok and then escaped.
</P>
<P>
	   The Myanmar army went into action once the rainy season ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Ka Mar Pa Law came under sustained attack last week, sending 1,000 Karen
civilians over the border into Thailand. Thailand then shelled rebel positions
to keep the fighters from joining them.
</P>
<P>
	   In reaction, the 10 gunmen seized the hospital and demanded that Thailand
stop the shelling and give refuge to fighters and civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Journalists from the Democratic Voice of Burma, a dissident radio station,
said their sources reported Ka Mar Pa Law fell Thursday morning. A spokesman for
Myanmar's government would not confirm the base had fallen but said skirmishes
had gone on for days.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thai Defense Ministry said soldiers were reinforcing the border to keep
armed intruders out. The rebels were welcome to enter Thailand, but only if they
laid down their arms, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Concerned About Nuclear Waste  </HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. SHEERAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A plan to move nuclear waste on Ohio highways or rails is
generating concern among elected officials and public interest organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Department of Energy is considering storing used nuclear waste from
the nation's power plants at an underground dump about 100 miles from Las Vegas
at Yucca Mountain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I urge the Department of Energy to do everything in its power to ensure
that Clevelanders receive accurate and complete information,'' Mayor Michael R.
White said Thursday at an outdoor news conference adjacent to a highway and rail
corridor.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor appeared with a critic of the plan, Chris Trepal, executive
director of the Earth Day Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The environmental group and others planned to ask the agency about potential
risks and emergency planning at a hearing today in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   Trepal said her group wants the government to ``cease the historic plan to
transport the most dangerous and radioactive waste through the heart of our
community and the back yards of over 50 million people nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government's latest round of public hearings began Monday in Lincoln,
Neb., and will continue Tuesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Cleveland, Lincoln and Chicago are along the main rail and highway
routes heading from the East Coast to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle Fisher, spokeswoman for the Energy Department's Yucca Mountain Project
Office, said today's hearing will be the 19th of 20 scheduled during a six-month
comment period. Ten hearings have been held in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're still studying the site and the routes,'' she said. ``Even if
everything were approved, we would not be starting until 2010.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said as many as nine shipments a week could go through Ohio, involving
mostly trucks. If trains are primarily used, there could be two train shipments
each week and one truck shipment every five or six days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Department of Energy has a very good track record for shipping nuclear
materials,'' Fisher said. ``There are very strict guidelines that must be
followed.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Steps Up the Offensive  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Upending his campaign's core theme, Bill Bradley
has launched a frenetic assault on rival Al Gore's honesty and is arguing that
the vice president cannot be trusted to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
	   Some polls have suggested that Gore is gaining days before the New Hampshire
primary, and Bradley abandoned his high-road tactic to directly confront his
rival.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and his aides said the move smacked of desperation, while Bradley said
``enough is enough'' and he would no longer tolerate distortions by Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I won't be reinventing myself,'' said Bradley. ``However, I can tell you
right now I am no longer going to accept misrepresentations of my positions by
Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he has gotten a positive response to his more confrontational
style, unveiled in a debate Wednesday. In the attack, the former New Jersey
senator all but called Gore a liar, though he didn't use that word.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes in politics people make misleading statements because they don't
know any better,'' said Bradley. ``I think he knows better, but he continues to
say what is untrue.''
</P>
<P>
	   That says volumes about what Gore would do if elected, Bradley argued.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How you run a campaign is how you govern. That was the point I was making
and I waited a long time to make it,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, addressing employees of a high-tech firm in Manchester on Thursday,
said anew that Bradley was turning the campaign negative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't understand how someone can condemn negative attacks while in the
same breath can make negative attacks,'' said Gore, who cut his campaign day
short to return to Washington to attend President Clinton's final State of the
Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Bradley's contentions in the debate was that Gore had been
inconsistent on abortion rights, including voting as a member of Congress to
restrict access to the procedure. And the suggestion haunted Gore on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president was a guest on a New Hampshire public radio call-in show
when a woman accused him of lying about his abortion record in the debate. ``I
don't know how I can support your candidacy if you're so dishonest on national
TV,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, Gore said, ``I have always supported Roe vs. Wade. I have
always supported keeping abortion legal. And it's true, early in my career I
voted to restrict the use of federal funding in some circumstances, but over the
years I've come to the view that federal funding ought to be available.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the tougher rhetoric, Bradley stepped up his schedule
Thursday -- starting early on a frigid morning and stumping deep into the
evening -- and a new air of urgency surrounded his campaign entourage.
</P>
<P>
	   Along the way, he engaged in chaotic handshaking at grocery and convenience
stores, even helping to bag groceries. He also mingled with patrons at a
Portsmouth pub, where politics wasn't on the forefront of everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's shift in approach had been under discussion since he was hammered
in the leadoff Iowa caucuses Monday night. Supporters such as Nebraska Sen. Bob
Kerrey have been battering Gore in public, arguing that he's been distorting
Bradley's record, and they have been pushing Bradley in private to become more
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
	   The change risks Bradley's core appeal as the nontraditional politician who
is above attack politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore aides dismissed the new approach as the last gasp of a troubled
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's clearly listening to his consultants,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane. ``His music wasn't playing. This undermines the central presence of his
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous polls have shown Gore with at least a slight lead in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to avoid the charge that he's turning the campaign negative, Bradley
also is running a new batch of positive television commercials in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Gore consistently misrepresents his health plan by arguing it
would replace Medicaid with $150-a-month vouchers. Bradley said he's told Gore
repeatedly that's not the case. Bradley said Gore also argues -- wrongly -- that
the health plan would fritter away the projected budget surplus.

<HEADLINE> Gore Turns Deficit Into Lead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore turned a deficit in New Hampshire polls into a
lead during his aggressive campaign for the Iowa caucuses, but Bill Bradley is
showing his feisty side in an effort to reverse that trend before the nation's
first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire tracking polls in recent days have suggested that Vice
President Gore has a lead of anywhere from 7 points to 17 points, depending on
the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   But the pollster for one of those surveys, Dick Bennett of the American
Research Group, saw some tantalizing signs Thursday night that Bradley's newly
aggressive approach may help reverse his slide as Tuesday's primary nears.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett noted that Bradley picked up ground among undecided voters Thursday
night, but stilled trailed Gore, 50 percent to 40 percent, in the three-day
poll. He cautioned that it was too early to tell whether Bradley's progress in
the polls was significant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tomorrow night will show if this trend holds,'' Bennett said on his poll
release. Tracking polls are rolling averages of several one-night polls and can
be deceptive -- sometimes showing quick evidence of change, and sometimes
showing variations that have more to do with the relatively small sample of
people who are polled each night.
</P>
<P>
	   But numerous tracking polls over a period of days can offer significant
evidence of a candidate's movement over time. And they all picked up Gore's
surge past Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had been relying on his strength with independents when he led many
polls during the fall. Independents will play a key role in the New Hampshire
primary. About one out of five say they haven't decided whether to vote in the
Democratic or Republican primary, said Robin Marra, director of the polling
institute at Franklin Pierce College.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Sen. John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush are in a
very close race, with McCain leading in several of the tracking polls by
anywhere from a narrow edge to 12 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Research Group poll released Thursday had McCain at 36 percent
and Bush at 32 percent, a slight improvement for Bush in that poll and a
difference within the poll's 4-point error margin.
</P>
<P>
	   The top candidates' increasingly aggressive campaigning could play well with
New Hampshire voters. A poll by Fox-WMUR-University of New Hampshire said that
many likely voters, more than a third on the Democratic and the Republican
sides, choose one quality over the others when it comes to determining who they
will support: ``He stands up for what he believes.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates on the Vietnam War  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press asks the presidential candidates a
question on the issues. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Labor Standards
</P>
<P>
	   Would you favor a system that would ban products made by child labor or
under unsafe or unhealthy conditions from being sold in the United States?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``I have called for the WTO (World Trade Organization) to
prohibit all trade in goods produced with forced child labor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``The United States currently supports initiatives that ban the
importation of products produced by forced or indentured child labor. I support
these and other initiatives aimed at protecting children from exploitation. Just
recently, at the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle, the President signed the
instrument of ratification of the International Labor Organization's Convention
on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. This document declared on
behalf of the American people that we will not tolerate child slavery, the sale
or trafficking of children, child prostitution or pornography, forced or
compulsory child labor, and hazardous work that harms the health, safety, and
morals of children. Through these and other initiatives, we are reaffirming both
at home and across the globe our fundamental belief in human dignity and our
unchanging reverence for human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``The U.S. should impose tariffs on countries that use child
labor to deny these regimes any benefit from the exploitation of children. And
keep those tariffs on until the regimes take children out of their sweatshops.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``Yes. The United States must not divorce its values from trade
policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``It is immoral to force children to work, particularly in
unsafe and unhealthy conditions, and we should oppose it. One of the important
issues I have raised in this campaign is stopping slave labor products (from
adults or children) from being sold in the U.S. Communist China has a
particularly loathsome record in this area. As President, I will work to stop
this and will impose sanctions on companies that engage in such practices.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``I have supported legislation banning the importation of goods
into the United States manufactured by child or slave labor. Defining 'unsafe'
or 'unhealthy' labor conditions, however, lends itself far too much to
subjective analysis by interested parties in both business and labor. Therefore,
I would ensure that cases are reviewed individually to ensure that health and
safety standards were appropriate based on relevant standards.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeking $350B Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans say President Clinton's
valedictory State of the Union address offered some hope they can find common
ground with him on debt reduction, education and other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think a lot of it is doable if the president will sit down and work with
us,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., singling out health care,
education, debt reduction, tax cuts and anti-drug aid to Colombia as areas of
potential agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   But following Clinton's 89-minute speech to Congress on Thursday night, the
longest of his eight State of the Union addresses, many of the same old
divisions remained. Republicans said he had proposed far too much new spending
and not enough tax reduction, which combined with their lingering distrust of
him lays the groundwork for a contentious election year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The proof is not him saying it tonight to a national television
audience,'' said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas. ``The proof is directing his minions
to work with the Republican Congress to actually do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president used his address to senators and representatives gathered in
the House chamber, in part, to recount the successes of his first seven years in
office: a near-record economic expansion, federal deficits morphed into
surpluses, lower crime rates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1992, we just had a roadmap. Today, we have results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also laid out a wish list for his final year that ranged from sweeping
ideas -- $350 billion in tax cuts, retirement savings accounts, more spending
for schools and health care, photo ID licenses for handguns -- to narrower ones
like encouraging the development of new vaccines and less-polluting cars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tonight is special because we stand on the mountaintop of a new
millennium,'' Clinton said. ``Behind us we see the great expanse of American
achievement. Before us, even grander frontiers of possibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some of his proposals have the potential for bipartisan compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   He would spend more for teachers, Head Start, after-school and summer school
programs, and provide college tuition tax deductions of up to $2,800 per family.
He wants to use parts of the huge projected federal surpluses to eliminate the
$3.6 trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by Republicans
and Democrats as both sides battle for control of Congress and the White House.
House Republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and
relief from the so-called marriage penalty this year. Presidential candidates
have their own proposals too.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would boost funds for scientific research, raise military pay,
increase the $5.15 hourly minimum wage and create a new Medicare prescription
drug benefit. And he would pare taxes for child care, long-term care of ailing
relatives, charitable giving, and companies investing in inner cities and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For too long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most
pressing national priorities,'' he said in one of his few overt swipes at the
Republicans from whom Democrats hope to win congressional control in November.
``Let's begin with them.''
</P>
<P>
	   But leavening such attacks were other gestures, such as when he turned and
shook hands with Hastert after lauding him for supporting efforts to increase
investments in urban areas. And many Republicans, eager to at least appear
cooperative in an election year, returned the favor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wants to have a legacy,'' said Rep. Thomas Davis, R-Va., chairman of
the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's campaign arm.
``He has some reasonable proposals here and we want to deal with them. It works
for us if he does it right. We like to show we're doing things too.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, one of Clinton's most bitter
foes, joined many of the frequent rounds of applause and left the door open to
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone knows we have some very serious disagreements over some very
important principles,'' DeLay said. ``But I am hopeful that the president will
work with us and leave office with a record of achievement.''
</P>
<P>
	   With the New Hampshire presidential primary just five days away, Clinton
boosted his personal favorite, Vice President Al Gore, by mentioning him six
times. He also recognized another candidate seated in the galleries above the
House chamber: First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, running for the U.S. Senate
seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   But from the presidential campaign trail, GOP contender George W. Bush
couldn't resist firing away at Clinton's proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The litany of spending programs the president announced tonight proves my
point that if you leave a large surplus in Washington, the money will be spent
on bigger government,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   The politics was also evident in some of the proposals Clinton made that
have little or no chance of enactment this year. Those included his calls for
campaign finance reform and licensing handgun owners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people will throw that right back into his face,'' said Sen.
Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a member of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton renewed his push for new rights for patients of health maintenance
organizations. He would provide health insurance for millions of low-income
parents -- a $110 billion, 10-year effort -- and let people between 55 and 65
buy into the Medicare medical insurance program. To help them afford that, he
would provide them with a tax credit.

<HEADLINE> Airline Lets Tired Pilots Cancel  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- American Airlines recently adopted a policy
allowing pilots who are too tired to fly to beg off a flight without penalty, a
top executive said Thursday at a hearing into a crash that killed 11 people last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The two pilots of the plane that crashed June 1 while trying to land in a
storm in Little Rock had been on duty for more than 13 hours -- just shy of
American's maximum 14-hour day. Pilot Richard Buschmann was killed and co-pilot
Michael Origel was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Greg Feith said the long
day was not unusual for American pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have received ... numerous people calling us or providing us letters
that people are flying tired -- that American Airlines pilots are still on the
edge of fatigue and management isn't listening,'' Feith said.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Baker, vice chairman for American's parent company, AMR Corp, said:
``We have said to our pilots in no uncertain terms, `If you feel you are unable
to perform because of fatigue, then you are off the trip at your request with no
recourse from the company.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Baker, who was in charge of American's operations at the time of the crash,
was promoted three weeks ago to a new position created to oversee safety and
security.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the airline plans to revise its policies on approaches and landings
and avoiding thunderstorms. Pilots will also be given more training on
interpreting radar.
</P>
<P>
	   The Air Transport Association in Washington said Thursday it did not know of
fatigue-related policies for individual airlines but did say that pilots, in
general, have been able to beg off flights in case of illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven people were killed and 110 injured when Flight 1420 landed in high
wind and heavy rain, ran off the runway, broke apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, American has evaluated itself three times and come up with 85
recommendations for improvements, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have learned some things. We've got some work to do. We will be a
better airline for it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fuel costs high in New York, but emergency relief doesn't match  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New York officials, looking to the federal government
for relief from soaring fuel prices, say emergency grants the Clinton
administration announced this week are inadequate.
<P>
	   New York has 1.4 million poor residents eligible for federal low income fuel
assistance, more than any other state, and Gov. George Pataki had sought between
$35 and $40 million in the emergency aid. Yet New York received $2.6 million,
well below the amount awarded to other less-populated states.
</P>
<P>
	   Maine, for instance, received $10.3 million in aid with 83,478 eligible
low-income households.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are dumbfounded by this decision," Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said
Thursday. "It's hard to understand how the administration can say that this
would be any significant help."
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil prices have nearly doubled in some parts of the Northeast
recently.
</P>
<P>
	   A typical New York state family's home heating oil bill was about $360 last
January. This month, it is headed to $680. The price for home heating oil in New
York state rose from an average of 90 cents a gallon to as much as $1.70 a
gallon - mostly in the last two cold weeks, according to government and business
surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   A variety of factors have been blamed for the increase ranging from a brutal
European winter that has sapped U.S. supplies to a frozen Hudson River that has
added time to oil tankers trips.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human
Services, said the amounts of the emergency grants had been based on a formula
taking into account the coldness of the state's temperature and the costliness
of the heating costs. He said while those factors were bad in New York they were
not as bad as they were in other states.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 11 states receiving the $44 million in total federal aid, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut and New Jersey each received more
money than New York. All had far fewer eligible households. Rhode Island,
Pennsylvania, Alaska, Vermont and Delaware received less money than New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Kharfen also explained that New York already receives a hefty annual
allocation of Low Income Heating Assistance Program money, known as LIHEAP. In
the 2000 fiscal year New York received $136.3 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the largest of any state in the nation," Kharfen said.
</P>
<P>
	   That failed to placate New York lawmakers who said they were being
shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   "This administration has bungled the government's response to skyrocketing
fuel oil prices," Rep. John McHugh, R-Watertown, said.
</P>
<P>
	   McHugh and some other lawmakers, including New York's Democratic Sen.
Charles Schumer, are calling on the administration to dip into the nation's
strategic oil reserves to help offset the skyrocketing fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson opposes that but said Thursday he was
delaying the delivery of 5 million barrels of oil to the 580 million barrel
reserve in an attempt to stem oil price increases somewhat.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he is perplexed by the sudden, steep rise in oil prices, and
said the Energy Department has begun more closely monitoring the heating oil
market.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States consumes about 18 million barrels of oil a day, according
to the American Petroleum Institute.

<HEADLINE> House Contest Couple To Sell Home  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- For sale by owner: Beautiful country home. Three
bedroom, two bath and high ceilings. Set amid 25 acres of secluded lakes and
hills in the Ozarks. Broken dreams not included.
</P>
<P>
	   For nearly a year, Arlyne and Darrell Barnes tried to give their dream
retirement home away in a contest. Anyone interested was to send $100 and an
essay on why they wanted the home.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple hoped to raise enough money to pay off their mortgage and set
some money aside to pay for a private investigation into their son's unsolved
death.
</P>
<P>
	   But too few people entered the contest. Now, with bills from lawyers and
private investigators piling up, the couple has dropped the contest and put the
house up for sale.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's really a shame,'' Mrs. Barnes said Thursday. ``But the fact that we
made so many new friends and received so many prayers made it all worth the
effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   The house is being listed as $159,900, well below its appraised price of
$200,000. ``We have so many bills and loans, we are going to lose it if we don't
sell it,'' Mrs. Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 613 people entered the contest. Their money has been refunded.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple had hoped to raise at least $50,000 to pay for a private
investigation into the death of Mitchell Krupp, Mrs. Barnes' 29-year-old son
from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   Krupp's home near Brentwood, Ark., burned in July 1997, in a blaze
authorities say was deliberately set. Investigators found Krupp's remains
between the springs of his bed mattress, along with the remains of a shotgun. A
lead shot was found in his skull.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said the fire destroyed so much evidence they may never learn
how he died. The case remains open.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Barnes says she believes her son was murdered and his death made to
look like a suicide. She has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Krupp's wife
of six years, Pam Worrell. Both Mrs. Barnes and her lawyer, Charles Kester,
declined comment on the pending lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Having exhausted their life savings on investigators and lawyers, the couple
needed money. The contest idea was inspired by ``The Spitfire Grill,'' a 1996
movie in which an elderly woman makes her restaurant the prize in a similar
giveaway.
</P>
<P>
	   They had built the home nine years ago as a place to retire. With a view of
a private, trout-stocked lake, a separate workshop, an indoor pool, cathedral
ceilings and a wraparound porch, it seemed a sure bet that people would bid $100
for a chance.
</P>
<P>
	   They announced the contest last February with a deadline of June 15. With
entries lagging, they extended the deadline to September 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, having fallen short of their goal of 1,800 entries, Mrs. Barnes said
she doesn't know what's next for her and her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been 2 1/2 years since my son died,'' she said. ``We never planned on
any of this.''
</P>
<P>
	   A nonprofit group called VOICES of Victims has shown interest in turning the
property into its national headquarters and a retreat for grieving families of
murderer children. But the organization doesn't have a lot of money, and Mrs.
Barnes says she can't wait for members to raise it.
</P>
<P>
	   Wanting to create something positive from the contest, Mrs. Barnes said she
may compile the essays she received into a book.
</P>
<P>
	   She said several people wrote of loved ones who also had died under
mysterious and unsolved circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It really opened our eyes to the number of unsolved murders there are out
there,'' she said. ``We were truly inspired to continue seeking the truth in my
son's case.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Look To More IRS Changes  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are eyeing reforms for the Internal Revenue
Service's system of penalties and interest, but a top Treasury official says too
many changes would confuse taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Penalties and interest can be quite severe, even debilitating,'' Rep. Amo
Houghton, R-N.Y. and chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means oversight
subcommittee said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We, as representatives of the people, must take pains to ensure that
innocent taxpayers' lives are not ruined by a cascading imposition of penalties
and interest due to honest mistakes,'' Houghton said at a hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   But Joseph Mikrut, tax legislative counsel for the Treasury Department, told
Houghton's subcommittee that while some changes may be needed, they should not
be drastic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no perfect system of sanctions and striking the appropriate
balance inherently involves tradeoffs among competing concerns,'' Mikrut said,
warning that changes could send mixed signals to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   The comments come as Congress looks at ways to reform the penalty and
interest system.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998 Congress passed a series of bills to make the IRS less heavy-handed
and lawmakers have cited penalty and interest reform as an example that further
change is needed in the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department is concerned that big changes in the law will
confuse Americans and cause more delinquent taxpayers, Mikrut said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although a penalty regime should not be overly harsh to noncompliant
taxpayers ... the currently high compliance level should not be discouraged,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Houghton cited as an example a constituent who was notified two years ago
that deductions claimed between 1981-1986 had been disallowed. ``The interest
clock was running all this time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other lawmakers had similar stories. Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., said a
physician in his district was notified that he owed the IRS a penny and had been
fined $100.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the changes Mikrut said Treasury supports include eliminating the
failure to file penalty and imposing a higher failure to pay penalty; and
elimination of interest in situations where the IRS may be at fault or there are
circumstances out of the taxpayer's control that cause payment delays.
</P>
<P>
	   Further changes may cause a ``blurring'' of the penalty and interest
systems, Mikrut cautioned.

<HEADLINE> Weather Problems Plague Regatta  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- America's Cup sailors use sophisticated
technology to gauge the speed and pressure of the wind -- anemometers,
barometers and birds.
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, there wasn't enough wind to hold the third race of the challenger
finals. On Saturday, northerly breezes of 10 to 20 knots should allow AmericaOne
and Prada of Italy to continue their best-of-9 series, tied at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
	The yachts are allowed to receive data from their weather boats until 10
minutes before the race. After that they're on their own. Instruments on the
mast feed data into a laptop computer on board.
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, though, crew members use other sources.
</P>
<P>
	``They'll watch the way birds are flying,'' Bob McDavitt of the Metropolitan
Weather Service of Auckland, said Friday. ``They'll see what helicopters are
doing in the sky because, quite often, the choppers need to face the wind to
steady themselves so that tells you what the weather is like that high in the
air.''
</P>
<P>
	McDavitt is an America's Cup veteran. He was the weatherman for the New Zealand
teams that competed in Fremantle, Australia, in 1987 and San Diego in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	Wind conditions in both those areas are less shifty than those in the Hauraki
Gulf off Auckland, which is surrounded by land on three sides. Only winds from
the north and northeast travel almost entirely over water.
</P>
<P>
	Under America's Cup rules, no race can start unless the wind is stronger than
five knots for 10 consecutive minutes without major shifts in direction. If that
doesn't happen between 1:15 p.m. local time, when the races are scheduled to
start, and 3 p.m., they're postponed.
</P>
<P>
	On Friday the race was postponed at 2:40 p.m. because winds rarely surpassed
five knots. So while their boats bobbed around in the placid waters, crew
members relaxed.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne skipper Paul Cayard lay down on the deck, his hands behind his head.
Other sailors chatted and laughed, waiting for the race committee's decision.
</P>
<P>
	``The sailors tend to be in modes of thought,'' McDavitt said. ``You're either
in race mode or relax mode. You can flip from one to another pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
	Auckland was under a high pressure system, which tends to keep winds down.
Sunny days, though, can speed them up.
</P>
<P>
	``It was too cloudy today for the sun to heat the land and the land to suck in
the breeze,'' McDavitt said. ``Not enough sunshine. Sorry about that.''
</P>
<P>
	More apologies may be in order Sunday, when the fourth race is scheduled. The
forecast was for rain and blustery winds in the morning and a wind shift from
north to west, ``which you don't like to have in the middle of the race'' since
the course may have to be changed after it starts.
</P>
<P>
	Barring further postponements, Races 4 and 5 will be held Sunday and Tuesday.
No racing is scheduled Monday because of the Auckland Anniversary Day holiday in
which other races will be held in the Gulf to mark the city's 160th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	Prada or America One will face defending champion New Zealand in the best-of-9
America's Cup finals scheduled to start Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	Conditions on Sunday could be similar to last Tuesday's when rough seas, strong
winds and heavy rain delayed the first race by 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts, though, aren't always reliable, especially on the Hauraki Gulf where
wind direction can change substantially over a short time.
</P>
<P>
	``All weather,'' McDavitt said, ``is a mixture of pattern and chaos.''

<HEADLINE> Boat Designer Wins Wherever He Goes  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- From San Diego to Auckland to Milan and now back
to Auckland.
</P>
<P>
	It's been a scenic and successful journey for a middle-aged California boat
designer who looks as if he might be comfortable on a surfboard and once had the
Beach Boys singing group backing his ill-fated America's Cup syndicate.
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, Doug Peterson likes to shoot from the lip, so don't accuse him of
being a traitor to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	He says he designs boats for America's Cup teams trying to beat the United
States because he wants the best chance of winning. He thinks through his
options then decides who to bestow his brilliance on.
</P>
<P>
	There is plenty of substance to Peterson who, at age 54, still has thick
reddish-brown hair with a beard to match and is trying to win his third straight
America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great genius,'' said Bill Koch, head of the America3 syndicate that
won the 1992 Cup in San Diego with Peterson on the design team. ``He has that
little bit of anti-establishment thinker about him, which is great.''
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, Peterson was a winner again, this time as a key designer for
New Zealand's Black Magic, which was much faster than Young America in sweeping
all five races in the finals off San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	``He's a highly intelligent human being,'' said John Bertrand, the Australian
winner of the 1983 America's Cup who used a Peterson-designed boat as part of
his preparations that year. ``He has an opinion on everything and, generally,
that opinion is very well worth listening to.''
</P>
<P>
	The Italians thought so. They hired him to design Prada for this year's races.
Good choice.
</P>
<P>
	The silver-hulled speedster would reach the America's Cup finals against New
Zealand if it beats AmericaOne in the best-of-9 challenger finals now under way
amid the shifty winds on Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing new about people working for different countries'' than their
own, Peterson said, ``nothing new at all.''
</P>
<P>
	Born in Los Angeles and raised in San Diego, Peterson moved to Auckland after
the 1992 races to meet the requirement that he live in the country for which
he's working for two years before the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
	That changed to three years after the 1995 event, so he moved to Milan. For the
past five months he's been in Auckland during the trials.
</P>
<P>
	``My kids love the mobility. I take them everywhere with me,'' said Peterson, a
father of three daughters and one son. ``My youngest daughter lived with me for
a year in Milan and she learned Italian much better than me.''
</P>
<P>
	He did explore working for other syndicates. He talked with Dennis Conner about
the Stars and Stripes campaign. In the end, as the three-year deadline
approached, no team in America or elsewhere other than the Italians had the
financial stability to assure it would be able to compete, he said.
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win,'' said Peterson, who denied that a bigger paycheck was a
factor. ``We were fully funded from day one so that looked like a combination to
me because we could start doing things right away.''
</P>
<P>
	Should Prada defeat AmericaOne, Peterson would have a chance to beat one of his
former employers, Sir Peter Blake. His syndicate is defending the Cup it won in
1995 in a boat Peterson designed.
</P>
<P>
	``There was an element on the team that didn't want me there'' this time,
Peterson said. ``Hopefully, they'll wish that they didn't let me go.''
</P>
<P>
	After the 1992 event, Peterson talked with all three American defense
syndicates preparing for 1995. Conner's was one of them.
</P>
<P>
	After Conner fell behind New Zealand 2-0 in the finals, Peterson was told that
Conner once said ``designers are just necessary evils.''
</P>
<P>
	His response: ``I wonder how necessary Dennis is right now.''
</P>
<P>
	Still, Peterson says he gets along with Conner.
</P>
<P>
	Once, Peterson and two friends began their own syndicate, Beach Boys USA, for
the 1992 Cup. But funding fell short so he took his innovative ideas to Koch.
</P>
<P>
	``Like all geniuses, he has weaknesses. He gets interested in some of the more
unusual and creative aspects and sometimes leaves details for other people,''
Koch said. ``He likes to think out of the (mainstream).
</P>
<P>
	``He would say, `Well, everybody is going for a short, fat boat, let's go for a
long, narrow boat' and not even test it. He'd just say, `Well, let's go for it,
design it tomorrow.'
</P>
<P>
	``We'd say, `Gosh, that's a very good idea, but how long, how narrow?' It was
that kind of interaction you need.''
</P>
<P>
	If Peterson and his Prada design team are successful against AmericaOne, he'll
move closer to his third straight America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
	Nothing personal. Just a job.
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of our group and their group sailed together and are friends,''
Peterson said, ``and they will continue to be friends. There is a life beyond
the America's Cup.''

GOP Sees Common Ground in Clinton's Speech
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans say President Clinton's
valedictory State of the Union address offered some hope they can find common
ground with him on debt reduction, education and other issues. "I think a lot of
it is doable if the president will sit down and work with us," said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., singling out health care, education, debt
reduction, tax cuts and anti-drug aid to Colombia as areas of potential
agreement. But following Clinton's speech to Congress on Thursday night, many of
the same old divisions remained. Republicans said he had proposed far too much
new spending and not enough tax reduction, which combined with their lingering
distrust of him lays the groundwork for a contentious election year.

Bradley Steps Up the Offensive

<P>
	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Upending his campaign's core theme, Bill Bradley
has launched a frenetic assault on rival Al Gore's honesty and is arguing that
the vice president cannot be trusted to tell the truth. Some polls have
suggested that Gore is gaining days before the New Hampshire primary, and
Bradley abandoned his high-road tactic to directly confront his rival. Gore and
his aides said the move smacked of desperation, while Bradley said "enough is
enough" and he would no longer tolerate distortions by Gore. "I won't be
reinventing myself," said Bradley. "However, I can tell you right now I am no
longer going to accept misrepresentations of my positions by Al Gore."

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Russia has escaped a Council of Europe suspension
for its conduct in Chechnya, but international pressure is growing on Moscow to
settle the bloody conflict. The Council of Europe handed Russia a three-month
deadline Thursday to start cease-fire talks and ease the suffering of Chechen
civilians, or face suspension from the human rights organization. A suspension
would be a blow to Moscow's efforts to link itself more closely with Europe.
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan added his voice to calls for a speedy end to
the war during his visit to Moscow.

Capitol Hill Wary on Cuban Boy

to reject legislation granting the boy citizenship. Having won at least a delay
in congressional action on the proposed legislation, the grandmothers were to
return Saturday to Cuba without the child, after more planned congressional
visits Friday. They were also seeking a meeting with President Clinton, but
White House aides suggested that seemed unlikely -- despite Clinton's support

Thursday to charges of involvement in the alleged plot. Ressam, an Algerian, was

Canada into the United States. Three other Algerian nationals and a woman
married to an Algerian are in custody, and police in the United States and

<HEADLINE> Officials agree to stop housing more than two children per room in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Officials have agreed to stop housing more than
two children in each room at the state's juvenile detention centers in response
to the rape of a 13-year-old boy.
<P>
	   Beginning next week, juveniles will sleep on the floor in common areas at
the three centers with staff watching over them throughout night rather than be
placed in rooms with two others.
</P>
<P>
	   A court-appointed monitor urged officials to restructure the system after a
13-year-old boy was raped while in a room at the New Haven Detention Center with
three other boys. Two boys were arrested in the November attack.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll do whatever it takes to keep this from happening again," said Judge
John J. Ronan, deputy chief court administrator, who agreed to the change during
a meeting Thursday with monitor Donald DeVore.
</P>
<P>
	   Populations at the three centers are 20 to 50 percent higher than goals set
by a 1997 federal consent decree to improve living conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been a 35 percent increase in admissions in the last five years at
the centers, which typically house youths between the ages of 11 and 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Failure by the state Department of Children and Families to quickly find
placements for children under its care also was cited as a cause of the
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
	   DeVore, appointed in 1997 after a federal class-action lawsuit was brought
against the state, urged judicial officials on Thursday to take immediate
action.
</P>
<P>
	   "As long as we continue to put too many kids in these rooms, it will be
almost impossible to ensure safety," DeVore told members of a task force
appointed to study the overcrowding problem.
</P>
<P>
	   In a September 1998 report on conditions at the New Haven center, DeVore
warned state officials that overcrowding breeds violence, illness and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Judicial officials responded at the time by taking several steps, such as
moving forward with plans to build larger facilities in Hartford and Bridgeport
and creating alternative detention programs that gave them another 100 beds.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said it's too soon to say exactly how the new system of putting
juveniles in common rooms will work or how much it will cost.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to require staff members to sit out in those rooms all night and
stay awake and watch," DeVore said. "They're going to have to beef up staffing."
</P>
<P>
	   Ronan also agreed to DeVore's suggestion that the monitor improve the method
used to identify youths who might be sexual predators. Those children are put in
single rooms.

<HEADLINE> State to take over Operation Sail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state will oversee the day-to-day operations
of the financially-strapped OpSail2000CT, the New London-based tall ships
celebration planned for this summer.
<P>
	   The budget for the project will be scaled back from $7 million to $6.2
million, and the governor's office has pledged to fill any budget gaps that
exist to ensure the success of the event, said John Johnson, OpSail
Connecticut's chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   "When all is said and done, I think (the state contribution) will be
somewhere between $2 million and $3 million, including the $700,000 we already
have," said Johnson, who also is chairman of the state Republican Party's
finance committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired Maj. Gen. David W. Gay, the former head of the state's Army National
Guard, will become president of OpSail and direct the group's day-to-day
operations, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcements were made after a meeting Thursday in the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson will remain as chairman, while Rowland's co-chiefs of staff, Peter
W. Ellef and Sidney J. Holbrook, will monitor OpSail from the governor's office,
said Dean Pagani, the governor's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   "General Gay oversaw the state's preparations for Y2K for Gov. Rowland,"
Pagani said. "He's a very good hands-on manager, especially when there's a
special project that has a defined role and limited amount of time. And the
governor has a very high level of confidence in his ability to make sure this
thing comes off without a hitch."
</P>
<P>
	   Pagani said there have been concerns, especially with OpSail's fund-raising
among corporate sponsors. He said Gay also will look into the possibility that
OpSail's administrative expenses have been excessive.
</P>
<P>
	   To date, cash donations to the project total $165,000 - well short of a $2.1
million target.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, OpSail has hired Madison Square Garden to head-up fund-raising
efforts. MSG will receive a commission for each donation it brings in.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 30 tall ships are expected to take part in OpSail2000CT, July
12-15. It is part of Operation Sail, a national celebration of the millennium
and America's 224th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	   Operation Sail is competing for tall ships with Sail Boston 2000, which is
scheduled to take place the week of July 10.

<HEADLINE> Mica: U.S. AWOL in Drug War  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key House subcommittee chairman is accusing the Clinton
administration of sabotaging the war on drugs by sharply reducing the Pentagon's
ability to interdict U.S.-bound shipments.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., based his allegation on a report by congressional
investigators that said the number of flight hours devoted to counterdrug
missions declined 68 percent from 1992 though 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The report by the General Accounting Office last month also said the number
of ship days involved for the same purpose fell 62 percent during that period.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This report confirms that the war on drugs did not fail, but rather was
dismantled by the Clinton administration,'' Mica told a hearing of his House
Government Reform Committee's panel on criminal justice, drug policy and human
resources on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House International Relations
Committee, said he was appalled by the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mica reacted sharply when Ana Maria Salazar, a deputy assistant secretary of
defense, said the Pentagon remains committed to the administration's counterdrug
strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find this hard to believe,'' Mica said. ``I find the war on drugs has
been sabotaged.''
</P>
<P>
	   Salazar noted there have been budget cuts for defense in the post-Cold War
era, and some had an impact on the drug war, including a $200 million cutback in
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   She also said the diversion of radar planes from counternarcotics activities
was another contributing factor. Other drug war assets were redeployed to Bosnia
and the Middle East to help meet priority military contingencies, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his opening statement, Mica said few wars in U.S. history ``have taken a
greater toll in lives or imposed greater destruction and casualties on our
society'' than the drug menace. Since 1993, he said, more than 100,000 Americans
have died in drug-related incidents, including 15,973 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Jess Ford, an analyst for the GAO -- Congress' investigative branch -- said
the Florida-based U.S. Southern Command told the GAO that the Pentagon was
unable to meet 57 percent of the command's requests for intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance flights during the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said the Southern Command believes that the lack of assets hurt its
ability to respond quickly to changing drug-trafficking patterns.

<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Tennessee Titans owner Bud Adams is sharing the joy of his
first Super Bowl by bringing 40 teen-agers from Nashville for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The teen-agers were picked from six United Way agencies for the trip of a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
	   They were scheduled to leave Tennessee today by bus and stay at the Titans'
hotel in Atlanta. Adams said he has tickets waiting for them on the 50-yard line
at the Georgia Dome, and they will fly back to Nashville on the team charter
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of Super Bowl tickets also have been donated to the Red Cross. A
drawing will be held and the tickets given to someone who has given blood in

home that she is picking St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm for the Rams because I once had a boyfriend who played for the Rams --
Glenn Davis -- one of the greats who was an All-American when he played at West
Point. But then he had to leave for the war, which delighted my mother because
he was in Korea and I was in L.A. -- the idea of a perfect romance for her
daughter! So I hope the Rams win up and down!"
</P>
<P>
	   Kirk Douglas is also a Rams fan despite the team's defection from Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always bet on the Rams," Douglas said, "because I think they're still in
Los Angeles. They win by three points."
</P>
<P>
	   TV producer Aaron Spelling is also a Rams man, predicting a 24-10 win over
the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the Rams don't win, I'll have to hock my wife's jewelry," Spelling said.

	   SKIPPING OUT: Rams kick returner Tony Horne could be fined by the NFL for
leaving a mandatory team press conference on Wednesday.

was a media day, but nobody really said it was mandatory, that I would get
fined. It was a Super Bowl rookie type of mistake. I came back down for the last
10 minutes."

	   SUPER BET: In what has become a yearly tradition, the governors of the two
states involved in the Super Bowl made a friendly wager over the outcome of
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
	   Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan is betting Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist a case of
St. Louis' celebrated toasted ravioli that the Rams beat the Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   Sundquist wagered a basket of Tennessee food products, including succulent
Tennessee ham.
</P>
<P>
	   There's also a side bet to please animal lovers: St. Louis-based Ralston
Purina Co. agreed to donate 1,000 pounds of animal food to the Humane Society of
the winning governor's choice.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a pretty fair proposition," Carnahan said. "I will be happy
to taste test the Tennessee ham to see whether it matches up to our Missouri
hams."
</P>
<P>
	   Sundquist said he loves Italian food, "and I look forward to receiving the
ravioli from Gov. Carnahan after the Titans' big win in the Super Bowl."
</P>
<P>
	   Toasted ravioli is a crunchy specialty that originated on The Hill, St.
Louis' Italian neighborhood. In 1947, a cook at Angelo's Restaurant accidentally
dropped ravioli -- which is usually boiled -- into a deep fryer.

</P>
<P>
	   "To the people of St. Louis, I just want to ask them, are they still mad at
me? They hated me at first. They cussed me out for two weeks. But I haven't
heard anything now. I should be the most famous man in St. Louis now, besides
Kurt Warner. He should be sending me part of his signing bonus. He's gone from
making $5 bagging groceries to being a $5 million quarterback. If that hadn't
happened, then he probably never would have gotten an opportunity."'

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Too small? London Fletcher figured he wasn't small enough.
</P>
<P>
	   While everyone else fudges on their exact height and weight, the St. Louis
Rams linebacker wanted everyone to know exactly how tall -- or short -- he
really was. So, his height on the official roster was downsized from 6-foot to
5-10.
</P>
<P>
	   And, to be perfectly honest, he's not that tall. Fletcher conceded Thursday
that he's probably a bit under 5-10, and he doesn't mind if the world knows all
about it.

they can succeed in life even when people say they are too small or too short."

	   Anyway, what's an inch here and there after following this path to the Super
Bowl:
</P>
<P>
	   --Growing up with tragedy, Fletcher watches his mother battle drug addition
for much of the past decade and endures the loss of a sister, who was killed in
a rape and beating 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   --After attending St. Francis (Pa.) on a basketball scholarship, the stocky
point guard hangs around less than two years before transferring to Division III
John Carroll in his hometown of Cleveland so he could be closer to family and
friends. A two-sport season is followed by a full-time switch to football and
small-college stardom.
</P>
<P>
	   --But John Carroll isn't the NFL. Overlooked in the draft, Fletcher takes a
job in corporate America, keeps himself in shape and sends out tapes to several
teams in hopes of earning a tryout.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis was one of the few teams that even noticed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I may look at a thousand of these tapes every year during the draft," said
Charley Armey, the Rams' vice president of player personnel. "I found London
Fletcher and I started researching. The first thing I thought looking at the
tape was this guy would be a great special teams player."
</P>
<P>
	   So, Armey offered a contract and hoped he had found one of those obscure
players who manages to slip onto the 53-man roster. Fletcher had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will be back next year as your starting middle linebacker," he told
Armey.
</P>
<P>
	   Fletcher was true to his word in training camp this season, winning a
three-way battle with Charlie Clemons and Lorenzo Styles, then proceeded to show
that size isn't everything.
</P>
<P>
	   "London set the tone for our defense," teammate Mike Jones said. "He's so
fiery and mad all the time, no matter if we're down by two or up by 30."
</P>
<P>
	   Barely visible over the top of an offensive line, the 241-pound Fletcher
ranged all over the field during the Rams' improbable run to the NFC
championship. He led the team with 138 tackles, 22 more than anyone else. He had
three sacks and pressured the quarterback eight more times. For good measure, he
forced a fumble and broke up five passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Fletcher's teammates are keenly aware of the hurdles he overcame to start in
Sunday's Super Bowl against the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   "London has been a tremendous inspiration," defensive tackle D'Marco Farr
said. "He hits and he talks with the best of them, too. Whenever we need a lift
or something to make you laugh, he is there. He is our quarterback on defense."
</P>
<P>
	   Fletcher chatters constantly on the field, rises from each tackle like he's
saved the season and clearly relishes the spotlight, as evidenced by his
bare-chested, biceps-flexing photo in Sports Illustrated's NFL preview issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought I was crazy and a lunatic in the huddle," Farr said. "But London
tells me to shut up because I'm interfering with his monologue."
</P>
<P>
	   Fletcher knew he has something to prove from his very first day with the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   "They saw this short guy walk into the locker room and probably thought I
was a running back," he recalled. "When they saw me at middle linebacker, I'm
sure they didn't take me too seriously. But once the ball was snapped, it didn't
take them long to realize I was here, and here to stay."
</P>
<P>
	   At just his second practice, Fletcher scuffled with a teammate who tried to
take advantage of the rookie. Before long, everyone realized this was someone
not to be annoyed.
</P>
<P>
	   "He plays like there's a chip on his shoulder," said defensive end Kevin
Carter, who led the NFL in sacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Off the field, Fletcher presents a gentler facade. He graduated from John
Carroll with a degree in sociology and enjoys talking with kids about the trials
and tribulations that never held him back.
</P>
<P>
	   "I figured that God wouldn't give me more than I could handle," he said.
"Besides, football isn't a life or death thing for me. Even if I couldn't play
football, I know I would be a success in life."

<HEADLINE> US To Continue Arms Sales to Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pentagon officials told a visiting Chinese military
delegation this week that U.S. sales of defensive arms to Taiwan will continue,
and that the reason Taiwan wants to acquire American anti-missile defenses is to
counter a recent buildup of Chinese missiles within range of the island.
</P>
<P>
	   This was one of several contentious issues raised during two days of talks
at the Pentagon -- the first high-level Chinese military contacts with the
United States since the mistaken U.S. bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade
last May.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter Slocombe, the undersecretary of defense for policy, headed the U.S.
side in the talks. He told reporters Thursday that the Clinton administration
has made no decisions on selling missile defenses to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we also made clear that one of the reasons why this is an issue is the
buildup of Chinese missile capability, and that since we're talking about what
is a sufficient defense capability, obviously the level of Chinese deployments
is a relevant factor,'' Slocombe said. He said he made clear to the Chinese
officials that ``we will continue our sale of defensive arms to Taiwan,''
although he would not discuss specific sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwan and communist China split amid civil war 50 years ago. The Taiwanese
government says it is willing to unify when China is more democratic and
economically developed. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and says it
must eventually return.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen said this week's talks produced agreement to
resume normal U.S.-China military ties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we are on track to getting military-to-military relations back at
a normal state of affairs,'' Cohen told reporters during a photo-taking session
in his office with British Defense Minister Geoffrey Hoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he had a ``very cordial'' meeting Wednesday with People's
Liberation Army Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, and that the Chinese officer extended
an invitation for Cohen to go to Beijing. Cohen had to cancel a visit last year
after the outbreak of NATO's air war against Yugoslavia. He last visited China
in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was, in fact, invited to return to China,'' Cohen said. ``I indicated
that I would do so at a mutually convenient time.'' He was not more specific,
but aides have said they believe Cohen might go to China this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   A Cohen trip would be preceded by a visit to Beijing by Adm. Dennis Blair,
commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command. Officials said it was likely
Blair would make the trip in the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
	   Slocombe said the talks, totaling 12 hours Tuesday and Wednesday, changed
neither side's views on topics of disagreement, such as Taiwan and the
Pentagon's effort to build a nationwide defense against long-range missile
attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were clear statements of strongly different views on a number of
subjects,'' Slocombe said, adding that there also were areas of agreement, such
as the need to prevent North Korea from building nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
	   A former head of military intelligence, Xiong is deputy chief of the general
staff of the People's Liberation Army. He is one of China's most politically
influential generals and is known for hard-line views on the United States. He
is a member of the ruling Communist Party's committee that sets policy toward
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   China agreed to send Xiong to Washington after the Clinton administration
said in mid-December it would seek $28 million from Congress for the extensive
bomb damage to China's embassy in Belgrade. China agreed to pay $2.87 million
for damage done in reprisal attacks on the U.S. Embassy and consular offices in
China.

<HEADLINE> Safety a Whirling Dervish for Titans  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Blaine Bishop is the Tennessee Titans' own Tasmanian devil.
</P>
<P>
	   The strong safety flies around the field -- stopping runners at the line of
scrimmage, zipping from side to side covering receivers or slashing into the
backfield for a sack.
</P>
<P>
	   Rookie Jevon Kearse got most of the publicity this season, but Bishop has
held the Titans' defense together in this Super Bowl season. And he does
everything at 110 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's ferocious," tackle Jason Fisk said. "He's got it on all the time. It's
something in his personality. When he gets out there on the football field,
don't make him mad. He'll go crazy."
</P>
<P>
	   Rams running back Marshall Faulk, the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year,
said a runner always must be on the lookout for the bow-legged Bishop.
</P>
<P>
	   "Blaine's a crafty safety. He loves getting big shots on you, and he's a guy
who's smart. He'll get the sure tackle. You have to be careful when playing
Blaine Bishop," Faulk said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not bad for a guy no one wanted when he came out of high school, who had to
walk on at Ball State and then waited until the eighth round of the NFL draft in
1993 before hearing his telephone ring.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's probably my favorite guy I've ever coached," Titans defensive
coordinator Gregg Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   "People tell you all the things he can't do. He can't backpedal. He can't
turn his hips, but he really gets after it. When I first saw him, I wanted to
know those same things. But my opinion changed completely when we put him in a
helmet and pads."
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop now has the respect of the NFL. He has been to the Pro Bowl three
times, and the Titans designated him their franchise player just before they
left Houston for Tennessee in 1997. They re-signed him for six years and $18
million.
</P>
<P>
	   But he still sees himself as a scrawny player trying to convince coaches
that yes, he can play football.
</P>
<P>
	   "They think I'm crazy. I feel like not only myself, but the team, doesn't
get a lot of respect," Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
	   His teammates see Bishop as a defensive coordinator on the field and a
tireless defender who has led the team in tackles three of the last five
seasons. He's best when telling people what he thinks.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's not a guy who's worried about your feelings," free safety Anthony
Dorsett said. "If he doesn't think you're going to get the job done, he will let
you know."
</P>
<P>
	   Linebacker Joe Bowden has never seen someone as intense as Bishop.
</P>
<P>
	   "He'll get in your face, slap you around, cuss and talk crazy," Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
	   It's easy to be intense when no one ever gave you a chance to do what you
love. Growing up in Indiana, Bishop dreamed of playing for the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame or the blue and maize of Michigan. Neither school called. Actually,
nobody offered the 5-foot-9, 203-pound Bishop a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
	   "Always the tweener: A step too slow to play corner and too short to play
safety," Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
	   He worked his way into college by heading first to St. Joseph's in
Rensselaer, Ind., for a year. Then he walked on at Ball State, where he was a
team captain by the time he graduated.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop thought he got the attention of NFL scouts at the Blue-Gray game. A
bruised shoulder limited his play at the Senior Bowl, though, and he went
through nearly two days of the draft without hearing his name called.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sixth round passed and I turned it off and started doing my term
paper," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The then-Oilers finally called in the eighth round, and they chose Bishop
with the 214th pick overall -- perhaps their best draft find in a decade when
they got players like left tackle Brad Hopkins, quarterback Steve McNair,
running back Eddie George and Kearse with No. 1 picks.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop has been a big key to the Titans' playoff run. He credits Pittsburgh
lineman Shar Pourdanesh with helping him crank up his intensity for the
playoffs. Pourdanesh poked him in the eye in the Titans' regular-season finale,
and Bishop said he realized then he would have to play even harder.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't realize that I could take it up even higher. From that point on,
I've been playing with a lot of intensity," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taz himself would be proud.

<HEADLINE> Statistics Don't Tell Bruce's Story  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- It's not likely Dick Vermeil will ever shed a tear for Isaac
Bruce.
</P>
<P>
	   But the St. Louis Rams' often-emotional coach realizes he doesn't have to be
on great terms with a player to recognize the greatness in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil's "so-called superstar" barb directed at Bruce three years ago has
kept the relationship on a polite level, even though Bruce said he long ago put
aside the slight. Vermeil had been responding to Bruce's criticism of teammates,
accusing them of quitting after a game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never had any hard feelings toward coach Vermeil and the things that
happened a couple years ago," Bruce said. "I immediately crushed them."
</P>
<P>
	   It was telling, though, when Vermeil, who cried when he cut backup tight end
Aaron Laing in 1998 training camp, had a more or less matter-of-fact tone when
discussing Bruce's automobile accident in December. Bruce rolled his Mercedes
twice after blowing a tire, and wasn't wearing a seat belt, yet walked away
without a scratch.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fortunately he's OK," Vermeil said then. "He's bumped and bruised and
ruined a nice car."
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bruce has consistently hesitated to give Vermeil the lion's
share of the credit for the Rams' startling turnaround.
</P>
<P>
	   None of which has affected Bruce's performance on the field. He's had better
years, statistically speaking, such as 1995, when he caught 119 passes, second
highest in NFL history. His 77-catch output this year is third-best in his
career, also trailing his 84-reception season in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Super Bowl season may represent the pinnacle for Bruce, even though
he spent so much time watching from the bench. Unlike the previous two years,
when Bruce was dogged by hamstring problems and missed a total of 15 games, the
problem this season was that the Rams were simply too good.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis' average winning margin of 18 points meant that to see perhaps the
NFL's most elusive receiver, famous for his on-a-dime cutbacks, you had to get
to the stadium early. His numbers were down a bit mostly because he played in
the fourth quarter only six times.
</P>
<P>
	   "His numbers would have been astronomical had we been in situations where we
were going into the two-minute offense to win the game," receivers coach Al
Saunders said. "This may have been his best year, although the numbers don't
speak to that."
</P>
<P>
	   Quarterback Kurt Warner isn't bashful about sharing the glory from his
41-touchdown pass, MVP season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've often said that I think Isaac is the best receiver out there, or at
least the best receiver that I've ever played with," Warner said. "You can't say
enough about what he can do."
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bruce again showed he doesn't matter who he works with. Five
quarterbacks have thrown him the ball since the Rams' move to St. Louis in 1995,
and he and Warner established a bond on the basis of one preseason game after
Trent Green's knee injury.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had to do it quick," Bruce said. "He didn't get many reps in training
camp. But I've had a lot of quarterbacks since I've been here and I think I can
play with a lot of people."
</P>
<P>
	   After a quiet outing in the NFC championship game against Tampa Bay, Bruce
is looking forward to more action. He caught only three passes for 22 yards
against the Buccaneers' zone, which double-teamed him all day, and the Titans
likely will play man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
	   Titans cornerback Denard Walker is looking forward to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a guy who does like to talk a lot of noise and likes to get in your
head," Walker said. "We can't bow down to playing Isaac Bruce's game. If we get
down to playing his game, I think he's going to light us up."

<HEADLINE> Fire Hazards Said at Capitol Dome  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under the picturesque Capitol dome, fire hazards are so
serious they violate federal law and are ``a potential threat to human life,''
congressional investigators have concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   The congressional Office of Compliance on Thursday cited a lack of fire
barriers, inadequate exit signs and exit capacity, deficient emergency lighting,
limited sprinkler coverage and dangerous storage of flammable and toxic
materials in the Capitol and surrounding office buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although all of the buildings do not have all of these problems, there is
a regrettable consistency throughout the complex in the lack of proper testing
and maintenance of major electrical systems and of fire safety systems, such as
sprinklers, suppression systems and emergency generators,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was the latest reproach against the Architect of the Capitol, who
maintains congressional buildings and grounds. The architect's office let the
level of fire safety in the complex slip ``far below that of most other American
office buildings of similar size and age,'' the congressional inspectors found.
</P>
<P>
	   The hazards are ``not only a violation of federal law governing employee
health and safety, but also a potential threat to human life,'' the compliance
office reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Architect of the Capitol Alan M. Hantman responded to the findings by
insisting the ``U.S. Capitol and its associated buildings are a safe work
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is true that life safety systems need improvement. But Capitol Hill is
a safer place today that it was three years ago. It will be safer still in each
successive year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hantman said improvements ``cannot be accomplished overnight'' because of
many factors, ``including inconveniencing congressional operations and
appropriateness for these national treasures.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Office of Compliance enforces the Congressional Accountability Act,
which forces Congress to obey many of the health and safety laws enforced
elsewhere in the country. The office has issued numerous health and safety
citations to the architect.
</P>
<P>
	   In December 1998, the House inspector general reported the Capitol and five
House office buildings were firetraps that left visitors, members of Congress
and employees with an ``undue risk of loss of life and property.''
</P>
<P>
	   The safety report released Thursday found that fire barriers ``to prevent
the spread of fire, smoke and toxic gases were either totally absent or
inadequate'' in Capitol buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   This danger is ``most severe'' in the main Capitol building and the three
oldest congressional office buildings, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of these four buildings has a single exit stairwell that would be
effectively protected against smoke or toxic gases in the event of fire,'' the
inspectors reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Capitol and other office buildings all have sprinklers ``in only very
limited areas,'' the study found.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem was compounded by installation of Omega sprinkler heads. Some
14,000 of the 30,000 installed were found to be defective, although the
manufacturer is replacing them under a settlement with the Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The architect was ``totally lacking or deficient'' in conducting any
maintenance and testing program of the sprinklers, inspectors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said that in the Rayburn House Office Building, built in the
early 1960s, ``none of the eight stairwells ... have doors designed to withstand
the spread of smoke and fire.''
</P>
<P>
	   A number of exits involve revolving doors which ``can impede quick exit,''
they noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit signs are not visible in many locations, the compliance office found,
and some directed people ``away from the nearest exit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report also found that compressed gas cylinders were improperly stored
in poorly ventilated basement areas in three buildings. While the cylinders were
removed, the report noted that citations were previously issued to the architect
for similar violations.

<HEADLINE> Wintry Weather Plagues Atlanta  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Good thing the Tennessee Titans played their way into the
Super Bowl. It doesn't look they'll be playing host to the big game any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Wintry weather has plagued Atlanta, which endured frigid temperatures and
braced today for an approaching storm that threatened to dump up to three inches
of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he didn't think the prospect of
shivering fans trekking through a snowbound city would damage Atlanta's chances
of landing another Super Bowl. After all, Sunday's game between the Titans and
St. Louis Rams will be played in the comfy Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   "We always understood this game was part Southern, part Northern," he said
Thursday. "The key thing is the quality of the stadium and having a domed
stadium."
</P>
<P>
	   In the NFL's version of Geography 101, Deep South Atlanta has the potential
to become a Northern city in late January. Ditto for Nashville and Charlotte,
two other cities that have considered bidding for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Titans and Carolina Panthers play in stadiums that have opened
since 1996, but neither has a roof.
</P>
<P>
	   "This week could have an impact on some Northern cities that were hoping to
get the game in an open-air stadium," Tagliabue said. "This shows us that winter
is still winter in the United States."
</P>
<P>
	   Other cities that might be affected: Baltimore and Washington, which have
built open-air stadiums in the last two years; Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, both
constructing facilities without a roof; and Philadelphia, where the Eagles are
seeking a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with a covered stadium, the problems of taking the game to a
cold-weather city were magnified by the unseasonable spell in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know a lot of fans who worried about the weather and how they're going to
get here," Titans owner Bud Adams said. "It's a big factor."
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL scrambled to plan for the worst-case scenario, knowing that Hotlanta
is hardly equipped to cope with severe winter weather. Forecasters provided a
bit of good news, projecting less snow and ice for the Atlanta area by
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the league was concerned that icy roads would prevent local workers
from reaching hotels, restaurants and other businesses catering to Super Bowl
visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know a couple of inches here can totally shut things down," said Jim
Steeg, the league vice president of special events.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service said 1-3 inches of snow was expected today,
with a chance of sleet and freezing rain Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the winter storm even arrived, it started having an impact on the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta Air Lines, a primary passenger carrier into and out of Atlanta, has
already started cancelling and delaying inbound flights.
</P>
<P>
	   With the expected bad weather in mind, the Titans and Rams were given
permission to move their final two days of workouts to the Georgia Dome. They
held their first practices outside Wednesday in bitterly cold temperatures, but
were more comfortable Thursday as the mercury climbed from 19 to 43 degrees and
the wind settled down.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, extra generators were in place to keep power running at the Dome.
Some hotels set aside rooms to house their own employees in case roads became
impassable. The teams were advised to anticipate delays in their travel
itineraries.
</P>
<P>
	   After Wednesday's workout, several Rams complained that it was virtually
impossible to concentrate in the frosty conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's tough when you're trying to practice for the biggest game of the year
and you have to go out in that kind of weather," Rams safety Keith Lyle said.
"You're freezing. No one wants to catch the ball. No one wants to bump into each
other."
</P>
<P>
	   The Dome was not available to the teams Wednesday and Thursday; it was being
used for pregame and halftime show rehearsals, as well as other game
preparations. But the NFL altered its scheduled today, cutting short another
rehearsal so the Titans and Rams could use the stadium for 1 1/2-hour practices
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL addressed another weather-related problem: the giant, outdoor tent
that was used for news conferences at Tennessee's team hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Titans met with the media Wednesday morning, it was not much warmer
in the tent than the 26-degree temperatures on the outside. But 16 additional
heaters were brought in Thursday, bringing the inside temperature to a downright

<HEADLINE> House Contest Couple To Sell Home  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- For sale by owner: Beautiful country home. Three
bedroom, two bath and high ceilings. Set amid 25 acres of secluded lakes and
hills in the Ozarks. Broken dreams not included.
</P>
<P>
	   For nearly a year, Arlyne and Darrell Barnes tried to give their dream
retirement home away in a contest. Anyone interested was to send $100 and an
essay on why they wanted the home.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple hoped to raise enough money to pay off their mortgage and set
some money aside to pay for a private investigation into their son's unsolved
death.
</P>
<P>
	   But too few people entered the contest. Now, with bills from lawyers and
private investigators piling up, the couple has dropped the contest and put the
house up for sale.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's really a shame,'' Mrs. Barnes said Thursday. ``But the fact that we
made so many new friends and received so many prayers made it all worth the
effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   The house is being listed as $159,900, well below its appraised price of
$200,000. ``We have so many bills and loans, we are going to lose it if we don't
sell it,'' Mrs. Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 613 people entered the contest. Their money has been refunded.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple had hoped to raise at least $50,000 to pay for a private
investigation into the death of Mitchell Krupp, Mrs. Barnes' 29-year-old son
from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   Krupp's home near Brentwood, Ark., burned in July 1997, in a blaze
authorities say was deliberately set. Investigators found Krupp's remains
between the springs of his bed mattress, along with the remains of a shotgun. A
lead shot was found in his skull.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said the fire destroyed so much evidence they may never learn
how he died. The case remains open.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Barnes says she believes her son was murdered and his death made to
look like a suicide. She has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Krupp's wife
of six years, Pam Worrell. Both Mrs. Barnes and her lawyer, Charles Kester,
declined comment on the pending lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Having exhausted their life savings on investigators and lawyers, the couple
needed money. The contest idea was inspired by ``The Spitfire Grill,'' a 1996
movie in which an elderly woman makes her restaurant the prize in a similar
giveaway.
</P>
<P>
	   They had built the home nine years ago as a place to retire. With a view of
a private, trout-stocked lake, a separate workshop, an indoor pool, cathedral
ceilings and a wraparound porch, it seemed a sure bet that people would bid $100
for a chance.
</P>
<P>
	   They announced the contest last February with a deadline of June 15. With
entries lagging, they extended the deadline to September 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, having fallen short of their goal of 1,800 entries, Mrs. Barnes said
she doesn't know what's next for her and her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been 2 1/2 years since my son died,'' she said. ``We never planned on
any of this.''
</P>
<P>
	   A nonprofit group called VOICES of Victims has shown interest in turning the
property into its national headquarters and a retreat for grieving families of
murdered children. But the organization doesn't have a lot of money, and Mrs.
Barnes says she can't wait for members to raise it.
</P>
<P>
	   Wanting to create something positive from the contest, Mrs. Barnes said she
may compile the essays she received into a book.
</P>
<P>
	   She said several people wrote of loved ones who also had died under
mysterious and unsolved circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It really opened our eyes to the number of unsolved murders there are out
there,'' she said. ``We were truly inspired to continue seeking the truth in my
son's case.''

<HEADLINE> Chase Privacy Pact May Prompt Trend  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp.'s decision to ask account holders
before selling their names to outside marketers may prompt other banks to offer
similar privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Chase can do it, that means other banks can do it," Frank Torres,
legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said about the new settlement agreement
between Chase and New York state's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   But most big banks aren't ready to do that and states ultimately might
compel them to tighten their privacy practices, Torres said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, financial institutions are concerned about recent privacy
enforcement actions against banks by several states as well as an initiative by
some states to enact new privacy laws that are stricter than federal
requirements Congress established in November.
</P>
<P>
	   "The states are fully engaged," said John Byrne, senior counsel for the
American Bankers Association. Banks around the country are "taking stock of
their privacy procedures," he said. "Some banks will decide on their own to go
beyond the mandated procedures ... if that's what their customers want to see."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, Chase must have written consent from account holders
before it can sell or share their data with outside marketers.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the settlement accord announced Tuesday by Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer in Albany, N.Y., Chase agreed to stop providing outside marketers with
the credit line and balance information of customers. As many as 22 million
consumers had been affected. Chase, the nation's third-largest bank holding
company, has some $370 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
	   The case "really demonstrates the need for legislation that protects
consumers from having their personal, sensitive financial information
distributed outside of the bank," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of
the American Civil Liberties Union. "I hope other banks follow (Chase) but I'm
not optimistic."
</P>
<P>
	   New York City-based Chase agreed not to share any customer data with outside
marketers, such as telemarketers, without customers' express written consent.
Even in cases where customers do give their permission, Chase agreed to provide
only their names, addresses and telephone numbers to the marketing firms, but
not any financial data.
</P>
<P>
	   This is stricter than the privacy provision in the new federal law, which
allows banks and other financial institutions to share customers' data with
outside firms unless customers expressly ask them not to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   The financial services industry had opposed even this more lenient
requirement. It won the right in the legislation for banks, securities firms and
insurance companies that are affiliated under the same corporate roof to share
customers' data. Customers are unable to stop such sharing by affiliated
financial companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The case involving Chase arose from an investigation by Spitzer's office
into allegations that the bank had provided customer information to marketers in
violation of its own privacy policy as disclosed to consumers. The data it
shared was said to have included encrypted account numbers and loan data.
</P>
<P>
	   The marketing firms used the information to phone Chase customers to try
selling them emergency road service plans, discount shopping clubs, legal
services, travel clubs, garden supplies and magazine subscriptions. Chase
received a commission on successful sales.
</P>
<P>
	   While it agreed to the settlement, Chase denied any wrongdoing. State
officials said they hadn't accused the bank of anything illegal, but they
promised to pursue similar enforcement actions against other financial
companies.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Reagan Great Communicators  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three-fourths of Americans see President Clinton as a
skillful communicator, the same percentage who felt that way about President
Reagan during his last year in office, a new poll says.
</P>
<P>
	   But while they think Clinton's ability to get his message across equals that
of the former Republican president, who was often called ``the great
communicator,'' they gave Reagan higher marks on leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABC News poll said just over half consider Clinton a good or excellent
leader, compared with two-thirds of Americans in 1988 who said Reagan was a good
or excellent leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABC poll of 515 adults taken Jan. 26 had an error margin of plus or
minus 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On ratings of his accomplishments, Clinton's ability to communicate and
his judgment as president, Clinton in the year 2000 is rated very similarly to
Reagan in 1988,'' said ABC pollster Gary Langer, noting that both were rated
good or excellent in their judgment by fewer than half. ``Reagan scored better
on another attribute, leadership.''
</P>
<P>
	   People were divided on whether Clinton would be remembered as an
above-average president or below average, with just over a third choosing each.
But two-thirds of Americans in 1988 thought Reagan would go down in history as
an above-average president.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton fared better than Reagan on public judgment of his handling of two
key areas, the economy and the federal deficit. Clinton was judged as excellent
or good on the economy by 68 percent, compared with 49 percent for Reagan. And
Clinton got a good or excellent mark on handling the federal deficit from 55
percent, compared with 16 percent for Reagan.
</P>
<P>
	   When people were asked whether they would be happy to see Clinton go when
his term is up in a year, more than half said they will be glad to see him go.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Demand Return of Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Cubans -- joined by visiting U.S.
college baseball players -- marched by torchlight through the streets of Havana
early today to commemorate an independence hero and demand the return of
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   A dramatic sea of flickering lights flooded down the broad steps of the
University of Havana at midnight as a predominantly student crowd marched
several blocks to a monument for Jose Marti. The crowd occasionally broke into
chants of ``Fidel! Fidel!'' for Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We continue in open, frontal combat for our (Elian), kidnapped in the
claws of the mafia of Miami,'' said speaker Julio Martinez, a senior official of
the Union of Communist Youth, to a tightly packed crowd waving Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Return Elian to the fatherland! Socialism or death! Fatherland or death!
We will triumph!'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   The march was held to mark the 147th anniversary of the birth of Marti, a
poet and leader of Cuba's struggle for independence from Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has staged events almost nightly for two months to demand the
return of Elian, who was rescued Nov. 25 while clinging to an innertube off the
coast of Florida after a shipwreck that killed his mother and 10 other people.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's great-uncle in the United States, backed by the anti-Castro Cuban
American National Foundation, is fighting in the courts to keep the child from
being returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Marching near the front ranks of the midnight parade were baseball players
from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn., who on Wednesday played a
game against the University of Havana and are visiting educational and cultural
sites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We decided as a team we would participate in this, just as a sign of
friendship,'' said Jake Mauer, 21, of St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   The visit to an island off-limits to most Americans seemed to have impressed
the players, who said they had been received warmly by Cubans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought they were a lot of repressed people and didn't care for Fidel,
but it's totally the opposite,'' said Joseph Larson, 21, of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   The university's president, Rev. Dennis Dease, said he hoped that the game
and other educational exchanges with the University of Havana ``will make a
small contribution to normalizing relations between our two countries.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for Elian, ``I hope that that little boy comes home here. This is where
he belongs,'' Dease said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Cuban officials and Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez expressed
anger at the treatment Elian's grandmothers received in a meeting with the boy
in Miami on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I felt very indignant,'' Gonzalez told reporters in Havana. ``They just
ruined everything.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez complained because the grandmothers' cellular phones were
confiscated, he had been unable to speak with his son during the meeting. During
all previous conversations with the boy since Elian was rescued, members of the
family fighting Gonzalez for custody have been present.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Fidel Castro's top
man for Cuba-U.S. relations, complained that anti-communist protests held near
the meeting place intruded on the meeting and said the Miami relatives and their
backers were given special privileges.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon accused the Miami relatives of breaking an agreement not to make
contact with the grandmothers during the meeting. Not only did Elian's second
cousin turn the boy over to the grandmothers, she also listened at the door and
recounted what happened later, Alarcon said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also complained that the meeting, which was supposed to last two to three
hours, was prematurely cut short by organizers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like some people visiting a person in jail,'' Alarcon charged.

<HEADLINE> Prominent fertility doctor goes on trial for insurance fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A prosecutor says a prominent doctor lied to insurance
companies to force them to pay for infertility treatments, but his lawyer
describes his client as the victim.
<P>
	   "There was no fraud, you will see," defense attorney Theodore D. Wells said
Thursday during opening statements in the case against Dr. Niels Lauersen.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and Dr. Magda Binion, an
anesthesiologist, are being tried on charges of conspiracy, health care fraud
and mail fraud in connection with an alleged 10-year scheme to falsely bill
fertility surgeries that were not covered by insurance as gynecological
surgeries which were.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Chung told jurors Lauersen was a thief as
she outlined her case in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ripping somebody off. That's what the evidence is going to show these
doctors did. They stole millions of dollars by telling lies year after year
after year," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells portrayed his 63-year-old client as a hero to patients struggling to
have a child.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged Lauersen often didn't bill insurance companies for
laboratory work that matched sperm and eggs before inserting the combination
into women.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said the doctor was nearly always able to bill the insurance company
accurately for treatment of the underlying physical problems preventing
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is going to be an exciting case," Wells said. "It's a real case. It's
about my client's life."
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of prosecutors crowded the courtroom along with supporters of
Lauersen, including women he had treated.
</P>
<P>
	   As Wells finished, some supporters applauded, prompting Judge William H.
Pauley to admonish: "This is not a theater. This is not a sports arena. There
will be no applause."
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen, the author of "It's Your Body," has appeared frequently on
television and in publications as an expert on fertility matters, which make up
about 10 percent of his practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Chung said the conspiracy started in 1987 as Lauersen falsely charged
insurance companies $7,500 at least 500 times, collecting at least $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "He decided he was going to lie and defraud and cheat the insurance
companies," Chung said. "For every patient he had - rich, poor or somewhere in
between - this is what he did."
</P>
<P>
	   She said he alleged on forms that women were bleeding or in pain, requiring
surgical procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no bleeding. There was no pain. There was no problem. The women
were there because they were trying to have a baby," Chung said.
</P>
<P>
	   The scheme was unearthed by suspicious insurance companies, one of which
checked their files over a seven-year period and found Lauersen led every doctor
in the country in almost every category for which he submitted claims, the
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said former patients would testify, along with a doctor who formerly
worked with Lauersen.
</P>
<P>
	   Chung warned the jury to forget the infertility debate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The case is not about whether fertility procedures are a good or a bad
thing," she said. "They bring joy to a lot of people."
</P>
<P>
	   Wells said prosecutors were relying on "false accusations and distortions of
the truth."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the doctor who will testify against his client was a former drug
addict who stole drugs from Lauersen for his personal use.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyer said his client also was sloppy with paperwork because he was
overworked.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had to use some standard forms and some of his paperwork is screwed up.
But that does not make him a criminal," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeatedly, Wells told the jury his client was dealing with "big" insurance
companies as he treated a mix of patients so diverse in income and background
that it could rival the United Nations in makeup.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that his client was outspoken about the failure of insurance
companies to treat women equally.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic, GTE Seek Merger OK  </HEADLINE>
    By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp. are taking steps to convince
regulators that their proposed merger would benefit consumers and comply with
federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies tried to address the thorniest issues associated with the
deal, which would create the nation's largest local phone company, in a filing
Thursday with the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   To complete the merger, originally valued at $52 billion, the companies
formally proposed spinning off GTE's Internet assets into a separate public
corporation. Those assets consist of GTE's Internet backbone of massive data
pipelines that crisscross the country carrying computer traffic. For regulatory
purposes, this constitutes long-distance service, which Bell companies are not
allowed to offer within their local calling boundaries without receiving FCC
approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic in December secured FCC permission to offer long-distance in
New York state only, but it could take years before it gets the ability to
provide long-distance throughout its local calling region of 13 states and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, GTE's Internet assets would be transferred into a new
public corporation that would be 90 percent owned and controlled by public
shareholders. The merged Bell AtlanticGTE would have a 10 percent voting and
economic interest in the company, but with an option of increasing its ownership
to 80 percent within five years from the closing of the merger. That gives the
companies time to win needed regulatory approval to own the Internet backbone.
</P>
<P>
	   GTE also would stop providing regular long-distance calling service in
states that are within the Bell Atlantic region -- aside from New York -- as
required by law.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a cue from the long list of conditions that SBC and Ameritech agreed
to when those two companies combined in the fall, Bell Atlantic and GTE made
commitments to extend their reach outside of the calling area they now serve.
</P>
<P>
	   The businesses said they would spend $500 million within three years of
closing the merger to compete with local companies in regions beyond their
current territory, providing rival telephone services or Internet connections to
customers in other Bell regions.
</P>
<P>
	   They also pledged to establish a separate affiliate for providing Internet
services; roll out data connections to rural and low-income areas; and set up
enforcement plans to make sure they follow through on merger commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the plan laid out by the companies could go a long way in
persuading regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will resolve the last major hurdle," said Rex G. Mitchell, an analyst
with Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. He said the FCC may be open to
the Internet spin-off plan -- and the possibility of the two companies regaining
a majority share of those assets in five years -- because that market is
currently dominated by the three long-distance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department already has approved Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE
as well as its wireless partnership with Vodafone AirTouch. The companies hope
to close the deal in the first or second quarter of this year.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Go ahead Gary, make my day!
</P>
<P>
	   That could be the sentiment behind filmmaker Michael Moore's decision to
take his throng of 100 ``moshers'' to New Hampshire to challenge the
presidential candidates to ``dive in for democracy and body surf the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican candidate Alan Keyes jumped into Moore's ``mosh pit'' on the eve
of the Iowa caucuses, which irritated GOP rival Gary Bauer. Bauer said the move
was undignified, and criticized Keyes for it Wednesday night in a pre-New
Hampshire primary debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore had promised the endorsement of his political cable program, ``The
Awful Truth,'' to the first candidate to jump into the pit.
</P>
<P>
	   A mosh pit is a crowd of people, typically just in front of the stage, who
catch a performer who jumps into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore says he's willing to give the six remaining candidates -- including
Bauer -- a chance to dive in.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are willing to multiple-endorse, just like the big money people do when
they write big checks to both the Democrats and Republicans,'' he said in a
statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Plus, to be known as the only group to have endorsed Alan Keyes is
something we may never be able to live with, and we are hoping to rectify that
in New Hampshire.''

<HEADLINE> Farmers Seek Genetic Crop Controls  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- U.N. talks to establish rules for trading in genetically
modified organisms are nearing an end, according to the talks' chairman, who
said he expected a draft agreement by this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are very close,'' said Colombian environment minister Juan Mayr, who
has led this week's talks in Montreal since they began Monday. ``I hope we will
find a solution.''
</P>
<P>
	   The previous round, held in February in Cartagena, Colombia, collapsed when
the United States and five other countries refused to accept the Biosafety
Protocol -- an international agreement intended to prevent environmental damage
due to trade in genetically engineered organisms.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union and developing nations have argued that countries should
be allowed to decline imports of genetically modified goods because little is
known about their environmental effects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Modern biotechnology is very young,'' said Tewolde Egziabher, head of the
Ethiopian delegation. ``Therefore being cautious is a necessity.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the United States and its partners -- Canada, Australia, Argentina,
Chile and Uruguay -- have disagreed, saying that the proposed rules in their
current form would restrict trade. Those countries argued that any country's
refusal to import a genetically modified product should be backed by scientific
evidence in the form of a risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
	   There was also concern the agreement on genetically altered goods relate to
other agreements, particularly to those of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we agree here should not be undermined later in the context of the
World Trade Organization,'' said European Commission environment minister,
Margot Wallstrom. ``We believe it is not right and it is not fair to subordinate
this agreement to the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 70 million acres of genetically engineered crops were planted
worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, 25 percent of the corn is genetically engineered, as
are 40 percent of planted soybeans.

<HEADLINE> Patriots Name Belichick Head Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft has learned the
value of a good coach.
</P>
<P>
	   And he didn't want to let another one get away.
</P>
<P>
	   After having watched the team regress after Bill Parcells left for the New
York Jets, Kraft decided a first-round draft choice was a reasonable cost for a
coach who could reverse the Patriots' slide. So Kraft decided to pay the Jets'
price as compensation for Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
	   "Perhaps the New England Patriots -- well, maybe they'd be playing in
Atlanta today," Kraft said wistfully on Thursday when asked if he had any
regrets about his efforts to stabilize the team's coaching since Parcells left.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here's our chance to solve our problems with all positions in the
organization, someone who gives me peace of mind that he knows what he's doing,
he knows what it takes to win. And that's why we're all in this business," Kraft
said Thursday after hiring Belichick.
</P>
<P>
	   "For a No. 1 draft choice, we can bring in a man that I feel certain can do
something, rather than the uncertainty of a draft choice. And it wasn't even
close when I thought about it that way."
</P>
<P>
	   The Patriots will give New York their No. 1 draft pick this year and a
fourth- and seventh-rounder in 2001. The Jets gave the Patriots a No. 5 in 2001
and a No. 7 in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   It took 24 days for the Patriots and Jets to agree on compensation for
Belichick and a couple hours for Kraft and his would-be coach to reach an
agreement somewhere off the highway between Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal came so quickly, Kraft claimed, that there wasn't time to discuss
whether Belichick would also take over as general manager. Asked why he hasn't
made Belichick the general manager, Kraft said, "We'll think about that. Thank
you for suggesting it."
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick said he wasn't concerned about having total control of the team.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a one-man band here. I can't play all the instruments," he
said. "I don't think it's important who's right. I think it's important what's
right."
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick was 37-45 as coach of the Cleveland Browns and an assistant with
New England when the Patriots went to the 1997 Super Bowl. He went to the Jets
with Parcells when the coach had a falling out with Kraft over total control,
saying, "If they want you to cook the dinner, at least they ought to let you
shop for some of the groceries."
</P>
<P>
	   The Jets tried to make Belichick their coach and Parcells a consultant to
get around the fact that Parcells was still under contract then with New
England. When commissioner Paul Tagliabue rejected that arrangement, New York
gave New England four draft picks and made Belichick the contractually
designated heir to Parcells.
</P>
<P>
	   Parcells took the Jets to the AFC title game in just two years, spawning a
rivalry with the jilted New England fans and letting the bad feelings with Kraft
stew; the two did not speak for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of letting Parcells do the shopping, Kraft gave that authority to
Bobby Grier and hired Pete Carroll as coach. The team got worse in each of the
three seasons under that arrangement, dissolving Parcells' Super Bowl team into
a fifth-place finisher with an 8-8 record.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll was fired with two years left on his five-year contract. But before
the Patriots could get permission to talk to Belichick, Parcells resigned and
Belichick was automatically made coach.
</P>
<P>
	   A day later, Belichick quit, telling unsuspecting reporters that he had
misgivings about the job because the Jets were for sale.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, this press conference will go a little bit better than the last
one I had," Belichick joked Thursday. "Hopefully, my tenure here will be a
little bit longer."
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue and a federal judge said Belichick was stuck with the Jets,
leaving him in limbo while the Patriots decided whether he was worth a
first-round choice.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you give up a first-round draft pick, that's something you
obviously don't want to do," said quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who was among the
players who lobbied for Belichick. "But to get a coach of the caliber of Bill
Belichick, it's probably a worthwhile thing to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Parcells said his conversation with Kraft ended "the border war" and allows
both of them to look back on the team's AFC championship with something other
than bitterness.
</P>
<P>
	   "It resolves a lot of issues lingering a long time and helps Bill get back
into coaching, where he wants to be," Parcells said. "I think Bob has the coach
he wants and we were compensated pretty well."

<HEADLINE> Adviser Leaving White House for NBA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top aide to President Clinton says he's quitting the
White House staff and going to work for the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Sosnik, a veteran political operative, was senior adviser to the
president. He had the job once held by George Stephanopoulos and later Rahm
Emanuel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president did not have a closer or more trusted adviser,'' Jake
Siewert, White House deputy press secretary, said Thursday. ``Doug will be
sorely missed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sosnik, unlike his predecessors, traveled frequently with the president and
was a card-playing competitor in hearts games.
</P>
<P>
	   He will be a senior vice president for the NBA for communications and
strategy. Sosnik is the first member of Clinton's inner circle to leave this
year, the final year of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   Sosnik has talked about quitting the administration for years, as far back
as 1996 after Clinton's reelection. He is expected to leave within several
weeks.

<HEADLINE> House Kills Polygamy Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT GEHRKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah lawmakers have voted down a bill that would have
established a special prosecutor to investigate abuse and fraud in polygamous
communities.
</P>
<P>
	   The House bill, killed by a vote of 28-43 on Thursday, would have allocated
$200,000 to hire a special prosecutor to probe crimes of welfare fraud, tax
fraud, domestic abuse and sexual abuse in polygamous societies.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill's sponsor, Salt Lake City Republican Ron Bigelow, said
investigators are needed because polygamist societies are generally secretive,
making uncovering crime difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do we say, 'Because you choose this particular lifestyle and it's hard to
investigate we're simply going to ignore it? You suffer these crimes? You go
ahead and let your children be abused?''' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents argued the measure targeted an entire group of people based on
their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah was required to outlaw polygamy in its constitution as a condition of
statehood and the crime of plural marriage has only been prosecuted a handful of
times.
</P>
<P>
	   But two years ago, two prominent members of the Kingston polygamous clan
were accused of child abuse. Both men were convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   That case, along with reports of rampant welfare fraud in the polygamous
sister-cities of Colorado City and Hildale, prompted heightened scrutiny of such
abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   There are an estimated 25,000 people living in polygamy in Utah, many of
whom trace their beliefs back to fundamental Mormonism. Mainstream Mormonism has
disavowed the practice.

<HEADLINE> Dropped Cell Phone Led to Crash  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) -- An Air Force security man crashed his
patrol car into a parked $39 million jet fighter while fumbling for his cell
phone, totaling the car and damaging the plane, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nov. 5 accident caused more than $62,000 in damage to the F-15's landing
gear, according to an Air Force report released Wednesday. The report did not
say how fast the car was going.
</P>
<P>
	   The driver, Airman Raymone Sydnor, was patrolling the flight line at this
Florida Panhandle base when he dropped his personal phone and leaned down to
search for it, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sydnor suffered a concussion. He received an undisclosed punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the accident, the Air Force said, security personnel have
been ordered to get out of their cars every half-hour for a 10-minute break ``to
combat boredom and oxygenate blood flow.''

    BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- A man who demanded a casino deliver $100,000 to his
home within two hours or he would start shooting people has landed in jail,
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronald Cherry, 52, made his demand Tuesday, telling Treasure Bay Casino
employees he would start shooting people at the casino unless he got the money,
police said. He even gave them his address, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the casino's security force contacted Biloxi police, who went to
Cherry's home.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes our job extremely easy when they give their name and address,"
said Biloxi Police Capt. William Kirk. "We don't have too many man hours on this
one. Put the paperwork together and rock and roll."
</P>
<P>
	   Cherry was charged with telephone harassment and jailed on $25,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would like people to come in and play for their winnings," said Gary
Dubuisson, vice president of table games for the casino. "It's more fun that
way."

<HEADLINE> Shalikashvili To Lead Test Ban Team  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Former U.S. military chief John Shalikashvili
was appointed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright today to head a team
trying to convince skeptical senators that a worldwide ban on nuclear testing is
in the best interest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   But the administration has no plans to seek another Senate vote on the
treaty this year, its final one in office, said State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate rejected the treaty last year with arguments that safeguards
against cheating by other countries were inadequate and that the United States
had to continue testing to keep its nuclear arsenal up to date. Only 48
senators, 19 short of the 67 required, voted for the treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright was announcing the new initiative today as she arrived for the
World Economic Forum, a conference of more than 500 top corporate executives
from around the world and scores of government officials, including President
Clinton, at Davos, a plush ski resort.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said a task force led by Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, will aim ultimately for approval of the landmark arms-control
measure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think this effort is important for its own sake, to develop support for
ratification, and additionally, because it signals the world that the United
States is interested in ratifying the treaty,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shalikashvili and other top American military commanders supports the ban on
further underground nuclear weapons tests, the only kind not banned in past
treaties.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright intends to see Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat while she is in
Switzerland to try to make headway on the framework of an accord for Israel that
is due by Feb. 13.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Taiwan Resuming Flights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippines and Taiwan partially settled an
aviation dispute Friday that severed air links between them for nearly four
months, and agreed to resume flights next Monday, President Joseph Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
	   Philippine and Taiwanese officials signed a letter of understanding at the
presidential palace allowing the resumption of flight service, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very happy ending. This agreement will enhance our trade
relations with Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement was signed by Eva Estrada Kalaw, who heads Manila's de facto
embassy in Taiwan, and Chan Shien-ching, Taiwan's chief representative in
Manila, and witnessed by Estrada and Philippine Airlines majority stockholder
Lucio Tan.
</P>
<P>
	   Air links were cut in early October after the Philippines scrapped a 1996
aviation pact, accusing Taiwanese carriers China Airlines and EVA Air of
competing unfairly with ailing Philippine Airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1996 agreement allowed each country's airlines to fly a total of 9,600
passengers between Manila and Taiwan weekly. The Philippines says Taiwanese
airlines unfairly poached passengers from PAL by carrying them from the
Philippines to third countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The new agreement allows each side to fly a maximum of 4,800 passengers
between Manila and Taiwan weekly. Further negotiations will be held on whether
Taiwan will be allowed to carry passengers from the Philippines to third
countries.

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows at 5.8 Percent Rate  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew at a sizzling 5.8 percent annual
rate during the final three months of 1999, chalking up a year of remarkable
prosperity as the nation heads into its longest economic expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the nation's gross domestic product -- the total output of
goods and services -- increased by 4 percent, turning in three straight years
where growth was 4 percent or higher, the Commerce Department said today.
Strength came from hardy consumer spending. In 1998, the economy grew by 4.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter rate was stronger than the 5.1 percent rate many analysts
were forecasting. It marked the strongest growth since a 5.9 percent rate posted
in the final three months of 1998. Robust consumer spending and a buildup in
business inventories added to 1999's fourth-quarter growth, while the trade
deficit subtracted from it. In the third quarter, the economy grew by a
breakneck 5.7 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve meets next week to decide interest rate policy and most
economists expect the Fed to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point on
Feb. 2 to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, in an appearance before Congress this week,
pledged to do the best he can to keep the economic expansion going. The economy
is about to enter its 107 month of uninterrupted growth in February, surpassing
the 106-month record set in 1969.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though the Fed raised rates three times last year, the economy
continues to grow at a rapid pace that some economists fear cannot be sustained
without later triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   An inflation gauge tied to GDP rose 1.5 percent in 1999, a worse showing on
inflation than the 0.7 percent increase recorded the year before. In the fourth
quarter, the inflation measure rose 2.3 percent, up from 1.7 percent posted in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index --
considered the best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs and closely
watched by Greenspan -- rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, well above the
0.9 percent increase many analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both reports contain the smoking gun that the Fed has been worried about --
wage pressures are surfacing and inflation is on the uptick," said First Union
economist David Orr.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said the reports raise the odds that the Fed will follow up the
expect rate increase in February with another one in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Worried about the prospects of rising inflation, the bond market tumbled.
Bond prices fell as yields on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 6.60
percent from 6.52 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The booming U.S. economy has been powered by consumer spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of all economy activity.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said today that consumer spending rose at an annual rate of
5.3 percent in the fourth quarter and 5.3 percent for the year. Plentiful jobs,
low inflation and stock and bond market gains have made Americans feel wealthy
and put them in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the nation's savings rate -- savings as a percentage of
disposable income -- was pulled to a record quarterly low of 1.9 percent in the
fourth quarter from 2.1 percent in the previous quarter. For all of 1999, the
savings rate hit an all-time annual low of 2.4 percent. In 1998, the savings
rate was 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Businesses -- confident that consumers will keep spending -- increased their
stockpiles to $65.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $38 billion in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Business investment -- spending on new equipment and plants -- rose at an
annual rate of 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter, down from a 10.9 percent rate
in the third quarter. For the year, business investment increased 8.3 percent,
compared with 12.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing construction, meanwhile, fell by a 1.2 percent rate in the fourth
quarter, following a 3.8 percent rate of decline in the previous quarter,
reflecting the steady rise in mortgage rates. In 1999, housing construction rose
7.2 percent, but was down from a 9.2 percent increase the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. trade deficit continued to be a drag on the nation's economic
growth. Imports rose at a 10.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter while exports
grew by a 6.9 percent rate. For the year, imports shot up 11.8 percent and
exports rose 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade deficit subtracted 1.11 percentage points from growth in 1999, a
slight improvement from the 1.18 percentage-point reduction recorded in 1998.
The U.S. trade deficit is the one blot on an otherwise vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though overseas' demand for U.S. products is picking up, U.S.
manufacturers continue to feel the lingering effects of the global financial
crisis that struck in 1997 and severely depressed foreign demand for U.S. goods.

<HEADLINE> AHP Settles Another Fen-Phen Suit  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM KIRCHOFER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The family of a 30-year-old Massachusetts woman
whose death was blamed on the fen-phen diet drug combination settled a lawsuit
against drug maker American Home Products, the company announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Terms of the deal with relatives of Mary J. Linnen were kept secret, but the
company said much of it will be used to fund a research foundation established
by the family to aid in treating the rare lung disease that killed her, primary
pulmonary hypertension.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wall Street Journal on Friday cited unidentified sources saying the
company settled the case for about $10 million. American Home refused to confirm
or deny the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Linnen, of Quincy, Mass., had taken the diet drug combination for 24 days in
1996 in an attempt to lose weight for her wedding. She was diagnosed with the
debilitating disease that November and died the following February, after
suffering partial blindness, the state court suit said.
</P>
<P>
	   Linnen's parents, Thomas F. and Mary J. Linnen, of Palm Coast, Fla., said in
the suit that an autopsy determined their daughter died as a result of
"pulmonary hypertension associated with" the fen-phen therapy
</P>
<P>
	   After her diagnosis, "she lived each day feeling and believing that she had
been given a death sentence," the suit said.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement by the company Thursday did not address the issue of whether or
not American Home Products admitted any wrongdoing, and Wyeth spokesman Doug
Petkus refused to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products' Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division marketed the
"fen" in the drug combination, fenfluramine, which was paired with phentermine
to make "fen-phen." Wyeth-Ayerst also made a related diet drug, dexfenfluramine,
which went under the brand name Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost six million Americans took the drugs until they were banned by the
Food and Drug Administration in 1997 after reports that some users developed
serious, and sometimes fatal, heart problems. Phentermine is still on the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1999, American Home Products agreed to pay $3.75 billion to
settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems
due to fen-phen. But the settlement only applied to patients with possible heart
valve problems. It did not cover Linnen's disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has set aside approximately another $1 billion to deal with
other claims that might arise. Even though the exact terms of the Linnen
settlement weren't known, Alex Zisson, an industry analyst with Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist, said Wall Street had been given no reason to believe it jeopardized that
reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   "They haven't given out a dollar figure, but at this point they've said the
charge will be adequate," Zisson said. "Wall Street at this point just wants all
the fen-phen litigation to go away. Even if American Home has to pay a little
more than the cases deserve, Wall Street would say that's a good deal."
</P>
<P>
	   American Home, which is fighting with competitor Pfizer, over American's
planned merger with another drug maker, Warner-Lambert, saw its shares fall
$1.12 1/2 Thursday to $43.37 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The Linnens' suit was the first wrongful death case filed against American
Home Products in connection with the fen-phen drugs, said their lawyer, Alex
MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not the first death case settled.
</P>
<P>
	   In Houston last year, relatives of 35-year-old Mary Marisa Smith, who
claimed fen-phen killed her, agreed to settle for an undisclosed amount of money
three weeks into trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Settlements of suits in other states and major jury verdicts against
American Home have recently raised questions about whether enough fen-phen users
will accept the national settlement. American Home can reject the preliminary
deal if too many patients opt out of it and pursue their own lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Even at the time fen-phen was being marketed, primary pulmonary hypertension
was a recognized, although rare, side effect, Zisson said. The Linnens claimed
their daughter wasn't notified of the risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The Linnens and American Home Products settled the suit after it went to
trial. During the trial the company disputed that its drug could be conclusively
linked to her condition.

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea to Insider Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A top Wall Street executive has pleaded innocent to charges
he engaged in insider trading with an X-rated movie star with whom he was
allegedly intimately involved.
</P>
<P>
	   The plea by James McDermott Jr., the former chief executive of Keefe,
Bruyette &AMP; Woods, was entered during a brief proceeding in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan on Thursday. Kathryn Gannon, known as "Marylin Star" in the adult
film industry, remains a fugitive in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   A third defendant, Anthony P. Pomponio, also pleaded innocent Thursday.
McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, and Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J.,
have already been arrested and freed on bail. Ms. Gannon, 30, of Miami, Fla., is
believed to be in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York investment bank chief was accused of tipping Ms. Gannon about
companies on the verge of mergers that would dramatically affect their stock
prices. Ms. Gannon then allegedly bought the stocks and shared the information
with Pomponio, a friend who also allegedly cashed in.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, McDermott, 48, who is married, was intimately
involved with Ms. Gannon while the insider trading was going on.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither defendant commented outside court Thursday.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush ballot battles to continue in federal court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge might be Sen. John McCain's last
hope to run in the New York Republican presidential primary in most of the
state.
<P>
	   An Albany County judge on Thursday threw the Arizona senator off the March 7
ballot in eight of the state's congressional districts, saying McCain didn't get
enough GOP signatures to compete in those districts. If the decision stands,
McCain's name will not be on the Republican presidential ballot in a fourth of
the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   However, McCain's lawyers planned today to ask a federal judge in Brooklyn
to put McCain on the ballot in all 31 of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know that I'm a qualified candidate," McCain told reporters after a
town hall meeting at Nashua High School in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would take the issue to the floor of the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia this summer if the courts fail to satisfy him.
</P>
<P>
	   In a potential boost to McCain, millionaire rival Steve Forbes decided to
intervene today in McCain's federal lawsuit. Paul Sullivan, Forbes' attorney,
said Forbes has been struck from the ballot in three congressional districts
because of technical violations of the state election laws. Like McCain, the
Forbes campaign believes that Bush supporters are behind the move.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a clearly politically motivated attempt to strike us from the
ballot with some of the most arcane technicalities in the New York ballot access
statutes," Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed in throwing McCain out of the districts, calling the
signature requirements "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Cannizzaro late Thursday overturned the state
Board of Elections' decision to allow McCain to compete in the challenged
districts despite challenges from state Republicans, most of whom support GOP
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In the challenged districts, the Arizona senator did not have the number of
signatures on his presidential petitions to qualify for the state primary.
However, McCain supporters argued that since he was a valid national
presidential primary contender, the signature requirement should not apply to
him.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed, calling the signature requirements "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not the prerogative of any single candidate to interpose his or her
own judgment in place of that of the state Legislature in this regard," the
judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to
qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31
congressional districts. In effect, there are 31 separate GOP primaries in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters had challenged McCain in 16 of those districts. Cannizzaro's
decision leaves McCain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Buley, a state Republican Committee lawyer working in support of Bush,
cheered the decision. "We're pleased and think it was the proper decision," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign lawyer Henry Berger said they had not yet decided whether
to appeal Cannizzaro's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are disappointed," Berger said Thursday. "But I'm going to see what
happens in federal court tomorrow and then make a decision whether to appeal."
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has become even more important.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats helped McCain stay on the ballot in those eight districts. The two
Republican members of the state Board of Elections had voted on Wednesday to
uphold the challenges to McCain's petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   But the board's two Democrats abstained, thus depriving the Bush camp of the
third vote it needed to have the petitions invalidated for a lack of signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no clear indication Thursday when the ballot for New York's March
7 primary would be final. The state board had hoped to complete the ballot by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cannizzaro's decision is part of the battle over New York's March 7
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Developer Donald Trump won the right to compete for Independence Party
backing and Forbes lost his spot on the Republican ballot in three Long Island
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump, who is not an announced presidential candidate, is considering
running for the Reform Party's presidential nomination. His New York supporters,
who operate as the Independence Party, are seeking to run delegate slates for
him in the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But a coalition within the Independence Party has been trying to have
Trump's delegates thrown off the ballot. The Democracy Coalition supports
Trump's nemesis and Reform presidential candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   In retaliation for the Long Island challenge to his petitions, Forbes is
seeking a court order to remove frontrunner George W. Bush from the GOP ballot
in six districts in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Chase Privacy Pact May Prompt Trend  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp.'s decision to ask account holders
before selling their names to outside marketers may prompt other banks to offer
similar privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Chase can do it, that means other banks can do it," Frank Torres,
legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said about the new settlement agreement
between Chase and New York state's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   But most big banks aren't ready to do that and states ultimately might
compel them to tighten their privacy practices, Torres said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, financial institutions are concerned about recent privacy
enforcement actions against banks by several states as well as an initiative by
some states to enact new privacy laws that are stricter than federal
requirements Congress established in November.
</P>
<P>
	   "The states are fully engaged," said John Byrne, senior counsel for the
American Bankers Association. Banks around the country are "taking stock of
their privacy procedures," he said. "Some banks will decide on their own to go
beyond the mandated procedures ... if that's what their customers want to see."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, Chase must have written consent from account holders
before it can sell or share their data with outside marketers.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the settlement accord announced Tuesday by Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer in Albany, N.Y., Chase agreed to stop providing outside marketers with
the credit line and balance information of customers. As many as 22 million
consumers had been affected. Chase, the nation's third-largest bank holding
company, has some $370 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
	   The case "really demonstrates the need for legislation that protects
consumers from having their personal, sensitive financial information
distributed outside of the bank," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of
the American Civil Liberties Union. "I hope other banks follow (Chase) but I'm
not optimistic."
</P>
<P>
	   New York City-based Chase agreed not to share any customer data with outside
marketers, such as telemarketers, without customers' express written consent.
Even in cases where customers do give their permission, Chase agreed to provide
only their names, addresses and telephone numbers to the marketing firms, but
not any financial data.
</P>
<P>
	   This is stricter than the privacy provision in the new federal law, which
allows banks and other financial institutions to share customers' data with
outside firms unless customers expressly ask them not to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   The financial services industry had opposed even this more lenient
requirement. It won the right in the legislation for banks, securities firms and
insurance companies that are affiliated under the same corporate roof to share
customers' data. Customers are unable to stop such sharing by affiliated
financial companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The case involving Chase arose from an investigation by Spitzer's office
into allegations that the bank had provided customer information to marketers in
violation of its own privacy policy as disclosed to consumers. The data it
shared was said to have included encrypted account numbers and loan data.
</P>
<P>
	   The marketing firms used the information to phone Chase customers to try
selling them emergency road service plans, discount shopping clubs, legal
services, travel clubs, garden supplies and magazine subscriptions. Chase
received a commission on successful sales.
</P>
<P>
	   While it agreed to the settlement, Chase denied any wrongdoing. State
officials said they hadn't accused the bank of anything illegal, but they
promised to pursue similar enforcement actions against other financial
companies.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 117.89; Nasdaq Down 69.66  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today amid more signs the economy may be
growing at an inflationary pace that will force the Federal Reserve to boost
interest rates again to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
	   At midday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 117.89
at 10,910.13. The Dow has been grinding back and forth in recent days, amid
worries about rising rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also posting sizable losses today. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 19.13 at 1,379.43, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 69.66 at 3,969.90.
</P>
<P>
	   General Electric, down 5 at 136 3/14, was leading the Dow's retreat,
followed by J.P. Morgan, down 3 3/16 at 122 7/16, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 3
1/2 at 101 1/16. Among the Dow's gainers, Johnson &AMP; Johnson was up 3 3/8 at 83
7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the session began, the government released two reports that
reinforced expectations that Fed officials will intensify their battle against
inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 5.8
percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, well above the 5.1
percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 5.9 percent
rate posted in the last three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, closely
watched by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter,
well above the 0.9 percent increase many analysts were expecting. Employment
costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price.
</P>
<P>
	   Those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug
along despite three increases in lending rates by the Fed in less than a year.
The central bank's policy makers meet again on Tuesday. But more pivotal to the
market than a rate boost, which most investors expect by now, may be the
accompanying statement on the Fed's stance going forward.
</P>
<P>
	   That may determine whether the market can climb back to record levels. For
now, the Dow has fallen 6 percent from its Jan. 14 closing high of 11,722.98,
and the Nasdaq sits nearly 5 percent from its closing high of 4,235.40, set just
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading today, declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4
ratio on the New York Stock Exchange and a slightly smaller margin on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 5.05 at
511.97.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 469.63 million shares, down from 504.64 million at the
same point on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.17 percent, Germany's DAX
index fell 0.84 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.02 percent, and France's
CAC-40 rose 0.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> PBS Studies U.S.-China Relations  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCUS ELIASON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- On New Year's Eve someone handed me a party noisemaker that
said MADE IN CHINA. It was a mundane detail, but one that would have been
unimaginable in the not-too-distant past.
</P>
<P>
	   Nowadays, we running dogs of Western imperialism can take package tours to
the Ming Tombs, and it seems that everything from ballpoint pens to coffee
machines is made in the People's Republic of China. So welcoming the millennium
with Chinese-made noisemakers may seem no big deal.
</P>
<P>
	   But considering that until 1970 Americans were forbidden to visit or trade
with Communist China, the story behind this momentous thaw is always worth
retelling.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nixon's China Game," an hourlong documentary airing at 9 p.m. Monday, is a
lively British-made contribution to PBS-TV's "The American Experience" series.
It's a reminder of how far we have come in the 31 years since Richard Nixon,
then the newly elected president, set out to change the world in defiance of the
foreign policy establishment and members of his own Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Imagine that world: the Soviets had just invaded Czechoslovakia. The Vietnam
War was still raging, and Hanoi's Soviet allies were being thoroughly unhelpful
about ending it. They wouldn't even agree to a summit with Nixon.
</P>
<P>
	   Mao Tse-tung's China, meanwhile, had joined the nuclear club and was
convulsed by mass upheaval called the Cultural Revolution. Until Nixon came
along, Henry Kissinger wrote in his memoirs, U.S. policymakers had treated the
world's most populous country as "a brooding, chaotic, fanatical and alien realm
difficult to comprehend and impossible to sway."
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, it was widely assumed that China and the Soviet Union, both being
communist and anti-Western, must be in cahoots. In fact, the opposite was
becoming evident as the two armies began skirmishing on their border.
</P>
<P>
	   What the public didn't know was that Nixon, the old Cold Warrior, was about
to upend the chessboard. He had concluded that adroit U.S. diplomacy could
profit from the worsening Soviet-Chinese split. The United States had boycotted
China since the communists seized power in 1949. Nixon resolved to end this
"angry isolation," as he put it.
</P>
<P>
	   A bipolar world would become tri-polar, and it would be Moscow's turn to
sweat.
</P>
<P>
	   It all seems so obvious now. But not so in 1969. Some people, including
Kissinger, then Nixon's national security adviser, thought the president had
lost his senses, according to the PBS documentary.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter Stoessel, the U.S. ambassador to Poland, was asked make the first
approach to his Chinese counterpart. He also balked, "because it was so against
orthodoxy and in a sense so dangerous," Kissinger relates. So Nixon talked to
Stoessel, asking him to simply approach the Chinese ambassador "and say hello."
</P>
<P>
	   Easier said than done, given the mental chasm dividing the two countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The first overture almost turned to farce. Stoessel and his staff tried to
get the ambassador's attention at a fashion show in Warsaw by chasing after the
Chinese guests.
</P>
<P>
	   One embassy staffer, Jiang Zhicheng, recalls in the film: "These Americans
ran after us shouting in Polish: 'We are from the American embassy.' ...The
ambassador panted, 'I saw President Nixon in Washington. He wants to establish
relations with China."'
</P>
<P>
	   The message got through, but slowly.
</P>
<P>
	   A delicate diplomatic dance followed, until the first major public sign of
change came in April 1970. Mao invited the U.S. table tennis team to China and
the phrase "ping-pong diplomacy" was coined. With Pakistani mediation, the
breakthrough came in July 1971, when Kissinger secretly visited China, leading
the first official U.S. delegation into the "alien realm" in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The documentary skillfully laces the story with details that show us the
human side of high diplomacy: Kissinger forgetting to pack a spare shirt and
having to borrow an oversized one from an aide; a Pakistani official, entrusted
with driving Kissinger clandestinely to the airport, who mislays his car keys.
</P>
<P>
	   Culminating in Nixon's weeklong visit to China in February 1972, the China
Game ended in an American triumph, for which the film gives Nixon almost all the
credit. Soon Nixon would be engulfed by Watergate. But the seeds of his gambit
would lead to China's momentous shift toward capitalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, despite frequent clashes over human rights and trade, some 700,000
Americans visit China annually, and China has a $57 billion trade surplus with
the United States. That's a lot of noisemakers.

<HEADLINE> Army Recruiters Seek Star Backing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is looking to Hollywood for help on the
recruiting front.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen said today he made personal pitches to about
a dozen movie stars, film producers and other celebrities -- plus some
high-profile professional athletes -- to do public service announcements
promoting the military on radio and television. Most indicated an interest but
made no firm commitment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said, `We'd like to help,''' Cohen told reporters during an interview
in his Pentagon office.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the celebrities he approached recently: movie stars Harrison Ford and
Julia Roberts, as well as Tom Cruise, who starred in the hit movie ``Top Gun''
about Navy fighter pilots; movie producer Steven Speilberg, who is working on a
TV documentary about the Marine Corps, and actor James Brolin.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said his intent is to find celebrities who are influential with young
people of military recruiting age. The military is struggling to enlist enough
people each year, and Cohen is looking for new ways to reach young audiences.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides aiming at potential recruits, Cohen wants to make more use of
celebrities as morale boosters for forces in the field. In December, he took a
group of celebrities, including former National Football League stars Terry
Bradshaw and Mike Singletary, to Kosovo and Bosnia to meet with U.S. troops on
peacekeeping duty.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he has talked to Fox TV about the possibility of broadcasting an
NFL pre-game show next season from aboard a Navy aircraft carrier.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar Up; Gold Mixed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The euro slumped to a record low for its second straight day
while the dollar surged against most major currencies in European trading today.
Gold prices were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro dropped to 97.62 cents in late European trading today after
stronger than expected economic growth was reported in the United States. Later,
in midday trading in New York, the euro traded at 97.52 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's slide followed the euro's first close below $1 on Thursday, when it
dropped below 99 cents for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
	   The single currency of 11 European nations has now lost more than 16 percent
of its value since its celebrated launch on Jan. 4, 1999. It has faltered
because European monetary officials have not indicated a willingness to support
the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday, included 107.22
Japanese yen, up from 104.97; 1.6495 Swiss francs, up from 1.6133; and 1.4482
Canadian dollars, up from 1.4200.
</P>
<P>
	   The British pound was quoted at $1.6205, down from $1.6361.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading in New York, the dollar bought 106.77 yen, and the pound
was worth $1.6224.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no longer traded
separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro rates, the dollar was worth
2.0029 German marks, up from 1.9750; 6.7154 French francs, up from 6.6245;
2.2561 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2255; and 1982.26 Italian lire, up from
1,955.43.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold closed in London at $286.40 bid per troy ounce, up from $285.90 on
Thursday. In Zurich the bid price was $286.40, up from $285.50 Thursday. Gold
closed up 50 cents in Hong Kong to $287.35.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver closed in London at $5.33 bid per troy ounce, up from $5.32.

<HEADLINE> Mannessmann, Deutsche Bank Plan  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German telecom Mannesmann AG plans to join forces
with the world's largest bank to launch a new European service that lets people
turn their phones into personal bank tellers by combining telephone and bank
accounts in the same network.
</P>
<P>
	   The venture with Deutsche Bank AG, called Tele-Commerce Bank, is expected to
bolster Mannesmann's e-commerce strategy and strengthen its defense against the
$156 billion hostile takeover bid by rival British telecom Vodafone AirTouch
PLC. It also comes during a flurry of rumors that Mannesmann was looking to dig
in further with another venture with AOL Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an additional argument to shareholders to hold on to Mannesmann,"
said Hermann Reith, a telecom analyst with BHF Bank in Frankfurt, on Friday. "It
shows that Mannesmann is also an Internet company, while Vodafone has nothing
when it comes to the Internet."
</P>
<P>
	   The 50-50 venture between Deutsche Bank and Mannesmann -- which should be up
and running later this year -- will tap Mannesmann's 35 million customers
allowing them to access bank accounts either through fixed line or wireless
phones. It will also combine banking and telephone bills into one monthly
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann will provide the wires, switches, telephones and billing centers.
Deutsche Bank will chip in the financial services. Both partners benefit because
of cost efficiencies and low overhead, Reith said.
</P>
<P>
	   A brokerage service will be added in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone spokesman Barry Wick dismissed the development as "nothing
special," and a normal outgrowth of the growing e-commerce sector.
</P>
<P>
	   Press reports Friday also speculated that Mannesmann was also seeking a
stake in AOL Europe, the continent's No. 2 Internet service provider and a 50-50
venture between German media giant Bertelsmann AG and Dulles, Va.-based America
Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The company would not comment on whether it was looking for a one-third
stake in AOL Europe for $7.4 billion as reported in the German business daily
Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
	   While such a move would not outright block Vodafone's takeover bid, it could
back up Mannesmann's defense that the company is better off going alone with its
mixed strategy of wireless, fixed line and Internet services -- as opposed to
Vodafone's sole reliance on mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann spokesman Manfred Soehnlein said the recent Internet expansion is
part of the company's long-term strategy, not a response to Vodafone's takeover
bid. He added that the company's projections for growth and increased value are
better reasons for shareholders to hold on to their stakes instead of selling
out to Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann shareholders have until Feb. 7 to decide whether to accept
Vodafone's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in Mannesmann dropped 0.3 percent to 268.20 euros ($262.83), while
Deutsche Bank was down 0.83 percent to 78.54 euros ($76.96). Vodafone shares
fell just 3 cents to $5.63.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks stumbled Friday amid fresh signs of economic growth
so strong that the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighters are likely to raise
interest rates again when they meet next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow industrials at one point were down more than 200 points and the
Nasdaq composite index fell more than 150 before regaining some lost ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 199.86, or by 1.8 percent, at
10,829.16 in active trading this afternoon. Broader stock indicators were also
posting sizable losses, with the Nasdaq down 143.95, or by 3.6 percent, at
3,895.61.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the session began, the government released two reports that
reinforced expectations that the Fed will intensify its battle against inflation
next week by raising interest rates to slow the U.S. economy. There also are
worries that more increases will follow in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising rates increase the cost of doing business, reducing corporate
profits. Higher rates also could slow consumer spending, which has been a
driving force behind the economy's long expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department on Friday reported that the economy grew at a
sizzling 5.8 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, well
above the 5.1 percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a
5.9 percent rate posted in the last three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, closely
watched by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter,
or faster than the 0.9 percent increase many analysts were expecting. Employment
costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price.

<HEADLINE> People cope at the coldest spot on the map  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. (AP) - Mercury doesn't just dip here in January, it
disappears from the thermometer. Days as cold as an ice box in this Adirondack
village are a warm relief.
<P>
	   How cold is it here?
</P>
<P>
	   It's so cold that gasoline can turn to jelly in cars. It's so cold that home
heating pipes and toilet bowls are cracking open. It's so cold that people
mummify themselves in wool and fur before stepping outside.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard to breathe," said Heather Tuttle, a supervisor at the Wawbeek
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   That's really cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Saranac Lake is a quaint village of about 5,000 people tucked in the High
Peaks of the Adirondacks. Not as celebrated or upscale as nearby Lake Placid,
the northern New York village still features a rustic charm accented by
clapboard homes, an old fashioned main street and a mountain lake.
</P>
<P>
	   And being so high up, temperatures far below zero are common. Temperatures
dipped to the -20 to -30 range recently - or -60 with the wind chill. Even with
cloud cover over the past few days, temperatures have been as low as -15.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's getting to be so if its zero you feel warm, and if it's 8 above, you
take off your jacket and leave it in the truck," said Bill Decker, owner of Big
D Fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   And when the temperatures nosedive, the locals just deal with it.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Catalano, manager of Asplin Tree Farm, had to go out Friday to cut
down two balsam fir trees to be shipped to Glens Falls. How does he psyche
himself to go out in the cold?
</P>
<P>
	   He doesn't. He just puts on a lot of wool and does it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, it will be quick and simple," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Catalano noted a big problem with the cold was getting the diesel tractors
to start up. Even with electric heaters on the engine blocks, fuel will
sometimes coagulate in the line, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Andreas Mowka said he routinely will "plug in" his family's three cars
overnight. But when it gets really cold - as it has a few times recently - he
will get up at 3 a.m. to run the cars for a half hour so they don't freeze up.
</P>
<P>
	   While the cars are idling, he'll make sure the horse's water doesn't ice up
and stock his house's wood stove (15 face cords a winter). Then he goes back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're in a dreamlike state when you do this," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   People with weekend homes in the area have it tougher. Decker said that in
the 24-hours since one home was checked, the heating system sputtered out,
causing water in every pipe to freeze, cracking radiators and toilet bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our technicians, our boiler repairmen aren't getting a lot of sleep," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Saranac Lake is not necessarily colder than other places in the Adirondacks,
but it gets more attention because it is the lone federally maintained weather
observation site in the area. It's also the largest year-round population center
within the 6-million-acre park.
</P>
<P>
	   "It sort of becomes representative of the Adirondacks," said National
Weather Service meteorologist Mike Cempa.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents here know their hometown has a frosty reputation, but they tend to
shrug it off as the price for living in such a beautiful setting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mowka said he has lived as far afield as Iran, Germany and Long Island, but
that Saranac Lake is the best and most beautiful.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary La Rose, a retiree who was looking out the window Friday morning to
watch chickadees flitting about her bird feeder, said it's important to keep in
mind the upsides of the area.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't have hurricanes and floods, so we have a little cold weather once
in while," she said. "That's not too bad."

<HEADLINE> Innocent man plagued by name droppers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - At least five times in the past two years, area
police have wrongly filed charges against Robert C. Smith after catching someone
who claimed to be him.
<P>
	   In at least some of those instances, it was Smith's good friend who
tarnished his good name.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the real Robert Smith, 20, of Syracuse managed to get the
charges dismissed. But the mistakes resulted in New York suspending Smith's
license, warrants being issued for his arrest and Smith having to appear in
court on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent episode occurred last weekend when police arrested five men
on felony drug charges after finding them in possession of 11 ounces of crack
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   It turned out, the person who gave Smith's name was Jeffrey Dowdell Jr., 21,
who has been friends with Smith since the attended elementary school together in
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell did not have any identification when he was arrested but provided
deputies with Smith's correct date of birth and address, said John D'Eredita,
spokesman for the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department. At the jail, however, a
deputy recognized him as Dowdell, D'Eredita said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deception earned Dowdell an extra charge: criminal impersonation, a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
	   But it also heaped another helping of embarrassment onto Smith, a young man
who lost his hearing three years ago after contracting meningitis, said
Celestine Smith, Smith's mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Celestine Smith said she doubted her son will remain friends with Dowdell.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's tired of being dragged through the mud and being in court all the
time. Being deaf is hard enough," said Mrs. Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were friends since the time they were 9 years old. But he can't be too
much of our friend if he's doing this to us," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith did not want to talk about the affair.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell, though, maintained that Smith was his friend, and said he was
sorry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know my man, Robert. I know he's mad at me. But he'll get over it. That's
my man," Dowdell said in a jailhouse interview with The Post-Standard of
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Celestine Smith said Dowdell admitted to her this summer that he had
pretended to be her son on a previous occasion when he was stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said he didn't think Robert would get in trouble because he can't hear,"
Mrs. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell admitted Monday that he told police he was Smith last fall when they
confiscated $1,000 from him because he was in a drug-infested neighborhood and
had no proof he had legally earned the money.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Dowdell said he never got any tickets in Smith's name.
</P>
<P>
	   But Syracuse police issued three separate appearance tickets in Smith's name
to an impersonator, said attorney December Haab, who represented Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   The appearance tickets noted that the suspect had a scar on his face and a
tattoo - which the real Smith does not have, Haab said. Neither does Dowdell.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrants were issued in 1999 for Smith's arrest for failing to appear in
court on a marijuana charge. The warrants and charges were dismissed after Haab
met with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspects occasionally deceive police as to their true identity but are
usually caught within hours after they are booked and fingerprinted, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's unusual," Haab said of Smith's predicament. "I hope it's
unusual."

<HEADLINE> Uranium Cleanup Funding Hike Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PRICHARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- The Clinton administration is seeking a significant
increase in funding for cleanup and worker health programs at uranium processing
plants in Kentucky and Ohio, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget request for fiscal year 2001, to be released Feb. 7,
proposes $109.2 million for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant and $113.5
million for the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   The requests represent a doubling of the Paducah plant's 1999 budget and an
83 percent increase for the Piketon operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson made the announcement during a visit to the office of the Paducah
site's cleanup contractor.
</P>
<P>
	   Three Paducah employees have filed a federal lawsuit alleging workers
unwittingly were exposed to plutonium and other highly toxic substances from
1953 to 1976. A recent Energy Department investigation found that worker safety
and environmental problems have persisted during federal efforts to clean up the
plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson has apologized for the failure to disclose plant hazards and
promised compensation for sick workers.
</P>
<P>
	   At Paducah, the 2001 budget request includes $78 million for cleanup, which
the Energy Department would use to remove 51,000 tons of contaminated scrap and
thousands of barrels containing radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
	   The current cleanup budget at Paducah is $54.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   At Piketon, the budget proposes $76.2 million for cleanup; the current
budget is $46.1 million.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Mostly Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Strong U.S. employment and domestic product data fueled fears
of an interest rate hike Friday, resulting in a slump in European stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Investor confidence lagged as analysts predicted the U.S. Federal Reserve
would hike interest rates by as much as half a percentage point next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 313 shares in companies in
countries that joined the single currency, fell 0.16 points to 408.30. The Dow
Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 3.0 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4783.9.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 606 shares in European companies fell 0.70
points, or 0.2 percent, to 368.36, while the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index fell 10.6
points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,625.7.
</P>
<P>
	   London's FTSE-100 Share Index was hit hard by the data, closing down 65.40,
or 1.0 percent, at 6,375.6. The index had climbed 34 points shortly before U.S.
data was released, but fell as much as 86 points just after.
</P>
<P>
	   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index fell 2.2 percent to 7,066.60, dragged lower by
Thursday's gainers Adidas Salomon and Deutsche Telekom, which closed 5.1 percent
and 4.8 percent lower, respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled broadly in afternoon trading as investors
dumped bank and industrial shares in the wake of fresh data that fueled
inflationary fears.
</P>
<P>
	   At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 130.61
at 10,897.01, recovering slightly from a drop of as much as 234 points early in
the afternoon. Many investors expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
when it meets next week, curbing business expansion by making it more expensive
to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks also were hurt. The Nasdaq composite index down 111.50 at
3928.06 after being down as much as 150, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was lower by 20.86 at 1377.70.
</P>
<P>
	   "With that news this morning, buyers just walked away and will wait for the
Fed," said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. "The market will
be weak, looking for direction, until everybody knows what the Fed is doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Before the session began, the government released two reports that
reinforced expectations that Fed officials will intensify their battle against
inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 5.8
percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, well above the 5.1
percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 5.9 percent
rate posted in the last three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, closely
watched by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter,
or more than the 0.9 percent increase many analysts were expecting. Employment
costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price.
</P>
<P>
	   Those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug
along despite three increases in lending rates by the Fed since June. The
central bank's policy-makers meet again on Tuesday and Wednesday. But more
pivotal to the market than the expected rate boost may be the accompanying
statement on the Fed's stance going forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Consequently, interest-rate sensitive bank stocks took a beating today. J.P.
Morgan was off 4 7/8 at 120 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Industrial companies, which are especially vulnerable to economic cycles,
also saw their shares fall today. General Electric was down 5 5/8 at 136 1/8
while General Motors was lower by 3 1/4 at 79 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, the volatile darlings of Wall Street, were in retreat.
Qualcomm slid 11 1/16 to 108 15/16. Amazon.com, which announced a round of
layoffs, was down 5 9/16 at 61 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading today, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about a
2-to-1 margin on the New York Stock Exchange and by a wider margin on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 10.23 at
506.79 at midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 709.59 million shares, down from 764.38 million at the
same point on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.17 percent, Germany's DAX
index fell 0.84 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.02 percent, and France's
CAC-40 rose 0.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court rejects leniency, disbars former city judge who  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The New Jersey Supreme Court on Friday refused to
consider any claim that alcoholism might justify leniency for a corrupt Jersey
City judge who solicited sex from female traffic offenders.
<P>
	   The court voted unanimously to disbar James F. Boylan, who was convicted in
federal court in 1998 of reducing traffic fines for female motorists in exchange
for sexual favors.
</P>
<P>
	   Boylan was sentenced to federal prison and his ouster comes as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Boylan's lawyer, Albert Jeffers, had argued to the court that
Boylan should be able to seek some leniency on the grounds the former judge
suffered from severe alcoholism at the time of his misdeeds, from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, Jeffers argued every defendant has a constitutional right to at
least present a so-called "mitigating factor" in his defense before the
Disciplinary Review Board, an agency of the Supreme Court that collects facts
and makes recommendations in attorney discipline. Because of this error, Jeffers
said Boylan was entitled to a new hearing with the board.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said no on both points.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices said alcohol impairment may sometimes be a mitigating factor
weighing on the side of leniency, but not in Boylan's case. They said his
violations of legal ethics were too severe.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are satisfied that no useful purpose would be served by a remand (for a
new hearing) in this case. So deep and profound is the impugnment of the
integrity of the legal system that disbarment is the only appropriate penalty,"
the court said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We acknowledge the debilitating effect of the disease of alcoholism but the
disease does not here equate with a loss of comprehension, competency or will
sufficient to mitigate the misconduct charged," the court said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boylan, who was one of several part-time municipal night court judges in
Jersey City, pleaded guilty to a single count of wire fraud to avoid a trial. He
was sentenced in May 1998 to 30 months in federal prison and ordered to pay
$12,500 restitution by a federal judge who described his conduct "unspeakable."
</P>
<P>
	   Boylan admitted coaching women to lie when they appeared before him so he
could give them a reduced fine. One of the women he had solicited tipped off the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   The women were young and poor and owed hundreds and thousands of dollars in
traffic tickets, prosecutors said, estimating at least 50 women were approached
by Boylan over the three-year period. They said he initiated the sex deals,
promising to reduce fines if they agreed to meet him later.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have declined to say how many women consented to sex with
Boylan. The unspecified sex acts took place at hotels or sometimes in a car,
according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside for legal and judicial work, Boylan taught social studies at Dickinson
High School in Jersey City.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Engineers May Strike  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- The union representing The Boeing Co's engineers and
technical workers is planning a walkout and strike next Thursday if the latest
contract offer from Boeing is rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   A company memorandum circulating among engineers and technical workers
indicates that Boeing officials plan to postpone two meetings with airline
customers of the 747 jetliner in early February because of the "high
probability" of a strike, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do remain hopeful that the contract will pass, but we do take any strike
threats from the union seriously," said Boeing spokesman Peter Conte.
</P>
<P>
	   The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace is planning
to vote on the contract Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Union negotiators originally considered a one-week walkout but decided to
call a strike of undetermined length if the contract is rejected, SPEEA
executive director Charles Bofferding said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, the company has shown no desire to negotiate with us, and our
people have decided to do something about it," Bofferding said. "A no vote on
this contract is a vote to strike."
</P>
<P>
	   The union represents nearly 23,000 employees about 11 percent of Boeing's
overall work force, including overtime-exempt engineers and scientists in one
unit and computer programmers, manual writers and other technicians in a second
unit. About 60 percent of those covered by the contracts belong to the union.
</P>
<P>
	   Key issues include a lack of guaranteed pay increases or bonuses and changes
in life insurance and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Both units voted down an earlier contract offer by more than 98 percent in
December. Bofferding said the latest offer was better than the first, but did
little to alter the status quo.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton criticizes Austria's Haider  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In a letter to a top Jewish leader, Hillary Rodham
Clinton on Friday came out against Joerg Haider and his far-right Freedom Party
becoming part of a coalition government in Austria.
<P>
	   The move served to call attention, once again, to the fact that her expected
Republican Senate opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, had shared the
dais with Haider at a Martin Luther King Day event earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani aides had said at the time that the mayor had not been aware that
Haider was at the event.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is a controversial figure who once praised Adolf Hitler's "orderly
employment practices" and later said veterans of Hitler's elite Waffen SS were
"decent people of good character."
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, Mrs.
Clinton said "Haider's record of intolerance, extremism and anti-Semitism should
be of concern to all of us."
</P>
<P>
	   "Neither he nor his party should be seriously considered as a partner in an
Austrian government," the first lady added.
</P>
<P>
	   "Surely, the history of the past century tells us the danger of such a move.
I hope that people of good will, in Austria and around the world, will speak out
and express their concern at this important moment," Mrs. Clinton wrote. "I
certainly will."
</P>
<P>
	   There has been an international outcry in recent days in the wake of news
that the center-right Austrian People's Party was talking with the Freedom Party
about forming a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The developments have led to criticism from other European countries and
from Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton camp left no doubt that the letter to Bronfman was meant to put
Giuliani on the spot.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been nearly two weeks since Rudy Giuliani shared a dais with Joerg
Haider. Why hasn't he spoken out?" Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton,
said. "Why didn't he throw Joerg Haider out of the room?"
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani camp declined to comment on Mrs. Clinton's letter.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor created an international incident in 1995 when he threw
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat out of a Lincoln Center concert celebrating the
United Nations' 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Giuliani blamed the Palestine Liberation Organization for the
murder of New Yorker Leon Klinghoffer during the hijacking of the Achille Lauro
cruise liner in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we're having a party and a celebration, I would rather not have
someone who was implicated in the murders of Americans there," Giuliani had
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign's move also seemed designed to score points with the
state's politically important Jewish community. The first lady and the mayor
have been jockeying over that for months.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani had blasted Mrs. Clinton for her embrace of Arafat's wife last year
just moments after she had charged that Israel was using poison gas against
Palestinians. The first lady later condemned Mrs. Arafat's statements.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's camp was also critical of Mrs. Clinton's appearance at a Martin
Luther King Day event this month hosted by Al Sharpton. During the event, a
Sharpton ally had made remarks considered anti-Semitic. Neither Mrs. Clinton nor
Sharpton were in the room at the time. The first lady subsequently criticized
the comments.

	   Economy Grows at 5.8 Percent Rate
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew at a high 5.8 percent
annual rate during the final three months of 1999 as the country
heads into its longest economic expansion in history. For all of
1999, the nation's gross domestic product -- the total output of
goods and services -- increased by 4 percent, turning in three
straight years in which growth was 4 percent or higher, the
Commerce Department said today. Strength came from hardy consumer
spending. In 1998, the economy grew by 4.3 percent. The
fourth-quarter rate was stronger than the 5.1 percent rate many
analysts were forecasting. Robust consumer spending and a buildup
in business inventories added to 1999's fourth-quarter growth,
while the trade deficit subtracted from it. In the third quarter,
the economy grew at a 5.7 percent rate.

The cuts, announced last night in a company meeting at Amazon's

work force of about 7,500, said spokesman Bill Curry. The layoffs
were not the result of post-Christmas letdowns or other seasonal

people to carry out its goals.

	   Leaders Discuss Wealth Disparities

but so has debate over who has benefited and who has lost in the

summit today. ``Disparities in the distribution of wealth within
and among societies are being augmented to a disturbing degree,''
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit told the World Economic Forum,
a six-day gathering of nearly 2,000 people. Ecevit said many of the
protesters against the World Trade Organization at its recent
meeting in Seattle feel the WTO too often considers the needs of
giant multinational corporations at the expense of the poor, the
environment and the rights of workers.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp.'s decision to ask
account holders before selling their names to outside marketers may
prompt other banks to offer similar privacy protections. ``If Chase

	   LONDON (AP) -- Strong U.S. employment and domestic product data
fueled fears of an interest rate hike Friday, resulting in a slump

predicted the U.S. Federal Reserve would hike interest rates by as
much as half a percentage point next week. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx
Index fell 0.16 points to 408.30. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 606
shares in European companies fell 0.70 points, or 0.2 percent, to
368.36. London's FTSE-100 Share Index was hit hard by the data,
closing down 65.40, or 1.0 percent, at 6,375.6. The index had
climbed 34 points shortly before U.S. data were released, but fell
as much as 86 points just after. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index fell
2.2 percent to 7,066.60. Milan's MIB30 Index was down 0.5 percent
to 42,541.

<HEADLINE> Economic Surge Feeds Inflation Fear  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, propelled by hardy consumer spending,
finished 1999 on a vibrant note, but the growth came at a price: a worrisome
uptick in wages and benefits that economists fear could trigger inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   During the final three months of 1999, the economy grew at a breakneck
annual rate of 5.8 percent, the biggest growth spurt since the end of 1998, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the nation's gross domestic product, its total output of
goods and services, increased by 4 percent, the third year in a row at 4 percent
or higher.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton boasted about the economy at a White House meeting with
mayors. "This unbelievable recovery marches on," Clinton said, referring to the
uninterrupted economic growth since the 1990-1991 recession that will set a
record of eight years and ten months next week.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, another government report showed Friday that employees'
wages and benefits surged 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, rekindling worries
about inflation and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid these worries, stocks tumbled. The Dow Jones industrial average was
down more than 140 points, the Nasdaq more than 100 points, in late afternoon
trading. But the bond market staged a stunning turnaround as jittery investors
shifted their money away from stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rising tide of economic growth has stirred up inflation in its wake,"
said Richard Yamarone, an economist with Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   With the roaring economy driving down the nation's unemployment rate to its
lowest point in 30 years, employers are having trouble finding scarce workers to
fill openings. Some employers are wooing workers with higher wages and benefits.
That's good for workers, but economists fear those increased costs could lead to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1.1 percent spike in the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index,
considered the best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs and closely
watched by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, stemmed from a 1.3 percent
jump in benefits, the biggest increase in six years. Economists blamed rising
health care costs for the big increase in benefit costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both reports contain the smoking gun that the Fed has been worried about --
wage pressures are surfacing, and inflation is on the uptick," said First Union
economist David Orr.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve meets next week to decide interest rate policy, and most
economists expect the Fed to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   A few economists said Friday's reports may put pressure on the Fed to bump
up rates by a half a point on Feb. 2. But more economists said the reports raise
the odds that the Fed will follow up next week's expected increase with a
quarter-of-a-point rate boost on March 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the Fed's three rate increases last year, the economy continues to
grow at a rapid pace that some economists fear cannot be sustained without
triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   An inflation gauge tied to GDP rose 1.5 percent in 1999, a worse showing on
inflation than the 0.7 percent increase recorded the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best of inflation news is clearly behind us, and if we keep growth at a
4 percent pace as we did in all of 1999 then the price problems will almost
certainly worsen," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the country's economic
activity, drove 1999's growth, rising 5.3 percent for the year. Plentiful jobs,
rising wages and benefits and stock market gains have made Americans feel
wealthy and put them in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
	   All that spending pushed the nation's savings rate -- savings as a
percentage of disposable income -- to an all-time annual low of 2.4 percent last
year. In 1998, the savings rate was 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   That isn't as dire as it seems, however, because the savings rate doesn't
take into account gains households have realized on their savings from such
factors as rising stock market values and higher real estate values for their
homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Business investment -- spending on new equipment and plants -- increased 8.3
percent last year, down from 12.7 percent in 1998. Rising mortgage rates
dampened housing construction, which rose 7.2 percent in 1999 but wasn't as
brisk as the 9.2 percent increase the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. trade deficit continued to be a drag on the economy, subtracting
1.11 percentage points from growth in 1999. But that was a slight improvement
from the 1.18 percentage-point reduction recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Imports shot up 11.8 percent last year, slightly more than the 11.6 percent
increase posted in 1998. Exports rose 3.5 percent last year, compared with a 2.2
percent rise the year before.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 178.93; Nasdaq Down 128.55  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled broadly in afternoon trading as investors
dumped bank and industrial shares in the wake of fresh data that fueled
inflationary fears.
</P>
<P>
	   At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was near its lows
of the day, down 178.93 at 10,849.09. Many investors expect the Federal Reserve
to raise interest rates when it meets next week, curbing business expansion by
making it more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks also were hurt. The Nasdaq composite index down 128.55 at
3,911.01, with the decline led by traditional stalwarts like Intel, Oracle and
Qualcomm. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was lower by 26.17 at 1,372.39.
</P>
<P>
	   "With that news this morning, buyers just walked away and will wait for the
Fed," said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. "The market will
be weak, looking for direction, until everybody knows what the Fed is doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Before the session began, the government released two reports that
reinforced expectations that Fed officials will intensify their battle against
inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 5.8
percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, well above the 5.1
percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 5.9 percent
rate posted in the last three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, closely
watched by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter,
or more than the 0.9 percent increase many analysts were expecting. Employment
costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price.
</P>
<P>
	   Those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug
along despite three increases in lending rates by the Fed since June. The
central bank's policy-makers meet again on Tuesday and Wednesday. But more
pivotal to the market than the expected rate boost may be the accompanying
statement on the Fed's stance going forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Consequently, interest-rate sensitive bank stocks took a beating today. J.P.
Morgan was off 5 9/16 at 120 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Industrial companies, which are especially vulnerable to economic cycles,
also saw their shares fall today. General Electric was down 5 7/8 at 135 7/8
while General Motors was lower by 3 9/16 at 79 5/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, the volatile darlings of Wall Street, were in retreat.
Qualcomm slid 8 1/2 to 111 1/2. Intel slipped by 3 7/16 to 94 11/16, while
Oracle fell by 3 13/16 to 48.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading today, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about a
2-to-1 margin on the New York Stock Exchange and by a wider margin on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 10.44 at
506.58 at late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 825.64 million shares, down from 900.77 million at the
same point on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.17 percent, Germany's DAX
index fell 0.84 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.02 percent, and France's
CAC-40 rose 0.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Engineers Might Strike  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- The union representing The Boeing Co's engineers and
technical workers is planning a strike next Thursday if the latest contract
offer from Boeing is rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace is planning
to vote on the contract Wednesday. The union represents nearly 23,000 employees
-- about 11 percent of Boeing's overall work force.
</P>
<P>
	   A company memorandum circulating among engineers and technical workers
indicates that Boeing officials plan to postpone two meetings with airline
customers of the 747 jetliner in early February because of the "high
probability" of a strike, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do remain hopeful that the contract will pass, but we do take any strike
threats from the union seriously," said Boeing spokesman Peter Conte.
</P>
<P>
	   Union negotiators originally considered a one-week walkout but decided to
call a strike of undetermined length if the contract is rejected, SPEEA
executive director Charles Bofferding said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, the company has shown no desire to negotiate with us, and our
people have decided to do something about it," Bofferding said. "A no vote on
this contract is a vote to strike."
</P>
<P>
	   The union represents overtime-exempt engineers and scientists in one unit
and computer programmers, manual writers and other technicians in a second unit.
About 60 percent of those covered by the contracts belong to the union.
</P>
<P>
	   Key issues include a lack of guaranteed pay increases or bonuses and changes
in life insurance and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Both units voted down an earlier contract offer by more than 98 percent in
December. Bofferding said the latest offer was better than the first, but did
little to alter the status quo.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Agenda Needs GOP Support  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today sought common ground with
Republicans on an effort to save Social Security -- while urging the nation's
mayors to keep pressure on Capitol Hill to ensure it gets done this year. ``We
do not want to miss this moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   During a White House breakfast with dozens of mayors in town for the U.S.
Conference of Mayors annual winter meeting, the president said some issues he
laid out in his State of the Union address Thursday night, such as preserving
Social Security and Medicare, are too pressing to be stalled by election-year
politics. But he said he fears lawmakers might put politics ahead of those
concerns if they feel little or no pressure from the local level.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't matter whether you're a Republican or Democrat, we are going to
double the number of people over 65,'' Clinton said. ``The further away you move
from the grass roots, the more likely politics is to shift from deeds to words.
So you mayors can make a difference here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Clinton traveled to Quincy, Ill., to spell out his State of the Union
proposals for the denizens of the Midwest and repeat his call for action on
education, Social Security, paying down the debt, and helping those who have yet
to join in the recent economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can bring free enterprise and hope to people who have never had it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a nod to the farmland that surrounds Quincy, Clinton also called anew for
overhaul of federal assistance to farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got to understand that we're a strong country when we all work
together and we give everyone a chance to rise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also sought the mayors' help in building support for his proposal to
repair dilapidated public schools, to ease concerns among lawmakers about
federal intervention in an ``entirely local issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday night, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., singled out health
care, education, debt reduction, tax cuts and anti-drug aid to Colombia as areas
of potential agreement with the president. ``I think a lot of it is doable if
the president will sit down and work with us,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
	   But following Clinton's 89-minute speech to Congress, the longest of his
eight State of the Union addresses, many of the same old divisions remained.
Republicans said he had proposed far too much new spending and not enough tax
reduction, which combined with their lingering distrust of him lays the
groundwork for a contentious election year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The proof is not him saying it tonight to a national television
audience,'' said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas. ``The proof is directing his minions
to work with the Republican Congress to actually do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president used his address to senators and representatives gathered in
the House chamber, in part, to recount the successes of his first seven years in
office: a near-record economic expansion, federal deficits converted to
surpluses, lower crime rates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1992, we just had a roadmap. Today, we have results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also laid out a wish list for his final year that ranged from sweeping
ideas -- $350 billion in tax cuts, retirement savings accounts, more spending
for schools and health care, photo ID licenses for handguns -- to narrower ones
like encouraging the development of new vaccines and less-polluting cars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tonight is special because we stand on the mountaintop of a new
millennium,'' Clinton said. ``Behind us we see the great expanse of American
achievement. Before us, even grander frontiers of possibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some of his proposals have the potential for bipartisan compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   He would spend more for teachers, Head Start, after-school and summer school
programs, and provide college tuition tax deductions of up to $2,800 per family.
He wants to use parts of the huge projected federal surpluses to eliminate the
$3.6 trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by Republicans
and Democrats as both sides battle for control of Congress and the White House.
House Republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and
relief from the so-called marriage penalty this year. Presidential candidates
have their own proposals too.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would boost funds for scientific research, raise military pay,
increase the $5.15 hourly minimum wage and create a new Medicare prescription
drug benefit. And he would pare taxes for child care, long-term care of ailing
relatives, charitable giving, and companies investing in inner cities and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For too long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most
pressing national priorities,'' he said in one of his few overt swipes at the
Republicans from whom Democrats hope to win congressional control in November.
``Let's begin with them.''
</P>
<P>
	   But leavening such attacks were other gestures, such as when he turned and
shook hands with Hastert after lauding him for supporting efforts to increase
investments in urban areas. And many Republicans, eager to at least appear
cooperative in an election year, returned the favor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wants to have a legacy,'' said Rep. Thomas Davis, R-Va., chairman of
the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's campaign arm.
``He has some reasonable proposals here and we want to deal with them. It works
for us if he does it right. We like to show we're doing things too.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, one of Clinton's most bitter
foes, joined many of the frequent rounds of applause and left the door open to
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone knows we have some very serious disagreements over some very
important principles,'' DeLay said. ``But I am hopeful that the president will
work with us and leave office with a record of achievement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The politics was also evident in some of the proposals Clinton made that
have little or no chance of enactment this year. Those included his calls for
campaign finance reform and licensing handgun owners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people will throw that right back into his face,'' said Sen.
Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a member of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton renewed his push for new rights for patients of health maintenance
organizations. He would provide health insurance for millions of low-income
parents -- a $110 billion, 10-year effort -- and let people between 55 and 65
buy into the Medicare medical insurance program. To help them afford that, he
would provide them with a tax credit.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Links With Deutsche Bank  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German telecommunications company Mannesmann AG
plans to join forces with the world's largest bank to launch a new European
service that turns phones into personal bank tellers by combining telephone and
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The venture with Deutsche Bank AG, called Tele-Commerce Bank, is expected to
bolster Mannesmann's e-commerce strategy and strengthen its defense against the
$156 billion hostile takeover bid by rival British telecom Vodafone AirTouch
PLC. At the same time, Mannesmann confirmed that it is seeking a stake in
Internet provider AOL Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an additional argument to shareholders to hold on to Mannesmann,"
said Hermann Reith, a telecom analyst with BHF Bank in Frankfurt, on Friday. "It
shows that Mannesmann is also an Internet company, while Vodafone has nothing
when it comes to the Internet."
</P>
<P>
	   The 50-50 venture between Deutsche Bank and Mannesmann -- which should be up
and running later this year -- will tap Mannesmann's 35 million customers
allowing them to access bank accounts either through fixed line or wireless
phones. It will also combine banking and telephone bills into one monthly
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann will provide the wires, switches, telephones and billing centers.
Deutsche Bank will chip in the financial services. Both partners benefit because
of cost efficiencies and low overhead, Reith said.
</P>
<P>
	   A brokerage service will be added in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone spokesman Barry Wick dismissed the development as "nothing
special," and a normal outgrowth of the growing e-commerce sector.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann confirmed Friday that it was also seeking a stake in AOL Europe,
the continent's No. 2 Internet service provider and a 50-50 venture between
German media giant Bertelsmann AG and U.S.-based America Online.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann said it considers closer cooperation with Bertelsmann a "very
interesting" idea, especially since it would give Mannesmann better access to
the company's vast storehouse of books, videos and music.
</P>
<P>
	   But company would not comment on whether it was looking for a one-third
stake in AOL Europe for $7.4 billion, as reported in the German business daily
Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been in talks for some time," spokesman Manfred Soehnlein said. "At
this stage, we can't comment on the details."
</P>
<P>
	   While such a move would not outright block Vodafone's takeover bid, it could
back up Mannesmann's defense that the company is better off going alone with its
mixed strategy of wireless, fixed line and Internet services -- as opposed to
Vodafone's sole reliance on mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann spokesman Manfred Soehnlein said the recent Internet expansion is
part of the company's long-term strategy, not a response to Vodafone's takeover
bid. He added that the company's projections for growth and increased value are
better reasons for shareholders to hold on to their stakes instead of selling
out to Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann shareholders have until Feb. 7 to decide whether to accept
Vodafone's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in Mannesmann dropped 0.3 percent to 268.20 euros ($262.83), while
Deutsche Bank was down 0.83 percent to 78.54 euros ($76.96). Vodafone shares
fell just 3 cents to $5.63.

	   A new ruling is scheduled to be handed down later, the Houston Chronicle
reported Friday, and legal experts said it was unclear what impact the new
ruling would have in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Last May, Los Angeles U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Samuel L. Bufford said Ms.
Smith, a former Playmate of the Year, was entitled to an estimated $820 million
from the estate of her late husband, Texas oilman J. Howard Marshall II.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, there's been a debate about whether Bufford has jurisdiction on
the matter because a county probate court is scheduled to divide the estate in
an upcoming Houston trial.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Harris County Probate Judge Mike Wood told lawyers he believes
Bufford withdrew his order because he realized he has no jurisdiction. Wood has
said only his court has jurisdiction over claims to Marshall's fortune.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Smith went to Bufford's court in October. Her lawyer said fraudulent
handling of her husband's estate had left her broke.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Smith was 26 when she married the 89-year-old billionaire in 1994.
Before he died 14 months later, her attorney said, he talked to two lawyers
about assuring half of his estate would go to his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   That scenario was called a "fantasy" by a lawyer for Marshall's son, E.
Pierce Marshall.

<TEXT>
<P>
    WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Actress Joanne Woodward has joined the leadership of
the Westport Country Playhouse as the theater tries to move from a summer-stock
repertoire toward new works with more eclectic appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodward will head the theater's new artistic advisory council to develop a
new strategy for the 70-year-old summer theater.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am thrilled to have an opportunity to work with a collective of artists
that will shape the programming future of the playhouse," Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 69-year-old actress, who won the best-actress Oscar for the 1957 film
"The Three Faces of Eve," and her husband, Paul Newman, live in Westport. They
appeared at the theater last year in a production of A.R. Gurney's "Love
Letters" to benefit a regional land trust.
</P>
<P>
	   The theater is getting new management following last week's resignation of
James B. McKenzie, who was executive producer of the playhouse for 41 years.

<HEADLINE> Bergen County eyeing minor league baseball stadium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Bergen County authorities are considering a
proposal to build a minor league baseball stadium in a county park near routes
95 and 80.
<P>
	   Steven Kalafer, the co-owner of the Somerset Patriots, wants to build a $22
million stadium in Overpeck Park. It would house the Bergen Cliff Hawks, an
expansion team of the independent Atlantic League.
</P>
<P>
	   The league already has teams in Brigdewater, Newark and Atlantic City, and
has proposed adding New Jersey franchises in Camden as well as Bergen County. It
also has teams in New Hampshire, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Bergen County Executive William "Pat" Schuber on Thursday formed a 15-member
task force to consider Kalafer's proposal. Key details still have to be worked
out, including how much local taxpayers would have to pay for the facility.
</P>
<P>
	   'I want this to be as taxpayer-neutral as possible," Schuber said Friday.
"We have to explore the feasibility of a stadium here and see if we have any
access or environmental issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Kalafer said he'd like Bergen County to pay for construction of the stadium.
He said local governments' experiences with building stadiums in Trenton,
Somerset and Atlantic City has shown they can be built for a predictable cost.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want it to be a public-private partnership that proves acceptable to
both sides," Kalafer said. "They would be responsible for the baseball park. I'd
be responsible for the team, marketing the team and providing upgrades and
amenities for the stadium."
</P>
<P>
	   The 5,000 to 6,500-seat stadium would be built on one of two proposed sites
in the park, which straddles several municipalities. The preferred site is on
the Palisades Park-Leonia border, with an alternate site across the Overpeck
Creek in Ridgefield Park.
</P>
<P>
	   Schuber said he likes what he's seen of the proposal so far.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bergen County is the biggest county in the state," he said. "It's a natural
market and there's always been great support for baseball here. People are not
going to abandon the Yankees or Mets for minor league baseball, but this is an
affordable alternative.
</P>
<P>
	   "I see families with kids interacting with the players, which you never see
in the major leagues," he said. "It's like taking baseball back where it should
be. I like the idea of that."
</P>
<P>
	   Kalafer said Bergen County is one of the most fertile potential locations
for minor league baseball in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given its population, demographics and income, Bergen County is an
absolutely natural area to support a baseball team," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schuber said the task force will hold 12 public hearings on the proposal
over the next three months.
</P>
<P>
	   Any plan must be approved by the county freeholder board, some of whose
members expressed skepticism. Freeholder James Sheehan called the idea "dumb."
And Freeholder Dennis McNerney questioned whether it would be appropriate to
spend county money on such a project.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlantic League is not affiliated with major league baseball, and
therefore is not subject to territorial restrictions that keep affiliated clubs
out of the geographic areas near major league teams.
</P>
<P>
	   The league will enter its third season this spring, and also has teams in
Bridgeport, Conn., Easton Pa., and Nashua, N.H. Expansion franchises are also
planned for Plainview, N.Y., and Aberdeen, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalafer said he already has obtained permission from the Atlantic League to
own two franchises, provided the business operations of each are kept separate.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey also has minor league teams in Trenton, Little Falls, and
Augusta.

<HEADLINE> John Irving Wrestled With Writing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Novelist John Irving says there's something positive in
knowing what your limitations are.
</P>
<P>
	   He learned that both as a wrestler and a writer.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was kind of a blow to me to discover early on in my wrestling career
that despite my technical superiority and my excellent condition, somebody who
was not my equal in those capacities but just was a marvelous athlete would get
the better of me in certain situations," Irving told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving, who wrote "The World According to Garp" and the screenplay for his
novel "The Cider House Rules," also said he learned early on that his dyslexia
made him make more mistakes than other students and that every assignment would
take him twice the time it took them.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the long run it helped him as a writer because he accepted that
"everything you do you have to do again, and your capacity for rewriting is the
only thing that separates you from people who do things in a hurry."

<HEADLINE> Army Recruiters Seek Star Backing  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is hoping Hollywood star power can put a
shine on its recruiting pitch.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that he and his wife, Janet,
have approached about a dozen movie stars, film producers and other celebrities
to do public service announcements promoting the military on radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're looking for every which way we can to reach out and touch those
young people we need to come into the military,'' Cohen said in an interview in
his Pentagon office.
</P>
<P>
	   The celebrity pitch is one way.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those the Cohens have approached recently: Movie stars Harrison Ford
and Julia Roberts, as well as Tom Cruise, who starred in the 1986 movie ``Top
Gun'' about a Navy F-14 pilot; movie producer Steven Spielberg, who is working
on a TV drama series about the Marine Corps; and actor James Brolin, who plays
Marine Corps Lt. Col. Bill Kelly on the syndicated TV series ``Pensacola: Wings
of Gold.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most expressed an interest in doing public service announcements for the
military, Cohen said, but none has given a firm commitment. He said he hoped to
begin the ads this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Department has long cast celebrities in the role of morale
boosters for troops stationed abroad, but Cohen believes Hollywood also can help
military recruiters reach young people who might not otherwise consider joining
the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Recruiting has been a struggle for the military in recent years, in part
because the booming economy gives young people more alternatives. The military
is trying to find new avenues to approach potential recruits. Cohen's idea of
using celebrities to pitch the advantages of a military career is one such
approach.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also sees an expanded role for celebrities in the Pentagon's campaign
to retain more troops already in uniform. In December, he took a group of
celebrities, including former National Football League stars Terry Bradshaw and
Mike Singletary, model Christie Brinkley and MTV's ``Downtown'' Julie Brown to
Kosovo and Bosnia to meet with U.S. troops on peacekeeping duty.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he has talked to Fox TV about the possibility of broadcasting an
NFL pre-game show next season from aboard a Navy aircraft carrier.

<HEADLINE> City puts welfare recipients on psychic payroll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Somewhere, Dionne Warwick is wondering why she didn't
think of this.
<P>
	   New York welfare recipients are now getting jobs with the Psychic Network, a
telephone pay service which offers clairvoyance at $4.99 a minute. The company
teaches the welfare clients to read tarot cards and offer a peek into the future
for callers, the city Human Resources Administration confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   This raises some obvious questions (and punch lines) best left to late-night
television monologues. But HRA spokeswoman Ruth Reinecke said the jobs, while
odd-sounding, are actually not strange at all.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pay is rather good, and it's attractive to work out of the home for the
mothers who have young children," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The qualifications are a high school diploma and the ability to read, write
and speak English; the pay starts at $10 an hour, plus bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen people were hired by the network since April under the city's effort
to move people from welfare to work - although it's not clear if Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani foresaw this development when he started the program in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The city refused to provide any information about the Psychic Network,
citing a confidentiality agreement with companies that participate in the
"workfare" program.
</P>
<P>
	   The HRA offices received a large number of calls about the plan after The
New York Times first reported the psychic connection. A Pittsburgh radio
reporter trying to track down an HRA spokeswoman said the report was the subject
of "great mirth" in the Steel City.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in the HRA offices Friday was laughing when she answered another
reporter's call. "Is this about the psychics?" she intuitively inquired.
</P>
<P>
	   While the 900-number services are a quirky business, they are legitimate.
Their ads must run with a required disclaimer that the calls are strictly for
entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to track down the owner of the Psychic Network could require the use
of tea leaves. The only phone listing under the name is a Florida bookstore that
has no connection to the telephone business.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, there was no listing for the Psychic Network. Attempts to reach
the company telepathically were also unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
	   The psychic phone lines, often advertised on late-night television or via
informercials, haven't drawn this much attention since the Psychic Friends
Network filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Psychic Friends - actually Inphomation Communication Inc. - were
best-known for the 30-minute informercials hosted by singer Dionne Warwick.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Cuts Dividend in Half  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH HETTENA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. slashed its dividend in half
Friday, continuing a belt-tightening that already includes plans for 2,800 new
job cuts in an attempt to reverse setbacks at its aerospace and aviation
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's second-largest defense business after Boeing Co. also reported
fourth-quarter earnings, after excluding one-time gains, fell 20 percent from a
year earlier, matching Wall Street's diminished expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed officials reiterated a warning first made in October year that the
bleak financial picture would continue into the new year, but projected gains in
the years to come.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a very strong conviction that the year 2000 will be the low point
for earnings and cash generation for this corporation," chief financial officer
Robert J. Stevens told analysts in a telephone conference call Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed stock, which fell 3 percent on Thursday, was off an additional 1.6
percent in afternoon trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, dropping 31
1/4 cents to $19.12 1/2 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutting quarterly dividend payments from 22 cents a share to 11 cents,
effective with the payout due March 31, is the latest in a series of measures
aimed at improving the bottom line. Reducing the dividend frees up about $180
million, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consistent with our previously announced focus on reducing debt, it is
prudent to change the dividend at this time," said Vance Coffman, the chairman
and chief executive of the Bethesda, Md.-based maker of rockets, satellites and
the F-16 fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the company announced it was eliminating 2 percent of its
140,000 jobs worldwide. Lockheed said the new cuts of 2,800 jobs in its aircraft
and rockets businesses would produce $200 million in annual savings. The latest
retrenchment brings the total number of jobs eliminated in recent months to
4,500.
</P>
<P>
	   "The purpose of these actions is to drive down indirect and administrative
costs to improve earnings and cash flow and reduce debt while improving focus on
these businesses," Coffman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed said it was considering whether to add another subsidiary, Lockheed
Martin IMS, to the list of eight company businesses on the auction block. The
Teaneck, N.J.-based unit, which had sales of $500 million last year, provides
services to government, including child-support collection and ticketing drivers
caught on red-light cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials also said they planned to close a deal to acquire
Bethesda-based Comsat Corp. in the first six months of 2000. Lockheed bought 49
percent of the satellite service provider last year, but cannot purchase the
rest until Congress changes Comsat's ownership rules to allow it. The House and
Senate are expected to begin working out final legislation next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts gave mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
	   "All the bad news is out. We think the stock is in the midst of a
turnaround," said Jeff Pittsburg of Pittsburg Institutional Inc., who is
advising his clients to buy the stock. "I think the dividends, the layoffs,
they're trying to create the cash flow. They're telling you they're going to
generate a lot of cash and that's very important."
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Nisbet of JSA Research Inc., has a hold on the stock, which he says is
in "limbo."
</P>
<P>
	   "The prospects as they have outlined them to us certainly aren't very
bright," he said. "It doesn't exactly exude confidence."
</P>
<P>
	   For the fourth quarter of 1999, Lockheed reported earnings of $293 million,
or 76 cents a share, compared with $125 million, or 33 cents a share, in the
same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
	   Profit in the latest quarter included $102 million, or 17 cents a share, in
one-time gains from the sale of surplus real estate, noncore businesses and the
company's stock in L3 Communication Holdings. The earnings of 59 cents, after
eliminating the unusual gains, met the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Lockheed earned $382 million or 99 cents a share, compared
with $1 billion or $2.63 a share in 1998. Excluding one-time charges, earnings
for 1999 would have been $1.50 vs. $2.99 for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, the company cut its earnings forecast for 2000 by more than half
to about $1 per share, and Lockheed saw its stock lose nearly half its value.
</P>
<P>
	   But the company also said it expected earnings per share to grow at an
annual rate of 15 percent to 25 percent in the near term, with growth at the
lower end of the range in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed's problems have been aggravated by troubles in its space systems
business. There have been several rocket launch failures as well as satellite
delays and the loss of satellite contracts, such as a long-held U.S. spy
satellite contract, reportedly worth $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of the company's flagship aircraft, the F-16 fighter jet, have
dwindled. Lockheed delivered 109 of the planes in 1998, down from 150 in the
previous year. The company now is almost entirely dependent on foreign
sales.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Sinks on Snowfall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat prices skidded lower Friday on the Chicago
Board of Trade after snowy weather struck the southern Plains
states and much of the nation's winter wheat crop. Other grains and
soybeans also fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat was pressured by the significant precipitation recorded in
much of the U.S. wheat-growing region the day before, which
somewhat alleviated concerns about crop dryness. A decline in corn
and soybean prices added to the selling mood.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn poked higher early in the session on stronger-than-expected
weekly export sales as reported by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. But the overall slump in agricultural commodities and
a yen for profit-taking pushed it back under by day's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans lost ground after USDA figures showed U.S. export sales
had dropped 72 percent from the previous week. Adding to the
pressure were forecasts for wetter, slightly more beneficial crop
weather in key growing regions of Brazil and Argentina over the
next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.59 3/4 a bushel; March
corn fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.23 1/2 a bushel; March oats fell  1/2 cent to
$1.13 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $5.23 1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef and pork futures rose in trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   February live cattle rose .20 cent to 69.72 cents a pound; March
feeder cattle rose .02 cent to 84.77 cents a pound; February lean
hogs rose .90 cent to 57 cents a pound; February pork bellies rose
.90 cent to 87.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Painting that helped topple S&AMP;L is sold at Sotheby's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - It was art vs. money - and the art survived, albeit at a
hefty price.
<P>
	   An Old Master painting that helped topple a Florida savings-and-loan was
auctioned at Sotheby's on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Paul Rubens' "Portrait of a Man as Mars" sold for $8.2 million,
attached to a turbulent past: It had been purchased with the federally insured
deposits of the mismanaged Miami thrift for its high-living chairman, who is now
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is the most important Rubens to come on the auction market in the last
generation," says Sotheby's spokesman Mathew Weigman.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, Florida banking officials discovered that the 17th century portrait
and two dozen other artworks - a $29 million collection - were purchased with
funds from the strapped CenTrust Savings and Loan. The buyer was David L. Paul,
the S&AMP;L's art-collecting chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
	   He had paid $13.2 million for the Rubens, with Sotheby's acting as agent for
Rush Kress, widow of Samuel Kress, founder of the five-and-dime store, according
to The Wall Street Journal. Sotheby's would not confirm the figure, saying this
was a private sale.
</P>
<P>
	   But it also was a high-profile sale, and it helped destroy the thrift CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul was in the spotlight: He had bought art for the S&AMP;L without first
seeking special permission. And the collection was the lesser expense; Paul had
charged up about $45 million in personal expenses with CenTrust money.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, after CenTrust stopped paying dividends, it was taken over by the
federal government in one of the biggest American savings and loan failures. The
thrift was liquidated and sold to Great Western Bank in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   And in 1994, Paul was convicted in Miami of fraud, conspiracy and
racketeering. He is serving an 11-year sentence in a federal prison in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale of the paintings was ordered by the Florida Department of Banking
and Finance.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, a buyer whose name the auction house did not release paid $8.2
million for the Rubens - a record for this artist at auction that topped a
previous one of about $6 million, paid for his "Samson and Delilah" in 1980 at a
London auction, according to Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
	   "Portrait of a Man as Mars," the image of a man dressed as the god Mars, is
as complex as its recent history.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an intimate picture - a one-on-one with this guy who's ready to speak
to you," says Christopher Apostle, a Sotheby's senior vice president. "It's
painted with such gusto, muscularity. This is a god of war, yet there's a benign
look on his face, full of paradoxes."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Agenda on the Road  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUINCY, Ill. (AP) -- President Clinton took the agenda for his final year in
office to small town America on Friday, saying strong economic times demand
action on Social Security, education, inequality and other long-term challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   The president asked the residents of Quincy to remember how they banded
together in 1993 when flood waters imperiled neighboring communities along the
Mississipppi River -- and how their forefathers harbored slaves seeking freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you have the chance of a lifetime to do good, you cannot be lulled
into complaceny,'' Clinton said, his overcoat collar turned up against the
frigid weather as he spoke in Washington Park, site of the sixth Lincoln-Douglas
debate. The president urged an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand people to
seize ``the challenge of a new era.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got to understand that we're a strong country when we all work
together and we give everyone a chance to rise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With Republicans in control of Congress and the November elections beginning
to steal the political spotlight, the prognosis for Clinton's agenda is not
rosy. But at a White House breakfast with dozens of mayors earlier Friday, the
president said saving the retirement system and improving schools are too
important to be stymied by election-year politics.

<P>
	   ``The further away you move from the grass roots, the more likely politics
is to shift from deeds to words,'' he said, asking the local leaders to join his
cause. ``You mayors can make a difference here.''
</P>
<P>
	   This town of 42,202, named for John Quincy Adams -- who served 17 years in
Congress after leaving the White House -- welcomed Clinton warmly the day after
he delivered his last State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds were on hand at Baldwin Field when the presidential plane arrived.
Local television lingered on every handshake and positioned cameras along the
motorcade route to broadcast his arrival live.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty ``local heroes,'' from law enforcement officers to teachers and
businessmen, were seated on the platform as Clinton spoke in Washington Park.
</P>
<P>
	   Quincy is home to farmers and manufacturers. A century ago, it provided safe
haven to escaped slaves who made it across the Mississippi River and victims of
religious persecution. In 1993, the community served as a staging area for
relief efforts when flooding overwhelmed nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton chose to visit Quincy, aides said, because it symbolized communities
large and small across the country that have prospered during his
administration. Crime and unemployment have reached historic lows over the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the politically important state of Illinois, unemployment has
declined 3 percent since Clinton took office in 1993, more than 35,000 children
have entered the Head Start program, and crime is down 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The president repeated his call for investing more in education -- from Head
Start to college tuition assistance; shoring up Social Security while paying
down the $3.6 trillion public debt; and spurring investment in areas that have
yet to share in the recent economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can bring free enterprise and hope to people who have never had it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a nod to the farmland surrounding Quincy, Clinton also called anew for
overhaul of federal assistance to farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should be using this time wisely to deal with the long-term
challenges,'' Clinton said. ``That's what I want the American people to
support.''

<HEADLINE> Controversial Bishop John Spong of Episcopal Diocese of Newark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TEANECK, N.J. (AP) - Bishop John Spong, an outspoken supporter of the
ordination of gays and women, and blessings of same-sex unions in the Episcopal
church, retired Friday as head of the Diocese of Newark.
<P>
	   Spong, 68, celebrated one of his final services as bishop at the Glenpointe
Marriott ballroom before hundreds of guests.
</P>
<P>
	   His successor, John Croneberger, will take over the position on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his elevation to bishop in 1976, Spong has raised eyebrows and blood
pressures for his beliefs ranging from women becoming priests to supporting
same-sex marriages to the ordination of openly gay ministers.
</P>
<P>
	   But Spong, a native of Charlotte, N.C. who speaks with the slightest accent,
left the diocese with few words of controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just the next stage of my life," said Spong in an interview on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, I've been a bishop, but also an author and lecturer," he said.
"But in all of my ordained life, it was participating in movements of people
who've been diminished in society, like people of color and gays, that the
church has diminished where I've worked."
</P>
<P>
	   Among those present at Friday's 126th annual convention of the Diocese of
Newark were the Rev. Richard Holloway of Edinburgh, Scotland, dozens of priests,
and Spong's second wife, Christine.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I married Jack, I knew what was ahead," said Christine, who married
Spong in 1990. "When you speak up (for gays), you're going to get hit. You
cannot know gay and lesbian people without wanting to hug them. Some of them
have been thrown out of their homes. I can't imagine throwing my child out of
the house."
</P>
<P>
	   The sermon, given by Holloway, was the story of the priest and the Good
Samaritan, who came across a man who had been robbed and beaten on the road. In
the story, the priest, afraid of being deemed unclean, passes by. But the
Samaritan stopped to care for the unknown man.
</P>
<P>
	   "The point of the parody is that good religion, following traditions in
these developed systems, can now get in the way of us getting to God," said
Holloway. "All of us are walking on the road to Jericho, and we must look for
Him because He is always ahead, and God can be found along the side of the
road."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Cathy Deats, 50, a married priest and mother, stood next to Spong
as a sign language interpreter.
</P>
<P>
	   "He will be sorely missed," said Deats, who was first ordained as a deacon
by Spong three years ago. "I may not agree with everything he says, but I truly
admire and respect him for standing up for what he believes in."
</P>
<P>
	   Deats said she believed in more traditional routines of prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   "It can be boring, I know. And I'm not saying the bishop doesn't pray, but I
believe more strongly in the mystical practices of prayer in the church," said
Deats.
</P>
<P>
	   Croneberger was rector of the Church of the Atonement in Tenafly for 18
years, and a priest for more than 34 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Croneberger, 60, was one of six candidates - all of whom favor ordaining
noncelibate gays and blessing same-sex unions - in a field that included the
Rev. Canon Gene Robinson of New Hampshire, who missed becoming the first openly
gay Episcopal bishop in the nation by several votes.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Spong, he will lecture at Harvard University starting next month, but
has no plans to move from Morris County. His latest book, "Here I Stand," was
published this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Spong, father of three daughters, said he found talking to students a great
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Spong lectured at Lewis &AMP; Clark University in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love the minds of 18- to 23-year-olds," Spong said. "Nothing is sacred
and they asked all kinds of questions."
</P>
<P>
	   There were no questions asked here during the service, but there was a
moment of fear when the Rev. Dana Rose slipped off the back of the riser as
Spong and others were blessing bread and wine. Rose was helped to his feet, and
Spong quickly gave him the sign of the cross.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose, a gay priest who's also black, was ordained first as a deacon by Spong
in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "People say, 'You're a priest and you're gay?"' said Rose, who works for the
gay and lesbian ministry in the diocese. "Now, there are many priests who are
gay, but black? I believe in inclusion of all people, like me, into the church,
just like the bishop."

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Earnings Growth May Slow  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Coca-Cola's targets for earnings growth may have to be
lowered slightly, but the president of the world's largest soft-drink maker also
told Wall Street on Friday that he is optimistic about prospects for the
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas Daft, who has been designated to become chairman and chief executive
of Atlanta-based Coke, and two top lieutenants outlined their vision for the
company during a nearly two-hour presentation to securities analysts in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting came just two days after Coca-Cola announced plans to eliminate
6,000 jobs, or one-fifth of the worldwide work force. The sweeping
reorganization also will give local managers more authority over how best to
sell soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have put our business much closer to where the business actually takes
place," Daft said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola had an especially tough year in 1999. It recalled soft drinks in
several European countries after a health scare, its bid for the French soft
drink brand Orangina was blocked, it was forced to scale back plans to buy
several Cadbury Schweppes brands overseas and its sales in Asia and Latin
America suffered because of regional economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke also faces a suit in which several former employees claimed they were
denied promotions because of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas Ivester unexpectedly announced in December that he would step down
in April after about 2 1/2 years as chairman and chief executive. Daft was
designated to succeed him in those posts and was named president in the interim.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft said the company is reviewing whether it needs to change its annual
growth targets of 15 percent to 20 percent in earnings per share in the wake of
this week's restructuring and has not yet completed the analysis.
</P>
<P>
	   But he told the analysts on Friday that the 17 percent to 18 percent average
implied by the current estimated growth range "is a tad high."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the new average "if there is one, won't be below the mid-teens."
</P>
<P>
	   Marc Cohen, beverage analyst for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., said Daft's comments
"may have allayed concerns that it will move down more."
</P>
<P>
	   But in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Coca-Cola shares
were off an additional $2.25 a share to $57.25. It has fallen more than 13
percent from its closing level of $65.87 1/2 a share on Tuesday, the day before
the restructuring announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft also said he expects 5 percent to 6 percent growth in Coca-Cola's sales
volume of soft-drink concentrate to bottlers, slightly below the target of 7
percent to 8 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
	   That in part reflects the company's decision to reduce the soft-drink
inventories held by its independent bottlers to free money that they can use to
improve operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The inventory reduction will mean Coca-Cola will sell less concentrate to
its bottlers this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a vested interest in having our bottlers be successful," said James
Chestnut, an executive vice president whose responsibilities include finance.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft said he didn't want to estimate what volume growth would be beyond the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   But at another point in a question-and-answer session, he told the analysts
"I'm very optimistic about the growth rates."
</P>
<P>
	   Emanuel Goldman, who follows Coca-Cola for Merrill Lynch, said he was
encouraged by the presentation about the Daft team's candor in discussing its
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have a great sense of the business. They will be disciplined and
flexible. They will be thoughtful but they won't be shy," he said.

<HEADLINE> ISP Launches Bid for Dexter Corp.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. (AP) -- International Specialty Products Inc. is
launching a hostile takeover bid for Dexter Corp., the nation's oldest publicly
traded company after a previous bid worth nearly $1 billion was spurned.
</P>
<P>
	   ISP said Friday it plans to nominate 10 board members "who are committed to
considering and pursuing ISP's offer or a superior proposal" when Dexter has its
annual meeting in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Dexter, a specialty chemicals company, last month rejected a $45-per-share
offer from ISP, which is headed by wealthy investor Samuel J. Heyman. The Dexter
board called the ISP proposal too low.
</P>
<P>
	   Heyman said in a letter to Dexter officials that once he had control of the
board, he intended to allow ISP's $932 million offer to be considered directly
by Dexter shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Windsor Locks-based Dexter said it was reviewing Heyman's letter "and
would respond in due course."
</P>
<P>
	   ISP, of Wayne, N.J., also said it filed a federal lawsuit in Connecticut on
Thursday, seeking to overturn Dexter's "poison pill" takeover defense that makes
it harder for a bid to succeed, and validate its proposed board vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded in 1767 as a cloth mill, Dexter was one of the nation's first
conglomerates by the 1830s. It makes products for the aerospace, electronics,
food packaging, and medical markets. It is the oldest company publicly traded on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Heyman, who owns 75 percent of ISP and about 10 percent of Dexter, has been
critical of Dexter's takeover of Life Technologies Inc. of Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Dexter holds 71 percent of Life Technologies; Heyman owns most of the rest
of the company. He has said he believes Dexter and Life Technologies would be
better off apart.
</P>
<P>
	   ISP makes chemicals, mineral products and filters. Life Technologies makes
supplies for biological research and genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
	   In his letter to Dexter chairman K. Grahame Walker, Heyman said the 10
percent decline in Dexter's stock price since it rejected ISP's offer shows
"Dexter's own shareholders appear to have rejected its business strategy, as
well."
</P>
<P>
	   Under Heyman's proposal, Dexter shareholders would replace the three current
board members up for re-election in April and add seven others, enlarging the
board to 17.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Dexter stock was trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $37.87
1/2, down 31 1/4 cents. ISP stock, also traded on the NYSE, was at $7.50, down
25 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Life Technologies stock, traded over the counter, was at $49 per share, down
12 1/2 cents.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 288.21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks stumbled today amid fresh signs of economic growth
so strong that the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighters are likely to raise
interest rates again when they meet next week. The Nasdaq composite index had
its second-biggest point drop ever.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 288.21, or by 2.6 percent, to close at
10,739.81 in heavy trading, according to preliminary figures. It was the
seventh-biggest point drop ever and left the Dow at its lowest level since Nov.
11.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also posting sizable losses, with the Nasdaq
down 151.29, or by 3.7 percent, at 3,888.27. The only bigger point drop was the
229.41-point plunge on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the session began, the government released two reports that
reinforced expectations that the Fed will intensify its battle against inflation
next week by raising interest rates to slow the U.S. economy. There also are
worries that more increases will follow in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising rates increase the cost of doing business, reducing corporate
profits. Higher rates also could slow consumer spending, which has been a
driving force behind the economy's long expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department on Friday reported that the economy grew at a
sizzling 5.8 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, well
above the 5.1 percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a
5.9 percent rate posted in the last three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, closely
watched by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter,
or faster than the 0.9 percent increase many analysts were expecting. Employment
costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price.

<HEADLINE> UPDATES throughout with city dropping psychic company.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Somewhere, Dionne Warwick knew this would happen.
<P>
	   New York City officials, sensing bad publicity and worse jokes, announced
Friday that they would no longer funnel welfare recipients into jobs with the
Psychic Network. The telephone pay service offered clairvoyance at $4.99 a
minute.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to pull the plug on the psychic connection came hours after the
hiring policy became public knowledge. Since last April, network instructors had
taught 15 welfare clients to read tarot cards and offer their callers a peek
into the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "Though HRA believes people should have the freedom to choose their own
employment, HRA's Business Link has decided to not include the Psychic Network
as one of its participating employers," said a statement from HRA Commissioner
Jason A. Turner.
</P>
<P>
	   These leaves welfare workers applying for employment with a less interesting
selection of jobs from a variety of companies: Rite Aid, Madison Square Garden,
Macy's.
</P>
<P>
	   Not quite the psychic gig, eh?
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, HRA spokeswoman Ruth Reinecke said the jobs, while odd-sounding,
were actually not strange at all.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pay is rather good, and it's attractive to work out of the home for the
mothers who have young children," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The qualifications were a high school diploma and the ability to read, write
and speak English; the pay starts at $10 an hour, plus bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The city refused to provide any information about the Psychic Network,
citing a confidentiality agreement with companies that participate in the
"workfare" program.
</P>
<P>
	   The HRA offices received a large number of calls about the plan after The
New York Times first reported it. A Pittsburgh radio reporter trying to track
down an HRA spokeswoman said the report was the subject of "great mirth" in the
Steel City.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in the HRA offices Friday was laughing when she answered another
reporter's call. "Is this about the psychics?" she intuitively inquired.
</P>
<P>
	   While the 900-number services are a quirky business, they are legitimate.
Their ads must run with a required disclaimer that the calls are strictly for
entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to track down the owner of the Psychic Network could require the use
of tea leaves. The only phone listing under the name is a Florida bookstore that
has no connection to the telephone business.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, there was no listing for the Psychic Network. Attempts to reach
the company telepathically were also unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
	   The psychic phone lines, often advertised on late-night television or via
informercials, haven't drawn this much attention since the Psychic Friends
Network filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 1998.
</P>
<P>

best-known for the 30-minute informercials hosted by singer Dionne Warwick.

<HEADLINE> Dietary Guidelines Revision Debated  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge refused Friday to block a revision of the
government's dietary guidelines despite complaints that nutrition experts
writing it are biased toward the meat and dairy industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups representing vegetarians and racial minorities filed suit last month
against the Clinton administration over the composition of an 11-member advisory
committee of nutrition experts doing the revision. They contended it should have
included at least one representative of people who use federal nutrition
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Judge District Judge James Robertson noted during a hearing that the
committee's proposed revision was unlikely to include any major changes from the
current version. He declined to stop the panel from releasing it, saying there
would be no ``irreparable injury'' in doing so.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee's work, which must be approved by the departments of
Agriculture and Health and Human Services, is expected to be made public in the
next few weeks. The departments are expected to take public comment on the
proposed revision for 60 days before deciding whether to approve it.
</P>
<P>
	   First published in 1980, the guidelines are revised every five years to
reflect the latest developments in scientific research. The committee's revision
will put more emphasis on eating whole grains, fruits and vegetables while
urging reduced consumption of sweets and saturated fat. The guidelines, which
follow the government's food pyramid, will continue to recommend meat and dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
	   Federally funded nutrition programs, including school lunches and Meals on
Wheels, are required to adhere to the recommendations, and they are also widely
used by professionals and dietitians in advising consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and
other groups contends the guidelines emphasize the consumption of meat, dairy
and egg products and ignore the special dietary needs of minority groups,
including blacks who are often lactose intolerant. At least six of the committee
members have ties to the meat and dairy industries through grants or seats on
advisory boards, the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee members are ``very accomplished, distinguished individuals who
are at the top of their fields'' and include a black and Hispanic, said Meredith
Manning, a Justice Department lawyer. She told the judge that the plaintiffs
``are essentially trying to get a major change in food policy enacted through
the judicial branch when they can't get that enacted through the executive and
legislative branches.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley's sharper criticism gets mixed reviews  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LEBANON, N.H. (AP) - Though supporters' views seemed decidedly mixed,
Bill Bradley kept up his aggressive criticism of Al Gore on Friday, questioning
his Democratic rival's truthfulness and portraying him as the kind of politician
who "uses words in a very tricky manner."
<P>
	   "You have to look at every word and every clause," Bradley said in a comment
echoing accusations that critics made about President Clinton during the
Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Bradley supporters have said his new, more confrontational campaign
style has made them uncomfortable, and one questioned him about it face to face.
</P>
<P>
	   "How can you deal with the sleaze factor without yourself going through the
same type of tactic?" asked Sonia Sheridan, who said she was troubled by the new
approach.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think you make a very good point," said Bradley. "When someone
misrepresents your position as Al Gore has done consistently in this campaign,
you call them on it."
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing Gore with an apparent lead just days before Tuesday's New
Hampshire primary, Bradley aides said he would continue his new tack.
</P>
<P>
	   "As voters make up their mind this weekend, we want to make sure they are
aware of the differences," said aide Anita Dunn.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheridan, the supporter who questioned Bradley, wasn't sure how the former
senator should respond to Gore's criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what he should do so that's why I asked him," she said. As for
negative campaigning, she said, "I certainly don't like that tactic but Gore
seems to be zooming because of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Other Bradley supporters at campaign events Friday were less than
enthusiastic about his new approach.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes me uncomfortable," said Belinda Glennie. "I'd rather see him be
the egghead he is."
</P>
<P>
	   "I've heard good reviews and I've heard bad reviews," said Nick Hanlon, who
attended a rally in Newport. "I hope it doesn't turn people off."
</P>
<P>
	   Unfazed, Bradley argued at rally after rally that Gore makes campaign
promises designed to be evasive or to mislead on issues ranging from gun control
to health care to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, Bradley said Gore talks about favoring licensing of handguns
but actually favors licensing of new handguns only.
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem is not new handguns, the problem is all handguns," Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said little in response. "I'm going to emphasize the positive," the
vice president said as he arrived in Portsmouth from his brief return to
Washington for Clinton's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to get down to that level. I'm going to continue to emphasize
a positive agenda," he said later in an interview with WNDS-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Accompanied by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Gore stuck to his
day's message - that he is the only presidential candidate with the know-how to
keep the economy on track.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have just begun to prosper," he declared.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on a positive note, his campaign previewed for reporters a 30-minute ad
it will air on New Hampshire television Saturday. Besides commercials that have
already been running, it includes new scenes - Gore playing Frisbee with his
wife and dancing with his daughter at her wedding - showing him as a loving
husband and father.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the people at Gore's Portsmouth event, Bradley's recent criticism
seemed to have made an impact.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Northern Research and Engineering Corp., engineer Dave Glista, a
Democrat from Durham, said he was undecided but leaning toward Bradley, even
though his priority issues - the economy and urban sprawl - should put him in
Gore's camp.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone says Clinton is the king of smooth talking and political talking.
I'm sure Gore has picked up some of that, so I would be more leery of what he
says," Glista said.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Gore accuses Bradley of negative campaigning sparked by
desperation.
</P>
<P>
	   Undecided Democrat Amos Johnson had her own doubts.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm more interested in the issues," Ms. Johnson said. "This is a bit
abrasive. We're going to go see Al Gore tomorrow and we'll make up our mind."
</P>
<P>
	   Along the way Friday, Bradley collected the endorsement of Connecticut Gov.
Lowell Weicker. Weicker was a Republican senator before winning the governor's
office as an independent.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Bradley's strengths is his appeal to independent voters, and he was
hoping to use Weicker's backing to score points with independents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Weicker aimed his pitch in their direction: "The only independent thinker
and actor out there is Bill Bradley."

<HEADLINE> Stocks Dive: Dow Ends Down 289.15  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks staged a sharp decline today as fresh inflation news
sparked a wave of "sell" cries on Wall Street, with banks, industrial and
technology companies bearing the brunt of the bad news.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 289.15 points, or by 2.6 percent,
to 10,738.87, led lower by General Electric, General Motors and J.P. Morgan.
That selling spree brought the week's loss to 512.84 points and left the Dow at
its lowest level since Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   An underlying worry of many investors is expectations that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates when it meets next week, and again later in
the year, curbing business expansion by making it more expensive to borrow
money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index suffered its second-biggest point drop ever as
investors dumped shares of the usual favorites like Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle.
The broad market indicator, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, also fell.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 38.41 to 1,360.15, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 152.61 to 3,886.95.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1 on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 2,082 down, 984 up and 469 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.076 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.115 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 12.40 to 504.62.
</P>
<P>
	   "With that news this morning, buyers just walked away and will wait for the
Fed," said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. "The market will
be weak, looking for direction, until everybody knows what the Fed is doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Before the session began, the government released two reports that
reinforced expectations that Fed officials will intensify their battle against
inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 5.8
percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, well above the 5.1
percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 5.9 percent
rate posted in the last three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, closely
watched by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter,
or more than the 0.9 percent increase many analysts were expecting. Employment
costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price.
</P>
<P>
	   Those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug
along despite three increases in lending rates by the Fed since June. The
central bank's policy-makers meet again on Tuesday and Wednesday. But more
pivotal to the market than the expected rate boost may be the accompanying
statement on the Fed's stance going forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Consequently, interest-rate sensitive bank stocks took a beating today, most
notably J.P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan Bank and Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
	   Industrial companies, which are especially vulnerable to economic cycles,
also saw their shares fall today.

<HEADLINE> Ad To Push Cholesterol Drugs  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Phil Sokolof, the Omaha industrialist who successfully
pressured the fast food industry to serve healthier meals, is now pushing
cholesterol-lowering pills.
</P>
<P>
	   He's paying $2.5 million for a fourth-quarter advertisement on the Super
Bowl to promote "the miracle drugs."
</P>
<P>
	   In the commercial, Sokolof says three out of four people with heart disease
are not taking enough of the cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins.
</P>
<P>
	   About 8 million Americans now take statins, but health experts say as many
as 30 million would benefit, arguing that statins reduce cholesterol far better
than even the most draconian diet and exercise programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Statins keep arteries from clogging and may even reverse the process.
Studies show people on statins lower their risk of heart attacks by about
one-third and they live longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Sokolof, 78, who had a heart attack when he was 43, credits statins for
helping him stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
	   This not Sokolof's first crusade. In the early 1990s, Sokolof ran newspaper
ads exposing hidden sources of saturated fat and he successfully persuaded
McDonald's Corp. to stop frying its French fries in animal fat.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, he went after the drug industry's profits, partially because of the
high prices on cholesterol pills.
</P>
<P>
	   "THE GOUGING OF AMERICA," blared the headline on the full-page ads. "MERCK,
HOW GREEDY CAN YOU GET?."
</P>
<P>
	   Ironically, drug companies such as Merck &AMP; Co. stand to gain if Sokolof's
Super Bowl ad spurs demand for cholesterol drugs. Merck makes Zocor, a leading
cholesterol-lowering drug.
</P>
<P>
	   To further spread his message, Sokolof said he plans to take out full-page
ads in major newspapers in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to reach as many people as I can and this is the only program more
people turn into to watch the ads than the game," he said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Orders Markets To Use Decimals  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on Friday ordered the nation's stock
exchanges to begin quoting at least some share prices in dollars and cents by
July 3, requiring them to fully abandon the 200-year-old use of fractions by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market and other U.S.
securities exchanges will be required to submit a decimal pricing plan within 45
days and to have decimal prices fully phased in by year's end, the Securities
and Exchange Commission said in announcing its order.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchanges have been putting together plans for phasing in decimal prices
this year, now that the securities industry has cleared the Year 2000
technological hurdle.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC normally refrains from intervening in the markets. Spokesmen for the
Securities Industry Association didn't immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Decimal trading will benefit investors by allowing greater competition and
making it easier to compare prices," SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said in a
statement. "It will also bring about consistency with foreign markets, which now
trade in decimals. We look forward to working with the industry to ensure that
the transition to decimals goes smoothly."
</P>
<P>
	   As an interim step, the nation's two biggest exchanges -- the NYSE and the
all-electronic Nasdaq -- and some regional exchanges have been quoting stocks in
minimum increments of one-sixteenth of a dollar, instead of the customary
one-eighths. In decimals, a sixteenth is 6.25 cents and an eighth is 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say adopting the decimal system would narrow the difference
between a stock's best bid and asking prices, known as the spread. Spreads
typically vary from 12 1/2 cents to 50 cents, an amount that adds up to a
sizable profit for brokers, who take in a percentage based on the size of the
spread.
</P>
<P>
	   Some stocks will begin trading in nickel increments, though many could be
trading in penny increments by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the decimalization argue that a narrower spread will increase
the competitiveness and efficiency of markets, increase trading volume and
improve liquidity.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, critics have said the narrower spreads in decimal trading would
erode profits, something that could reduce the number of market makers, the
firms which form a market's backbone.
</P>
<P>
	   Market makers trade for their own accounts and agree to process customers'
orders for particular stocks. A sharp drop in market makers could hurt an
exchange's ability to handle high-volume trading sessions.

<HEADLINE> Mexico City Cops Protest Salary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Hundreds of riot police blocked Mexico City streets
Friday to demand salary raises and other benefits, clogging key thoroughfares
and causing traffic jams that stretched for miles.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the morning rush hour began, uniformed officers parked buses at
intersections and erected barricades to block main thoroughfares, wreaking havoc
for commuters.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers want 100 percent salary increases, better equipment and
benefits. They also called for the dismissal of their commander, the Televisa
network reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico City Mayor Rosario Robles said the protest was unjustified but
acknowledged that an accounting error had delayed paychecks for the officers,
the government news agency Notimex reported. She said the problem would be
resolved by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesting officers said they would continue the blockade until city
authorities discussed their demands.
</P>
<P>
	   In the afternoon, traffic was congested even further by another street
protest by administrative workers from the Autonomous University of Chapingo.
The demonstrators, who were demanding wage increases, walked onto the main
freeway that circles Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   For two hours, the university workers blocked traffic in both directions on
the Perifico Sur. Riot police who remained on duty during their colleagues'
protest were called in to dislodge the workers, Notimex reported.

<HEADLINE> Controversial Bishop John Spong of Episcopal Diocese of Newark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TEANECK, N.J. (AP) - Bishop John Spong, an outspoken supporter of the
ordination of gays and women, and blessings of same-sex unions in the Episcopal
church, retired Friday as head of the Diocese of Newark.
<P>
	   Spong, 68, celebrated one of his final services as bishop at the Glenpointe
Marriott ballroom before hundreds of guests.
</P>
<P>
	   His successor, John Croneberger, will take over the position on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his elevation to bishop in 1976, Spong has raised eyebrows and blood
pressures for his beliefs ranging from women becoming priests to supporting
same-sex marriages to the ordination of openly gay ministers.
</P>
<P>
	   But Spong, a native of Charlotte, N.C. who speaks with the slightest accent,
left the diocese with few words of controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just the next stage of my life," said Spong in an interview on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, I've been a bishop, but also an author and lecturer," he said.
"But in all of my ordained life, it was participating in movements of people
who've been diminished in society, like people of color and gays, that the
church has diminished where I've worked."
</P>
<P>
	   Among those present at Friday's 126th annual convention of the Diocese of
Newark were the Rev. Richard Holloway of Edinburgh, Scotland, dozens of priests,
and Spong's second wife, Christine.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I married Jack, I knew what was ahead," said Christine, who married
Spong in 1990. "When you speak up (for gays), you're going to get hit. You
cannot know gay and lesbian people without wanting to hug them. Some of them
have been thrown out of their homes. I can't imagine throwing my child out of
the house."
</P>
<P>
	   The sermon, given by Holloway, was the story of the priest and the Good
Samaritan, who came across a man who had been robbed and beaten on the road. In
the story, the priest, afraid of being deemed unclean, passes by. But the
Samaritan stopped to care for the unknown man.
</P>
<P>
	   "The point of the parable is that good religion, following traditions in
these developed systems, can now get in the way of us getting to God," said
Holloway. "All of us are walking on the road to Jericho, and we must look for
Him because He is always ahead, and God can be found along the side of the
road."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Cathy Deats, 50, a married priest and mother, stood next to Spong
as a sign language interpreter.
</P>
<P>
	   "He will be sorely missed," said Deats, who was first ordained as a deacon
by Spong three years ago. "I may not agree with everything he says, but I truly
admire and respect him for standing up for what he believes in."
</P>
<P>
	   Deats said she believed in more traditional routines of prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   "It can be boring, I know. And I'm not saying the bishop doesn't pray, but I
believe more strongly in the mystical practices of prayer in the church," said
Deats.
</P>
<P>
	   Croneberger was rector of the Church of the Atonement in Tenafly for 18
years, and a priest for more than 34 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Croneberger, 60, was one of six candidates - all of whom favor ordaining
noncelibate gays and blessing same-sex unions - in a field that included the
Rev. Canon Gene Robinson of New Hampshire, who missed becoming the first openly
gay Episcopal bishop in the nation by several votes.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Spong, he will lecture at Harvard University starting next month, but
has no plans to move from Morris County. His latest book, "Here I Stand," was
published this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Spong, father of three daughters, said he found talking to students a great
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Spong lectured at Lewis &AMP; Clark University in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love the minds of 18- to 23-year-olds," Spong said. "Nothing is sacred
and they asked all kinds of questions."
</P>
<P>
	   There were no questions asked here during the service, but there was a
moment of fear when the Rev. Dana Rose slipped off the back of the riser as
Spong and others were blessing bread and wine. Rose was helped to his feet, and
Spong quickly gave him the sign of the cross.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose, a gay priest who's also black, was ordained first as a deacon by Spong
in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "People say, 'You're a priest and you're gay?"' said Rose, who works for the
gay and lesbian ministry in the diocese. "Now, there are many priests who are
gay, but black? I believe in inclusion of all people, like me, into the church,
just like the bishop."

<HEADLINE> France's Ex-Finance Minister Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A former French finance minister has been placed under formal
investigation for alleged financial wrongdoing in connection with French oil
company Elf-Aquitaine, his lawyer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The order by two judges to put former Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn under formal investigation means he is one step short of being
charged. Lawyer Jean Veil confirmed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges, Eva Joly and Laurence Vichnevsky, are looking into accusations
of widespread fraud at Elf in the early 1990s. The oil company confirmed Friday
that it had lost the equivalent of $3.5 billion between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors want to investigate allegations that Strauss-Kahn's personal
secretary, Evelyne Duval, received one year's salary worth $31,500 from the oil
company in 1993. Duval was not working for Strauss-Kahn at the time of the
alleged payment, but at a business group that Strauss-Kahn had founded.
</P>
<P>
	   It was another blow for Strauss-Kahn, who is already under investigation for
allegedly taking the equivalent of an estimated $100,000 for a fictitious job
with a student insurance fund, the MNEF.
</P>
<P>
	   Strauss-Kahn, who was a powerful figure in Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's
government, resigned in November after the scandal broke.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Merger Bid Under Review  </HEADLINE>
    By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- BP Amoco extended its deadline Friday for acquiring
Atlantic Richfield Co., apparently trying to give a skeptical Federal Trade
Commission more time to review the company's revised merger proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC had scheduled a meeting for Monday at which the agency had been
widely expected to direct its staff to try to block the merger in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   But Friday, the FTC postponed the meeting. A short time later, BP announced
extension to Feb. 7 of its self-imposed deadline for the merger.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said in a statement that it agreed "to extend the 20-day clock
... in order to give the Federal Trade Commission time to consider internally
whether they believe there is common ground to commence negotiations."
</P>
<P>
	   FTC officials would not comment on the merger. BP Amoco spokesman Tom Koch
said the company had no comment beyond the one-paragraph statement.
</P>
<P>
	   While commissioners still could act on the merger at its meeting now
rescheduled for next Wednesday, BP Amoco's decision to extend the 20-day clock
suggested efforts were under way to try to avoid a lengthy court fight.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco's chairman, Sir John Browne, reportedly made new suggestions to FTC
Chairman Robert Pitofsky this week in a last-ditch attempt to keep the agency
out of court. A short time later, the FTC postponed its scheduled meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   No details of Browne's discussion were available Friday. While it was not
clear whether Browne's overture was enough to sway the agency, BP Amoco's Friday
statement suggested the FTC was considering new offers.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco's purchase of Atlantic Richfield Co., or Arco as it is commonly
known, has been in trouble at the FTC for weeks. The FTC staff recommended in
December against approving the merger because of worries that the combined
company would be able to dictate prices in the West Coast gasoline market.
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies control 70 percent of the oil produced on Alaska's North
Slope. While BP Amoco has agreed to divest some of the Alaska petroleum
production and make other concessions, the new company still would control 55
percent of Alaskan oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC staff has argued that such dominance could hurt competition in the
retail gasoline market in California and the Northwest, where refiners depend
heavily on Alaskan crude.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Jan. 14, the FTC staff has shifted from trying to negotiate a
settlement to preparing for litigation, according to sources familiar with the
discussions. The commission had been widely expected to approve, at a meeting
first scheduled for Friday, then Monday and now Wednesday, a request for an
injunction against the merger.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither FTC officials nor BP Amoco executives would comment, although
company officials said Thursday that "discussions" were continuing with the FTC.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Arco have argued that after the divestitures, the new company
would pose no competitive problems because West Coast prices are dictated by the
global oil market and not Alaska production.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only a little over a year ago that British Petroleum sealed the
purchase of Amoco. It then announced in April it wanted to buy Arco.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal is among a number of megamergers in the oil industry. In late
November, the FTC approved the combination of Exxon and Mobil to create the
worlds largest privately owned oil company. Earlier, Texaco and Shell had
combined refining and marketing activities.

<HEADLINE> Citizenship Support for Elian Wanes  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Florida nun selected by Attorney Gen. Janet Reno as a
neutral party in the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez sought unsuccessfully on
Friday to persuade Reno to change her mind about returning the 6-year-old to
Cuba. Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin also backed legislation to make Elian an American
citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   Conceding ``I am no longer neutral,'' O'Laughlin told reporters she has come
to believe that separating Elian now from his Florida relatives would be
``another traumatic loss for him'' after the death of his mother at sea in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   Her abandonment of impartiality was denounced by those seeking Elian's
return to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am bewildered,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. ``Never in my wildest
imagination would I think that a nun who was supposed to be a neutral party
would undermine that neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin, the Barry University president whose Miami Beach home was used
earlier in the week for a meeting between Elian and his Cuban grandmothers, said
she now thinks it is in the boy's best interest to stay in this country, at
least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
	   But Reno, a longtime friend, did not back away from her support of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that the boy be returned to his
father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She would only change her mind, I believe, if she could find legal reasons
to change her mind and have adequate evidence that that would be necessary,''
O'Laughlin said outside the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno, after escorting O'Laughlin to the department door, said in a written
statement that she had ``listened to all she had to say. She told me about her
feelings, observations and conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``However,'' Reno said, ``I continue to believe, based on all the
information available to me, including the information that Sister Jeanne shared
with me, that the person who speaks for this child is his one surviving parent
-- his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the stark difference of opinion, the two women remained friendly at
the end of their meeting, O'Laughlin said: ``I left my meeting with Janet Reno
with a gigantic hug, and a promise that we will both keep pursuing the truth as
we see it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The INS ruling has not been carried out because the federal government
agreed to postpone action until the family had an opportunity to challenge it in
court, which Elian's Florida relatives have done, filing a lawsuit in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Miami was holding a hearing Friday to reconsider timing
of the lawsuit after a ruling Thursday that appeared to suggest that a decision
would not be made until March at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said she hoped the case would be ``resolved as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before meeting with Reno, O'Laughlin visited Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., chief
sponsor of the citizenship bill, and announced her support for it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The child has been in the torment of the seas and now he's been in the
torment of political agendas. Somehow we must find for him calm seas, at least
for a while,'' she said. If it takes a congressional act to keep him here, so be
it, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her support for the legislation came just as it appeared to be losing ground
in Congress. Elian's grandmothers made the rounds of Capitol Hill this week
urging the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Mack conceded that the grandmothers' visits had ``affected some of my
colleagues,'' costing potential support for his legislation, but denied that
O'Laughlin's support for it would undermine her credibility or was intended on
his part to counter the grandmothers' visits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't care about politics, we care about our grandson,'' said Mariela
Quintana, the paternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers might return to Cuba this weekend, said the Rev. Joan Brown
Campbell of the National Council of Churches, which has facilitated their
travel.	   The meeting in Reno's office ran more than an hour and a half, twice
the scheduled length. Also present were INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and Peg
Albert, a child psychologist and colleague of Sister Jeanne. The INS is part of
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the center of an international tug of war since he was found
clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and others
traveling with him from Cuba had drowned.

<HEADLINE> Canada Party Would Impose Flat Tax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A new political party bidding to unite Canada's conservatives
would impose a flat tax and keep the country's two official languages -- English
and French.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates to a convention in the capital were deciding the name and policies
of the new party. They also debated tougher law enforcement and immigration
measures Friday, calling for more police on the streets and the immediate
deportation of illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal of the new party is to combine the western-based Reform Party, the
official opposition in Parliament, with supporters of the Conservative Party to
create a rightist movement capable of toppling the governing Liberal Party in
national elections expected in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   But conservative unity has been threatened by internal divisions over who
would lead the new party and whether bedrock Reform supporters in the western
provinces can accept more mainstream policies needed to attract support in
Ontario, the nation's most populous province.
</P>
<P>
	   Policies adopted Friday included the flat-tax system, which supporters say
would exempt more lower-income Canadians from income tax and reduce the rate for
the highest earners who pay the majority of taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Reform Party and the Conservative Party agree on lowering taxes but have
differed over other issues. The Conservative Party has a rich political history
and more moderate views than the Reform Party, which started in 1987 as a
protest movement against what it called the federal government's lack of concern
about western issues.
</P>
<P>
	   In a signal of the new party's direction, the more than 1,000 delegates at
the convention accepted Canada's two national languages of French and English
and recognized the federal government's responsibility to protect minority
language rights. The Reform Party previously opposed special status for the
French language.
</P>
<P>
	   Another proposal Friday would combine the nation's various security and
intelligence-gathering agencies -- including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Foreign Affairs ministry, and
Immigration ministry -- into a single department.
</P>
<P>
	   It also would require the immediate deportation of anyone living illegally
in Canada, instead of the current policy that includes lengthy appeals of
deportation orders.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter what happens at the conference and an accompanying Reform Party
national conference in Ottawa on Saturday and Sunday, the final answer on
whether the new party successfully merges the right won't be known until Reform
Party members vote in March on whether to join up.

<HEADLINE> Thousands attend wing-eating contest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Nearly 14,000 fans gathered in the First Union
Center at the crack of dawn Friday to witness one of the city's wackiest annual
events, a chicken wing-eating contest.
<P>
	   Twenty-two men ranging in size from average to 600-plus pounds competed for
30 minutes to see who could eat the most wings without throwing up. The winner
ate 82 wings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Only in Philly can this happen," said John Thompson, 56, of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   Tollbooth collector Joseph Paul, 48, of Bellmawr, N.J., won a trip to Aruba
for downing 90 wings - though eight were disqualified.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was hard after I started, but I knew I had the lead and I kept digging,"
Paul said.
</P>
<P>
	   Runner-up Hank Foldey of Philadelphia finished 79, while 600-pound Chris
Manger finished third.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's incredible, it's brutal, but I'll be back," Manger said.
</P>
<P>
	   There was debate over whether one contestant threw up, because he had his
hands cupped over his mouth, which would have disqualified him. He was allowed
to remain in the contest.
</P>
<P>
	   The free event, sponsored by WIP radio, is held the Friday prior to the
Super Bowl. It has grown from a six-contestant, 100-fan event in the lobby of a
Center City hotel in 1993 to a day-long celebration.

<HEADLINE> Officials Order Priest To Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
   By ALFONSO ANZUETO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Guatemalan authorities on Friday ordered a priest who
is wanted in connection with the slaying of a bishop to appear before
investigators or face extradition from the United States, where he is living.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Leopoldo Zeissig said Rev. Mario Orantes has three days to
appear before investigators. After that, authorities plan to request his
extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   Orantes, 40, fled to the United States in October after complaining of
threatening telephone calls, according to his lawyer, Jose Toledo, who declined
to specify where in the United States Orantes is living.
</P>
<P>
	   The priest had been jailed from July 1998 to February 1999 by authorities
investigating the death of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi. On Monday,
authorities issued a warrant for his arrest again.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerardi, 75, was found bludgeoned to death in his garage on April 26, 1998,
two days after presenting a human rights report that blamed the Guatemalan
military and pro-government death squads for atrocities committed during the
country's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Church leaders and human rights groups complained while Orantes was being
held that investigators had unjustly focused on the priest while ignoring a
possible link to the military.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, police have arrested a former presidential guard, a
military officer and his father, who is a retired officer, in connection with
the killing. A church cook, Margarita Lopez, who had been jailed briefly in July
1998, also was arrested again.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrests were based on testimony from Ruben Chamax Sontay, a man who was
near the bishop's home on the night of the killing, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The developments followed the Jan. 14 inauguration of President Alfonso
Portillo, who had pledged during his campaign to solve the crime, which he
called ``a national disgrace.''

<HEADLINE> Economic Surge Feeds Inflation Fear  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, propelled by hardy consumer spending,
finished 1999 on a vibrant note, but the growth came at a price: a worrisome
uptick in wages and benefits that economists fear could trigger inflation. Wall
Street plunged.
</P>
<P>
	   During the final three months of 1999, the economy grew at a breakneck
annual rate of 5.8 percent, the biggest growth spurt since the end of 1998, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the nation's gross domestic product, its total output of
goods and services, increased by 4 percent, the third year in a row at 4 percent
or higher.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton boasted about the economy at a White House meeting with
mayors. "This unbelievable recovery marches on," Clinton said, referring to the
uninterrupted economic growth since the 1990-1991 recession that will set a
record of eight years and ten months next week.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, another government report showed Friday that employees'
wages and benefits surged 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, rekindling worries
about inflation and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid these worries, stocks tumbled. The Dow Jones industrial average closed
down 289.15 points to 10,738.87, its lowest level since Nov. 11. The Nasdaq fell
152.50 points to 3,887.06, its second-biggest point loss ever. The bond market
staged a stunning turnaround as jittery investors shifted their money away from
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rising tide of economic growth has stirred up inflation in its wake,"
said Richard Yamarone, an economist with Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   With the roaring economy driving down the nation's unemployment rate to its
lowest point in 30 years, employers are having trouble finding scarce workers to
fill openings. Some employers are wooing workers with higher wages and benefits.
That's good for workers, but economists fear those increased costs could lead to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1.1 percent spike in the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index,
considered the best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs and closely
watched by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, stemmed from a 1.3 percent
jump in benefits, the biggest increase in six years. Economists blamed rising
health care costs for the big increase in benefit costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both reports contain the smoking gun that the Fed has been worried about --
wage pressures are surfacing, and inflation is on the uptick," said First Union
economist David Orr.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve meets next week to decide interest rate policy, and most
economists expect the Fed to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   A few economists said Friday's reports may put pressure on the Fed to bump
up rates by a half a point on Feb. 2. But more economists said the reports raise
the odds that the Fed will follow up next week's expected increase with a
quarter-of-a-point rate boost on March 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the Fed's three rate increases last year, the economy continues to
grow at a rapid pace that some economists fear cannot be sustained without
triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   An inflation gauge tied to GDP rose 1.5 percent in 1999, a worse showing on
inflation than the 0.7 percent increase recorded the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best of inflation news is clearly behind us, and if we keep growth at a
4 percent pace as we did in all of 1999 then the price problems will almost
certainly worsen," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the country's economic
activity, drove 1999's growth, rising 5.3 percent for the year. Plentiful jobs,
rising wages and benefits and stock market gains have made Americans feel
wealthy and put them in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
	   All that spending pushed the nation's savings rate -- savings as a
percentage of disposable income -- to an all-time annual low of 2.4 percent last
year. In 1998, the savings rate was 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   That isn't as dire as it seems, however, because the savings rate doesn't
take into account gains households have realized on their savings from such
factors as rising stock market values and higher real estate values for their
homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Business investment -- spending on new equipment and plants -- increased 8.3
percent last year, down from 12.7 percent in 1998. Rising mortgage rates
dampened housing construction, which rose 7.2 percent in 1999 but wasn't as
brisk as the 9.2 percent increase the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. trade deficit continued to be a drag on the economy, subtracting
1.11 percentage points from growth in 1999. But that was a slight improvement
from the 1.18 percentage-point reduction recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Imports shot up 11.8 percent last year, slightly more than the 11.6 percent
increase posted in 1998. Exports rose 3.5 percent last year, compared with a 2.2
percent rise the year before.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers React to Clinton's Address  </HEADLINE>
   By CAREN BENJAMIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If five years ago the president had proposed simultaneous
tax cuts, spending increases, and reduction of the national debt, Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., said most people would have called the plan ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Today, ``the fact of the matter is, it's a reality. The question now is 'are
we going to seize the day?' '' Kennedy said Thursday in response to President
Clinton's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of New England's heavily Democratic congressional delegation similarly
lauded the speech, which included approximately $350 billion in tax cuts aimed
at married couples and families sending children to college.
</P>
<P>
	   But some, including the region's few Republicans, suggested the package
might be overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to be very curious as to what all these programs add up to
because it sounds quite expensive,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We heard lots of beautiful phrases and so many billions of dollars we
can't even count them,'' said Connecticut Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, both Johnson and Shays saw areas the two parties can work together.
Johnson, for example, was pleased Clinton mentioned pension reform though she'd
rather see a simplification of pension laws than Clinton's proposed incentives
to employers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the president's own party suggested reducing the national debt and
supporting health care, Social Security and education should take precedence
over tax relief. ``When I go around and talk to people they want health
coverage, prescription drugs. No one is talking about tax breaks per se,'' said
Rep. J. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., agreed. ``I don't see anyone clamoring for a tax
cut.'' He suggested the money could be better spent expanding health care
coverage to poor people.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposals aimed at expanding health coverage without creating an
entirely new health system drew praise from Rhode Island Democrat Sen. Jack
Reed. ``I think it's best to build upon the system that we have,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
	   The working poor, many of whom have not shared in the country's financial
success, would also benefits from Clinton's proposal to create tax incentives
for retirement savings accounts, said Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn. ``This
innovative, market-oriented proposal will help change that imbalance and expand
the winner's circle to include many of the families who are not yet sharing in
this unprecedented prosperity,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
	   New England lawmakers also applauded Clinton's promise to spend more on
education including an increase in Pell grants and a tax deduction for college
tuition. The proposals ``mean hundred of new teachers for Massachusetts schools,
and more after-school programs to keep children safe and help them with their
schoolwork,'' said Massachusetts Democrat Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Responsible tax cuts can be balanced with the best economic stimulus we
have ever known; good schools that leave no child behind, national standards and
accountability, and real reform for failing schools,'' agreed Sen. John F.
Kerry, D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Courts Strikes Challenge  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's highest court has struck down a
lawsuit claiming its own magistrates were appointed illegally by a powerful
constitutional assembly overstepping its bounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling Thursday was a setback for critics of President Hugo Chavez who
say he has concentrated power into his own hands and brought the country
dangerously close to dictatorship. But it is also likely to stir further
controversy about the way the president is carrying out his ``social
revolution'' in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   The same lawsuit claimed that a new ``mini-congress,'' the attorney general,
the national comptroller, the public defender and the national electoral council
were all designated illegally. Each of those claims was shot down by Venezuela's
newly created Supreme Tribunal of Justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Since becoming president a year ago, Chavez has pushed through a new
constitution and decimated the two political parties that ruled the South
American nation during 40 years of democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   The new constitution, approved by voters on Dec. 15, calls for the renewal
of all elected powers, but national balloting has been postponed until May
because of last month's massive flooding and landslides that killed thousands of
people on Venezuela's northern coast.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Chavez, a former army paratrooper who staged a failed
military coup eight years ago, will be able to rule Venezuela with virtually no
checks on his power.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, 21 members of a so-called ``mini-Congress'' made up of Chavez
supporters were sworn in. The mini-congress's job will be to perform basic
legislative functions until elections are held for a new legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the high court magistrates, the mini-congress's members were each
handpicked by the Chavez-controlled panel that rewrote the constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   A Venezuelan attorney named Eduardo Garcia presented a lawsuit to the court
saying this was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   But the court ruled that the constitutional assembly had the power to make
the appointments because it was ``given originating power by the Venezuelan
people'' in national elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez and his supporters say the profound changes taking place in
Venezuelan society and politics will root out decades of corruption and crush a
corrupt oligarchy that plunged the oil-rich nation into poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   But the opposition says Chavez has concentrated power into his own hands and
brought the country dangerously close to dictatorship.

	   Stocks Dive: Dow Ends Down 289.15
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks staged a sharp decline today as fresh
inflation news sparked a wave of ``sell'' cries on Wall Street.
Banks, industrial and technology companies bore the brunt of the
bad news. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 289.15 points,
or by 2.6 percent, to 10,738.87, led lower by General Electric,
General Motors and J.P. Morgan. That selling spree brought the
week's Dow loss to 512.84 points and left the Dow at its lowest
level since Nov. 11. An underlying worry of many investors is
expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
when it meets next week, and again later in the year, curbing
business expansion by making it more expensive to borrow money. The
Nasdaq composite index suffered its second-biggest point drop ever
-- down 152.61 at 3,886.95 -- as investors dumped shares of the usual
favorites like Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle.

	   Economy Grows at 5.8 Percent Rate
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew at a 5.8 percent annual
rate during the final three months of 1999 as the country heads
into its longest economic expansion in history. For all of 1999,
the nation's gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and
services -- increased by 4 percent, the Commerce Department said
today. Strength came from hardy consumer spending. In 1998, the
economy grew by 4.3 percent. The fourth-quarter rate was stronger
than the 5.1 percent rate many analysts were forecasting. Robust
consumer spending and a buildup in business inventories added to
1999's fourth-quarter growth, while the trade deficit subtracted
from it. In the third quarter, the economy grew at a 5.7 percent
rate.

	   SEC Orders Markets To Use Decimals
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators today ordered the nation's
stock exchanges to begin quoting at least some share prices in
dollars and cents by July 3, requiring them to fully abandon the
200-year-old use of fractions by year's end. The New York Stock
Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market and other U.S. securities
exchanges will be required to submit a decimal pricing plan within
45 days and to have decimal prices fully phased in by year's end,
the Securities and Exchange Commission said in announcing its
order. The exchanges have been putting together plans for phasing
in decimal prices this year, now that the securities industry has
cleared the Year 2000 technological hurdle.

	   Coca-Cola Earnings Growth May Slow
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Coca-Cola's targets for earnings growth may have
to be lowered slightly, but the president of the world's largest
soft-drink maker also told Wall Street that he is optimistic about
prospects for the company. Douglas Daft, who has been designated to
become chairman and chief executive of Atlanta-based Coke, and two
top lieutenants outlined their vision for the company during a
nearly two-hour presentation to securities analysts in New York.
The meeting came just two days after Coca-Cola announced plans to
eliminate 6,000 jobs, or one-fifth of the worldwide work force. The
sweeping reorganization also will give local managers more
authority over how best to sell soft drinks. Coca-Cola stock was
down 2 9/16 at 56 15/16 today.

	   Lockheed Cuts Dividend in Half
</P>
<P>
	   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. slashed its dividend
in half today -- from 22 cents a share to 11 cents -- effective with
the payout due March 31. The move follows Lockheed's news yesterday
that it is eliminating 2,800 jobs in its troubled aeronautics and
space divisions. The nation's second-largest defense business after
Boeing Co. also reported fourth-quarter earnings, excluding
one-time gains, fell 20 percent from a year earlier, matching Wall
Street's diminished expectations. Lockheed officials reiterated a
warning first made in October year that the bleak financial picture
would continue into the new year, but projected gains in the years
to come. Lockheed shares were at 18 7/8, down 9/16.

Engineering Employees in Aerospace, represents nearly 23,000
employees -- about 11 percent of Boeing's overall work force. SPEEA

reorganization. The cuts, announced last night in a company meeting
at Amazon's Seattle headquarters, represent about 2 percent of
Amazon's entire work force of about 7,500, said spokesman Bill
Curry. The layoffs were not the result of post-Christmas letdowns
or other seasonal fluctuations, Curry said. He said the company
does ongoing organizational reviews to ensure it has the skills and
number of people to carry out its goals. Amazon's stock was down 5 1/4

<HEADLINE> Gore turns deficit into lead; GOP race is close  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - Vice President Al Gore has pulled ahead of Bill
Bradley in New Hampshire polls with a surge of support from men, independents
and registered Democrats. Bradley is working to reverse the trend with
aggressive campaigning.
<P>
	   With four days left until the first-in-the-nation primary, Gore appears to
have taken a boost from his strong campaign in Iowa, which resulted in a
decisive win Monday. Bradley's feisty performance in Wednesday night's debate
could help him, but it's still too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
	   A Dartmouth College-Associated Press poll, released Friday, gives Gore a 54
percent to 40 percent lead over Bradley. The poll was conducted Sunday through
Wednesday, in the days just before and after Gore's victory in the Iowa
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Several other polls, also taken during the days just before the debate,
showed Gore with a double-digit lead, including the Franklin Pierce
College-WNDS-TV poll, which had Gore with a 15-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The last Dartmouth-AP poll two weeks ago had Bradley at 49 percent and Gore
at 43, a slight edge for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Republican race, the latest Dartmouth-AP poll had John McCain in a
virtual tie with George W. Bush, 37 percent to 34 percent. Publisher Steve
Forbes had 15 percent. In the Dartmouth-AP poll two weeks ago, McCain had 42
points, Bush 33 and Forbes 11.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has a narrow lead in some polls, based on his strength among
independents. Bush's chance to catch him may depend on his ability to win over
undecided Republicans despite competition for their votes from conservatives
Forbes and Alan Keyes, veteran pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dartmouth-AP poll of 365 likely voters in the Democratic primary and 435
likely voters in the Republican primary has a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Linda Fowler, director of the Rockefeller Center polling institute at
Dartmouth College in Hanover, said Gore's campaign has improved. Democrats who
previously doubted whether he could win in November now think Gore has a better
chance, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gore looks much more poised," Fowler said. "He's much clearer in terms of
his message, he's less jittery, he looks more in control."
</P>
<P>
	   That's reflected in poll numbers that showed likely voters saying Gore is
more likely to provide strong leadership than Bradley. They also said Gore is
much more likely to win both the New Hampshire primary and November's general
election. Bradley still has an edge in trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Bennett of American Research Group said his tracking poll showed
Bradley faring a little better Thursday and gaining among independents, but it
was too early to say whether he could regain enough ground by Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had drawn much of his strength from independents and men, but the
Dartmouth-AP poll shows Gore has surged among men and has regained an earlier
advantage among women.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, 56 percent of men supported Bradley and 38 percent backed
Gore in the Dartmouth-AP poll. But in the latest poll, 51 percent of men are
backing Gore, while 41 percent supported Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, McCain still ranks significantly higher than Bush on
voter perceptions that he is trustworthy and a strong leader, but voters also
think Bush is more likely to prevail in the New Hampshire primary and win the
presidency in November.

<HEADLINE> Swordsman Kills U.K. Lawmaker Aide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) -- A sword-wielding man killed a Liberal Democrat
party aide and injured a lawmaker Friday at their office, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The aide, who was not immediately identified, was reportedly stabbed at
least 10 times.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberal Democrat lawmaker Nigel Jones, 51, suffered cuts to his hands and
arms and was taken to a hospital in Cheltenham, about 100 miles northwest of
London. He was not seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The party said it knew of no motive for the attack and Jones had not
received any threats beforehand.
</P>
<P>
	   But local councilor Alexis Cassin, also a Liberal Democrat, said she
understood Jones had been dealing with a difficult case involving the alleged
attacker, although she did not know the details of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Cassin said she believed there were at least three people in the room at the
time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheltenham police refused to confirm the type of sword. But witnesses
speaking to the British Broadcasting Corp. said it was similar to one used by a
Japanese Samurai warrior, though they did not offer any description of what that
meant. The witnesses also said the suspect ``went crazy'' in the lawmaker's
office before he was chased up the street, still carrying the weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Police would give no details about the attack, but said a 49-year-old local
man was arrested near the party's headquarters and brought in for questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   Councilor Brian Cassin, husband of Alexis Cassin, said the lawmaker and his
assistants had been preparing for their regular Friday night office hours when
they were attacked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``MPs do have a problem with angry, aggrieved people. Mr. Jones and his
assistants work very hard to deal with casework but you can't win them all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have heard he was dealing with a bit of this man's work. They were
trying to help this man before tonight,'' he said. ``These people are here out
of public duty to help.''
</P>
<P>
	   Graham Norton said his neighbor, David Copson, had held the party aide in
his arms and tried to resuscitate him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He tried his best to save this man and gave him mouth-to-mouth, but he
said there was a hole in the man's stomach,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw offered condolences to the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Members of Parliament of all parties in this country are very accessible
to their constituents and this makes this tragedy all the more dreadful,'' Straw
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones won the Cheltenham seat in 1992 and has been the party's spokesman on
local government and housing, science and technology, consumer affairs and
culture, media and sports.
</P>
<P>
	   The Liberal Democrats are Britain's second-largest opposition party.

<HEADLINE> Suit alleges state allowing improper vehicles in preserves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Environmental groups have sued New York state over
what they contend are instances where motorized vehicles have been allowed onto
sensitive public preserve areas in the Adirondack and Catskill mountains.
<P>
	   The suit, filed late Thursday in federal court in Albany, claims that the
state Department of Environmental Conservation has engaged in a
"well-established and recurring pattern" of improperly issuing permits for the
use of motor vehicles, snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles in state forest
preserves.
</P>
<P>
	   The claim alleges that motorized vehicles have caused "the destruction of
trees, noise pollution, exhaust vapors and odors, degradation of hiking trails,
erosion from motor vehicle traffic and disturbance and destruction of habitat
areas."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the areas where motor vehicles have allegedly been misused are the
Santononi Preserve and the groups also say the DEC improperly bulldozed a wide
trail for snowmobilers through the Vanderwacker Mountain Wild Forest tract.
</P>
<P>
	   Both parcels of land are in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups said they know of at least 30 instances where permits for vehicle
use appear to have been issued illegally by the DEC, despite what they say were
their repeated warnings to the state over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "The destruction is not being accomplished so much by the vehicles, but by
the changes to the landscape they are making to accommodate the vehicles," John
Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The DEC revised its permit procedures in December to make sure they adhered
to forest preserve protection rules, the state's land use master plan and other
guidelines, department spokeswoman Jennifer Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We simply don't agree with their contentions," she said of the
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Post said the DEC was also challenging the groups' right to bring the suit
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups said their suit does not seek any change in the use of motorized
vehicles that have been won by individuals with disabilities or to limit where
law enforcement personnel are allowed to venture.
</P>
<P>
	   The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court last year ruled the groups'
suit could be brought on constitutional grounds. The environmentalists are
contending that the state is failing to protect the forest preserve lands, as
required by an 1894 amendment to the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   The four groups suing were the Adirondack Council, the Residents' Committee
to Protect the Adirondacks, the Association for the Protection of the
Adirondacks and Environmental Advocates.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit was filed before U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence Kahn.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Courts Strikes Challenge  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's highest court has struck down a
lawsuit claiming its own magistrates were appointed illegally by a powerful
constitutional assembly overstepping its bounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling Thursday was a setback for critics of President Hugo Chavez who
say he has concentrated power into his own hands and brought the country
dangerously close to dictatorship. But it is also likely to stir further
controversy about the way the president is carrying out his ``social
revolution'' in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   The same lawsuit claimed that a new ``mini-congress,'' the attorney general,
the national comptroller, the public defender and the national electoral council
were all designated illegally. Each of those claims was shot down by Venezuela's
newly created Supreme Tribunal of Justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Since becoming president a year ago, Chavez has pushed through a new
constitution and decimated the two political parties that ruled the South
American nation during 40 years of democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   The new constitution, approved by voters on Dec. 15, calls for the renewal
of all elected powers, but national balloting has been postponed until May
because of last month's massive flooding and landslides that killed thousands of
people on Venezuela's northern coast.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Chavez, a former army paratrooper who staged a failed
military coup eight years ago, will be able to rule Venezuela with virtually no
checks on his power.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, 21 members of a so-called ``mini-Congress'' made up of Chavez
supporters were sworn in. The mini-congress's job will be to perform basic
legislative functions until elections are held for a new legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the high court magistrates, the mini-congress's members were each
handpicked by the Chavez-controlled panel that rewrote the constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   A Venezuelan attorney named Eduardo Garcia presented a lawsuit to the court
saying this was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   But the court ruled that the constitutional assembly had the power to make
the appointments because it was ``given originating power by the Venezuelan
people'' in national elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez and his supporters say the profound changes taking place in
Venezuelan society and politics will root out decades of corruption and crush a
corrupt oligarchy that plunged the oil-rich nation into poverty.

<HEADLINE> Mars Web site touts health benefits of chocolate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Snacking on chocolate needn't be a guilt trip, a
candy maker assures consumers in a Web site that suggests there may be health
benefits to eating the treat.
<P>
	   Mars Inc., the Hackettstown-based maker of M&AMP;M's, Snickers and 3 Musketeers,
stops short of claiming chocolate is a health food. But it is believed to be the
first major chocolate manufacturer to promote research on the possible
disease-fighting properties of the plant compounds found in the candy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone knows that chocolate tastes great; most don't know that chocolate
may provide certain health benefits. The good news is, eating well can include
chocolate," according to the Web site, www.cocoapro.com.
</P>
<P>
	   The site said "preliminary research" suggests that cocoa beans contain
antioxidants called polyphenols, which may reduce the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cocoapro logo - a graphic of a hand holding a cocoa bean - will appear
on the back of candy bar wrappers beginning this quarter, with the hopes that
consumers will turn to the Web site to ease their conscience.
</P>
<P>
	   Hershey Foods Corp. and Nestle USA, both Mars competitors, are not promoting
the health benefits of their products.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurie MacDonald at Nestle said, however, that her company finds the
research "interesting and promising" and is following it closely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chocolate Manufacturers Association has its own Web site touting the
health benefits of chocolate. The site notes that research suggests eating a
chocolate bar instead of a high carbohydrate snack raises "good cholesterol"
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   One researcher who has done several studies on chocolate's health properties
also said it has been found to have some benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our work shows that chocolate does have antioxidant effects, which could
protect against heart disease, premature aging and possibly cancer. No doubt
about it," said Penny Kris-Etherton, a nutrition professor at Penn State
University.
</P>
<P>
	   But are the findings ready to be plastered on product labels?
</P>
<P>
	   "The effect on major chronic diseases is open to discussions," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a nonprofit organization that advocates food safety and nutrition,
said Friday that Mars is using its Web site to make assertions that the federal
government has not yet approved for its packaging.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is irresponsible health advice," said Silverglade. He warned that many
candy bars contain a significant amount of saturated fats, which have been
proven to raise blood cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Food and Drug Administration has not approved any health claims
for chocolate. Any such claims on the candy wrapper would require FDA
authorization.
</P>
<P>
	   Marlene Machut, a spokeswoman for Mars, said the company is not suggesting
replacing fruits and vegetables with a Snickers bar.
</P>
<P>
	   "We support what nutritionists have been saying: moderation and a balanced
diet is the key to healthy living. Chocolate can certainly fit into a healthy
diet and a healthy lifestyle," she said. "People need to enjoy their food."

<HEADLINE> Euro Hits New Lows Under 98 Cents  </HEADLINE>
    By PETER ALAN HARPER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro fell to new lows Friday, dropping below 98 cents
for the first time ever and winding up below $1 for a second straight day. The
euro's retreat helped the dollar stage a broad advance against other leading
currencies on a day when U.S. stocks fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro sank as low as 97.38 cents Friday afternoon and settled at 97.78
cents in late trading in New York, down from 98.86 cents Thursday. The dollar
also climbed to 106.98 Japanese yen from 105.09 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   During a day of dramatic changes, the dollar hit a 10-year high against the
Swiss franc, a 3 1/2-month high against the yen, a 4-week high against the
British pound and a 12-month high against the New Zealand dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was aided by reports Friday that the U.S. economy galloped ahead
at an annual rate of 5.8 percent during the final quarter of 1999, the largest
burst of growth since late 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures reinforced views among traders that the American economy will
continue to outperform the economy of the 11 European nations that have adopted
the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors in several markets, and at least one hedge fund, added to the
euro's plight by dumping the currency to buy dollars. The selling shifted money
into the U.S. bond market, where long-term interest rates fell despite inflation
jitters that sent U.S. stocks stumbling.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro now has lost 17.7 percent since peaking on the day it made its
debut as a currency -- Jan. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   European Union officials continued to downplay the significance of Friday's
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   However, investors speculated that officials at the European Central Bank
had to be upset and might finally consider raising interest rates to boost the
currency at their management committee meeting next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the ECB, this is their worst nightmare," said Paul Podolsky, a managing
director at Fleet Global Foreign Exchange in Boston. While a psychological blow,
the low euro is providing some benefits by making European goods less costly and
more competitive on world markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry Willmore, a senior economist at Barclays Capital, said that if the
downfall continues below 96 cents, "there is a pretty good risk of intervention.
I think they were caught by surprise by the euro's moves in recent days."
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6468 Swiss francs in New York,
up from 1.6316 Thursday, and 1.4430 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4337. The
British pound fell to $1.6210 from $1.6388.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies participating in the euro are no longer traded separately and are
tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on the euro's rate Friday, the dollar
was worth: 2.0006German marks, down from 1.9780; 6.7085 French francs, up from
6.6339; and 1,980.23 Italian lire, up from 1,958.20.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Drops 22 to 755  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and natural
gas in the United States fell this week by 22 to 755.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the rigs running nationwide, 131 were exploring for oil and 624 were
looking for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported Friday. During the
same week last year, 562 rigs were operating in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally peaked at
4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil boom but set several record
lows last year, bottoming out at 498 on April 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, New Mexico gained three while
Alaska and Louisiana lost one apiece. Texas lost 10 rigs, while California,
Oklahoma and Wyoming were unchanged.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Trade Body Expects Dissent  </HEADLINE>
    By NAOMI KOPPEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- The location and the purpose may be different, but the U.N.'s
trade and development body likely may face the same problems that led to the
high-profile failure of last month's World Trade Organization meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   A draft text for next month's U.N. Conference on Trade and Development in
Bangkok, completed Friday, champions free trade as the best way for poorer
countries to improve their economies and living standards.
</P>
<P>
	   But many of the issues that haunted the WTO's Seattle gathering are also set
to rear their heads at the Bangkok meeting, which starts Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD considers the text -- which will now be passed to delegates in
Bangkok for final approval -- a success. It contains only 15 disputed areas,
said spokeswoman Carine Richard-van Maele. The document produced for UNCTAD's
last meeting four years ago had 590.
</P>
<P>
	   But the disputed areas of the 37-page text bear a striking resemblance to
the WTO disagreements -- agriculture, labor standards and an end to all trade
barriers for the poorest countries. In some cases the wording is identical.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, a European Union proposal would insert a paragraph pointing to
the importance of "Democracy, rule of law, transparent and accountable
governance and administration ... human rights and fundamental freedoms."
Developing countries have resisted all suggestions that trade negotiations
should be linked to human rights.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the European Union rejects suggestions that its huge
agricultural subsidy program is having negative effects on developing countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, whose negotiators had to leave before the end of the
meeting, has also registered a general reservation over the entire section
covering trade.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't deny that there are substantial differences that remain," UNCTAD
Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   "They will need a long process, a great effort. Until now we have seen
practically no willingness to compromise. Bangkok is another opportunity to see
those compromises, and in a way that will not commit the countries to make a
decision that would be more or less irrevocable."
</P>
<P>
	   The nations have agreed on some provisions, including the need for writing
off debts for the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
	   There is also general agreement that developing countries must be given help
to develop trading policies that encourage investment and allow them to take
part in the e-commerce revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 3,000 participants, including heads of state, from UNCTAD's 199
members, are expected to attend the conference Feb. 12-19.

<TEXT>
    	   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) - The guy's 53 years old. But when he's being praised
by a former president as the best man for the White House, he probably doesn't
mind that he keeps being referred to as "my boy."
<P>
	   Former President Bush used the term several times during his speech at a
campaign rally Friday, plugging for George W. Bush in this year's election.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush the younger is a man of character who believes in his country, the
father said of the son.
</P>
<P>
	   The former president also poked some fun at himself, joking that he is going
through a bit of an identity crisis because of his son's rising prominence.
</P>
<P>
	   He said a hairdresser told his wife, Barbara Bush, that he was excited to be
doing the hair of the mother of the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   When Mrs. Bush reminded him that she also was the wife of the former
president, the hairdresser said, "Well, there's that, too."

<P>
	   Bill Bradley stepped up his criticism of his Democratic rival: "When you
listen to Al Gore speak, you have to listen very carefully, you have to look at
every word and every clause." Gore, who returned from the State of the Union
address to appear with former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin at a campaign
event, dismissed Bradley's remarks and said he wanted to "emphasize the
positive."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush picked up the endorsement of his father's former White House chief of
staff, former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu. He also criticized President
Clinton's new tax cut plan as not "significant enough." Rival John McCain said
he was "truly disappointed" that Bush hadn't stopped supporters' efforts to
knock McCain off one-fourth of the ballots for the party's New York primary. He

<HEADLINE> Korean War Remains Discovered  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea has discovered more than 400 remains of
people likely to be American servicemen killed in the Korean War, a deputy North
Korean representative to the United Nations said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Li Gun said his country has offered to return the remains, without
conditions. He said the U.S. government would have to act quickly, because the
area where the remains were found in December and January is being converted to
cropland.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Pentagon office in charge of POW-MIA affairs, spokesman Larry Greer
said North Korea notified the Pentagon of the discovery this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've asked for more details,'' Greer said. He said his office is leery of
unilateral returns of war remains, because in the past they have lacked the
anthropological detail needed for individual identifications.
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview from his New York office, Li said his government
believes it will find many more remains, beyond the approximately 415 already
uncovered, in an area of North Pyongan Province where land is being moved to
create cropland.
</P>
<P>
	   About 8,200 U.S. servicemen are listed as missing from the 1950-53 Korean
War, and the Pentagon has said it believes a few thousand are potentially
recoverable from North Korea. In joint recovery operations over the past few
years, 42 sets of remains have been recovered. Negotiations on arranging joint
recovery operations for this year broke down in December after the North Koreans
demanded that the United States donate materials and equipment for children's
clothing factories.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Li's office sent letters to several U.S. veterans organizations
that said, ``Some remains of the U.S. troops killed in the Korean War are being
recovered by bulldozers.'' The letter did not mention the 400 figure. It said
that once the land-moving operation is finished, ``It will be difficult for us
to confirm the remains sites and unable to find the remains forever.''
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Metersky of the Chosin Few group of Korean War veterans said Friday he
doubts the North Koreans' sincerity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all agree this is a political ploy'' to get the Pentagon involved in
humanitarian assistance as a condition for the return of remains, he said. ``We
do not want our government to pay ransom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Li said his government had ``suggested'' but not demanded that the United
States donate children's clothing factories as a means of compensating North
Korea for its cooperation in remains-recovery operations. He said the intent was
to show average North Korean citizens, whose help he said is vital to recovering
remains, that the United States is well intentioned and is no longer the enemy.

<HEADLINE> Cocoa Glut Sparks Price Decline  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Cocoa careened close to a 13-year low Friday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP;
Cocoa Exchange as strong West African harvests heap more supplies onto a glutted
world market.
</P>
<P>
	   In other commodity markets, gold prices retreated sharply and wheat fell
after snow fell in the southern Plains states.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa prices have been in a tailspin since 1998. Continued lackluster demand
coupled with whopper crops in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world's top two
producers, are pressuring the market further.
</P>
<P>
	   World production is expected to exceed demand this year for the first time
since the 1995-96 marketing year, rising 6 percent while grindings -- reflecting
consumption -- climb just 3 percent, according to new figures released by trade
house ED&AMP;F Man.
</P>
<P>
	   Crops arriving in West African ports for shipment are large. ED&AMP;F Man says
Ivory Coast, benefiting from favorable growing conditions, is on pace for a
record while Ghana should have its largest crop since 1972-73. Indonesia, the
No. 3 world producer, also is expected to produce a record crop.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no attempt to keep cocoa off the market. That really has kept
prices down," said Jack Scoville, vice president and analyst with the
Chicago-based Price Futures Group.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good crop, and along with the liberalization the IMF has forced on
these countries it certainly hasn't slowed down the speed at which cocoa moves
out," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa settled down $12 at $811 a ton after sinking as low as $805 -- just $5
off the 13-year low reached last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold's decline caught some investors off guard amid uncertainty over what
caused it. Some rumors said a large hedge fund was forced to sell a substantial
position of its holdings in gold, perhaps due to credit problems. Other traders
speculated that the strength in the U.S. dollar contributing to the slide.
</P>
<P>
	   The expiring February contract settled $4.10 lower at $283 an ounce on the
New York Mercantile Exchange after bottoming out at $280.50.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat declined on the Chicago Board of Trade after snowy weather struck the
southern Plains states and much of the nation's winter wheat crop the day
before, easing concerns about crop dryness. A decline in corn and soybean prices
added to the selling mood.
</P>
<P>
	   March wheat fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.59 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> DPUC reverses decision on gas rates for Southern Conn. Gas Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - State utility regulators on Friday reversed a
decision that would have cut rates for Southern Connecticut Gas customers, and
instead granted the company a rate hike.
<P>
	   The decision from the state Department of Public Utility Control will result
in a 3 cent-per-month increase for an average customer who does not heat with
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision came despite a preliminary ruling earlier this month that would
have required the gas company to cut rates by about 22 cents per month on
average.
</P>
<P>
	   Some utility analysts said the preliminary ruling might have killed plans
for Energy East Corp. to take over Southern Connecticut Gas.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies refused to comment on the final decision Friday, saying it
was still being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies also refused to say whether the merger hinged on the DPUC
ruling. The DPUC already has approved the merger, but the companies still need
approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The rate decision was changed because of miscalculations in the preliminary
ruling, the DPUC said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling will still result in smaller profit limits for the company. The
DPUC set maximum earnings at 10.71 percent, down from the 11.45 percent maximum
profit that was set in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Southern Connecticut Gas, which serves 158,000 customers in the New Haven
and Bridgeport areas, requested increased revenues of $20 million. The DPUC
instead granted revenue increases of $502,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy East, of Albany, N.Y., also plans to pay $355 million to take over
Hartford-based CTG Resources, Inc., the parent company of Connecticut Natural
Gas Corp. The company has also made offers for Central Maine Power Co. and
Berkshire Energy Resources in Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> SEC Orders Markets To Use Decimals  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on Friday ordered the nation's stock
exchanges to begin quoting at least some share prices in dollars and cents by
July 3, requiring them to fully abandon the 200-year-old use of fractions by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market and other U.S.
securities exchanges will be required to submit a decimal pricing plan within 45
days and to have decimal prices fully phased in by year's end, the Securities
and Exchange Commission said in announcing its order.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchanges have been putting together plans for phasing in decimal prices
this year, now that the securities industry has cleared the Year 2000
technological hurdle.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC normally refrains from intervening in the markets' operation.
</P>
<P>
	   SEC spokesman Chris Ullman explained that the agency was seeking to promote
"a greater level of coordination within the industry and with" the SEC. The move
was intended "to reaffirm how important we think this is," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities Industry Association said the SEC's action "clears the way
for the securities industry to proceed with its effort to convert" to decimal
pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will make securities trading more understandable for investors as well
as increasing the competitiveness of U.S. markets," the SIA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Decimal trading will benefit investors by allowing greater competition and
making it easier to compare prices," SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said in a
statement. "It will also bring about consistency with foreign markets, which now
trade in decimals. We look forward to working with the industry to ensure that
the transition to decimals goes smoothly."
</P>
<P>
	   As an interim step, the nation's two biggest exchanges -- the NYSE and the
all-electronic Nasdaq -- and some regional exchanges have been quoting stocks in
minimum increments of one-sixteenth of a dollar, instead of the customary
one-eighths. In decimals, a sixteenth is 6.25 cents and an eighth is 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   The NYSE "is decimal-ready. We will continue to work with the SEC and the
industry toward a smooth conversion to decimal pricing," exchange spokesman Rich
Adamonis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nasdaq spokesman Scott Peterson said his exchange will be ready to trade in
5-cent increments on July 3 "and looks forward to discussing the implications of
quoting securities in 1-cent increments with the SEC."
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say adopting the decimal system would narrow the difference
between a stock's best bid and asking prices, known as the spread. Spreads
typically vary from 12 1/2 cents to 50 cents, an amount that adds up to a
sizable profit for brokers, who take in a percentage based on the size of the
spread.
</P>
<P>
	   Some stocks will begin trading in nickel increments, though many could be
trading in penny increments by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the decimalization argue that a narrower spread will increase
the competitiveness and efficiency of markets, increase trading volume and
improve liquidity.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, critics have said the narrower spreads in decimal trading would
erode profits, something that could reduce the number of market makers, the
firms which form a market's backbone.
</P>
<P>
	   Market makers trade for their own accounts and agree to process customers'
orders for particular stocks. A sharp drop in market makers could hurt an
exchange's ability to handle high-volume trading sessions.

<HEADLINE> Gene Talks Boil Down to Few Issues  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- In the final hours of international talks Friday on trade
in genetically modified food and other products, negotiators found themselves
grappling over the same issues that doomed a similar agreement nearly a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates scurried from room to room of the Montreal hotel where the meeting
was being held, bearing proposals and counterproposals. Late in the afternoon,
conference president Juan Mayr delayed what was to be the final meeting of the
disagreeing parties by four hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayr, who set a deadline of Friday night, also has said that he will not
leave Montreal without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somebody has to give in somewhere,'' said Ethiopian head delegate Towalde
Egziabher.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators were attempting to draft the Biosafety Protocol, a set of rules
that would protect the environment from damage by genetically modified plants,
animals and bacteria. Environmentalists and a few scientific studies have raised
concerns that genetically modified organisms could wipe out native species,
disrupt natural cycles and cause other ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's fish genes in fruit, poultry genes in fish, animal genes in
plants, growth hormones in milk, insect genes in vegetables, tree genes in grain
and in the case of pork, human genes in meat,'' said Steve Gilman, an organic
farmer in Stillwater, N.Y. ``Real and reasonable concerns about genetic
engineering have fallen upon deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate at the talks has revolved around how great the scientific
uncertainty is, and how it should be dealt with. The European Union and
developing nations have argued that countries should be allowed to decline
imports of a genetically modified product if little is known about its
environmental effect.
</P>
<P>
	   But the United States and its partners disagree, saying the proposed rules
in their current form would restrict trade. Those countries argued that any
nation's refusal to import a genetically modified product should be backed by
scientific evidence in the form of a risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We live in a world in which scientific certainty is not available,'' said
U.S. Undersecretary of State Frank Loy.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks last February in Cartagena, Colombia, ended in disarray when the
United States and five other countries -- Canada, Australia, Argentina, Chile
and Uruguay -- rejected a draft agreement favored by 125 other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation has changed since then, with major U.S. food producers such as
Archer Daniels Midland, Gerber and the Iams pet food company either demanding
that genetically modified products be segregated or refusing to use them
altogether. Protests at the World Trade Organization talks in Seattle last month
also suggest that the American public has concerns about genetically altered
food.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the year since Cartagena, it has become obvious that the position of
the (United States') group is increasingly isolated,'' said Philip Bereano, a
University of Washington professor who has been following the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as in Cartagena, the talks in Montreal have come down to a handful of
issues:
</P>
<P>
	   --The relationship of the proposed rules to the World Trade Organization.
The United States wants the agreement to have ``equal status'' with the free
trade pact. But other countries fear that any bans they impose will be
overturned by the World Trade Organization's dispute resolution panel.
</P>
<P>
	   --The amount of scientific evidence that is needed to justify banning a
genetically modified product.
</P>
<P>
	   --The amount of evidence that exporters must provide about their products.
</P>
<P>
	   Genetically modified crops are already widespread. About 70 million acres of
genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999. In the United
States, genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 percent of corn
and 40 percent of soybeans.

<HEADLINE> China Frees U.S. College Librarian  </HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDE R. MARX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese authorities freed a U.S. college librarian on
Friday, five months after they arrested him on charges of smuggling secret
documents out of the country, U.S. and Chinese officials said here.
</P>
<P>
	   Song Yongyi, who works at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., was scheduled
to arrive in Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said the U.S. government was pleased
by China's decision but ``did not believe there was any evidence to warrant his
detention.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, China's ambassador to the United States said in a statement that
Song ``admitted all the facts related to his criminal activities ... and also
voluntarily revealed evidence against illegal activities of others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song's case was treated with leniency because of his ``repentance,'' said
the ambassador, Li Zhao Xing.
</P>
<P>
	   Song, a 50-year-old Chinese national who had planned to become a U.S.
citizen in September, was on a trip to China in August to collect source
material on the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when he and his wife, Helen Yao,
were detained. His wife was allowed to return to the United States in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickinson officials have said Song was collecting previously published
material to bring to the United States, but the Chinese contended he was
``purchasing or illegally supplying intelligence'' to people outside China.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley cited the efforts of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and several congressional delegations that visited China
for pressuring the Chinese government to release Song.
</P>
<P>
	   Specter said he learned of Song's release during a meeting with Li at the
Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday morning. He said he believes Chinese
authorities released Song to curry favor with Congress, which will decide
whether to grant China permanent most-favored-nation trade status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They know they'll need our votes,'' said Specter, who declined to comment
on Song's alleged confession.
</P>
<P>
	   Song's wife spoke with her husband Friday and was ``ecstatic'' about the
development, said Specter.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickinson President William Durden said he was ``appreciative of the actions
of the Chinese government and look forward to his return to his family and our
campus.'' Durden also declined to comment on the confession but called the
release a victory for academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   Song is an expert on documents about the Cultural Revolution, when millions
in China were persecuted as Mao Tse-tung sought to consolidate his power. The
communist government continues to regard the period as extremely sensitive and
heavily restricts access to archived material about it.

<HEADLINE> Economic Surge Feeds Inflation Fear  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, propelled by hardy consumer spending,
finished 1999 on a vibrant note, but the growth came at a price: a worrisome
uptick in wages and benefits that economists fear could trigger inflation. Wall
Street plunged.
</P>
<P>
	   During the final three months of 1999, the economy grew at a breakneck
annual rate of 5.8 percent, the biggest growth spurt since the end of 1998, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the nation's gross domestic product, its total output of
goods and services, increased by 4 percent, the third year in a row at 4 percent
or higher.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton boasted about the economy at a White House meeting with
mayors. "This unbelievable recovery marches on," Clinton said, referring to the
uninterrupted economic growth since the 1990-1991 recession that will set a
record of eight years and ten months next week.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, another government report showed Friday that employees'
wages and benefits surged 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, rekindling worries
about inflation and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid these worries, stocks tumbled. The Dow Jones industrial average closed
down 289.15 points to 10,738.87, its lowest level since Nov. 11. The Nasdaq fell
152.49 points to 3,887.07, its second-biggest point loss ever. The bond market
staged a stunning turnaround as jittery investors shifted their money away from
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rising tide of economic growth has stirred up inflation in its wake,"
said Richard Yamarone, an economist with Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   With the roaring economy driving down the nation's unemployment rate to its
lowest point in 30 years, employers are having trouble finding scarce workers to
fill openings. Some employers are wooing workers with higher wages and benefits.
That's good for workers, but economists fear those increased costs could lead to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1.1 percent spike in the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index,
considered the best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs and closely
watched by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, stemmed from a 1.3 percent
jump in benefits, the biggest increase in six years. Economists blamed rising
health care costs for the big increase in benefit costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both reports contain the smoking gun that the Fed has been worried about --
wage pressures are surfacing, and inflation is on the uptick," said First Union
economist David Orr.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve meets next week to decide interest rate policy, and most
economists expect the Fed to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   A few economists said Friday's reports may put pressure on the Fed to bump
up rates by a half a point on Feb. 2. But more economists said the reports raise
the odds that the Fed will follow up next week's expected increase with a
quarter-of-a-point rate boost on March 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the Fed's three rate increases last year, the economy continues to
grow at a rapid pace that some economists fear cannot be sustained without
triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   An inflation gauge tied to GDP rose 1.5 percent in 1999, a worse showing on
inflation than the 0.7 percent increase recorded the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best of inflation news is clearly behind us, and if we keep growth at a
4 percent pace as we did in all of 1999 then the price problems will almost
certainly worsen," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the country's economic
activity, drove 1999's growth, rising 5.3 percent for the year. Plentiful jobs,
rising wages and benefits and stock market gains have made Americans feel
wealthy and put them in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
	   All that spending pushed the nation's savings rate -- savings as a
percentage of disposable income -- to an all-time annual low of 2.4 percent last
year. In 1998, the savings rate was 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   That isn't as dire as it seems, however, because the savings rate doesn't
take into account gains households have realized on their savings from such
factors as rising stock market values and higher real estate values for their
homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Business investment -- spending on new equipment and plants -- increased 8.3
percent last year, down from 12.7 percent in 1998. Rising mortgage rates
dampened housing construction, which rose 7.2 percent in 1999 but wasn't as
brisk as the 9.2 percent increase the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. trade deficit continued to be a drag on the economy, subtracting
1.11 percentage points from growth in 1999. But that was a slight improvement
from the 1.18 percentage-point reduction recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Imports shot up 11.8 percent last year, slightly more than the 11.6 percent
increase posted in 1998. Exports rose 3.5 percent last year, compared with a 2.2
percent rise the year before.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Cuts Dividend in Half  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH HETTENA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. slashed its dividend in half
Friday, continuing a belt-tightening that already includes plans for 2,800 new
job cuts in an attempt to reverse setbacks at its aerospace and aviation
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's second-largest defense business after Boeing Co. also reported
fourth-quarter earnings, after excluding one-time gains, fell 20 percent from a
year earlier, matching Wall Street's diminished expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed officials reiterated a warning first made in October year that the
bleak financial picture would continue into the new year, but projected gains in
the years to come.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a very strong conviction that the year 2000 will be the low point
for earnings and cash generation for this corporation," chief financial officer
Robert J. Stevens told analysts in a telephone conference call Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed stock fell about 3 percent for the second day in a row, dropping 56
1/4 cents to $18.87 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutting quarterly dividend payments from 22 cents a share to 11 cents,
effective with the payout due March 31, is the latest in a series of measures
aimed at improving the bottom line. Reducing the dividend frees up about $180
million, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consistent with our previously announced focus on reducing debt, it is
prudent to change the dividend at this time," said Vance Coffman, the chairman
and chief executive of the Bethesda, Md.-based maker of rockets, satellites and
the F-16 fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the company announced it was eliminating 2 percent of its
140,000 jobs worldwide. Lockheed said the new cuts of 2,800 jobs in its aircraft
and rockets businesses would produce $200 million in annual savings. The latest
retrenchment brings the total number of jobs eliminated in recent months to
4,500.
</P>
<P>
	   "The purpose of these actions is to drive down indirect and administrative
costs to improve earnings and cash flow and reduce debt while improving focus on
these businesses," Coffman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed said it was considering whether to add another subsidiary, Lockheed
Martin IMS, to the list of eight company businesses on the auction block. The
Teaneck, N.J.-based unit, which had sales of $500 million last year, provides
services to government, including child-support collection and ticketing drivers
caught on red-light cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials also said they planned to close a deal to acquire
Bethesda-based Comsat Corp. in the first six months of 2000. Lockheed bought 49
percent of the satellite service provider last year, but cannot purchase the
rest until Congress changes Comsat's ownership rules to allow it. The House and
Senate are expected to begin working out final legislation next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts gave mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
	   "All the bad news is out. We think the stock is in the midst of a
turnaround," said Jeff Pittsburg of Pittsburg Institutional Inc., who is
advising his clients to buy the stock. "I think the dividends, the layoffs,
they're trying to create the cash flow. They're telling you they're going to
generate a lot of cash and that's very important."
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Nisbet of JSA Research Inc., has a hold on the stock, which he says is
in "limbo."
</P>
<P>
	   "The prospects as they have outlined them to us certainly aren't very
bright," he said. "It doesn't exactly exude confidence."
</P>
<P>
	   For the fourth quarter of 1999, Lockheed reported earnings of $293 million,
or 76 cents a share, compared with $125 million, or 33 cents a share, in the
same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
	   Profit in the latest quarter included $102 million, or 17 cents a share, in
one-time gains from the sale of surplus real estate, noncore businesses and the
company's stock in L3 Communication Holdings. The earnings of 59 cents, after
eliminating the unusual gains, met the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Lockheed earned $382 million or 99 cents a share, compared
with $1 billion or $2.63 a share in 1998. Excluding one-time charges, earnings
for 1999 would have been $1.50 vs. $2.99 for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, the company cut its earnings forecast for 2000 by more than half
to about $1 per share, and Lockheed saw its stock lose nearly half its value.
</P>
<P>
	   But the company also said it expected earnings per share to grow at an
annual rate of 15 percent to 25 percent in the near term, with growth at the
lower end of the range in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed's problems have been aggravated by troubles in its space systems
business. There have been several rocket launch failures as well as satellite
delays and the loss of satellite contracts, such as a long-held U.S. spy
satellite contract, reportedly worth $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of the company's flagship aircraft, the F-16 fighter jet, have
dwindled. Lockheed delivered 109 of the planes in 1998, down from 150 in the
previous year. The company now is almost entirely dependent on foreign
sales.

<HEADLINE> Thruway board quietly approves toll hike plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Thruway Authority board has quietly approved a 3
percent toll hike beginning June 1 to pay for improvements to the superhighway
and other transportation projects.
<P>
	   The board Thursday voted to go forward with a previously unannounced plan to
tie future toll increases on the Thruway to the construction cost index, which
is an average of construction material and labor costs. The first-year hike will
be 3 percent, the maximum annual increase under the new toll increase system.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls at the short-trip barriers around Buffalo and New York City would not
go up because they are rounded to the nearest quarter. But virtually all other
tolls on the ticketed part of the superhighway would go up by 3 percent, rounded
to the nearest nickel.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway officials will hold four public hearings to gather comment on the
toll-increase plan and finalize the plan this spring, Thruway spokeswoman Anya
Frost said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls were last raised on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road, in
1988. In 1996, the Thruway board backed away from a toll hike at the insistence
of Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   There was little, if any, advance word that the board was contemplating a
toll hike before Thursday's meeting. The press release issued by the Authority
afterward spoke of the agency funding $275 million in capital improvements this
year. Not until the second page of the release did the Authority refer to the
adoption of a plan which could result in an annual toll hike - it called it an
"indexed toll adjustment plan" - beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   "This common-sense plan will ensure that motorists are never hit with
massive toll hikes, while providing businesses that rely on the Thruway with the
information they need when planning their budgets," the Authority said in a
statement from Chairman Louis Tomson.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority leader of the state Senate said Friday he is opposed to raising
tolls. Joseph Bruno cited such a hike as running counter to recent state efforts
to cut taxes and other costs of doing business in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now is not the time for the Thruway Authority to impose a hidden tax on
upstate businesses, residents and commuters in the form of multiyear toll
hikes," Bruno, R-Rensselaer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Motor Truck Association blasted the Authority for the secretive
manner in which it voted to raise tolls, and said it appeared there was nothing
to prevent tolls from going up 3 percent every year if construction costs
continue to rise annually.
</P>
<P>
	   "As business people we would never increase our prices to our largest
customers without first consulting with them," grumbled the Motor Truck
Association's president, Bill Joyce.
</P>
<P>
	   It called on Pataki to ask the Thruway Authority to reexamine its projected
toll hike and to find other ways to fund improvements on the roadway. Calls to
Pataki's office for comment about the projected toll increase were not
immediately returned Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the $275 million in projects to be put out for bid this year by the
Thruway was worked on the Interstate 287 corridor around the Tappan Zee Bridge
and the Syracuse Inner Harbor development project.
</P>
<P>
	   Both projects are among the transportation facilities the Thruway has
assumed authority for in recent years. Critics say the drain of these other
facilities have put additional financial burdens on the Authority past that of
maintaining the original toll highway between New York City and the Pennsylvania
border.
</P>
<P>
	   Tomson was a former deputy to Pataki and was nominated by the governor to
the Thruway position. It is unlikely that the Thruway Authority board would
proceed with a toll hike plan without the prior knowledge of Pataki's office.

   PREMIA, Spain (AP) -- Two women were injured when neo-Nazi youths clashed
with anti-racism demonstrators late Friday in northeastern Spain, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The clashes followed a relatively peaceful march of 200 people through
Premia de Mar when a group of 30 skinheads carrying Nazi symbols and Spanish
flags began throwing stones at them, the state-owned news agency EFE reported.
Two women were reported injured.
</P>
<P>

surface after a fight earlier in the week between a North African and a
Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, anti-immigrant violence erupted in parts of the northeastern
region of Catalonia, where Premia is located. Anti-immigrant demonstrators then
attacked shops and homes belonging to Moroccans and clashed with police.

<HEADLINE> Mars Web Site Touts Health Benefits  </HEADLINE>
    By NINA RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Snacking on chocolate needn't be a guilt trip, a candy
maker assures consumers in a Web site that suggests there may be health benefits
to eating the treat.
</P>
<P>
	   Mars Inc., the Hackettstown-based maker of M&AMP;M's, Snickers and 3 Musketeers,
stops short of claiming chocolate is a health food. But it is believed to be the
first major chocolate manufacturer to promote research on the possible
disease-fighting properties of the plant compounds found in the candy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone knows that chocolate tastes great; most don't know that chocolate
may provide certain health benefits. The good news is, eating well can include
chocolate," according to the Web site, www.cocoapro.com.
</P>
<P>
	   The site said "preliminary research" suggests that cocoa beans contain
antioxidants called polyphenols, which may reduce the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cocoapro logo -- a graphic of a hand holding a cocoa bean -- will appear
on the back of candy bar wrappers beginning this quarter, with the hopes that
consumers will turn to the Web site to ease their conscience.
</P>
<P>
	   Hershey Foods Corp. and Nestle USA, both Mars competitors, are not promoting
the health benefits of their products.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurie MacDonald at Nestle said, however, that her company finds the
research "interesting and promising" and is following it closely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chocolate Manufacturers Association has its own Web site touting the
health benefits of chocolate. The site notes that research suggests eating a
chocolate bar instead of a high carbohydrate snack raises "good cholesterol"
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   One researcher who has done several studies on chocolate's health properties
said their studies it does have some benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our work shows that chocolate does have antioxidant effects, which could
protect against heart disease, premature aging and possibly cancer," said Penny
Kris-Etherton, a nutrition professor at Penn State University.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a nonprofit organization that advocates food safety and nutrition,
said Friday that Mars is using its Web site to make assertions that the federal
government has not yet approved for its packaging.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is irresponsible health advice," said Silverglade. He warned that many
candy bars contain a significant amount of saturated fats, which have been
proven to raise blood cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Food and Drug Administration has not approved any health claims
for chocolate. Any such claims on the candy wrapper would require FDA
authorization.
</P>
<P>
	   Marlene Machut, a spokeswoman for Mars, said the company is not suggesting
replacing fruits and vegetables with a Snickers bar.
</P>
<P>
	   "We support what nutritionists have been saying: moderation and a balanced
diet is the key to healthy living. Chocolate can certainly fit into a healthy
diet and a healthy lifestyle," she said. "People need to enjoy their
food."

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Seek Young Monk's Asylum  </HEADLINE>
   By GOPAL DAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BHUBANESWAR, India (AP) -- The Dalai Lama has urged India to grant refuge to
a prominent teen-age Buddhist monk who fled Chinese-ruled Tibet, saying it would
be a ``terrible mistake'' not to allow him to stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter released to reporters Friday, the Tibetan Buddhist leader said
India's image would suffer if the government does not allow the 17th Karmapa to
stay. Since arriving in India earlier this month, the 14-year-old Karmapa has
been staying at a monastery near Dharmsala, the Dalai Lama's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter was written Jan. 18 to Rabi Ray, a former speaker of the Lok
Sabha, India's lower house of parliament. Ray released the letter to reporters
in the eastern city of Bhubaneswar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be a terrible mistake for India if (the government) does not let
the Karmapa stay on,'' the Dalai Lama said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Buddhist groups have demanded that the Karmapa be allowed asylum in the
Rumtek monastery in India's northeastern state of Sikkim, where his deceased
predecessor -- who fled Tibet in 1959 -- established the seat of his Karma Kagyu
sect.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indian Express newspaper reported on Sunday that the Dalai Lama also
wrote to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, supporting the Karmapa's
request to stay. The Foreign Ministry and the Dalai Lama's administration
refused to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
	   India has allowed more than 100,000 Tibetan refugees to settle within its
borders since a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. The Dalai Lama heads
an exile government in Dharmsala.
</P>
<P>
	   China has said the monk would be welcomed back, but the Chinese government
will continue to control ordination of key Buddhist religious figures.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference in Washington on Jan. 20, China's vice-chairman for
Tibet, Sun Qi Wen, dismissed concerns that the Karmapa's departure might hurt
Chinese relations with India.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dalai Lama has met the Karmapa five times since the teen-ager's arrival.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Earnings Growth May Slow  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Coca-Cola's targets for earnings growth may have to be
lowered slightly, but the president of the world's largest soft-drink maker also
told Wall Street on Friday that he is optimistic about prospects for the
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas Daft, who has been designated to become chairman and chief executive
of Atlanta-based Coke, and two top lieutenants outlined their vision for the
company during a nearly two-hour presentation to securities analysts in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting came just two days after Coca-Cola announced plans to eliminate
6,000 jobs, or one-fifth of the worldwide work force. The sweeping
reorganization also will give local managers more authority over how best to
sell soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have put our business much closer to where the business actually takes
place," Daft said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola had an especially tough year in 1999. It recalled soft drinks in
several European countries after a health scare, its bid for the French soft
drink brand Orangina was blocked, it was forced to scale back plans to buy
several Cadbury Schweppes brands overseas and its sales in Asia and Latin
America suffered because of regional economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke also faces a suit in which several former employees claimed they were
denied promotions because of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas Ivester unexpectedly announced in December that he would step down
in April after about 2 1/2 years as chairman and chief executive. Daft was
designated to succeed him in those posts and was named president in the interim.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft said the company is reviewing whether it needs to change its annual
growth targets of 15 percent to 20 percent in earnings per share in the wake of
this week's restructuring and has not yet completed the analysis.
</P>
<P>
	   But he told the analysts on Friday that the 17 percent to 18 percent average
implied by the current estimated growth range "is a tad high."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the new average "if there is one, won't be below the mid-teens."
</P>
<P>
	   Marc Cohen, beverage analyst for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., said Daft's comments
"may have allayed concerns that it will move down more."
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola shares fell $2.56 1/4 to $56.93 3/4 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange. It has fallen more than 13 percent from its closing
level of $65.87 1/2 a share on Tuesday, the day before the restructuring
announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft also said he expects 5 percent to 6 percent growth in Coca-Cola's sales
volume of soft-drink concentrate to bottlers, slightly below the target of 7
percent to 8 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
	   That in part reflects the company's decision to reduce the soft-drink
inventories held by its independent bottlers to free money that they can use to
improve operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The inventory reduction will mean Coca-Cola will sell less concentrate to
its bottlers this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a vested interest in having our bottlers be successful," said James
Chestnut, an executive vice president whose responsibilities include finance.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft said he didn't want to estimate what volume growth would be beyond the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   But at another point in a question-and-answer session, he told the analysts
"I'm very optimistic about the growth rates."
</P>
<P>
	   Emanuel Goldman, who follows Coca-Cola for Merrill Lynch, said he was
encouraged by the presentation about the Daft team's candor in discussing its
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have a great sense of the business. They will be disciplined and
flexible. They will be thoughtful but they won't be shy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise As Stocks Dive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term bond prices rose sharply for a third day in a row
Friday as investors sought refuge in fixed-income securities during a major
selloff in the U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile shorter-term Treasuries fell amid growing expectations the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates next week to slow the economy and fight
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year note climbed  7/8 point, or $8.75 per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.45
percent, down from 6.52 percent at the same time on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   But prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 1/16 to 1/32 point, while
intermediate maturities rose 1/32 to 9/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   The divergence between long and short-term bonds has been a running theme in
the Treasury markets for over a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices initially slumped Friday on the release of more strong economic
news, which heightened fears that interest rates are headed higher.
</P>
<P>
	   But interest rate concerns quickly gave way to a desire for a safe haven as
stocks plunged. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 289 points, while the
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 152.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors often shift money to government bonds when stocks tumble because
bond returns, while generally smaller than those from stock investments, are
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Thursday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.62
percent as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point from Thursday to 5.46
percent. Six-month yields were 5.84 percent, as the discount rose 0.05
percentage point to 5.59 percent. One-year yields were 6.17 percent as the
discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 5.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell
to 5.56 percent from Thursday's 5.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index for municipal bonds rose 1/16 to 91 11/32 point. The
yield was 6.30 percent, down from 6.31 percent late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> FDA Advisers Support Drug for MS  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A cancer drug appears to ease advanced multiple
sclerosis, government scientists decided Friday -- leaving Novantrone in line to
become the nation's first treatment for tens of thousands of Americans with
crippling late-stage MS.
</P>
<P>
	   But Novantrone can be used only for about two years before it suddenly and
mysteriously increases patients' risk of dangerous heart damage, and MS is a
disease patients battle for decades.
</P>
<P>
	   So using Novantrone safely, quitting the drug around that two-year mark,
will require intense patient and doctor education, members of a Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee warned.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA is not bound by its advisers' recommendations but usually follows
them. If approved, Novantrone would become the first official treatment for
"secondary progressive MS," the most severe form of the debilitating neurologic
disease.
</P>
<P>
	   About 350,000 Americans have MS, which starts with such symptoms as
numbness, tingling and fatigue but progresses to difficulty walking and seeing
and eventually paralysis. It usually strikes people ages 20 to 40.
</P>
<P>
	   MS tends to come in sporadic attacks, or flares. Some patients have
"relapsing-remitting MS," periods of severe symptoms after which patients almost
totally recover until the next attack. But 40 percent of MS patients have the
worse "secondary progressive" form, where the flares become more and more
frequent, and they don't recover from the damage each one causes.
</P>
<P>
	   Three drugs are in use that can somewhat ease relapsing-remitting MS, but
until now no drug has been proved to work against the more severe form, said Dr.
Craig Smith of Seattle's Swedish Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
	   MS occurs when patients' immune systems go awry and attack the fatty layer
of insulation, called myelin, that protects nerve fibers in the brain and spine,
thus damaging or even destroying nerves.
</P>
<P>
	   Novantrone, a cancer drug made by Seattle-based Immunex Corp., works against
MS by suppressing those attacking immune cells.
</P>
<P>
	   In a two-year study of 194 Europeans with advanced MS, high doses of the
drug slowed the disease's progression by 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Novantrone causes side effects typical of cancer chemotherapy -- some
nausea, hair loss, menstrual disorders, certain infections.
</P>
<P>
	   But the main worry is that after patients take a certain amount of the drug
-- the amount most would get over a two-year period -- they become at risk for
heart failure. Doctors don't really understand why.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this drug is approved, it's only going to be a short-term drug and there
will be risks associated with it," cautioned Dr. Stephen Reingold of the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
</P>
<P>
	   It may prove difficult to get MS patients who feel healthy when taking
Novantrone to give it up for fear of the heart problem. Thus FDA's advisers
urged the agency to make the danger very clear, and consider ways for doctors to
measure accurately when MS patient are becoming at risk so they stop the drug.
</P>
<P>
	   Novantrone currently is sold to treat certain leukemia and prostate cancer
patients. That means regardless of whether FDA formally approves it for MS,
doctors today can legally prescribe the drug to MS patients. Some are doing so.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly, I don't have anything else to use," said Smith, who began
prescribing Novantrone after learning of the European study.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith's patient, Catherine Sykes, has been on Novantrone for a year, after
older MS drugs did nothing to stop the flares that struck every few months.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have not had one exacerbation since I've been on the chemotherapy," she
said, and her only side effect is a little nausea. "I've noticed improvements in
my walking. I have less fatigue and better muscle control."
</P>
<P>
	   Novantrone is given intravenously once every three months, costing $2,800 to
$3,000 for a year's treatment.

<HEADLINE> ISP Launches Bid for Dexter Corp.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. (AP) -- International Specialty Products Inc. is
launching a hostile takeover bid for Dexter Corp., the nation's oldest publicly
traded company after a previous bid worth nearly $1 billion was spurned.
</P>
<P>
	   ISP said Friday it plans to nominate 10 board members "who are committed to
considering and pursuing ISP's offer or a superior proposal" when Dexter has its
annual meeting in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Dexter, a specialty chemicals company, last month rejected a $45-per-share
offer from ISP, which is headed by wealthy investor Samuel J. Heyman. The Dexter
board called the ISP proposal too low.
</P>
<P>
	   Heyman said in a letter to Dexter officials that once he had control of the
board, he intended to allow ISP's $932 million offer to be considered directly
by Dexter shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Windsor Locks-based Dexter said it was reviewing Heyman's letter "and
would respond in due course."
</P>
<P>
	   ISP, of Wayne, N.J., also said it filed a federal lawsuit in Connecticut on
Thursday, seeking to overturn Dexter's "poison pill" takeover defense that makes
it harder for a bid to succeed, and validate its proposed board vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded in 1767 as a cloth mill, Dexter was one of the nation's first
conglomerates by the 1830s. It makes products for the aerospace, electronics,
food packaging, and medical markets. It is the oldest company publicly traded on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Heyman, who owns 75 percent of ISP and about 10 percent of Dexter, has been
critical of Dexter's takeover of Life Technologies Inc. of Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Dexter holds 71 percent of Life Technologies; Heyman owns most of the rest
of the company. He has said he believes Dexter and Life Technologies would be
better off apart.
</P>
<P>
	   ISP makes chemicals, mineral products and filters. Life Technologies makes
supplies for biological research and genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
	   In his letter to Dexter chairman K. Grahame Walker, Heyman said the 10
percent decline in Dexter's stock price since it rejected ISP's offer shows
"Dexter's own shareholders appear to have rejected its business strategy, as
well."
</P>
<P>
	   Under Heyman's proposal, Dexter shareholders would replace the three current
board members up for re-election in April and add seven others, enlarging the
board to 17.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Dexter stock fell 31 1/4 cents to $37.87 1/2 in trading at 5:15
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. ISP stock, also traded on the NYSE, fell 31
1/4 cents to $7.43 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Life Technologies stock, rose $3.88 to $53 per share in trading at 4 p.m.
over the counter.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plunge: Dow Ends Off 289.15  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks staged a sharp decline Friday as fresh inflation
news sparked a wave of "sell" cries on Wall Street, with banks, manufacturing
and technology companies bearing the brunt of the bad news.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 289.15 points, or by 2.6 percent,
to 10,738.87, led lower by General Electric, General Motors and J.P. Morgan.
That selling spree brought the week's loss to 512.84 points, and left the Dow at
its lowest level since Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   An underlying worry of many investors is expectations that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates when it meets next week, and again later in
the year, curbing business expansion by making it more expensive to borrow
money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index swooned 152.49 points, or by 3.8 percent, to
3,887.07, its second-biggest point drop ever, as investors dumped shares of the
usual favorites like Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle. The Nasdaq, which ended last
week at a record high, lost 348.33 points since then.
</P>
<P>
	   A broad blue-chip barometer, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, fell 38.40 to
1,360.16.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the session began, the government released two reports that
reinforced expectations that Fed policy-makers will intensify their battle
against inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "With that news this morning, buyers just walked away and will wait for the
Fed," said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. "The market will
be weak, looking for direction, until everybody knows what the Fed is doing."
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 5.8
percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, well above the 5.1
percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 5.9 percent
rate posted in the last three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, closely
watched by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter,
or more than the 0.9 percent increase many analysts were expecting. Employment
costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price.
</P>
<P>
	   Those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug
along despite three increases in lending rates by the Fed since June. The
central bank's inflation-fighters meet again on Tuesday and Wednesday. But more
pivotal to the market than the expected rate boost may be the accompanying
statement on the Fed's stance going forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Consequently, interest-rate sensitive bank stocks took a beating Friday.
J.P. Morgan fell 7 9/16 to 118 1/16, Chase Manhattan Bank slid 4 to 76 11/16 and
Citigroup fell 2 7/8 to 56 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Industrial companies, which are especially vulnerable to economic cycles and
higher oil prices, also saw their shares fall. General Electric slid 7 3/4 to
134, and General Motors closed down 3 7/8 at 79.
</P>
<P>
	   The selloff was exacerbated by investors, who are buying more stocks with
borrowed money, worried about signals from technology favorites.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazon.com, for example, said Friday it will fire 150 people to cut costs.
And earlier this week, Qualcomm said demand for its products was slowing.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazon.com's stock fell 5 1/4 to 61 11/16 on Friday while Qualcomm's shares
slid 9 7/16 to 110 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Even technology stalwarts did not escape the selling spree, like Intel, down
4 1/8 to 94, and Oracle, down 4 7/16 to 47 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everytime interest rates go up, companies with high (price-to-earnings
ratios) go down the most, and technology stocks have the highest" ratios, said
Ron Hill, a partner at Brown Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
	   One bright spot in the market was the pharmaceutical companies, such as
Merck, up 2 1/4 to 76 3/8, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, up 4 at 84 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   But biotechnology companies were not as lucky. Biogen plunged 7 11/16 to 92.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which has been on a tear, fell
12.40 to 504.62.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Stock Exchange declining issues outnumbered advancers by
more than 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.076 billion shares vs. 1.115 billion in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.17 percent, Germany's DAX
index fell 0.84 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.02 percent, and France's
CAC-40 rose 0.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> State drops final two charges against former Whitman fund-raiser  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - For the first time in more than three years,
Michael Francis, Gov. Christie Whitman's former head fund-raiser and sports
chief, is out from under the cloud of a criminal investigation.
<P>
	   Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said Friday that he will not pursue the
remaining two counts of a 12-count indictment charging Francis with trying to
force an Atlantic City shopping center to hire his cleaning business.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge had previously thrown out the other 10 counts because the state's
case against Francis was weak.
</P>
<P>
	   State prosecutors had said Francis, the head fund-raiser for Whitman's
successful 1993 gubernatorial campaign, threatened the Ocean One Mall with labor
unrest if it did not award his Planned Building Services a $500,000 cleaning
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense said there was no evidence that Francis did anything other than
promote his company. His statements that there would be no labor problems were
meant to reassure the mall owners, not threaten or pressure them, the defense
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmer said it was in the best interest of the state not to proceed with the
two remaining charges - tampering with witnesses and falsifying records.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made the decision in light of the court's prior rulings dismissing eight
out of 12 counts of the indictment, sharply limiting the evidence that the jury
was allowed to hear, and directing a verdict of acquittal on two further
counts," Farmer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis, whom Whitman forced out as chairman of the New Jersey Sports and
Exposition Authority, said in a statement that Farmer's decision "ends what has
been a devastating and painful period in my life."
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's conclusion, therefore, is a bittersweet moment. It seals my
vindication and establishes my innocence, but it also marks the loss of so much
time and opportunity."
</P>
<P>
	   The governor was in Switzerland on Friday for a conference. Her spokesman,
Peter McDonough, said the governor would not second-guess former Attorney
General Peter Verniero's decision to indict Francis.
</P>
<P>
	   "No governor is privy to what goes into a decision to pursue a criminal
case. We are under a presumption that the attorney general received the best
professional advice to pursue a case," he said.

<HEADLINE> Gadhafi Tosses Parliament's Budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi threw out his parliament's
proposed 2000 budget Friday and criticized lawmakers for allocating too much
money to administration rather than development.
</P>
<P>
	   Gadhafi told the General People's Congress that he was ``shocked and
dismayed'' that legislators had earmarked all of Libya's oil revenue to the
administration, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported from the Libyan capital
of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
	   Gadhafi said that when he came to power in 1969, it was decided that 70
percent of oil revenue would be assigned to new development projects and 30
percent would be spent on government and public services, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Libya rarely releases budget figures and it was unknown to what extent it
has stuck to those 70-30 figures. However, more than 90 percent of government
expenditure is usually financed from oil revenue. Libya produces 1.3 million
barrels a day and 75 percent of production is for export.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What happened is that today 100 percent of the oil revenues are devoted to
the administration,'' the agency reported him saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a policy ``squanders away the future and is a great treason we cannot
permit,'' Gadhafi said. ``Libya has to spend its revenues on everything that
will allow the country to advance,'' he told the parliament, which was convened
in the coastal city of Sirte.
</P>
<P>
	   Gadhafi told legislators to draw up a new budget, allocating the bulk of
funds to infrastructure. He mentioned the construction of roads, ports and
airports, industrial and agricultural projects, health and education.
</P>
<P>
	   Officially Libya is run by a series of people's congresses and committees,
but real power rests with Gadhafi, who ousted the former king in a military
coup. Only one political party is permitted.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians: Israel Stalling Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian leaders on Friday accused Israel of wasting
time in peace talks, saying Prime Minister Ehud Barak is not serious about
meeting a Feb. 13 deadline for an outline of a final peace treaty between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak on Friday canceled a weekend trip to an economic conference in Davos,
Switzerland. That move dashed hopes for a three-way summit with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton, who both were to be in attendance
and planned to meet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Barak doesn't want to reach an agreement with us,'' said
Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath. ``All he wants to do is to waste
time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty talks have yielded little progress. With
the deadline for a treaty outline fast approaching, Israeli negotiator Oded Eran
and his Palestinian counterpart, Yasser Abed Rabbo, are to hold talks starting
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
possible the talks would be moved to the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat by
midweek. The official said a final decision on the venue has not yet been made.
</P>
<P>
	   At a meeting of the Palestinian cabinet Friday evening, Arafat said Israel's
``delaying and evading implementation of the interim agreements is harming the
peace process very badly,'' the Palestinian news agency WAFA said in a news
release.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians had proposed moving the talks to Washington, but Israel
refused, Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want our negotiations with the Israelis to be under the supervision of
the United States, the same as the negotiations between Syria and Israel,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, said earlier Friday that negotiations
would intensify next week. But both sides have said they doubt the February
deadline for an outline can be met.
</P>
<P>
	   The sides have set September as the deadline for a final treaty. Difficult
issues are on the agenda, including borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements and the fate of Jerusalem, which both claim.

<HEADLINE> FCC Changes Course on Religion  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bowing to pressure from religious broadcasters and
Republican lawmakers, the Federal Communications Commission on Friday reversed
its ruling that some religious programming, including church services, cannot be
considered educational.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC's original action, though affecting only a limited number of
religious broadcasters, had prompted complaints that regulators were trying to
control the content of religious TV. A lawmaker introduced legislation this week
that would have undone the FCC's order.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the commissioners, in a 4-1 vote, undid it themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Regrettably, it has become clear that our actions have created less
certainty rather than more, contrary to our intent,'' the commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy stemmed from an FCC decision in December that offered
additional guidance for noncommercial broadcasters who seek licenses for
specially reserved educational TV channels. To qualify for such licenses, the
commission said that broadcasters must devote 50 percent of their regularly
scheduled air time to educational programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission determined that programming ``primarily devoted to religious
exhortation, proselytizing or statements of personally held religious views and
beliefs generally would not qualify as 'general educational' programming.'' In a
footnote, it said church services also normally would not qualify as ``general
educational'' programming.
</P>
<P>
	   That language drew fire from hundreds of religious broadcasters and a number
of Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, who had proposed the bill to repeal
the FCC's action, said he was ``thrilled'' by the reversal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Religious broadcasters and their listeners were a target for an FCC that
sought to limit their freedom to express religious faith,'' Oxley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Religious Broadcasters declared the decision ``a total
victory,'' but spokesman Karl Stoll said the group would maintain a vigilant eye
on the commission to prevent reprisals.
</P>
<P>
	   FCC Chairman Bill Kennard had tried to calm the furor by stressing that the
ruling did not apply to the majority of religious broadcasters, who operate on
commercial channels. About 373 television stations hold educational reserve
licenses nationwide, but about only 20 of these are religious broadcasters,
according to FCC estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Even those who wanted special educational licenses would still only have to
meet the requirement that 50 percent of their programming be educational,
Kennard noted in letters to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FCC acknowledged Friday the ``difficulty of minting clear
definitional parameters for 'educational, instructional or cultural'
programming.''
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Michael Powell, who had dissented from the original decision to
issue the guidance in December, said ``it has opened a Pandora's box of
problems.'' He supported the FCC's Friday action to return the judgment back to
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   But Commissioner Gloria Tristani accused the FCC of caving in to ``an
organized campaign of distortion and demagoguery.'' She particularly took issue
with critics who suggested that the commission had an anti-religious bias.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I reject and resent this type of attack, reminiscent of a witch hunt,''
Tristani wrote in her dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Starr, co-chairman of the grassroots Save Pittsburgh Public TV
Campaign, said he was dismayed by the FCC's reversal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're stunned by the sudden and last-minute capitulation,'' said Starr,
who had organized an effort among groups that included the National Education
Association to defend the guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Oglesby To Lead Seattle P.I.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Los Angeles Times executive Roger Oglesby has been named
publisher and editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, succeeding J.D.
Alexander, who will become an assistant to Hearst Newspapers president George B.
Irish, The Hearst Corp. said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Post-Intelligencer managing editor Ken Bunting has been
promoted to executive editor, Hearst announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Oglesby, 51, most recently was president of the Orange County edition of the
Los Angeles Times. Before that, he held numerous positions with Times parent The
Times Mirror Co., including editor and vice president of the Allentown Morning
Call in Pennsylvania and president and CEO of California Community News. He also
served in editorial positions with Knight-Ridder's San Jose Mercury News and the
Omaha World-Herald.
</P>
<P>
	   "Roger brings to the Post-Intelligencer a broad background with impressive
depth in both the business and editorial aspects of journalism," Irish said. "We
are confident that he will build on J.D.'s achievements at the helm of the
Post-Intelligencer."
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander joined the Post-Intelligencer as executive editor in 1986 and was
named publisher in 1993. He previously served as managing editor of The San
Diego Union and held various positions at The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
	   Bunting, 51, joined the Post-Intelligencer in 1993 as managing editor,
supervising all news content. As executive editor, he also will be responsible
for the newspaper's web site and other "new media," and will serve on the
Post-Intelligencer editorial board.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst publishes 12 daily newspapers, including the Houston Chronicle, San
Francisco Examiner, San Antonio Express-News and the Times Union in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post-Intelligencer publishes daily except Sunday. It has operated since
1983 under a joint operating agreement with The Seattle Times in which the
newspapers compete editorially but share advertising, circulation and production
resources.

<HEADLINE> Abducted Children Return to Uganda  </HEADLINE>
   By HENRY WASSWA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) -- A pitifully thin girl was the first to emerge from
the airplane, carried down the stairs and placed gently in a wheelchair.
Struggling behind her on crutches was a boy with only one leg.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the plane was empty, 19 sick and weak-looking adolescents were
back in their homeland of Uganda after being released from months -- or possibly
years --of captivity under Ugandan rebels based in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last month, about 60 child captives have been handed over by Uganda's
feared Lord's Resistance Army rebels to their sometime military backers, Sudan's
government. In turn, Sudan has allowed aid workers to return the young people to
Uganda as part of a deal to improve relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
	   They are the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the thousands of children believed to have been systematically kidnapped
by the rebels over the past decade, at least 5,000 remain missing -- 2,000 of
whom are believed to be alive, a United Nations Childrens' Fund official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boys serve as porters and fighters to the rebels -- who are led by former
soldiers and other northerners disgruntled with Uganda's government. Girls are
often forced to be concubines of rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the freed children who arrived Friday in Entebbe, near Uganda's
capital of Kampala, was a girl holding a five-month-old baby at her breast.
Officials said the tiny child had been fathered by one of the LRA commanders
whom she was forced to ``marry.''
</P>
<P>
	   The one-legged boy cried ``for days saying he wanted to go home,'' said Afaf
Yahya, another UNICEF official.
</P>
<P>
	   Although dressed in new shoes and clothes, the children showed little
emotion for a welcoming ceremony after the flight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mood is rather sad, but I am happy that my children are back. It is a
positive indication that Sudan is willing to honor the agreement signed here
with the Uganda government,'' said Uganda's Vice-president Specioza Kazibwe, who
presided over the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The children are held against their will and their identification,
repatriation and resettlement is a gigantic task,'' she said, drawing cheers
from an otherwise somber audience when she put a child on her back, then held
another in her lap.
</P>
<P>
	   No one has said how the Sudanese government arranges to receive the children
from the LRA, which it had been arming. And it remained unclear how many more
children will be released.
</P>
<P>
	   UNICEF officials said the 19 children will be flown Saturday to the northern
town of Gulu to receive medical treatment, counseling and to be handed over to
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The LRA is one of several rebel organizations from northern and northwestern
Uganda that have attempted to oust President Yoweri Museveni, himself a former
rebel leader who took power in 1986. Sudan has also accused Uganda of backing
southern Sudanese rebels.

<HEADLINE> Thruway board quietly approves toll hike plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Thruway Authority board has quietly approved a 3
percent toll hike beginning June 1 to pay for improvements to the superhighway
and other transportation projects.
<P>
	   The board Thursday voted to go forward with a previously unannounced plan to
tie future toll increases on the Thruway to the construction cost index, which
is an average of construction material and labor costs. The first-year hike will
be 3 percent, the maximum annual increase under the new toll increase system.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls at the short-trip barriers around Buffalo and New York City would not
go up because they are rounded to the nearest quarter. But virtually all other
tolls on the ticketed part of the superhighway would go up by 3 percent, rounded
to the nearest nickel.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway officials will hold four public hearings to gather comment on the
toll-increase plan and finalize the plan this spring, Thruway spokeswoman Anya
Frost said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Authority's executive director, John Platt, insisted no final
decision had been made. "They're holding public hearings in April and they could
change their minds," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls were last raised on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road, in
1988. In 1996, the Thruway board backed away from a toll hike at the insistence
of Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   There was little, if any, advance word that the board was contemplating a
toll hike before Thursday's meeting. The press release issued by the Authority
afterward spoke of the agency funding $275 million in capital improvements this
year. Not until the second page of the release did the Authority refer to the
adoption of a plan which could result in an annual toll hike - it called it an
"indexed toll adjustment plan" - beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   "This common-sense plan will ensure that motorists are never hit with
massive toll hikes, while providing businesses that rely on the Thruway with the
information they need when planning their budgets," the Authority said in a
statement from Chairman Louis Tomson.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority leader of the state Senate said Friday he is opposed to raising
tolls. Joseph Bruno cited such a hike as running counter to recent state efforts
to cut taxes and other costs of doing business in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now is not the time for the Thruway Authority to impose a hidden tax on
upstate businesses, residents and commuters in the form of multiyear toll
hikes," Bruno, R-Rensselaer said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the Senate majority wants to make money available for capital projects
we'll be more than happy to discuss this alternative," Platt said. But otherwise
"we need to be able to have a hedge against the cost of construction."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Motor Truck Association blasted the Authority for the secretive
manner in which it voted to raise tolls, and said it appeared there was nothing
to prevent tolls from going up 3 percent every year if construction costs
continue to rise annually.
</P>
<P>
	   "As business people we would never increase our prices to our largest
customers without first consulting with them," grumbled the Motor Truck
Association's president, Bill Joyce.
</P>
<P>
	   It called on Pataki to ask the Thruway Authority to reexamine its projected
toll hike and to find other ways to fund improvements on the roadway.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon refused to take a stance on the plan. "At
this point it's just a proposal," he said. "There's going to be public hearings.
We'll let the process move forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the $275 million in projects to be put out for bid this year by the
Thruway was worked on the Interstate 287 corridor around the Tappan Zee Bridge
and the Syracuse Inner Harbor development project.
</P>
<P>
	   Both projects are among the transportation facilities the Thruway has
assumed authority for in recent years. Critics say the drain of these other
facilities have put additional financial burdens on the Authority past that of
maintaining the original toll highway between New York City and the Pennsylvania
border.
</P>
<P>
	   Tomson was a former deputy to Pataki and was nominated by the governor to
the Thruway position. It is unlikely that the Thruway Authority board would
proceed with a toll hike plan without the prior knowledge of Pataki's office.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plunge: Dow Ends Down 289.15  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks staged a sharp decline Friday as fresh inflation
news sparked a wave of "sell" cries on Wall Street, with banks, manufacturing
and technology companies bearing the brunt of the bad news.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 289.15 points, or by 2.6 percent,
to 10,738.87, led lower by General Electric, General Motors and J.P. Morgan.
That selling spree brought the week's loss to 512.84 points, and left the Dow at
its lowest level since Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   An underlying worry of many investors is expectations that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates when it meets next week, and again later in
the year, curbing business expansion by making it more expensive to borrow
money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index swooned 152.49 points, or by 3.8 percent, to
3,887.07, its second-biggest point drop ever, as investors dumped shares of the
usual favorites like Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle. The Nasdaq, which ended last
week at a record high, lost 348.33 points since then.
</P>
<P>
	   A broad blue-chip barometer, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, fell 38.40 to
1,360.16.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the session began, the government released two reports that
reinforced expectations that Fed policy-makers will intensify their battle
against inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "With that news this morning, buyers just walked away and will wait for the
Fed," said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. "The market will
be weak, looking for direction, until everybody knows what the Fed is doing."
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 5.8
percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, well above the 5.1
percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 5.9 percent
rate posted in the last three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, closely
watched by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter,
or more than the 0.9 percent increase many analysts were expecting. Employment
costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price.
</P>
<P>
	   Those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug
along despite three increases in lending rates by the Fed since June. The
central bank's inflation-fighters meet again on Tuesday and Wednesday. But more
pivotal to the market than the expected rate boost may be the accompanying
statement on the Fed's stance going forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Consequently, interest-rate sensitive bank stocks took a beating Friday.
J.P. Morgan fell 7 9/16 to 118 1/16, Chase Manhattan Bank slid 4 to 76 11/16 and
Citigroup fell 2 7/8 to 56 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Industrial companies, which are especially vulnerable to economic cycles and
higher oil prices, also saw their shares fall. General Electric slid 7 3/4 to
134, and General Motors closed down 3 7/8 at 79.
</P>
<P>
	   The selloff was exacerbated by investors, who are buying more stocks with
borrowed money, worried about signals from technology favorites.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazon.com, for example, said Friday it will fire 150 people to cut costs.
And earlier this week, Qualcomm said demand for its products was slowing.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazon.com's stock fell 5 1/4 to 61 11/16 on Friday while Qualcomm's shares
slid 9 7/16 to 110 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Even technology stalwarts did not escape the selling spree, like Intel, down
4 1/4 to 94, and Oracle, down 4 7/16 to 47 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everytime interest rates go up, companies with high (price-to-earnings
ratios) go down the most, and technology stocks have the highest" ratios, said
Ron Hill, a partner at Brown Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
	   One bright spot in the market was the pharmaceutical companies, such as
Merck, up 2 1/4 to 76 3/8, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, up 4 at 84 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   But biotechnology companies were not as lucky. Biogen plunged 7 7/16 to 92
1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which has been on a tear, fell
12.40 to 504.62.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Stock Exchange declining issues outnumbered advancers by
more than 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.076 billion shares vs. 1.115 billion in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.17 percent, Germany's DAX
index fell 0.84 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.02 percent, and France's
CAC-40 rose 0.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> UN Warns of Unrest in East Timor  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations on Friday warned of the potential
for social unrest in East Timor because of unemployment, high food prices and
disrupted social services in the aftermath of the territory's vote for
independence.
</P>
<P>
	   To try to counter the risk, Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended that
the U.N. transitional administration in East Timor, or UNTAET, make creating
jobs and beefing up East Timor's destroyed infrastructure a priority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The East Timorese have received UNTAET with a great deal of goodwill and
very high expectations as the embodiment of the international community's
promise of support,'' Annan wrote in a report to the Security Council.
``However, they are in desperate straits and are understandably impatient for
UNTAET to deliver on this promise.''
</P>
<P>
	   East Timor's people voted overwhelmingly in a U.N.-organized ballot on Aug.
30 to break away from Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese colony in
1975 and annexed it a year later.
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesian-backed militias went on a weeks-long killing and looting rampage
to protest the results, destroying large parts of the territory and driving tens
of thousands of East Timorese into the neighboring, Indonesian-controlled
territory of West Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations estimates there are still nearly 100,000 people in
refugee camps set up in West Timor, where pro-Indonesian militias continue to
operate, allegedly harassing and intimidating the refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   In his report, Annan said the U.N. mission, which has been running the
territory for three months, is trying to coordinate humanitarian relief efforts.
But he said the destruction of the territory, particularly in public services,
would continue to be a serious obstacle to progress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Widespread unemployment and the disruption of the education system and
other social and public services, combined with the very high prices of food and
other daily necessities, bear the potential for serious social problems,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to trying to create more jobs, expanding trade will be an
important step in lowering the prices of basic goods, Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Mars Web Site Touts Health Benefits  </HEADLINE>
    By NINA RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Snacking on chocolate needn't be a guilt trip, a candy
maker assures consumers in a Web site that suggests there may be health benefits
to eating the treat.
</P>
<P>
	   Mars Inc., the Hackettstown-based maker of M&AMP;M's, Snickers and 3 Musketeers,
stops short of claiming chocolate is a health food. But it is believed to be the
first major chocolate manufacturer to promote research on the possible
disease-fighting properties of the plant compounds found in the candy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone knows that chocolate tastes great; most don't know that chocolate
may provide certain health benefits. The good news is, eating well can include
chocolate," according to the Web site, www.cocoapro.com.
</P>
<P>
	   The site said "preliminary research" suggests that cocoa beans contain
antioxidants called polyphenols, which may reduce the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cocoapro logo -- a graphic of a hand holding a cocoa bean -- will appear
on the back of candy bar wrappers beginning this quarter, with the hopes that
consumers will turn to the Web site to ease their conscience.
</P>
<P>
	   Hershey Foods Corp. and Nestle USA, both Mars competitors, are not promoting
the health benefits of their products.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurie MacDonald at Nestle said, however, that her company finds the
research "interesting and promising" and is following it closely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chocolate Manufacturers Association has its own Web site touting the
health benefits of chocolate. The site notes that research suggests eating a
chocolate bar instead of a high carbohydrate snack raises "good cholesterol"
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   One researcher who has done several studies on chocolate's health properties
said they show it does have some benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our work shows that chocolate does have antioxidant effects, which could
protect against heart disease, premature aging and possibly cancer," said Penny
Kris-Etherton, a nutrition professor at Penn State University.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a nonprofit organization that advocates food safety and nutrition,
said Friday that Mars is using its Web site to make assertions that the federal
government has not yet approved for its packaging.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is irresponsible health advice," said Silverglade. He warned that many
candy bars contain a significant amount of saturated fats, which have been
proven to raise blood cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Food and Drug Administration has not approved any health claims
for chocolate. Any such claims on the candy wrapper would require FDA
authorization.
</P>
<P>
	   Marlene Machut, a spokeswoman for Mars, said the company is not suggesting
replacing fruits and vegetables with a Snickers bar.
</P>
<P>
	   "We support what nutritionists have been saying: moderation and a balanced
diet is the key to healthy living. Chocolate can certainly fit into a healthy
diet and a healthy lifestyle," she said. "People need to enjoy their
food."

<HEADLINE> McCain Holds Thin Lead in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EXETER, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain battled Friday to hold off Gov. George
Bush and gain the New Hampshire triumph needed to sustain his underdog
presidential campaign as the five-man Republican field headed into a final
weekend of campaigning before the nation's first primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, in a two-front fight against staunch conservative candidates on one
side and the more moderate McCain on the other, believed he was narrowing the
gap, aides said. But they also said the Texas governor might run out of time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There would have to be a sea change in voter attitudes'' for McCain to
lose, said Ken Khachigian, one of the Arizona senator's advisers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, front-runner nationally, said that win or lose in New Hampshire on
Tuesday, ``I will survive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The majority of public polls Friday gave McCain the lead, but they also
offered Bush reason to hope. Conservative Steve Forbes was running a distant
third, still taking aim at Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Four days before the nation's first primary, the GOP campaigns launched
their get-out-the-vote drives and made final decisions on weekend TV ads. Unlike
past years, when negative ads were part of the closing-weekend dynamic, the
top-tier campaigns decided to keep their attack spots off the air unless a rival
went first.
</P>
<P>
	   Though eleventh-hour attacks could still hit Monday, the reluctance to go
negative suggested that McCain, Bush and Forbes were focusing on turning out
their supporters rather than trying to peel away their rivals' backers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Absent any earth-shattering events this weekend, it's all going to come
down to turnout,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor said he had ``a very good chance'' of winning Tuesday.
But whatever happens, Bush told reporters, ``I'm in it for the long pull,'' with
a campaign well organized in primary states beyond New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, however, can't afford to lose here, his aides said. With a fraction
of Bush's money and little support from the party establishment, McCain's
longshot strategy is to hobble Bush in New Hampshire and ride the momentum into
later primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I know is it's tight,'' McCain said, belying the upbeat mood of his
senior staff. Both Bush and McCain drew large crowds Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Duprey, New Hampshire's Republican Party chairman, said McCain was the
man to beat, but he sensed Bush gaining ground. ``The Bush people have to pour
it on to catch John,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has been leading in most polls, using his strength among
independents, while a couple of polls have shown the race very close. Tracking
polls, which are sometimes unreliable, showed Bush gaining ground on McCain
after Wednesday's debate by getting increasing support from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, meanwhile, was being squeezed from the right and left. While McCain
kept him occupied, conservative voters were flirting with Forbes, Alan Keyes and
Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
	   Criticism was served with coffee at a Manchester donut shop Friday, as Bauer
attacked Bush's abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe Governor Bush is AWOL on this issue,'' he said. Later, he told
employees at an investment firm in Merrimack that others in his party were
reluctant to take controversial stands on issues. ``I think too many of the
people in my party get up in the morning and head for the tall grass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to a group of college students, Keyes' eyes welled up with tears
when spoke of his religious faith.
</P>
<P>
	   And Forbes joined forces with McCain to sue for inclusion on New York
primary ballots. Both candidates are accusing Bush of trying to keep them off.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes flew several current and former Texas education officials to
Manchester to criticize Bush's record as governor. Bush's rhetoric about his
Texas record is ``in direct contrast to what has actually happened,'' the
publisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush replied as he usually does to Forbes: by recalling his rival's 1996 TV
ads that damaged the campaign of eventual nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people of New Hampshire are going to reject that kind of
campaigning,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning to McCain, the Texan said President Clinton's State of the Union
address showed that the president and McCain ``agree on the size of the tax
cut.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not significant enough,'' Bush said of the $350 billion, 10-year tax
cut proposed by Clinton. McCain is proposing a $237 billion in tax cuts over
five years, half the size of Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning the tables, McCain compared Bush to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George Bush's tax plan is exactly the kind of empty promise we've had from
President Clinton the last eight years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Already flush with endorsements, Bush picked up the backing of former New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu. Former vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp
endorsed Bush a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said the back-to-back backings show ``real desperation among the
establishment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the scenes, McCain's campaign mailed promotional material to 95,000
Republican women and more than 100,000 independent voters. In addition, 60,000
veterans will be getting letters discussing the former Vietnam POWs ``one last
mission.''
</P>
<P>
	   Letters from Bush's mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, were sent by the
Texan's campaign to tens of thousands of New Hampshire residents. Each voter
identified by the campaign as a Bush backer will get four pieces of mail and
four telephone calls urging them to vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' mailouts said that Bush couldn't be trusted to cut taxes or
government spending.

<HEADLINE> Citizenship Support for Elian Wanes  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Florida nun selected by Attorney Gen. Janet Reno as a
neutral party in the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez sought unsuccessfully on
Friday to persuade Reno to change her mind about returning the 6-year-old to
Cuba. Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin also backed legislation to make Elian an American
citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   Conceding ``I am no longer neutral,'' O'Laughlin told reporters she has come
to believe that separating Elian now from his Florida relatives would be
``another traumatic loss for him'' after the death of his mother at sea in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   Her abandonment of impartiality was denounced by those seeking Elian's
return to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am bewildered,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. ``Never in my wildest
imagination would I think that a nun who was supposed to be a neutral party
would undermine that neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin, the Barry University president whose Miami Beach home was used
earlier in the week for a meeting between Elian and his Cuban grandmothers, said
she now thinks it is in the boy's best interest to stay in this country, at
least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
	   But Reno, a longtime friend, did not back away from her support of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that the boy be returned to his
father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She would only change her mind, I believe, if she could find legal reasons
to change her mind and have adequate evidence that that would be necessary,''
O'Laughlin said outside the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno, after escorting O'Laughlin to the department door, said in a written
statement that she had ``listened to all she had to say. She told me about her
feelings, observations and conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``However,'' Reno said, ``I continue to believe, based on all the
information available to me, including the information that Sister Jeanne shared
with me, that the person who speaks for this child is his one surviving parent
-- his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the stark difference of opinion, the two women remained friendly at
the end of their meeting, O'Laughlin said: ``I left my meeting with Janet Reno
with a gigantic hug, and a promise that we will both keep pursuing the truth as
we see it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The INS ruling has not been carried out because the federal government
agreed to postpone action until the family had an opportunity to challenge it in
court, which Elian's Florida relatives have done, filing a lawsuit in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing Friday in Miami, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said he
would hear arguments on Feb. 22 on whether the lawsuit should be dismissed. On
Thursday, the judge had set a hearing date of March 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said she hoped the case would be ``resolved as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before meeting with Reno, O'Laughlin visited Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., chief
sponsor of the citizenship bill, and announced her support for it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The child has been in the torment of the seas and now he's been in the
torment of political agendas. Somehow we must find for him calm seas, at least
for a while,'' she said. If it takes a congressional act to keep him here, so be
it, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her support for the legislation came just as it appeared to be losing ground
in Congress. Elian's grandmothers made the rounds of Capitol Hill this week
urging the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Mack conceded that the grandmothers' visits had ``affected some of my
colleagues,'' costing potential support for his legislation, but denied that
O'Laughlin's support for it would undermine her credibility or was intended on
his part to counter the grandmothers' visits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't care about politics, we care about our grandson,'' said Mariela
Quintana, the paternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers might return to Cuba this weekend, said the Rev. Joan Brown
Campbell of the National Council of Churches, which has facilitated their
travel.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting in Reno's office ran more than an hour and a half, twice the
scheduled length. Also present were INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and Peg
Albert, a child psychologist and colleague of Sister Jeanne. The INS is part of
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the center of an international tug of war since he was found
clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and others
traveling with him from Cuba had drowned.

   MIAMI (AP) -- A former Miami-Dade County commissioner who was caught on tape
taking a $5,000 bribe was sentenced Friday to two years and three months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   James Burke, who declared, ``This is a wonderful country'' after taking the
money from an informant, was convicted of bribery in October.

sentencing hearing.

millions of dollars in business to San Francisco financier Calvin Grigsby, a
founder of what was once the nation's leading minority-owned municipal bond
firm.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cohen Optimistic on U.S. Defense  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday he remains
optimistic that the Pentagon can build a reliable national missile defense,
despite the failure of a missile interceptor test last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The science is there'' to build a system of radars and interceptors that
could defend all 50 states against a limited attack by long-range ballistic
missiles, Cohen said in an interview in his Pentagon office.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said the interceptor launched last week from Kwajalein Island in the
central Pacific missed its target -- a mock warhead sent aloft by a Minuteman
missile from more than 4,000 miles away -- by less than 100 feet. That was a
more precise description of the outcome than Pentagon officials had previously
provided.
</P>
<P>
	   The exact reason the intercept missed still is being sought, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he still intends to give President Clinton a recommendation this
summer on whether to commit to deploying a national missile defense. If the
commitment is made, the plan is to have it ready for use by 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense secretary said Clinton will take into account the level of
threat posed by countries, such as North Korea, that are trying to build
long-range ballistic missile forces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The threat is there and is likely to grow,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   On other topics, Cohen said:
</P>
<P>
	   --The Russian army is now bogged down in its war in Chechnya to the point
where the outcome is uncertain. ``Whatever victory they might secure, they
certainly have to face a long-term type of guerrilla warfare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   --The 2001 defense budget, to be submitted by President Clinton on Feb. 7,
will include about $60 billion in money to buy new weapons. About $1 billion of
that will be devoted to repairing shortcomings exposed in the Kosovo war last
spring, including the purchase of an additional Joint Stars ground surveillance
aircraft, an additional squadron of Navy EA-6B electronic warfare aircraft and
more unmanned surveillance planes.
</P>
<P>
	   --He intends to ask Congress again this year for authority to close more
military bases. He did not sound optimistic about the chances of persuading
Congress, which has refused to grant such authority in each of the last three
years. ``Can we achieve it this year? I don't know,'' he said. He said he is
consulting with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., about how to
approach the problem this year.
</P>
<P>
	   --The Pentagon's policy on gays in the military, in which homosexuals are
permitted to serve as long as they don't reveal their sexual orientation, is
``generally being implemented effectively,'' despite highly publicized lapses.

<HEADLINE> Postal Truck Crashes, Mail Burns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A U.S. Postal Service truck crashed and caught on fire
after its driver swerved to avoid boulders from a landslide, burning thousands
of letters.
</P>
<P>
	   Postal workers will be able to salvage only about 10 percent of them, and
because the fire needed to be hosed down, even the salvageable mail was soaked,
postal service spokesman David Mazer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The big rig mail truck, which left the Mojave Mail Processing Center, was
bound for Los Angeles International Airport early Thursday. The driver suffered
minor injuries in the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Postal workers on Friday dried out the salvageable mail, Mazer said. When
dry, each piece will be placed in a plastic bag and sent to its intended
recipient, or to the sender if that address is the only one legible.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Agenda to Small Town  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUINCY, Ill. (AP) -- President Clinton took the agenda for his final year in
office to small town America on Friday, saying strong economic times demand
action on Social Security, education, inequality and other long-term challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   The president asked the residents of Quincy to remember how they banded
together in 1993 when flood waters imperiled neighboring communities along the
Mississipppi River -- and how their forefathers harbored slaves seeking freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you have the chance of a lifetime to do good, you cannot be lulled
into complaceny,'' Clinton said, his overcoat collar turned up against the
frigid weather as he spoke in Washington Park, site of the sixth Lincoln-Douglas
debate. The president urged an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand people to
seize ``the challenge of a new era.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got to understand that we're a strong country when we all work
together and we give everyone a chance to rise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With Republicans in control of Congress and the November elections beginning
to steal the political spotlight, the prognosis for Clinton's agenda is not
rosy. But at a White House breakfast with dozens of mayors earlier Friday, the
president said saving the retirement system and improving schools are too
important to be stymied by election-year politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The further away you move from the grass roots, the more likely politics
is to shift from deeds to words,'' he said, asking the local leaders to join his
cause. ``You mayors can make a difference here.''
</P>
<P>
	   This town of 42,202, named for John Quincy Adams -- who served 17 years in
Congress after leaving the White House -- welcomed Clinton warmly the day after
he delivered his last State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds were on hand at Baldwin Field when the presidential plane arrived.
Local television lingered on every handshake and positioned cameras along the
motorcade route to broadcast his arrival live.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty ``local heroes,'' from law enforcement officers to teachers and
businessmen, were seated on the platform as Clinton spoke in Washington Park.
</P>
<P>
	   Quincy is home to farmers and manufacturers. A century ago, it provided safe
haven to escaped slaves who made it across the Mississippi River and victims of
religious persecution. In 1993, the community served as a staging area for
relief efforts when flooding overwhelmed nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton chose to visit Quincy, aides said, because it symbolized communities
large and small across the country that have prospered during his
administration. Crime and unemployment have reached historic lows over the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the politically important state of Illinois, unemployment has
declined 3 percentage points since Clinton took office in 1993, more than 35,000
children have entered the Head Start program, and crime is down 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The president repeated his call for investing more in education -- from Head
Start to college tuition assistance; shoring up Social Security while paying
down the $3.6 trillion public debt; and spurring investment in areas that have
yet to share in the recent economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can bring free enterprise and hope to people who have never had it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a nod to the farmland surrounding Quincy, Clinton also called anew for
overhaul of federal assistance to farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should be using this time wisely to deal with the long-term
challenges,'' Clinton said. ``That's what I want the American people to
support.''

	   World Pride Roma 2000 is expected to bring hundreds of thousands of gays and
lesbians to Rome at the same time the city is overflowing with religious
pilgrims coming to the Jubilee millennium celebrations called by Pope John Paul
II.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rome has a millennium-old code of welcome and respect that won't change in
2000,'' Rutelli told a city council meeting on Holy Year issues Friday as about
20 demonstrators gathered outside to protest World Pride.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican, which condemns homosexual acts but not homosexuality itself,
had no official comment on the July 1-9 event. Vatican officials denied reports
that the Holy See had tried to get it canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also acknowledged
that the Vatican was irritated by the fact that the gathering comes during the
Jubilee year.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Saturday, Italian RAI state radio quoted Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the
pope's secretary of state, as saying during a reception Friday evening that the
Vatican ``expects from the premier a gesture of common sense,'' an apparent call
for the Italian government to intervene to cancel the gay event.
</P>
<P>
	   Sodano also was quoted as saying the controversy ``puts into question'' the
concordat, a document regulating relations between Rome and the Vatican that was
first signed in 1929 and was revised in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   A pro-Vatican member of parliament, Mario Baccini, called the mayor's
decision a ``moral and material slap'' in the face of the Holy See.
</P>
<P>
	   Vatican officials said the Holy See was displeased by the city's cooperation
with the organizers, including allocation of $180,000 to cover municipal costs
like security.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutelli has been a big Jubilee booster, shepherding the city through major
construction projects -- including a Vatican garage -- to spruce it up for an
estimated 30 million pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican's Holy Year calendar includes days dedicated to the sick, to
children and to city traffic officers. The pope's fellow Poles get their day
during the first week in July -- the same time as World Pride.
</P>
<P>
	   Gays have criticized the pope's teachings on homosexuality, but Italian gay
leaders denied any disrespect is intended by holding World Pride during the
Jubilee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not an anti-Jubilee event nor an event against the pope,'' said
Francesco Falsetta, an official of the Mario Mieli Homosexual Cultural
Association, one of the organizing groups.
</P>
<P>
	   World Pride's main event will be a July 8 march through the city. Organizers
say it will also feature conferences, sporting events and parties.

<HEADLINE> Virgin Islands Landfill Burns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- Firefighters were attempting to
extinguish a landfill fire Friday on the U.S. Virgin island of St. Croix.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire at the landfill sent up a plume of smoke over the area, but did not
affect flights at the nearby airport, said Public Workers Commissioner Harold
Thompson. Authorities did not know what caused the fire nor when it would be
contained.
</P>
<P>
	   Landfill fires are not uncommon at the U.S. Virgin Islands' two landfills,
the other located on St. Thomas island. In June an explosion caused by a fuel
tank at the St. Croix landfill threw up a 2,000-foot-high mushroom cloud and
ignited a fire that burned for several days.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the local government to shut
down the St. Croix landfill by December 2002 because it attracts birds, which
could cause a danger to planes using the nearby airport, Port Authority
executive director Gordon Finch said.

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Patient Convicted  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman with multiple sclerosis was convicted of drug
possession on Friday for lighting a marijuana cigarette in a congressman's
Capitol Hill office when she felt the onset of an attack related to her illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Stephanie Duncan-Peters of the District of Columbia Superior Court
ruled in a nonjury trial that the woman, Renee Emry Wolfe, 39, of Ann Arbor,
Mich., had not met the burden of proof necessary for a medical defense.
</P>
<P>
	   She could have sentenced the mother of four to six months in jail and fined
her $1,000, but instead ordered Wolfe to perform 50 hours of community service
and pay court costs of $50.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would prefer that (Wolfe) return to her home and deal with her medical
condition in whatever way she and her doctor deem appropriate,'' Duncan-Peters
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marijuana is banned by the federal government, although voters in six states
have approved laws allowing the drug to be used for medical purposes. Nearly 70
percent of voters in Washington, D.C., voted last year to allow the medical use
of marijuana, but Congress has blocked the measure from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe went to Rep. Bill McCollum's office on Sept. 15, 1998, carrying the
marijuana and a sign to protest his resolution saying marijuana is a dangerous
drug that should not be legalized for medical use.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Jeffrey Orchard said Wolfe intended to simply tell the
congressman about her experience with marijuana, but started to feel tense. She
lighted the marijuana cigarette only when she believed she was about to suffer
an attack of shaking and muscle tightening caused by her condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A neurologist, Dr. Denis Petro, testified that marijuana works as a muscle
relaxant, allowing people with multiple sclerosis to control their shaking, or
spasticity. Other drugs produce severe side effects or are not as effective, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Alex Bourelly acknowledged ``this is a unique case, and a unique
defense,'' but said it was clear Wolfe was guilty of marijuana possession under
the law in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said the ``case comes down to whether there was a necessity for
(Wolfe) to possess marijuana on that day in the District of Columbia.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There isn't any evidence she was suffering an attack of spasticity at the
time she was in the congressman's office,'' Duncan-Peters concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system that afflicts
more than 300,000 Americans. Wolfe has difficulty walking and usually sits in a
wheelchair.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Hits Northern Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8
shook northern Japan, but there were no reports of damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The quake, which hit Friday night around 11:21 p.m., was centered about 35
miles under the floor of the Pacific Ocean off the eastern coast of Japan's
northern island of Hokkaido, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was felt most strongly in the cities of Kushiro and Nemuro and the towns
of Nakashibetsu, Akkeshi and Betsukai in Hokkaido. People in the northern region
of Honshu, Japan's main island, also felt the quake.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no fear of tsunami, or seismic waves caused by undersea
disturbances such as volcanic activity or undersea earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
	   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause damage to houses if it is centered in a
residential area.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. It sits atop
four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the earth's surface.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Couple Returns After Fleeing  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVE KARNOWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A couple who say their son has ``brittle bone'' disease
and fled when authorities contended they beat him have returned to Minnesota and
worked out a deal with prosecutors, ending nine months on the run.
</P>
<P>
	   Wally Hines III, 31, and his wife, Debby, 32, came back with their
18-month-old son, Wyatt, on Wednesday and appeared in court Friday. They were
released without bail and allowed to keep custody of their child.
</P>
<P>
	   The criminal charges will be dismissed Oct. 30 if the parents stay out of
trouble with the law, continue to cooperate with authorities on care for the
child, and if the boy remains in good health, Dakota County Attorney James
Backstrom said. The agreement includes continued involvement by social service
workers and juvenile court supervision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're very happy. They wanted to come home,'' said John Whitehead,
president of The Rutherford Institute, a Charlottesville, Va.-based legal
advocacy group that helped negotiate their return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they feel that things have worked out about as well as could be
expected,'' said Wally Hines Jr., Wyatt's grandfather. ``I didn't think they
would have come back otherwise, to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the county attorney's office, Diane Anderson, said
officials couldn't give further details because all parties in the case remain
under a judge's gag order.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hineses and their defenders have always denied that Wyatt was the victim
of abuse and maintained that authorities overreacted to his injuries. The
parents were never charged with child abuse, only with depriving the county of
its custodial rights and federal charges of interstate flight to avoid
prosecution. The federal charges are being dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   The family says Wyatt suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic
disease that affects some 20,000 to 50,000 Americans, or about 1 in 20,000. They
say that's what explains the broken leg and broken ribs that first brought Wyatt
to authorities' attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the gag order, it was unclear if prosecutors were still disputing
the diagnosis. They had suggested earlier that the boy's fractures might have
been caused by roughhousing by his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation in Gaithersburg, Md.,
say it's common for social workers to conclude that children are victims of
abuse when they're really victims of OI, and that the condition can be difficult
to diagnose.
</P>
<P>
	   Wyatt's problems were first noticed when he was just 6 weeks old and his
parents took him to a doctor with a swollen leg. X-rays showed that his femur
was broken in two places. When child protection workers ordered more X-rays,
doctors found six broken ribs, and Wyatt was put in foster care for three
months, where he suffered more fractures.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple got Wyatt back when they agreed to a deal that required the
father to live away from their home for four weeks. Shortly before a final
hearing in May, Wyatt's femur broke again, and they fled April 27 after learning
police were coming to take Wyatt away.

<HEADLINE> For blind graduate and his aging Seeing Eye Dog, ceremony means  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   POMONA, N.J. (AP) - One by one, all 599 graduates walked up the aisle of
the gymnasium of the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey on Friday. One by
one, they engaged in the familiar graduation ceremony routine: A handshake, a
diploma, a posed photograph.
<P>
	   Nearly everyone got some applause from classmates or family members. But the
whole crowd roared for Tony Skladanek. Or was it Amelia they were cheering for?
</P>
<P>
	   Skladanek, 33, of Northfield, and Amelia - his Seeing Eye dog - walked up
the ramp near the dais as the applause grew louder. Skladanek was handed his
psychology degree, then shook hands with Carole Hedinger, a member of the
college's Board of Trustees, before heading down the ramp and back to his seat.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a graduation for me and a retirement party for her," Skladanek said
later.
</P>
<P>
	   The German Shepherd, which is 11 years old, is gradually going blind.
Skladanek will soon replace her, but she'll only be losing a job - not a friend.
</P>
<P>
	   "She'll stay right here and live in the lap of luxury with my family. I'll
be getting my own apartment in Atlantic City," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Skladanek, a former casino waiter, lost his sight 12 years ago as a result
of complications stemming from diabetes. A graduate of Atlantic Community
College, he went on to earn a 3.38 grade-point average at Stockton, where he
relied on Braille and student note-takers to help him work.
</P>
<P>
	   But his peers learned plenty from him, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people, when they're having a hard time at school and they think
they can't do it, they look at me. I give 'em a boost. They think 'If he can do
it, I can do it.' I seem to encourage people, even before I ever open my mouth,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   They were certainly encouraged Friday when Skladanek and Amelia - both
wearing caps and gowns - walked up to receive his diploma.
</P>
<P>
	   After the ceremony, he and his family celebrated with a graduation party at
their home.
</P>
<P>
	   But Skladanek, who hopes to either attend graduate school or go to work for
the state Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired, wasn't interested in
dwelling on his accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after the ceremony, he was already antsy for a new challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel like I'm wasting time now, not going to class," he said.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Chicago Gangster Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEBOYGAN, Wis. (AP) -- A man who allegedly ran the drug trade for Chicago's
largest street gang has been arrested in Wisconsin, where he lived under an
assumed name and worked at a cheese factory.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnny Jackson, 27, was ordered detained Friday by a U.S. magistrate,
pending a transfer to Chicago. He was the only high-ranking member of the
Gangster Disciples, a 5,000-member gang, who remained at large.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson was named in a 50-count federal drug indictment in 1995, and the
U.S. Marshals Service called him one of its 15 most wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson lived in Sheboygan for about five to six months before marshals
arrested him at his home Thursday, investigator John Ambrose said. Since going
into hiding, Jackson had worked menial jobs in Indiana, Minnesota and Wisconsin,
most recently at a Sheboygan cheese factory, the marshals service said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson is thought to have run day-to-day drug money collection for the
Gangster Disciples, the marshals service said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He had been a high-ranking authority in the gang, and the gang protected
him,'' Ambrose said. ``He didn't tell people a lot about himself.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson also is sought for questioning about a 1998 apartment fire that
killed his common-law wife, the service said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russian Bank Funds Gone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- In the latest scandal surrounding Russia's troubled banks, the
liquidator of a bankrupt Russian bank has apparently disappeared, along with the
bank's remaining funds, a newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokobank was once Russia's 11th-biggest bank. It went bankrupt after the
financial crisis of August 1998, which sent hundreds of Russian banks into
insolvency.
</P>
<P>
	   After nearly a year of paying back creditors from Tokobank assets, about
$8.8 million remained for assorted unpaid creditors by the end of 1999, the
Kommersant daily said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Vladimir Belayev, the man put in charge of repaying creditors,
didn't return from a New Year holiday and his assistant, Maxim Alexeyev, has
also disappeared, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the money, an investigation has found that it, too, had vanished, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the financial crisis hit, the Central Bank moved in to save the larger
banks, but Tokobank was not spared and was declared bankrupt by a Moscow court
at the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Ad Hits Gore on Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to capitalize on Al Gore's shaky abortion record,
Bill Bradley is set to air an ad accusing the vice president of straddling on
what many Democrats see as a bedrock issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of the seven men running for president, only one candidate has been
pro-choice for everyone all the time,'' a narrator says in the ad.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore says he has always believed that abortion should remain legal. But for
many years he voted to prevent government from paying for abortions for poor
women in the Medicaid program. Gore also voted in 1984 to define the word
``person'' under four civil rights laws to include ``unborn children from the
moment of conception.'' And in a 1987 letter to constituents, he called abortion
``arguably the taking of human life.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the late 1980s, Gore changed his mind and began supporting Medicaid
abortion funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, vowing to campaign more aggressively, is hitting Gore hard on the
issue. He pounded it in their debate Wednesday, and will begin airing a new
television ad Saturday in New Hampshire, which holds the nation's first primary
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the kind of issue you can't straddle,'' Bradley says, speaking
directly to the camera. ``You can't be on both sides. You have to decide which
side you are on. Are you anti-abortion, or are you pro-choice? And I decided a
long time ago that I'm pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley ad, coupled with his aggressive criticism of Gore's abortion
record, represents a run at women voters who are crucial to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore emphasizes that he supports federal funding now and notes that there is
no difference between the two candidates' current positions. Still, the issue
continues to dog him.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on a New Hampshire public radio call-in show Friday, a woman
accused Gore of lying about his abortion record in Wednesday's debate. ``I don't
know how I can support your candidacy if you're so dishonest on national TV,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore responded: ``I have always supported Roe vs. Wade. I have always
supported keeping abortion legal. And it's true, early in my career I voted to
restrict the use of federal funding in some circumstances, but over the years
I've come to the view that federal funding ought to be available.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new Bradley ad is among the sharpest of the Democratic campaign, but it
stops short of being a direct attack, not mentioning Gore by name. It's not
unlike a Gore ad that ran in Iowa that picked on a Bradley Senate vote to
declare that Gore was the ``only Democrat'' who was there for farmers during
damaging floods.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly anxious about Gore's abortion-rights record, his campaign on
released Friday an ``open letter'' from 42 members of Congress stating that ``Al
Gore is pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   That letter was followed by a list of 300 New Hampshire women pledging
support for Gore, in part, because of his commitment to women's health and
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore's campaign insists it is not worried about the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the voters of New Hampshire are very smart and recognize that this
is the politics of desperation,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley released three other ads on Friday, all of which were upbeat and
positive.
</P>
<P>
	   One recounted his work in passing legislation requiring health insurance
companies to pay for at least 48 hours in the hospital after childbirth. A
second touted newspaper endorsement. And the third had basketball legend Bill
Russell urging people to turn out at the polls Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Citizenship Support for Elian Wanes  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Florida nun selected by Attorney Gen. Janet Reno as a
neutral party in the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez sought unsuccessfully on
Friday to persuade Reno to change her mind about returning the 6-year-old to
Cuba. Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin also backed legislation to make Elian an American
citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   Conceding ``I am no longer neutral,'' O'Laughlin told reporters she has come
to believe that separating Elian now from his Florida relatives would be
``another traumatic loss for him'' after the death of his mother at sea in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   Her abandonment of impartiality was denounced by those seeking Elian's
return to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am bewildered,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. ``Never in my wildest
imagination would I think that a nun who was supposed to be a neutral party
would undermine that neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin, the Barry University president whose Miami Beach home was used
earlier in the week for a meeting between Elian and his Cuban grandmothers, said
she now thinks it is in the boy's best interest to stay in this country, at
least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
	   But Reno, a longtime friend, did not back away from her support of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that the boy be returned to his
father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She would only change her mind, I believe, if she could find legal reasons
to change her mind and have adequate evidence that that would be necessary,''
O'Laughlin said outside the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno, after escorting O'Laughlin to the department door, said in a written
statement that she had ``listened to all she had to say. She told me about her
feelings, observations and conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``However,'' Reno said, ``I continue to believe, based on all the
information available to me, including the information that Sister Jeanne shared
with me, that the person who speaks for this child is his one surviving parent
-- his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the stark difference of opinion, the two women remained friendly at
the end of their meeting, O'Laughlin said: ``I left my meeting with Janet Reno
with a gigantic hug, and a promise that we will both keep pursuing the truth as
we see it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The INS ruling has not been carried out because the federal government
agreed to postpone action until the family had an opportunity to challenge it in
court, which Elian's Florida relatives have done, filing a lawsuit in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing Friday in Miami, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said he
would hear arguments on Feb. 22 on whether the lawsuit should be dismissed. On
Thursday, the judge had set a hearing date of March 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said she hoped the case would be ``resolved as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before meeting with Reno, O'Laughlin visited Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., chief
sponsor of the citizenship bill, and announced her support for it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The child has been in the torment of the seas and now he's been in the
torment of political agendas. Somehow we must find for him calm seas, at least
for a while,'' she said. If it takes a congressional act to keep him here, so be
it, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her support for the legislation came just as it appeared to be losing ground
in Congress. Elian's grandmothers made the rounds of Capitol Hill this week
urging the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Mack conceded that the grandmothers' visits had ``affected some of my
colleagues,'' costing potential support for his legislation, but denied that
O'Laughlin's support for it would undermine her credibility or was intended on
his part to counter the grandmothers' visits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't care about politics, we care about our grandson,'' said Mariela
Quintana, the paternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers might return to Cuba this weekend, said the Rev. Joan Brown
Campbell of the National Council of Churches, which has facilitated their travel
and supports the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Friday, the council said it was ``surprised'' that O'Laughlin
``chose to step out of her assigned role of neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We regret that Sister Jeanne, in choosing to state her opinion after
exercising the role of neutral host so admirably, has in her action further
fueled the fire of controversy and eliminated herself as a neutral facilitator
in any future discussions on this matter,'' the council said.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting in Reno's office ran more than an hour and a half, twice the
scheduled length. Also present were INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and Peg
Albert, a child psychologist and colleague of Sister Jeanne. The INS is part of
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the center of an international tug of war since he was found
clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and others
traveling with him from Cuba had drowned.

<HEADLINE> China Frees U.S. College Librarian  </HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDE R. MARX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese authorities freed a U.S. college librarian on
Friday, five months after they arrested him on charges of smuggling secret
documents out of the country, U.S. and Chinese officials said here.
</P>
<P>
	   Song Yongyi, who works at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., was scheduled
to arrive in Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said the U.S. government was pleased
by China's decision but ``did not believe there was any evidence to warrant his
detention.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, China's ambassador to the United States said in a statement that
Song ``admitted all the facts related to his criminal activities ... and also
voluntarily revealed evidence against illegal activities of others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song's case was treated with leniency because of his ``repentance,'' said
the ambassador, Li Zhao Xing.
</P>
<P>
	   Song, a 50-year-old Chinese national who had planned to become a U.S.
citizen in September, was on a trip to China in August to collect source
material on the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when he and his wife, Helen Yao,
were detained. His wife was allowed to return to the United States in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickinson officials have said Song was collecting previously published
material to bring to the United States, but the Chinese contended he was
``purchasing or illegally supplying intelligence'' to people outside China.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley cited the efforts of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and several congressional delegations that visited China
for pressuring the Chinese government to release Song.
</P>
<P>
	   Specter said he learned of Song's release during a meeting with Li at the
Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday morning. He said he believes Chinese
authorities released Song to curry favor with Congress, which will decide
whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations, formerly known as
most-favored-nation trading status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They know they'll need our votes,'' said Specter, who declined to comment
on Song's alleged confession.
</P>
<P>
	   Contacted at home by The Associated Press, Song's wife Yao said: ``He called
me and said he was free. Today is a very exciting day.'' She said the State
Department told her Song would arrive in Detroit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickinson President William Durden said he was ``appreciative of the actions
of the Chinese government and look forward to his return to his family and our
campus.'' Durden also declined to comment on the confession but called the
release a victory for academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   Song is an expert on documents about the Cultural Revolution, when millions
in China were persecuted as Mao Tse-tung sought to consolidate his power. The
communist government continues to regard the period as extremely sensitive and
heavily restricts access to archived material about it.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Breaks Kidnap World Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia broke its own world record for kidnappings
last year with nearly 3,000 reported abductions, a private watchdog group
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Dramatic mass abductions by leftist guerrilla contributed to a 33 percent
increase in kidnappings, according to the Pais Libre foundation. The 2,945 cases
in 1999 compares to 2,216 the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   The surge in abductions helped spawn a citizen-based peace movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Half of the year's kidnappings were carried out by leftist rebels. Common
criminal gangs were the second biggest culprits.
</P>
<P>
	   The guerillas, who often snare their victims at highway roadblocks, have
turned to ransom as a way to finance their armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   The highest number of rebel abductions were attributed to Colombia's largest
guerrilla band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
	   But the year's most spectacular kidnappings were carried out by the smaller
National Liberation Army, or ELN.
</P>
<P>
	   In April, the group hijacked an Avianca airliner and abducted all 41 people
aboard. One month later, ELN commandoes raided a Catholic mass and trucked more
than a hundred faithful into the mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   The report issued Friday also noted a six-fold increase in kidnapping last
year by the rebels' main rivals, rightist paramilitary groups who are backed by
wealthy landowners. The militias kidnapped 120 people during 1999, Pais Libre
reported, among them well known human rights activists and a left-leaning
Senator.

<HEADLINE> Federal judge may ease GOP primary ballot rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The federal judge hearing Sen. John McCain's request to
get his name back on state presidential primary ballots said Friday he was
considering cutting by 80 percent the number of signatures state GOP leaders can
require candidates to collect.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Edward Korman said it appeared New York's top
Republicans had designed onerous ballot access rules in an effort to close the
presidential primary to all but their favorite candidate - this year, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   "Isn't that the reality of what's happening here?" Korman asked during a
three-and-a-half conference with lawyers from the state GOP and the campaigns of
McCain, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes. "It's being done to wall off the Republican
primary."
</P>
<P>
	   A state judge threw McCain's name off ballots in eight New York
congressional districts on Thursday, potentially leaving him unable to contest
the March 7 primary in at least 12 of the state's 31 districts. The possibility
that Republicans in more than a third of the state may be unable to vote for a
candidate who some polls show leading in the crucial New Hampshire primary has
prompted renewed criticism of New York's notoriously arcane ballot access rules.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cumulative effect of these rules makes it virtually impossible for
candidates to get on the ballot without spending a huge amount of money" or
having the support of the state party, said McCain attorney Burt Neuborne. "It
seriously burdens voters of the state of New York if they cannot express their
support for Sen. John McCain."
</P>
<P>
	   State party leaders say the requirements are a legitimate way of determining
whether candidates have statewide support and that McCain's campaign should have
done a better job of signature-gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   "The McCain campaign was not a reasonably diligent campaign, and that's the
standard," said Lawrence Mandelker, a lawyer for the state party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes campaign - which has spent more than $650,000 so far trying to
get on the ballot - joined McCain's lawsuit and asked Korman to place the
millionaire publisher's name back on the ballot in three Long Island
congressional districts where his petitions were declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, stumping in New Hampshire, said he welcomed Forbes' involvement in
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am glad he's joined us," McCain said. "It shows that other people are
deprived" ballot access.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Keyes asked the judge to eliminate the requirement that
signatures be collected district by district, instead allowing candidates to
appear on the ballot if they gather 5,000 names statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes and Gary Bauer decided not to contest the New York primary because of
the complicated requirements, but Keyes' lawyers asked that both candidates be
allowed to try again under a lower standard.
</P>
<P>
	   Korman, who said he hoped to issue a decision next week, appeared to be
considering a reduction in the number of signatures Republican candidates must
collect in each congressional district.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates are now required to get signatures of .5% of each district's
registered Republicans, plus 5,000 more signatures statewide. Korman discussed
with lawyers the possiblity of reducing the district requirement to .1%.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he planned to make a final decision by the end of next week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows Federal Aid for Ga.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As another winter blast was poised to pound Georgia on
Friday, President Clinton freed up federal aid to the state to recover from last
week's ice storm.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes asked the federal government to declare disasters in
39 northern counties because of the storm that left 500,000 customers without
electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Friday, North Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. requested federal
disaster aid to reimburse costs incurred by the state and 26 counties after a
winter storm that hit the state Jan. 24 and 25. ``This storm blanketed the
Piedmont of North Carolina with the greatest snowfall on record for a single
event in the last 100 years,'' Hunt wrote in a letter.
</P>
<P>
	   A disaster declaration makes federal money available to local governments
and individuals for repairs and loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a blizzard heading into Georgia this weekend was expected to
cover a much greater area and drop up to 3 inches of snow, plus sleet and
freezing rain, through Super Bowl Sunday. More than 100,000 people are expected
in Atlanta for the game between the Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams.

<HEADLINE> Court orders arguments soon on case holding up state tobacco funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Supreme Court on Friday ordered swift
hearings and a quick conclusion to a lawsuit that is keeping New Jersey from
cashing in on hundreds of millions of dollars from the national settlement with
the tobacco industry.
<P>
	   The court ordered the Appellate Division to accelerate arguments in the case
and then quickly rule on the appeal. The case involves 12 smokers who objected
to the state's settlement with big tobacco, saying more antismoking measures
should have been implemented.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials and an attorney for the dozen New Jersey residents say they
are attempting to work out a settlement that would avert having the case to go
court. But several issues remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
	   The court case has huge budget implication for New Jersey. Under the
settlement, New Jersey is to receive $7.6 billion over 25 years. State officials
say more than $180 million of the settlement money has been put in escrow until
the lawsuit is resolved. Gov. Christie Whitman on Monday said in her budget
message that she wants to use the money for a variety of health-related
programs, and also to help subsidize a school construction program nearing $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the tobacco agreement, New Jersey would lose the $7.6 billion if the
matter isn't settled by Dec. 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Those on both sides of the dispute, however, said Friday they expect a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything that moves us closer to a settlement will be good news, across the
board, for New Jersey," said Peter McDonough, Whitman's chief spokesman. "There
are some very good state programs funded through this settlement."
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed in 1997, demands that programs such as clinics to help
people stop smoking be written into the agreement. Other demands include chest
X-rays, cancer screening and medical exams.
</P>
<P>
	   Terry Paul Bottinelli, who is representing the 12 smokers in the lawsuit,
said many of those things were included in Whitman's budget message. He said the
state and his clients are getting close to a settlement, but concedes there are
issues that could force a trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we have been looking for has been the establishment of tobacco control
programs and antismoking programs," said Bottinelli. "It looks like the governor
is funding this."
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 involved in the lawsuit are not asking for personal payments, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bottinelli and state officials, however, said several issues are unresolved,
such as whether or not the tobacco industry should have to pay lawyers fees, and
what role the state will have in future lawsuit or fee matters.
</P>
<P>
	   The courts set no hearing date on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Pigeon sharpshooters called 'inhumane cowboys' by PETA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A posse of sharpshooters has taken to Buffalo's
residential streets with .22-caliber rifles and their sights on pigeons.
<P>
	   The band of pigeon busters is part of the city's Animal Control squad and is
armed daily with poison, traps, and rifles to handle residents' complaints about
unwanted wildlife.
</P>
<P>
	   The Common Council is considering a request to hire two more officers to the
six-member pest control squad.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are a bunch of inhumane cowboys enjoying target practice on taxpayer
dollars," said Stephanie Boyles, wildlife biologist for People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. "Residents who like pigeons or those who just don't want
bullets flying down their street shouldn't be paying for this."
</P>
<P>
	   The group learned of the practice through a Buffalo News article. Officials
weren't sure how long the shooting has been going on. Shooting nuisance birds by
government officials has been practiced in other cities nationwide. Shooting
within city limits would be illegal in most municipalities if done by private
citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's spokesperson, Peter Cutler, said that PETA's letter demanding
the hunt to be stopped and suggested options will be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're concerned for the health and safety of all residents, so we need to
watch out for disease, but on the same token we don't want anybody harmed while
these guys are out there," Cutler said. He said the rifles are used in the most
extreme circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll give serious review to other methods and take the most appropriate
action," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpshooters are ready each weekday to get rid of the unwanted birds. Frank
Poincelot, the city's head pest-control and wildlife officer, told the Buffalo
News that on "a good day, they (the pest-control officers) could go through 50
or 60 rounds of ammunition."
</P>
<P>
	   That means 50 to 60 dead birds, because officials insist the crew doesn't
miss its shots, which are often at birds perched on roof peaks of single- and
two-family houses. Although a .22-caliber bullet can travel a mile or more and
potentially through a bird, animal control officials said the shooting isn't a
threat to people. Most bird hunting is done with shotguns, not .22 caliber
rifles.
</P>
<P>
	   The main complaint of residents is the droppings left by roosting pigeons.
Some fear the spread of disease, but most just don't like cleaning up the mess.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyday in the spring I'm hosing my driveway and scraping my windshield,"
said Ann Marie Cortese of north Buffalo. "Those birds make me have extra work."
</P>
<P>
	   Pigeons have been accused of spreading everything from salmonella to
meningitis and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
	   PETA's website charges that pest control companies have spread the
misconception that urban pigeons spread disease. "The vast majority of people
are at little health risk from pigeons and have a better chance of getting
struck by lighting," the organization writes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Boyles concedes that the droppings can be a nuisance. "Sure, they are
annoying, but only effective methods will get rid of them," she said. "When you
kill a bird the only thing that'll happen is that another will take its place."
</P>
<P>
	   PETA suggests that homeowners and building managers should take measures to
make the roosting site less hospitable in the first place. Tying up wind chimes,
playing a radio, putting up effigies of predator birds or flying a balloon with
big eyes drawn on it have all proven effective, according to PETA.
</P>
<P>
	   "People feed the birds or leave their trash out attracting them," Ms. Boyles
said. "And then the birds are shot at, paying for our irresponsibility."

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Warned Against Independence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Independence for Taiwan would mean war with China, Vice
Premier Qian Qichen warned Friday as China stressed anew its own plan for
reunification.
</P>
<P>
	   Qian warned that those who want independence for Taiwan should not ``play
with fire,'' the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported late Friday. ``Taiwan
independence absolutely will not mean peace but war,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Qian spoke Friday at a forum marking the fifth anniversary of Beijing's plan
to reunify with Taiwan under the ``one country, two systems'' model it used for
Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
	   Qian, a foreign policy specialist who oversaw the return of Hong Kong in
1997 and Macau in December, reiterated the government's offer of giving Taiwan
more autonomy under more flexible policies than the arrangements with the other
two territories.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations with Taiwan could include ``international space for economic,
cultural and social activities for Taiwan that suits it, and the political
status of the Taiwan authorities,'' he said according to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
	   Qian repeated the mainland's offer that anything could be discussed as long
as Taiwan agreed to the ``one-China principle.'' He also reiterated the
government's condemnation of Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui for saying last
summer that the two sides should be treated as equals in talks.
</P>
<P>
	   China regards Taiwan as one of its provinces. The mainland and the island of
Taiwan have been ruled separately since the end of the Chinese civil war in
1949. Beijing demands that they be reunited eventually and has long threatened
to use military force if Taiwan declares independence.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Mayor Arrested in Sweep  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER KERR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sacramento police arrested the mayor of
neighboring Folsom and accused him of offering an undercover female officer cash
and cocaine for sex.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Everett Reginald Drew, known as Reggie Drew, was one of eight people
arrested Thursday night in the second police sweep made under a new city law
that allows authorities to impound cars used in prostitution and drug crimes,
Police Chief Arturo Venegas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew, 57, was booked on five felony and misdemeanor prostitution and drug
counts, and released on $5,000 bond. The Sacramento County district attorney
will decide whether to file formal charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew, leaving jail Friday morning, waved his arms when asked about the
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until we're through the judicial process, I can't comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew is mayor of Folsom, a city of 48,000 in eastern Sacramento County known
mainly for its giant state prison complex. He is also a manager with the state
Prison Industry Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the mayor approached the officer, who was standing on a
Sacramento street, and struck up a conversation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He offered cash as well as a small quantity of rock cocaine for the sex
act they agreed upon,'' said Capt. Ted Mandalla. He declined to give additional
details.
</P>
<P>
	   They went to a nearby motel the police were using for the sweep and arrested
Drew there, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew was captured on a video the department was making for a planned press
conference Friday to tout the success of the two sweeps, Mandalla said.
</P>
<P>
	   Results of chemical tests taken to determine if Drew was under the influence
of drugs are not yet back, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Cuts Dividend in Half  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH HETTENA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. slashed its dividend in half
Friday, continuing a belt-tightening that already includes plans for 2,800 new
job cuts in an attempt to reverse setbacks at its aerospace and aviation
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's second-largest defense business after Boeing Co. also reported
fourth-quarter earnings, after excluding one-time gains, fell 20 percent from a
year earlier, matching Wall Street's diminished expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed officials reiterated a warning first made last October that the
bleak financial picture would continue into the new year, but projected gains in
the years to come.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a very strong conviction that the year 2000 will be the low point
for earnings and cash generation for this corporation," chief financial officer
Robert J. Stevens told analysts in a telephone conference call Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed stock fell about 3 percent for the second day in a row, dropping 56
1/4 cents to $18.87 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutting quarterly dividend payments from 22 cents a share to 11 cents,
effective with the payout due March 31, is the latest in a series of measures
aimed at improving the bottom line. Reducing the dividend frees up about $180
million, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consistent with our previously announced focus on reducing debt, it is
prudent to change the dividend at this time," said Vance Coffman, the chairman
and chief executive of the Bethesda, Md.-based maker of rockets, satellites and
the F-16 fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the company announced it was eliminating 2 percent of its
140,000 jobs worldwide. Lockheed said the new cuts of 2,800 jobs in its aircraft
and rockets businesses would produce $200 million in annual savings. The latest
retrenchment brings the total number of jobs eliminated in recent months to
4,500.
</P>
<P>
	   "The purpose of these actions is to drive down indirect and administrative
costs to improve earnings and cash flow and reduce debt while improving focus on
these businesses," Coffman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed said it was considering whether to add another subsidiary, Lockheed
Martin IMS, to the list of eight company businesses on the auction block. The
Teaneck, N.J.-based unit, which had sales of $500 million last year, provides
services to government, including child-support collection and ticketing drivers
caught on red-light cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials also said they planned to close a deal to acquire
Bethesda-based Comsat Corp. in the first six months of 2000. Lockheed bought 49
percent of the satellite service provider last year, but cannot purchase the
rest until Congress changes Comsat's ownership rules to allow it. The House and
Senate are expected to begin working out final legislation next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts gave mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
	   "All the bad news is out. We think the stock is in the midst of a
turnaround," said Jeff Pittsburg of Pittsburg Institutional Inc., who is
advising his clients to buy the stock. "I think the dividends, the layoffs,
they're trying to create the cash flow. They're telling you they're going to
generate a lot of cash and that's very important."
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Nisbet of JSA Research Inc., rates the stock a "hold" -- one of the
lowest ratings generally given by analysts. He said the stock is in "limbo."
</P>
<P>
	   "The prospects as they have outlined them to us certainly aren't very
bright," he said. "It doesn't exactly exude confidence."
</P>
<P>
	   For the fourth quarter of 1999, Lockheed reported earnings of $293 million,
or 76 cents a share, compared with $125 million, or 33 cents a share, in the
same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
	   Profit in the latest quarter included $102 million, or 17 cents a share, in
one-time gains from the sale of surplus real estate, noncore businesses and the
company's stock in L3 Communication Holdings. The earnings of 59 cents, after
eliminating the unusual gains, met the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Lockheed earned $382 million or 99 cents a share, compared
with $1 billion or $2.63 a share in 1998. Excluding one-time charges, earnings
for 1999 would have been $1.50 vs. $2.99 for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, the company cut its earnings forecast for 2000 by more than half
to about $1 per share, and Lockheed saw its stock lose nearly half its value.
</P>
<P>
	   But the company also said it expected earnings per share to grow at an
annual rate of 15 percent to 25 percent in the near term, with growth at the
lower end of the range in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed's problems have been aggravated by troubles in its space systems
business. There have been several rocket launch failures as well as satellite
delays and the loss of satellite contracts, such as a long-held U.S. spy
satellite contract, reportedly worth $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of the company's flagship aircraft, the F-16 fighter jet, have
dwindled. Lockheed delivered 109 of the planes in 1998, down from 150 in the
previous year. The company now is almost entirely dependent on foreign
sales.

<HEADLINE> Judge May Intervene in N.Y. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge hearing Sen. John McCain's request to get
his name back on state presidential primary ballots said Friday that he was
considering cutting by 80 percent the number of signatures state GOP leaders can
require candidates to collect.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Edward Korman said it appeared that New York's top
Republicans had designed onerous ballot access rules in an effort to close the
presidential primary to all but their favorite candidate -- this year, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Isn't that the reality of what's happening here?'' Korman asked during a
more than three-hour conference with lawyers from the state GOP and the
campaigns of McCain, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes. ``It's being done to wall off
the Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
	   A state judge threw McCain's name off ballots in eight New York
congressional districts on Thursday, potentially leaving him unable to contest
the March 7 primary in at least 12 of the state's 31 districts. The possibility
that Republicans in more than one-third of the state may be unable to vote for a
candidate who some polls show leading in the crucial New Hampshire primary has
prompted renewed criticism of New York's notoriously arcane ballot-access rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The cumulative effect of these rules makes it virtually impossible for
candidates to get on the ballot without spending a huge amount of money'' or
having the support of the state party, said McCain attorney Burt Neuborne. ``It
seriously burdens voters of the state of New York if they cannot express their
support for Sen. John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
	   State party leaders say the requirements are a legitimate way of determining
whether candidates have statewide support and that McCain's campaign should have
done a better job of signature-gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The McCain campaign was not a reasonably diligent campaign, and that's the
standard,'' said Lawrence Mandelker, a lawyer for the state party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes campaign, which has spent more than $650,000 so far trying to get
on the ballot, joined McCain's lawsuit and asked Korman to place the millionaire
publisher's name back on the ballot in three Long Island congressional districts
where his petitions were declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, stumping in New Hampshire, said he welcomed Forbes' involvement in
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am glad he's joined us,'' McCain said. ``It shows that other people are
deprived'' ballot access.
</P>
<P>
	   Korman, who said he hoped to issue a decision next week, appeared to be
considering a reduction in the number of signatures Republican candidates must
collect in each congressional district.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates are now required to get signatures of 0.5 percent of each
district's registered Republicans, plus 5,000 more signatures statewide. Korman
discussed with lawyers the possibility of reducing the district requirement to
0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Keyes asked the judge to eliminate the requirement that
signatures be collected district by district, instead allowing candidates to
appear on the ballot if they gather 5,000 names statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes and Gary Bauer decided not to contest the New York primary because of
the complicated requirements, but Keyes' lawyers asked that both candidates be
allowed to try again under a lower standard.

<HEADLINE> Poland's Cabinet Won't Be Changed  </HEADLINE>
   By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's Cabinet emerged
unscathed Friday after the ruling Solidarity party, beset by infighting and
plunging public approval ratings, met to hash out ways to restore its battered
image.
</P>
<P>
	   After hours of closed meetings, Solidarity party leader Marian Krzaklewski
said there would be no Cabinet changes -- despite a clamor by some party
factions for Buzek to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Solidarity is a coalition of several factions,'' Krzaklewski said. ``They
can have different approaches but the approach of the bloc is the one supported
by the majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   Krzaklewski said Solidarity leaders agreed to reform the bloc's
parliamentary caucus in February, draft a new government program in March and
select a presidential candidate in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's talks reflected desperation within the party, which has its roots
in the Solidarity movement that toppled communism in 1989, to keep its members
in line behind unpopular economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Some party factions have been voting against the government in parliament
and are demanding that Buzek be replaced. Party leaders have responded by saying
those deputies could be banned from running again on Solidarity's ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   Solidarity's troubles are deepening as former communists exploit public
anger over cost-cutting in social services and a restructuring of moribund state
industries that is leaving many Poles without work.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll released this week by the CBOS agency put Solidarity's public
approval rating at a record low 16 percent. All recent credible surveys suggest
that if an election were held today, the former communists, who governed in the
mid-1990s, would return to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Solidarity leaders and their junior coalition partner, the center-right
Freedom Union, are reluctant to backtrack on reforms that have won high praise
from the West and set Poland on course to join the European Union. They say the
problem is a matter of poor public relations, not policy.
</P>
<P>
	   One group of rebellious Solidarity deputies even has organized a survey to
ask journalists what the party is doing wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   One question asks respondents to choose which term best describes the
party's media policy: ``joke, chaos, incompetence, lies, fun, sabotage,
stupidity, order, professionalism, accuracy, truthfulness or honesty.''
</P>
<P>
	   The feuding is being watched closely by Western investors, whose anxiety
runs high whenever economic reforms come under threat.

<HEADLINE> Storm Spreads More Snow in South  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA M. LaHAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A storm spread still more snow across the Deep South on
Friday, giving children from Arkansas to Georgia a rare chance to build snowmen
but threatening travel to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm, which had dumped up to 17 inches of snow in Oklahoma, dropped
between an inch and a foot in Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee
before stalling near the Alabama-Georgia line.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-grader Trent Franklin stayed up until after midnight to watch the
flakes start falling outside his Shelby County, Ala., home. Then he got up at
daybreak, bundled up and went outside to play in 2 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've got so many layers on I can't get cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm to was expected to re-form and head east, hitting the Atlanta area
with up to 3 inches of snow through Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could potentially turn into a significant icing,'' Weather Channel
meteorologist Robyn Hulecki said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a precaution, Delta Air Lines canceled some flights into Atlanta Friday
afternoon, but promised to accommodate passengers trying to get to the Super
Bowl. More than 100,000 people are expected in Atlanta for the game between the
Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the customers to get down there to the Super Bowl,'' said John
Farmer, Delta station manager in Nashville, Tenn. ``We'll work with them any way
we can to get them there by kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Benson, 28, of Kansas City, Mo., managed to beat the storm and arrive
at the Atlanta airport Friday. ``I feel very lucky that we made it here, that
the flight did not get canceled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While travelers worried, thousands of children in the Deep South enjoyed a
rare snow day. They threw snowballs and built snowmen as their parents took
Friday off from work.
</P>
<P>
	   In Alabama, TV stations stayed on the air all night giving live updates from
cold reporters framed on the screen by ``Winter Storm 2000'' graphics.
</P>
<P>
	   Brothers Brad and David Dooley in the Birmingham, Ala., area enjoyed the day
off from class by working on a snowman outside their house. Roads were clear,
but their mother had no complaints about schools being closed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How could they do anything with this out there?'' said Cynthia Dooley.
</P>
<P>
	   Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove activated about 300 National Guardsmen to
help communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials elsewhere also were treating the weather with urgency.
</P>
<P>
	   In North Carolina, which was surprised by 2 feet of snow this week, Gov. Jim
Hunt on Friday asked President Clinton to declare 26 counties disaster areas,
which would make them eligible for federal funds. About 13,000 customers
remained with power in the state, but they were expected to have it back by
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton approved a disaster declaration late Friday for 30 Georgia
counties because of an ice storm last week that left 500,000 customers without
electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
	   This weekend's storm is expected to cover a much greater area.

<HEADLINE> Thruway board quietly approves toll hike plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Thruway Authority board has quietly adopted a
plan which could provide for annual increases in tolls to pay for improvements
to the superhighway and other transportation projects.
<P>
	   The board Thursday voted to go forward with a previously unannounced plan to
tie future toll increases on the Thruway to the construction cost index, which
is an average of construction material and labor costs in 20 U.S. cities. The
first-year hike would be 1.8 percent under that system, according to Thruway
Authority Executive Director John Platt.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls at the short-trip barriers around Buffalo and New York City would not
go up because they are rounded to the nearest quarter. But virtually all other
tolls on the ticketed part of the superhighway would go up by 1.8 percent,
rounded to the nearest nickel.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway officials will hold four public hearings to gather comment on the
toll-increase plan and finalize the plan this spring, Thruway spokeswoman Anya
Frost said.
</P>
<P>
	   Platt insisted that no final decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not cast in stone at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls were last raised on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road, in
1988. In 1996, the Thruway board backed away from a toll hike at the insistence
of Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   There was little, if any, advance word that the board was contemplating a
toll hike before Thursday's meeting. The press release issued by the Authority
afterward spoke of the agency funding $275 million in capital improvements this
year. Not until the second page of the release did the Authority refer to the
adoption of a plan which could result in an annual toll hike - it called it an
"indexed toll adjustment plan" - beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   "This common-sense plan will ensure that motorists are never hit with
massive toll hikes, while providing businesses that rely on the Thruway with the
information they need when planning their budgets," the Authority said in a
statement from Chairman Louis Tomson.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority leader of the state Senate said Friday he is opposed to raising
tolls. Joseph Bruno cited such a hike as running counter to recent state efforts
to cut taxes and other costs of doing business in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now is not the time for the Thruway Authority to impose a hidden tax on
upstate businesses, residents and commuters in the form of multiyear toll
hikes," Bruno, R-Rensselaer said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the Senate majority wants to make money available for capital projects
we'll be more than happy to discuss this alternative," Platt said. But otherwise
"we need to be able to have a hedge against the cost of construction."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Motor Truck Association blasted the Authority for the secretive
manner in which it voted to raise tolls, and said it appeared there was nothing
to prevent tolls from going up 3 percent every year if construction costs
continue to rise annually.
</P>
<P>
	   "As business people we would never increase our prices to our largest
customers without first consulting with them," grumbled the Motor Truck
Association's president, Bill Joyce.
</P>
<P>
	   It called on Pataki to ask the Thruway Authority to reexamine its projected
toll hike and to find other ways to fund improvements on the roadway.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon refused to take a stance on the plan. "At
this point it's just a proposal," he said. "There's going to be public hearings.
We'll let the process move forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the $275 million in projects to be put out for bid this year by the
Thruway was work on the Interstate 287 corridor around the Tappan Zee Bridge and
the Syracuse Inner Harbor development project.
</P>
<P>
	   Both projects are among the transportation facilities the Thruway has
assumed authority for in recent years. Critics say the drain of these other
facilities have put additional financial burdens on the Authority past that of
maintaining the original toll highway between New York City and the Pennsylvania
border.
</P>
<P>
	   Tomson was a former deputy to Pataki and was nominated by the governor to
the Thruway position. It is unlikely that the Thruway Authority board would
proceed with a toll hike plan without the prior knowledge of Pataki's office.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Waste Shipping Plan Criticized  </HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. SHEERAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A federal proposal to ship nuclear waste across Ohio puts
people at risk of radiation exposure from potential rail or truck accidents,
critics said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people will want to know if they are getting hundreds of free
X-rays as they are sitting in traffic,'' Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said at a
Department of Energy public hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Ohio, as a key transit point between East Coast nuclear plants and a
proposed Nevada repository for nuclear waste, would bear an ``unfair burden''
involving nuclear waste shipping, Kucinich said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kucinich, a critic of increased rail traffic through his congressional
district in Cleveland, was the leadoff witness at the 20th in a series of Energy
Department hearings on proposals for a nuclear-waste repository inside Yucca
Mountain about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   The nuclear power industry says the shipments would be safe.
</P>
<P>
	   The six-month period for public comment will end Feb. 9. Then, the president
and Congress must decide whether to proceed with the proposal, which would not
take effect until 2010.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, more than 42,000 tons of lethal commercial waste are being kept
at nuclear plants. At Yucca Mountain, the waste would be sealed in metal
containers within rock tunnels about 1,000 feet underground and 1,000 feet above
the water table.

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Santa Clara County transit authorities have ordered
the removal of graphic cancer-awareness posters depicting women scarred by
mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
	   Created by the San Francisco-based Breast Cancer Fund, the posters feature
women provocatively posed as if in lingerie ads, but with mastectomy scars
superimposed on their chests.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents in Santa Clara County and elsewhere in the San Francisco Bay area
have complained about the posters since they appeared about two weeks ago. The
billboard company that had agreed to put them on San Francisco bus shelters also
rejected the ads after seeing them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will not run ads that anyone will find offensive,'' said Lupe Solis, a
spokeswoman for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Breast Cancer Fund founder Andrea Martin, whose mastectomy scars were used
in the pictures, said she was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What about those who think this is a positive thing? Too bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 17 posters remain on bus shelters in Oakland and adjoining Contra
Costa County, Martin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An American Airlines jet that crashed off the end
of a wet runway in a storm could have landed safely if all its braking systems
had worked properly, aviation experts testified Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Flight 1420 left the runway still going about 100 mph, then hit a
metal lighting structure, broke apart and caught fire. Eleven people died in the
June 1 crash at the Little Rock airport, including the pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   The McDonnell-Douglas MD-82 landed in heavy rain and 25 mph crosswinds, but
that alone was not enough to cause it to run off the runway, according to Boeing
Corp. tests exhibited at a National Transportation Safety Board hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's braking was hindered because it did not use its spoilers -- wing
panels that help deceleration by putting more weight on the wheels, said Thomas
Yager, a NASA research engineer who specializes in runway braking.
</P>
<P>
	   With spoilers, 80 percent of the plane's weight is placed on a plane's main
landing gear, said C.J. Turner, a Boeing engineer. Boeing now owns
McDonnell-Douglas.
</P>
<P>
	   Without spoilers, less than 30 percent of the weight remains on the main
landing gear, making it much more difficult to brake, Turner said. In a
crosswind -- as was the case with the accident -- without spoilers the main
landing gear will bear just 7 percent of the load.
</P>
<P>
	   The flight recorders indicated that the spoilers did not deploy, but it was
unclear whether the crew failed to set them or whether there was a mechanical
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Co-pilot Michael Origel has testified that he believed Chief Pilot Richard
Buschmann set the spoilers to deploy automatically upon landing. But Origel,
whose duty it was to confirm the task, said he could not recall the position of
the spoiler handle before the accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Instances in which spoilers have not deployed when properly set are very
rare, said Robert Baker, vice chairman of American Airlines' parent company, AMR
Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The deceleration of Flight 1420 was also impeded because the pilots did not
apply wheel brakes until 11 seconds after touchdown -- choosing to use manual
brakes instead of brakes that deploy automatically.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the reason for the braking delay was that the chief pilot was trying
to straighten the plane after an off-center touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of American Airlines and its pilots union questioned whether
a flooded runway could have also affected the landing.
</P>
<P>
	   But Yager said runway markings showed no evidence of hydroplaning and that
the runway was of the highest quality, with good traction and drainage. He said
the plane's tire treads also were good.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The runway itself was not at fault,'' Yager said.

    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Someone is tarnishing Robert C. Smith's good name.
<P>
	   And in at least some instances, it's Smith's good friend, say police.
</P>
<P>
	   At least five times in the past two years, area police have wrongly filed
charges against the 20-year-old Syracuse man after catching someone who claimed
to be him.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the real Robert Smith have managed to get the charges
dismissed. But the mistakes resulted in New York suspending Smith's license,
warrants being issued for his arrest and Smith having to appear in court on
several occasions.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent episode occurred last weekend when police arrested five men
on felony drug charges after finding them in possession of 11 ounces of crack
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   It turned out, the person who gave Smith's name was Jeffrey Dowdell Jr., 21,
who has been friends with Smith since the attended elementary school together in
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell did not have any identification when he was arrested but provided
deputies with Smith's correct date of birth and address, said John D'Eredita,
spokesman for the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department. At the jail, however, a
deputy recognized him as Dowdell, D'Eredita said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deception earned Dowdell an extra charge: criminal impersonation, a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith's mother, Celestine Smith, said she doubted her son will remain
friends with Dowdell.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's tired of being dragged through the mud and being in court all the
time. Being deaf is hard enough," said Mrs. Smith of her son who lost his
hearing three years ago after contracting meningitis.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were friends since the time they were 9 years old. But he can't be too
much of our friend if he's doing this to us," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith did not want to talk about the affair.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell, though, maintained that Smith was his friend, and said he was
sorry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know my man, Robert. I know he's mad at me. But he'll get over it. That's
my man," Dowdell said in a jailhouse interview with The Post-Standard of
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Celestine Smith said Dowdell admitted to her this summer that he had
pretended to be her son on a previous occasion when he was stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said he didn't think Robert would get in trouble because he can't hear,"
said Mrs. Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell admitted Monday that he told police he was Smith last fall when they
confiscated $1,000 from him because he was in a drug-infested neighborhood and
had no proof he had legally earned the money.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Dowdell said he never got any tickets in Smith's name.
</P>
<P>
	   But Syracuse police issued three separate appearance tickets in Smith's name
to an impersonator, said attorney December Haab, who represented Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   The appearance tickets noted that the suspect had a scar on his face and a
tattoo - which the real Smith does not have, Haab said. Neither does Dowdell.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrants were issued in 1999 for Smith's arrest for failing to appear in
court on a marijuana charge. The warrants and charges were dismissed after Haab
met with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspects occasionally deceive police as to their true identity but are
usually caught within hours after they are booked and fingerprinted, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's unusual," Haab said of Smith's predicament. "I hope it's
unusual."

<HEADLINE> SUBS 4th graf to RESTORE dropped first reference to HRA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Somewhere, Dionne Warwick knew this would happen.
<P>
	   New York City officials, sensing bad publicity and worse jokes, announced
Friday that they would no longer funnel welfare recipients into jobs with the
Psychic Network. The telephone pay service offered clairvoyance at $4.99 a
minute.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to pull the plug on the psychic connection came hours after the
hiring policy became public knowledge. Since last April, network instructors had
taught 15 welfare clients to read tarot cards and offer their callers a peek
into the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "Though HRA believes people should have the freedom to choose their own
employment, HRA's Business Link has decided to not include the Psychic Network
as one of its participating employers," said a statement from Human Resources
Administration Commissioner Jason A. Turner.
</P>
<P>
	   This leaves welfare workers applying for employment with a less interesting
selection of jobs from a variety of companies: Rite Aid, Madison Square Garden,
Macy's.
</P>
<P>
	   Not quite the psychic gig, eh?
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, HRA spokeswoman Ruth Reinecke said the jobs, while odd-sounding,
were actually not strange at all.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pay is rather good, and it's attractive to work out of the home for the
mothers who have young children," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The qualifications were a high school diploma and the ability to read, write
and speak English; the pay starts at $10 an hour, plus bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The city refused to provide any information about the Psychic Network,
citing a confidentiality agreement with companies that participate in the
"workfare" program.
</P>
<P>
	   The HRA offices received a large number of calls about the plan after The
New York Times first reported it. A Pittsburgh radio reporter trying to track
down an HRA spokeswoman said the report was the subject of "great mirth" in the
Steel City.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in the HRA offices Friday was laughing when she answered another
reporter's call. "Is this about the psychics?" she intuitively inquired.
</P>
<P>
	   While the 900-number services are a quirky business, they are legitimate.
Their ads must run with a required disclaimer that the calls are strictly for
entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to track down the owner of the Psychic Network could require the use
of tea leaves. The only phone listing under the name is a Florida bookstore that
has no connection to the telephone business.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, there was no listing for the Psychic Network. Attempts to reach
the company telepathically were also unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
	   The psychic phone lines, often advertised on late-night television or via
informercials, haven't drawn this much attention since the Psychic Friends
Network filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Psychic Friends - actually Inphomation Communication Inc. - were
best-known for the 30-minute informercials hosted by singer Dionne Warwick.

<HEADLINE> Officer killed while chasing burglary suspects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ESSEX, Conn. (AP) - A Middletown police sergeant died Friday after his
cruiser went off Route 9 and crashed during a pursuit of two burglary suspects,
police said.
<P>
	   Sgt. George Dingwall, a 19-year veteran, was one of several officers chasing
the suspects at about noon when his cruiser went off the left side of the
highway and crashed into some trees, said Lt. Ralph Carpenter, a state police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were investigating whether the cruiser was rammed by the suspects'
car, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dingwall was taken by Life Star helicopter to Hartford Hospital, where he
later died.
</P>
<P>
	   "As the (suspects') vehicle proceeded down Route 9, the vehicle rammed a
Middletown police cruiser," Carpenter said. "It continued further down
southbound and ended up ramming one of our state police cruisers."
</P>
<P>
	   The car was stopped on Interstate 95 in Branford by troopers using "stop
sticks," a spiked device that when driven over, slowly deflates a car's tires.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant Brown, 36, and Victor Santiago, 38, both from New Haven, were taken
into custody. They were being held on numerous charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The chase began when police interrupted a burglary in progress at a home in
Middletown, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident and investigation closed Route 9 southbound near Exit 3 in
Essex. The highway remained closed after 8 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Flags were flying at half staff Friday afternoon in front of the Middletown
police headquarters to honor Dingwall.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had a distinguished career, and he was well respected by all of us at
the Middletown Police Department," said Police Chief J. Edward Brymer. "We have
lost a family member"

<HEADLINE> Federal judge may ease GOP primary ballot rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The federal judge hearing Sen. John McCain's request to
get his name back on state presidential primary ballots said Friday he was
considering cutting by 80 percent the number of signatures state GOP leaders can
require candidates to collect.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Edward Korman said it appeared New York's top
Republicans had designed onerous ballot access rules in an effort to close the
presidential primary to all but their favorite candidate - this year, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   "Isn't that the reality of what's happening here?" Korman asked during a
three-and-a-half hour conference with lawyers from the state GOP and the
campaigns of McCain, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes. "It's being done to wall off
the Republican primary."
</P>
<P>
	   A state judge threw McCain's name off ballots in eight New York
congressional districts on Thursday, potentially leaving him unable to contest
the March 7 primary in a total of 14 of the state's 31 districts. The
possibility that Republicans in more than a third of the state may be unable to
vote for a candidate who some polls show leading in the crucial New Hampshire
primary has prompted renewed criticism of New York's notoriously arcane ballot
access rules.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cumulative effect of these rules makes it virtually impossible for
candidates to get on the ballot without spending a huge amount of money" or
having the support of the state party, McCain attorney Burt Neuborne said in
Brooklyn federal court. "It seriously burdens voters of the state of New York if
they cannot express their support for Sen. John McCain."
</P>
<P>
	   State party leaders say the requirements are a legitimate way of determining
whether candidates have statewide support and that McCain's campaign should have
done a better job of signature-gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   "The McCain campaign was not a reasonably diligent campaign, and that's the
standard," said Lawrence Mandelker, a lawyer for the state party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes campaign joined McCain's lawsuit and asked Korman to place the
millionaire publisher's name back on the ballot in three Long Island
congressional districts where his petitions were declared invalid. Forbes has so
far spent more than $650,000 trying to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, stumping in New Hampshire, said he welcomed Forbes' involvement in
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am glad he's joined us," McCain said. "It shows that other people are
deprived" ballot access too.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Keyes asked the judge to eliminate the requirement that
signatures be collected district by district, and instead allow candidates to
appear on the ballot if they gather 5,000 names statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes and Gary Bauer decided not to contest the New York primary because of
the complicated requirements, but Keyes' lawyers asked that both candidates be
allowed to try again under a lower standard.
</P>
<P>
	   Korman, who said he hoped to issue a decision next week, appeared to be
considering a reduction in the number of signatures Republican candidates must
collect in each congressional district.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates are now required to get signatures of .5 percent of each
district's registered Republicans, plus 5,000 more signatures statewide. Korman
discussed with lawyers the possibility of reducing the district requirement to
.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he planned to make a final decision by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes sued successfully in federal court in 1996 to appear on the ballot
when state party leaders lined up behind eventual nominee Bob Dole. Korman ruled
then that the party must reduce its per-district signature requirement from 5
percent to .5 percent. Party leaders and the state legislature decided last year
to use the judge's requirement this time around.
</P>
<P>
	   But Korman on Friday criticized the GOP for imposing other burdensome rules
and challenging so many signatures that the .5 percent "is not a true .5
percent." He questioned the requirement that volunteers only be allowed to
gather signatures in their own districts, the imposition of a 37-day limit on
petition drives, and the fact that the drives fall during the busy holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why are there 37 days only?" the judge asked. "Why is it ... the hardest 37
days? Why are there restrictions on who can circulate petitions? ... There ought
to be some answers."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Forbes plans to challenge Bush's petitions in six districts where
campaign workers claim to have uncovered fraud, including lists of signatures
apparently written in the same handwriting.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffrey Buley, general counsel to the state Republican committee, said that
although there might be isolated incidents of fraud, he was confident all of
Bush's petitions were valid.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Court Strikes Challenge  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's highest court has struck down a
lawsuit claiming its own magistrates were appointed illegally by a powerful
constitutional assembly overstepping its bounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling Thursday was a setback for critics of President Hugo Chavez who
say he has concentrated power into his own hands and brought the country
dangerously close to dictatorship. But it is also likely to stir further
controversy about the way the president is carrying out his ``social
revolution'' in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   The same lawsuit claimed that a new ``mini-congress,'' the attorney general,
the national comptroller, the public defender and the national electoral council
were all designated illegally. Each of those claims was shot down by Venezuela's
newly created Supreme Tribunal of Justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Since becoming president a year ago, Chavez has pushed through a new
constitution and decimated the two political parties that ruled the South
American nation during 40 years of democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   The new constitution, approved by voters on Dec. 15, calls for the renewal
of all elected powers, but national balloting has been postponed until May
because of last month's massive flooding and landslides that killed thousands of
people on Venezuela's northern coast.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Chavez, a former army paratrooper who staged a failed
military coup eight years ago, will be able to rule Venezuela with virtually no
checks on his power.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, 21 members of a so-called ``mini-Congress'' made up of Chavez
supporters were sworn in. The mini-congress's job will be to perform basic
legislative functions until elections are held for a new legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the high court magistrates, the mini-congress's members were each
handpicked by the Chavez-controlled panel that rewrote the constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   A Venezuelan attorney named Eduardo Garcia presented a lawsuit to the court
saying this was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   But the court ruled that the constitutional assembly had the power to make
the appointments because it was ``given originating power by the Venezuelan
people'' in national elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez and his supporters say the profound changes taking place in
Venezuelan society and politics will root out decades of corruption and crush a
corrupt oligarchy that plunged the oil-rich nation into poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Chavez appointed a former fellow coup participant head of
Venezuela's secret police. Eliecer Otaiza replaces retired Col. Jesus Urdaneta,
another former coup plotter who resigned last week because of a conflict with
the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez has come under criticism for promoting former coup participants to
top government posts, and for giving the military a larger role in Venezuelan
society.

<HEADLINE> Storm Spreads More Snow in South  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA M. LaHAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A storm spread still more snow across the Deep South on
Friday, giving children from Arkansas to Georgia a rare chance to build snowmen
but threatening travel to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm, which had dumped up to 17 inches of snow in Oklahoma, dropped
between an inch and a foot in Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee
before stalling near the Alabama-Georgia line.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-grader Trent Franklin stayed up until after midnight to watch the
flakes start falling outside his Shelby County, Ala., home. Then he got up at
daybreak, bundled up and went outside to play in 2 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've got so many layers on I can't get cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm to was expected to re-form and head east, hitting the Atlanta area
with up to 3 inches of snow through Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could potentially turn into a significant icing,'' Weather Channel
meteorologist Robyn Hulecki said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a precaution, Delta Air Lines canceled some flights into Atlanta Friday
afternoon, but promised to accommodate passengers trying to get to the Super
Bowl. More than 100,000 people are expected in Atlanta for the game between the
Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the customers to get down there to the Super Bowl,'' said John
Farmer, Delta station manager in Nashville, Tenn. ``We'll work with them any way
we can to get them there by kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Benson, 28, of Kansas City, Mo., managed to beat the storm and arrive
at the Atlanta airport Friday. ``I feel very lucky that we made it here, that
the flight did not get canceled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While travelers worried, thousands of children in the Deep South enjoyed a
rare snow day. They threw snowballs and built snowmen as their parents took
Friday off from work.
</P>
<P>
	   In Alabama, TV stations stayed on the air all night giving live updates from
cold reporters framed on the screen by ``Winter Storm 2000'' graphics.
</P>
<P>
	   Brothers Brad and David Dooley in the Birmingham, Ala., area enjoyed the day
off from class by working on a snowman outside their house. Roads were clear,
but their mother had no complaints about schools being closed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How could they do anything with this out there?'' said Cynthia Dooley.
</P>
<P>
	   Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove activated about 300 National Guardsmen to
help communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials elsewhere also were treating the weather with urgency.
</P>
<P>
	   In North Carolina, which was surprised by 2 feet of snow this week, Gov. Jim
Hunt on Friday asked President Clinton to declare 26 counties disaster areas,
which would make them eligible for federal funds. About 13,000 customers
remained without power in the state, but were expected to have it back by Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton approved a disaster declaration late Friday for 30 Georgia counties
because of an ice storm last week that left 500,000 customers without
electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
	   This weekend's storm is expected to cover a much greater area.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Memorial Protest Banned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Berlin police on Friday banned a planned weekend demonstration
against the building of a Holocaust memorial in the center of the city, citing
the potential for violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the Saturday demonstration was actually just a cover for a
march by the extreme-right National Party of Germany that had originally been
set to take place in the central city of Goettingen. That event was banned by
local authorities there on Thursday because of fears of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Police have reason to believe that for Berlin, there is also a large
possibility that the procession will take a confrontational course,'' Berlin
police said Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Also planned for Saturday was an event by supporters of the memorial, who
will take to the streets around the site to solicit donations for the project.
Earlier cost estimates have been around $10 million, although designs for a
documentation center to be located at the site have not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
	   German leaders on Thursday held a ceremonial dedication for the monument to
be located just south of the landmark Brandenburg Gate, consisting of a vast
field of 2,700 close-set concrete slabs resembling stones in a graveyard.
Thursday was also Germany's annual Day of Remembrance for Victims of Nazism,
established in 1996 to coincide with the day Soviet soldiers liberated the
Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1945.

	   A state judge threw McCain's name off ballots in eight New York
congressional districts on Thursday, potentially leaving him unable to contest
the March 7 primary in at least 14 of the state's 31 districts. The possibility
that Republicans in more than one-third of the state may be unable to vote for a
candidate who some polls show leading in the crucial New Hampshire primary has
prompted renewed criticism of New York's notoriously arcane ballot-access rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The cumulative effect of these rules makes it virtually impossible for
candidates to get on the ballot without spending a huge amount of money'' or
having the support of the state party, said McCain attorney Burt Neuborne. ``It
seriously burdens voters of the state of New York if they cannot express their
support for Sen. John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
	   State party leaders say the requirements are a legitimate way of determining
whether candidates have statewide support and that McCain's campaign should have
done a better job of signature-gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The McCain campaign was not a reasonably diligent campaign, and that's the
standard,'' said Lawrence Mandelker, a lawyer for the state party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes campaign, which has spent more than $650,000 so far trying to get
on the ballot, joined McCain's lawsuit and asked Korman to place the millionaire
publisher's name back on the ballot in three Long Island congressional districts
where his petitions were declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, stumping in New Hampshire, said he welcomed Forbes' involvement in
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am glad he's joined us,'' McCain said. ``It shows that other people are
deprived'' ballot access.
</P>
<P>
	   Korman, who said he hoped to issue a decision next week, appeared to be
considering a reduction in the number of signatures Republican candidates must
collect in each congressional district.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates are now required to get signatures of 0.5 percent of each
district's registered Republicans, plus 5,000 more signatures statewide. Korman
discussed with lawyers the possibility of reducing the district requirement to
0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Keyes asked the judge to eliminate the requirement that
signatures be collected district by district, instead allowing candidates to
appear on the ballot if they gather 5,000 names statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes and Gary Bauer decided not to contest the New York primary because of
the complicated requirements, but Keyes' lawyers asked that both candidates be
allowed to try again under a lower standard.

<HEADLINE> Gene Talks Boil Down to Few Issues  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- In the final hours of international talks Friday on trade
in genetically modified food and other products, negotiators found themselves
grappling over the same issues that doomed a similar agreement nearly a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates scurried from room to room of the Montreal hotel where the meeting
was being held, bearing proposals and counterproposals. Late in the afternoon,
conference president Juan Mayr delayed what was to be the final meeting of the
disagreeing parties by four hours. Early in the evening, he pushed the meeting
back yet again.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayr, who set a deadline of Friday night, also has said that he will not
leave Montreal without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somebody has to give in somewhere,'' said Ethiopian head delegate Towalde
Egziabher.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators were attempting to draft the Biosafety Protocol, a set of rules
that would protect the environment from damage by genetically modified plants,
animals and bacteria. Environmentalists and a few scientific studies have raised
concerns that genetically modified organisms could wipe out native species,
disrupt natural cycles and cause other ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's fish genes in fruit, poultry genes in fish, animal genes in
plants, growth hormones in milk, insect genes in vegetables, tree genes in grain
and in the case of pork, human genes in meat,'' said Steve Gilman, an organic
farmer in Stillwater, N.Y. ``Real and reasonable concerns about genetic
engineering have fallen upon deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate at the talks has revolved around how great the scientific
uncertainty is, and how it should be dealt with. The European Union and
developing nations have argued that countries should be allowed to decline
imports of a genetically modified product if little is known about its
environmental effect.
</P>
<P>
	   But the United States and its partners disagree, saying the proposed rules
in their current form would restrict trade. Those countries argued that any
nation's refusal to import a genetically modified product should be backed by
scientific evidence in the form of a risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We live in a world in which scientific certainty is not available,'' said
U.S. Undersecretary of State Frank Loy.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks last February in Cartagena, Colombia, ended in disarray when the
United States and five other countries -- Canada, Australia, Argentina, Chile
and Uruguay -- rejected a draft agreement favored by 125 other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation has changed since then, with major U.S. food producers such as
Archer Daniels Midland, Gerber and the Iams pet food company either demanding
that genetically modified products be segregated or refusing to use them
altogether. Protests at the World Trade Organization talks in Seattle last month
also suggest that the American public has concerns about genetically altered
food.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the year since Cartagena, it has become obvious that the position of
the (United States') group is increasingly isolated,'' said Philip Bereano, a
University of Washington professor who has been following the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as in Cartagena, the talks in Montreal have come down to a handful of
issues:
</P>
<P>
	   --The relationship of the proposed rules to the World Trade Organization.
The United States wants the agreement to have ``equal status'' with the free
trade pact. But other countries fear that any bans they impose will be
overturned by the World Trade Organization's dispute resolution panel.
</P>
<P>
	   --The amount of scientific evidence that is needed to justify banning a
genetically modified product.
</P>
<P>
	   --The amount of evidence that exporters must provide about their products.
</P>
<P>
	   Genetically modified crops are already widespread. About 70 million acres of
genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999. In the United
States, genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 percent of corn
and 40 percent of soybeans.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Cancels Lecture in Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on Friday
canceled a speech scheduled for next week at the University of Texas, citing
safety concerns over a planned protest.
</P>
<P>
	   Kissinger, national security adviser to President Nixon and secretary of
state to both Nixon and President Ford, had been scheduled to speak Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two groups -- UT Radical Action Network and Peace Action Austin -- held a
meeting on campus earlier this week to denounce Kissinger's foreign policy
during his days in office and to plan a protest for next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Harry Middleton, director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson library at UT, said
university police and the Secret Service had warned that the planned protests
posed a threat to public safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Borders, assistant director of the LBJ Library, said protesters
indicated they would disrupt Kissinger's speech. Attempts to control the
protests could create problems for other spectators, Borders said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Kissinger said he regrets the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to one of the protest organizers, professor Robert Jensen, were not
returned.

<HEADLINE> Storm Spreads More Snow in South  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA M. LaHAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A storm spread still more snow across the Deep South on
Friday, giving children from Arkansas to Georgia a rare chance to build snowmen
but threatening travel to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm, which had dumped up to 17 inches of snow in Oklahoma, dropped
between an inch and a foot in Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee
before stalling near the Alabama-Georgia line.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-grader Trent Franklin stayed up until after midnight to watch the
flakes start falling outside his Shelby County, Ala., home. Then he got up at
daybreak, bundled up and went outside to play in 2 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've got so many layers on I can't get cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm to was expected to re-form and head east, hitting the Atlanta area
with up to 3 inches of snow through Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could potentially turn into a significant icing,'' Weather Channel
meteorologist Robyn Hulecki said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a precaution, Delta Air Lines canceled some flights into Atlanta Friday
afternoon, but promised to accommodate passengers trying to get to the Super
Bowl. More than 100,000 people are expected in Atlanta for the game between the
Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the customers to get down there to the Super Bowl,'' said John
Farmer, Delta station manager in Nashville, Tenn. ``We'll work with them any way
we can to get them there by kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Benson, 28, of Kansas City, Mo., managed to beat the storm and arrive
at the Atlanta airport Friday. ``I feel very lucky that we made it here, that
the flight did not get canceled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While travelers worried, thousands of children in the Deep South enjoyed a
rare snow day. They threw snowballs and built snowmen as their parents took
Friday off from work.
</P>
<P>
	   In Alabama, TV stations stayed on the air all night giving live updates from
cold reporters framed on the screen by ``Winter Storm 2000'' graphics.
</P>
<P>
	   Brothers Brad and David Dooley in the Birmingham, Ala., area enjoyed the day
off from class by working on a snowman outside their house. Roads were clear,
but their mother had no complaints about schools being closed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How could they do anything with this out there?'' said Cynthia Dooley.
</P>
<P>
	   Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove activated about 300 National Guardsmen to
help communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials elsewhere also were treating the weather with urgency.
</P>
<P>
	   In North Carolina, which was surprised by 2 feet of snow this week, Gov. Jim
Hunt on Friday asked President Clinton to declare 26 counties disaster areas,
which would make them eligible for federal funds. Roughly 25,000 utility
customers throughout the state remained without power Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton approved a disaster declaration late Friday for 30 Georgia counties
because of an ice storm last week that left 500,000 customers without
electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
	   This weekend's storm is expected to cover a much greater area.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Warned Against Independence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Independence for Taiwan would mean war with China, Vice
Premier Qian Qichen warned Friday as China stressed anew its own plan for
reunification.
</P>
<P>
	   Qian warned that those who want independence for Taiwan should not ``play
with fire,'' the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported late Friday. ``Taiwan
independence absolutely will not mean peace but war,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Qian spoke Friday at a forum marking the fifth anniversary of Beijing's plan
to reunify with Taiwan under the ``one country, two systems'' model it used for
Hong Kong and Macau.
</P>
<P>
	   Qian, a foreign policy specialist who oversaw the return of Hong Kong in
1997 and Macau in December, reiterated the government's offer of giving Taiwan
more autonomy under more flexible policies than the arrangements with the other
two territories.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations with Taiwan could include ``international space for economic,
cultural and social activities for Taiwan that suits it, and the political
status of the Taiwan authorities,'' he said according to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
	   Qian repeated the mainland's offer that anything could be discussed as long
as Taiwan agreed to the ``one-China principle.'' He also reiterated the
government's condemnation of Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui for saying last
summer that the two sides should be treated as equals in talks.
</P>
<P>
	   He also repeated China's opposition to ``any foreign force'' -- a reference
the United States -- selling advanced weapons to Taiwan or transferring
technologies for a missile-defense system.
</P>
<P>
	   China regards Taiwan as one of its provinces. The mainland and the island of
Taiwan have been ruled separately since the end of the Chinese civil war in
1949. Beijing demands that they be reunited eventually and has long threatened
to use military force if Taiwan declares independence.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Couple Returns After Fleeing  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVE KARNOWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A couple who said their son's broken bones were caused
by ``brittle bone'' disease have worked out a deal with prosecutors to keep
custody of their son if he remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Wally Hines III, 31, and Debby Hines, 32, fled Minnesota nine months ago
after being accused of causing their son's injuries. The couple returned with
their 18-month-old son, Wyatt, on Wednesday and appeared in court Friday. They
were released without bail and allowed to keep custody of their child.
</P>
<P>
	   The parents were never charged with child abuse, only with depriving the
county of its custodial rights and federal charges of interstate flight to avoid
prosecution. The federal charges are being dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   The state charges will be dismissed Oct. 30 if the parents stay out of
trouble with the law, continue to cooperate with authorities on care for the
child, and if the boy remains in good health, Dakota County Attorney James
Backstrom said. The agreement includes continued involvement by social service
workers and juvenile court supervision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're very happy. They wanted to come home,'' said John Whitehead,
president of The Rutherford Institute, a Charlottesville, Va.-based legal
advocacy group that helped negotiate their return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they feel that things have worked out about as well as could be
expected,'' said Wally Hines Jr., Wyatt's grandfather. ``I didn't think they
would have come back otherwise, to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Hineses and their defenders have always denied that Wyatt was the victim
of abuse and maintained that authorities overreacted to his injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The family says Wyatt suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic
disease that affects some 20,000 to 50,000 Americans, or about 1 in 20,000. They
say that's what explains the broken leg and broken ribs that first brought Wyatt
to authorities' attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the gag order, it was unclear if prosecutors were still disputing
the diagnosis. Social workers have said they thought the injuries were caused by
the parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation in Gaithersburg, Md.,
say it's common for social workers to conclude that children are victims of
abuse when they're really victims of OI, and that the condition can be difficult
to diagnose.
</P>
<P>
	   Wyatt's problems were first noticed when he was just 6 weeks old and his
parents took him to a doctor with a swollen leg. X-rays showed that his femur
was broken in two places. When child protection workers ordered more X-rays,
doctors found six broken ribs, and Wyatt was put in foster care for three
months, where he suffered more fractures.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple got Wyatt back when they agreed to a deal that required the
father to live away from their home for four weeks. Shortly before a final
hearing in May, Wyatt's femur broke again, and they fled April 27 after learning
police were coming to take Wyatt away because of the injury.

<HEADLINE> Bad Brakes Cited in Ark. Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An American Airlines jet that crashed off the end
of a wet runway in a storm could have landed safely if all its braking systems
had worked properly, aviation experts testified Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Flight 1420 left the runway still going about 100 mph, then hit a
metal lighting structure, broke apart and caught fire. Eleven people died in the
June 1 crash at the Little Rock airport, including the pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   The McDonnell-Douglas MD-82 landed in heavy rain and 25 mph crosswinds, but
that alone was not enough to cause it to run off the runway, according to Boeing
Corp. tests exhibited at a National Transportation Safety Board hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's braking was hindered because it did not use its spoilers -- wing
panels that help deceleration by putting more weight on the wheels, said Thomas
Yager, a NASA research engineer who specializes in runway braking.
</P>
<P>
	   With spoilers, 80 percent of the plane's weight is placed on a plane's main
landing gear, said C.J. Turner, a Boeing engineer. Boeing now owns
McDonnell-Douglas.
</P>
<P>
	   Without spoilers, less than 30 percent of the weight remains on the main
landing gear, making it much more difficult to brake, Turner said. In a
crosswind -- as was the case with the accident -- without spoilers the main
landing gear will bear just 7 percent of the load.
</P>
<P>
	   The flight recorders indicated that the spoilers did not deploy, but it was
unclear whether the crew failed to set them or whether there was a mechanical
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Co-pilot Michael Origel has testified that he believed Chief Pilot Richard
Buschmann set the spoilers to deploy automatically upon landing. But Origel,
whose duty it was to confirm the task, said he could not recall the position of
the spoiler handle before the accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Instances in which spoilers have not deployed when properly set are very
rare, said Robert Baker, vice chairman of American Airlines' parent company, AMR
Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The deceleration of Flight 1420 was also impeded because the pilots did not
apply wheel brakes until 11 seconds after touchdown -- choosing to use manual
brakes instead of brakes that deploy automatically.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the reason for the braking delay was that the chief pilot was trying
to straighten the plane after an off-center touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of American Airlines and its pilots union questioned whether
a flooded runway could have also affected the landing.
</P>
<P>
	   But Yager said runway markings showed no evidence of hydroplaning and that
the runway was of the highest quality, with good traction and drainage. He said
the plane's tire treads also were good.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The runway itself was not at fault,'' Yager said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also testifying was Stephanie Manus, who said a child-restraint seat saved
her 18-month-old daughter's life in the crash. She urged that the use of such
seats be made a requirement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we're about to land, they advise us to put away our laptops, and the
reason is you cannot safely hold on to those items in an unexpected situation,''
Mrs. Manus said. ``Our children are much more precious than a laptop computer,
and something has got to be done about this.''
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Federal Aviation Administration said it would begin writing
a rule to create standards for child-restraint seats on airplanes. NTSB Chairman
James Hall told Mrs. Manus he supported the change.

<HEADLINE> Warrant Out for Russian Official  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian official at the center of a Kremlin corruption
scandal said Friday that he wouldn't rule out going to Switzerland to answer an
arrest warrant charging him with money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss Judge Daniel Devaud said Friday that he had issued the warrant
charging former Kremlin property manager Pavel Borodin of laundering money
through Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Borodin said Friday that he hadn't seen the warrant and that he would have
to examine it carefully, but that he would consider going to Switzerland. He
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I respect Switzerland, mountains and all other stuff,'' he said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
	   Devaud said he could not ask Russia to extradite a Russian citizen, but he
could be arrested if he traveled to Western countries. There was no indication
Friday that Russian authorities would turn Borodin over to the Swiss
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Borodin served as Kremlin property manager for seven years under former
President Boris Yeltsin, and presided over the Kremlin business empire,
including government buildings, resorts, hotels, planes and numerous other
assets worth approximately several billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Friday's Canada News Briefs  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press Note: All dollars are Canadian unless otherwise noted
Convention To Create Right-Wing Alliance
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- A policy framework that drifted only slightly from that of
the Reform party began to take shape Friday at a convention to create a new
political alliance of the right-wing.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates at the United Alternative convention charted new territory by
supporting a motion that recognizes Canada's two official languages and
bilingualism, as well as a commitment to pursue a flat tax where most Canadians
would pay one income tax rate of 17 per cent.
</P>
<P>
	   But the broad strokes of the potential new party's principles differed very
little from those espoused by Reform.
</P>
<P>
	   The platform backs, among other things, balanced budget legislation, a
harder line against crime and punishment, eliminating financial support for
multiculturalism, and getting rid of farm subsidies and affirmative action
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   There wasn't much debate, with the most sparks flying over the official
bilingualism motion. Some participants called for amendments to hand the
provinces control over language and culture, or even limit services in both
languages to Quebec, Acadia and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm all for providing services in both official languages, but I'm deadly
against the Official Languages Act,'' said one delegate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a divisive force, it's expensive, and I just want to make sure the
United Alternative is not embracing official bilingualism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Debate could heat up today around a series of motions on social policy,
which concentrate heavily on the primacy of the family.
UA Party Would Clamp Down on Illegal Immigrants
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canada under the United Alternative would immediately deport
illegal immigrants, stiffen penalties for people smugglers, make jails less
hospitable and put more police on the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   It would also amalgamate all security and intelligence-gathering agencies --
now divided across the RCMP, CSIS, Foreign Affairs, Immigration and customs --
into one single super-ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   These were just some of the proposals to restore order in Canada's justice
and security system put before delegates Friday at the United Alternative
meeting in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
	   Art Hangar, the Reform party's defense critic, and former Ontario solicitor
general Bob Runciman criticized the Liberal security strategy and painted an
alternative picture of the system that drew steady applause.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals aren't new: many are basic tenets of Reform and Ontario Tory
policies that are already popular with party members.
Deal on Rules for Trade Nearing
</P>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- It was still not clear Friday whether negotiators would
succeed in striking a treaty to regulate trade in genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates had managed to narrow their differences to only two or three key
articles after an all-night session Thursday. But there were important gaps to
bridge despite the efforts of the weeklong meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Environment Minister David Anderson said Canada could not approve a deal
unless it effectively protected the environment from the risks posed by
genetically modified crops, which critics call Frankenfoods.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not here for the cosmetics of this,'' Anderson said in an interview
at the conference, which has drawn environment ministers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want a practical document that really does protect nations and
environments in the world from the risks presented, and they do exist, of
genetically modified organisms.''
</P>
<P>
	   The planned treaty would likely have a major impact on the evolution of the
biotech industry, which already accounts for billions of dollars worth of
international trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada has approved more than 40 genetically altered crops, including
herbicide-resistant canola and slow-ripening tomatoes, and many more are in
development.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say these foods have not been adequately tested for effects on human
health. Another major concern is that genetically modified organisms could
proliferate in the environment, wiping out native species.
Almost-Frozen Asian Migrant Recovers
</P>
<P>
	   CORNWALL, Ontario (AP) -- A youth whose hands were half-frozen when he was
found huddled in a telephone booth with four other Asian migrants was recovering
from exposure in hospital Friday while other members of the group were
interviewed by immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were discovered Thursday by a storekeeper in a small town east of
this eastern Ontario city. Glenda Hollingsworth said the youth's gnarled hands
looked dead from the cold.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the saddest thing. I cried,'' she said. ``The youngest one's hands
were so cold, they were twisted and folded in half.''
</P>
<P>
	   The teen was being treated for exposure to cold but officials would not
reveal specifics of his condition Friday because he is a minor.
</P>
<P>
	   Another member of the group, also a minor, is in the custody of the Ottawa
Children's Aid Society.
</P>
<P>
	   The other three men were transferred to the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre
where immigration officials began their investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for Citizenship and Immigration Canada would not divulge
specifics of the investigation into the migrants, including how the they arrived
in Canada and why they were wandering in the cold.
Toronto Police Union's Fundraising Banned
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto's police chief weighed in Friday on the frenzied
fight over the police union's fundraising drive, ordering the militant police
association to immediately stop soliciting for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   The action came after a bylaw was passed at an emergency closed-door meeting
of the Toronto Police Services Board, giving Chief David Boothby the authority
to issue a ``cease and desist'' order stopping the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics take issue with how the money is being collected -- with the offer
of a windshield decal indicating support -- and with how funds will be spent,
namely to oppose politicians who don't support the union.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the scheme, telemarketers call people on behalf of the union and try
to drum up funds to promote and oppose political candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Bromell, the president of the Toronto Police Association, refused to
give interviews Friday but said in a news release that the campaign is legal and
will continue.

<HEADLINE> S.C. House Against No Gun Ri Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The South Carolina Legislature has taken issue with
media reports of a mass slaying of Korean civilians by U.S. forces during the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``reports are capable of being used by the enemies of the United States
and detractors of the Armed Forces of the United States to blemish the heroism
and distinguished record of the one and one-half million men and women who
served as soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen in the Armed Forces of the
United States during the Korean War,'' reads a House resolution passed this week
on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press, citing dozens of villagers and U.S. veterans, reported
in September that hundreds of Korean civilians were killed at No Gun Ri by
American soldiers who feared North Korean soldiers were infiltrating groups of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and South Korea previously dismissed the claims, but
opened investigations after the AP report was published.

<HEADLINE> Slain Woman's Ex-Husband Arrested  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KELLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- A man and his parents have been arrested in the 1996
slaying of his ex-wife, whose dismembered body was found floating in a lake by
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
	   Macon County State's Attorney Lawrence Fichter would not talk about a
possible motive or who he thinks fired the shots that killed the 23-year-old
Karyn Hearn Slover. She was shot five times in the head.
</P>
<P>
	   Slover's ex-husband and former in-laws were arrested Thursday, hours after
the third grand jury to consider the case returned indictments against all three
for first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Grand jury documents allege Michael K. Slover Jr., 29, and his parents,
Michael K. Slover Sr., 53, and Jeanette Slover, 52, intentionally shot and
killed Karyn Slover. The indictments also charge that the two Slover men tried
to conceal the crime by ``cutting, burning and destroying'' the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
	   All three were arrested without incident, Illinois State Police Sgt. Rory
Steidl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fichter said he would ask the judge to deny bond and keep all three in jail
until trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Sam Cahnman, who represented Slover Jr. during the grand jury
proceedings, said Friday, ``To the best of my knowledge my client is not
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to the office of the attorney representing the parents were not
answered.
</P>
<P>
	   Karyn Slover vanished Sept. 27, 1996. She was last seen by co-workers at the
Decatur Herald &AMP; Review, where she worked in the newspaper's advertising
department. She left the newspaper that day to pick up her 3-year-old son at her
in-laws' home. She was never heard from again.
</P>
<P>
	   The car she was driving was found that night, abandoned with the engine
running 29 miles northeast of Decatur on Interstate 72. Two days later,
fishermen found parts of her dismembered body in plastic bags in Lake
Shelbyville -- 41 miles away from where the car was left.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends and family were stunned, and the case gripped the community. A
sickening feeling lingered for years at the newspaper office, said human
resources manager Terri Kuhle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You had highs and lows (in the investigation). Then you wait and nothing
happens,'' Kuhle said.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Reports Big Drop in Crime  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Major crimes dropped 12.7 percent in 1999 to the lowest
recorded number in the city since 1971, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 101,552 serious crimes recorded last year from January through December
are the lowest since the city began reporting the numbers to the FBI, Police
Chief Benny Napoleon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a one-year phenomenal reduction,'' he said. There were 116,322
serious crimes recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   After surging in the first half of the year, homicides were down 3 percent
overall to 416, the figures show. Larcenies were down 18.5 percent, while
burglaries dropped 14.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My goal is to have Detroit consistently out of the top 30 when it comes to
its violent crime rate,'' Napoleon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Dennis Archer said the drop should be noticed by businesses and serve
as a benchmark for the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Making people feel safe was among Archer's chief goals when he took office
in 1994, and since then the overall crime rate has gone down, mirroring a
national trend.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dropped Against Chimp Owners  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON DROUIN KEITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors have agreed to drop their case against the
owners of a 150-pound pet chimp named Moe, but he will remain in custody until a
civil lawsuit is settled.
</P>
<P>
	   And if he ever comes back to town, said Martin J. Mayer, the city's chief
prosecutor, his surrogate ``parents'', LaDonna and St. James Davis, can expect
to find themselves back in court again.
</P>
<P>
	   The city's civil lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction against the Davises
barring Moe from the city. A court date has not been set yet.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Moe has bitten two people in two years, city prosecutors dropped
their criminal case against the Davises this week, West Covina police Chief
Frank Wills said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference with his wife and a few supporters, Davis said it was a
relief not to face criminal charges and thanked more than 24,000 people who he
said have signed a petition demanding Moe's return.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis, holding a sign saying ``No Moe red tape,'' insisted Moe isn't a
public safety threat and he has bitten people only when provoked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Animals bite, people bite, Mike Tyson bites. So what?'' he asked at the
Friday news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a phone interview, Mayer disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The chimpanzee is not a cute little monkey,'' Mayer said, adding that the
5-foot-tall Moe has 1,200 pounds of crushing power in each of his arms and used
that strength two years ago ``to beat ... a police officer'' who answered a
disturbance call.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple has spent tens of thousands of dollars since September fighting
to get back the primate, who lived with them in West Covina, 25 miles east of
Los Angeles, for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Wills said prosecutors decided to drop the criminal case after the Animal
Legal Defense Fund agreed last weekend to mediate on behalf of Moe in the civil
case. The defense fund works nationally to defend animals against abuse and
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Moe was something of a local celebrity before he was hauled off to
quarantine in September, appearing at ribbon cuttings and helping to sell Girl
Scout cookies.

<HEADLINE> Mobster Gets Last Laugh in Obit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A mobster who died while serving time for drug
trafficking got the last laugh -- with his obituary.
</P>
<P>
	   Saul Kane, 65, a former associate of Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo, died
Jan. 20 of respiratory problems linked to a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Kane, who was serving a 25-year prison term in Lexington, Ky., had his
family deliver a death notice the newspapers couldn't refuse: It listed the
imprisoned Scarfo as his brother and Scarfo's son as one of his own sons. The
notice was published Saturday in The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Press of
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
	   Listing Scarfo as a relative was Kane's way of pointing up his loyalty,
according to an unidentified investigator quoted by the Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
	   Kane was convicted in the drug case in 1987 and sentenced to 95 years in
prison, in part because he refused to give authorities information about Scarfo.
The sentence was later reduced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What he's saying is that he was loyal to the end,'' the investigator said.
``What he's saying is that, unlike some others, he wasn't a rat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kane had always had a reputation as a wiseguy, even among his fellow
wiseguys.
</P>
<P>
	   He operated an Atlantic City lounge called the My Way -- as in the Frank
Sinatra song. When law enforcement investigators identified the My Way as a mob
hangout in the late 1970s, Kane took out an advertisement in the Press saying,
``Come meet the Mob at the My Way.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is, he got the last laugh. From the grave, he was still
busting,'' mob informant George Fresolone said in Tuesday's Inquirer.

<HEADLINE> Officer killed while chasing burglary suspects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ESSEX, Conn. (AP) - A Middletown police sergeant died Friday after his
cruiser went off Route 9 and crashed during a pursuit of two burglary suspects,
police said.
<P>
	   Sgt. George Dingwall, a 19-year veteran, was one of several officers chasing
the suspects at about noon when his cruiser went off the left side of the
highway and crashed into some trees, said Lt. Ralph Carpenter, a state police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were investigating whether the cruiser was rammed by the suspects'
car, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dingwall, 47, was taken by Life Star helicopter to Hartford Hospital, where
he later died.
</P>
<P>
	   "As the (suspects') vehicle proceeded down Route 9, the vehicle rammed a
Middletown police cruiser," Carpenter said. "It continued further down
southbound and ended up ramming one of our state police cruisers."
</P>
<P>
	   The car was stopped on Interstate 95 in Branford by troopers using "stop
sticks," a spiked device that when driven over slowly deflates a car's tires.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant Brown, 36, and Victor Santiago, 38, both from New Haven, were taken
into custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown was being held on charges including endangering a police officer and
reckless driving. He was also wanted for a parole violation, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Santiago was charged with interfering with a police officer. Both were
expected to be charged with burglary, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The chase began when police interrupted a burglary in progress at a home in
Middletown, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident and investigation closed Route 9 southbound near Exit 3 in
Essex until 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Flags were flying at half staff Friday afternoon in front of the Middletown
police headquarters, and a black bunting had been draped over the front of the
building to honor Dingwall.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had a distinguished career, and he was well respected by all of us at
the Middletown Police Department," said Police Chief J. Edward Brymer. "We have
lost a family member"

<HEADLINE> Gore turns deficit into lead; GOP race is close  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - Vice President Al Gore has pulled ahead of Bill
Bradley in New Hampshire polls with a surge of support from men, independents
and registered Democrats. Bradley was working to reverse the trend with
aggressive campaigning.
<P>
	   With four days left until the first-in-the-nation primary, Gore appears to
have gotten a boost from his strong campaign in Iowa, which resulted in a
decisive win Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A Dartmouth College-Associated Press poll, released Friday, gives Gore a 54
percent to 40 percent lead over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday, in the days just before and
after Gore's victory in the Iowa caucuses. Gore was moving up in many polls
before his caucus win.
</P>
<P>
	   A tracking poll released Friday night by the University of New Hampshire for
WMUR and Fox News gave Gore a 13-point lead, 54-41. The CNN-USA Today-Gallup
tracking poll out Friday night gave Gore a 16-point lead, 56-40. Both polls had
an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The last Dartmouth-AP poll two weeks ago had Bradley at 49 percent and Gore
at 43, a slight edge for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Republican race, the latest Dartmouth-AP poll had John McCain in a
virtual tie with George W. Bush, 37 percent to 34 percent. Publisher Steve
Forbes had 15 percent. In the Dartmouth-AP poll two weeks ago, McCain had 42
points, Bush 33 and Forbes 11.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has a narrow lead in some polls, based on his strength among
independents. Bush's chance to catch him may depend on his ability to win over
undecided Republicans despite competition for their votes from conservatives
Forbes and Alan Keyes, veteran pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
	   The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll taken Tuesday through Thursday out Friday
night had the two about even, Bush at 37 percent and McCain at 36 percent with
an error margin of 4 percentage points. The University of New Hampshire-WMUR-Fox
tracking poll taken Monday through Thursday gave McCain a 40-33 edge, just
outside the poll's 4-point error margin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dartmouth-AP poll of 365 likely voters in the Democratic primary and 435
likely voters in the Republican primary had an error margin of plus or minus 5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Linda Fowler, director of the Rockefeller Center polling institute at
Dartmouth College in Hanover, said Gore's campaign has improved. Democrats who
previously doubted whether he could win in November now think Gore has a better
chance, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gore looks much more poised," Fowler said. "He's much clearer in terms of
his message, he's less jittery, he looks more in control."
</P>
<P>
	   That's reflected in poll numbers that showed likely voters saying Gore is
more likely to provide strong leadership than Bradley. They also said Gore is
much more likely to win both the New Hampshire primary and November's general
election. Bradley still has an edge in trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had drawn much of his strength from independents and men, but the
Dartmouth-AP poll shows Gore has surged among men and has regained an earlier
advantage among women.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, 56 percent of men supported Bradley and 38 percent backed
Gore in the Dartmouth-AP. But in the latest poll, 51 percent of men are backing
Gore, while 41 percent supported Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, McCain still ranks significantly higher than Bush on
voter perceptions that he is trustworthy and a strong leader, but voters also
think Bush is more likely to prevail in the New Hampshire primary and win the
presidency in November.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Launches Assault on Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEBANON, N.H. (AP) -- Though supporters' views seemed decidedly mixed, Bill
Bradley kept up his aggressive criticism of Al Gore on Friday, questioning his
Democratic rival's truthfulness and portraying him as the kind of politician who
``uses words in a very tricky manner.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to look at every word and every clause,'' Bradley said in a
comment echoing accusations that critics made about President Clinton during the
Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking the stage after Gore on Friday night, at a dinner benefiting the New
Hampshire Democratic Party, Bradley turned the heat on his opponent even hotter.
``We have to face up to the fund-raising scandals of 1996,'' Bradley said,
hoping to remind Democrats of Gore's central role in that controversy. ``If we
don't clean our house, the Republicans will clean it for us in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Bradley supporters have said his new, more confrontational campaign
style has made them uncomfortable, and one questioned him about it face to face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can you deal with the sleaze factor without yourself going through the
same type of tactic?'' asked Sonia Sheridan, who said she was troubled by the
new approach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you make a very good point,'' said Bradley. ``When someone
misrepresents your position as Al Gore has done consistently in this campaign,
you call them on it.''
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing Gore with an apparent lead just days before Tuesday's New
Hampshire primary, Bradley aides said he would continue his new tack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As voters make up their mind this weekend, we want to make sure they are
aware of the differences,'' said aide Anita Dunn.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheridan, the supporter who questioned Bradley, wasn't sure how the former
senator should respond to Gore's criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know what he should do so that's why I asked him,'' she said. As
for negative campaigning, she said, ``I certainly don't like that tactic but
Gore seems to be zooming because of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other Bradley supporters at campaign events Friday were less than
enthusiastic about his new approach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes me uncomfortable,'' said Belinda Glennie. ``I'd rather see him be
the egghead he is.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've heard good reviews and I've heard bad reviews,'' said Nick Hanlon,
who attended a rally in Newport. ``I hope it doesn't turn people off.''
</P>
<P>
	   Unfazed, Bradley argued at rally after rally that Gore makes campaign
promises designed to be evasive or to mislead on issues ranging from gun control
to health care to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, Bradley said Gore talks about favoring licensing of handguns
but actually favors licensing of new handguns only.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is not new handguns, the problem is all handguns,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said little in response. ``I'm going to emphasize the positive,'' the
vice president said as he arrived in Portsmouth from his brief return to
Washington for Clinton's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to get down to that level. I'm going to continue to
emphasize a positive agenda,'' he said later in an interview with WNDS-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Accompanied by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Gore stuck to his
day's message -- that he is the only presidential candidate with the know-how to
keep the economy on track.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have just begun to prosper,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on a positive note, his campaign previewed for reporters a 30-minute ad
it will air on New Hampshire television Saturday. Besides commercials that have
already been running, it includes new scenes -- Gore playing Frisbee with his
wife and dancing with his daughter at her wedding -- showing him as a loving
husband and father.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the people at Gore's Portsmouth event, Bradley's recent criticism
seemed to have made an impact.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Northern Research and Engineering Corp., engineer Dave Glista, a
Democrat from Durham, said he was undecided but leaning toward Bradley, even
though his priority issues -- the economy and urban sprawl -- should put him in
Gore's camp.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone says Clinton is the king of smooth talking and political talking.
I'm sure Gore has picked up some of that, so I would be more leery of what he
says,'' Glista said.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Gore accuses Bradley of negative campaigning sparked by
desperation.
</P>
<P>
	   Undecided Democrat Amos Johnson had her own doubts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm more interested in the issues,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``This is a bit
abrasive. We're going to go see Al Gore tomorrow and we'll make up our mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Along the way Friday, Bradley collected the endorsement of Connecticut Gov.
Lowell Weicker. Weicker was a Republican senator before winning the governor's
office as an independent.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Bradley's strengths is his appeal to independent voters, and he was
hoping to use Weicker's backing to score points with independents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Weicker aimed his pitch in their direction: ``The only independent thinker
and actor out there is Bill Bradley.''

<TEXT>
    	   BEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) - Some computer users around the nation who use
AT&AMP;T's Global Network were unable to access the Internet on Friday night, a
company official said.
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T spokesman David Johnson said the disruption began at about 6:45 p.m.
EST. Service for most customers was restored at about 10:15 p.m., Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Technicians and engineers were still trying to determine what caused the
problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson said it was nearly impossible to tell how many customers were
affected because computer users have various ways to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   "They might have three or four different numbers they try," he said. "There
are so many multiple routes for accessing the Internet."
</P>
<P>

access do so through the Worldnet Service, which was not affected.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- A Moroccan man was detained after crossing into the United

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Hits Northern Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 shook
northern Japan, slightly injuring two people.
</P>
<P>
	   The quake, which hit Friday night around 11:21 p.m., was centered about 35
miles under the floor of the Pacific Ocean off the eastern coast of Japan's
northern island of Hokkaido, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was felt most strongly in the cities of Kushiro and Nemuro and the towns
of Nakashibetsu, Akkeshi and Betsukai in Hokkaido. People in the northern region
of Honshu, Japan's main island, also felt the quake.
</P>
<P>
	   A 57-year-old Nemuro woman was slightly injured when the jolt made her fall
and hit her head, local police spokesman Hisao Harada said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in Nemuro, a 52-year-old man cut his hand on a bottle that fell from a
shelf, Harada said.
</P>
<P>
	   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause damage to houses if it is centered in a
residential area.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. It sits atop
four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the earth's surface.

<HEADLINE> China Frees U.S. College Librarian  </HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDE R. MARX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese authorities freed a U.S. college librarian on
Friday, five months after they arrested him on charges of smuggling secret
documents out of the country, U.S. and Chinese officials said here.
</P>
<P>
	   Song Yongyi, who works at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., was scheduled
to arrive in Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said the U.S. government was pleased
by China's decision but ``did not believe there was any evidence to warrant his
detention.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, China's ambassador to the United States said in a statement that
Song ``admitted all the facts related to his criminal activities ... and also
voluntarily revealed evidence against illegal activities of others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song's case was treated with leniency because of his ``repentance,'' said
the ambassador, Li Zhao Xing.
</P>
<P>
	   Song, a 50-year-old Chinese national who had planned to become a U.S.
citizen in September, was on a trip to China in August to collect source
material on the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when he and his wife, Helen Yao,
were detained. His wife was allowed to return to the United States in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickinson officials have said Song was collecting previously published
material to bring to the United States, but the Chinese contended he was
``purchasing or illegally supplying intelligence'' to people outside China.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley cited the efforts of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and several congressional delegations that visited China
for pressuring the Chinese government to release Song.
</P>
<P>
	   Specter said he learned of Song's release during a meeting with Li at the
Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday morning. He said he believes Chinese
authorities released Song to curry favor with Congress, which will decide
whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations, formerly known as
most-favored-nation trading status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They know they'll need our votes,'' said Specter, who declined to comment
on Song's alleged confession.
</P>
<P>
	   Contacted at home by The Associated Press, Song's wife, Yao, said: ``He
called me and said he was free. Today is a very exciting day.'' She said the
State Department told her Song would arrive in Detroit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Beijing, a U.S. official said Song left Saturday on a Northwest flight to
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador to China James Prueher said he hoped Song's release would be
``a harbinger of continued open academic research in China'' and of broader
discussions with the Chinese government on related issues. Prueher said in a
statement he was ``delighted for Song Yongyi and his family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dickinson President William Durden said he was ``appreciative of the actions
of the Chinese government and look forward to his return to his family and our
campus.'' Durden also declined to comment on the confession but called the
release a victory for academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   Song is an expert on documents about the Cultural Revolution, when millions
in China were persecuted as Mao Tse-tung sought to consolidate his power. The
communist government continues to regard the period as extremely sensitive and
heavily restricts access to archived material about it.

Clinton Vows Federal Aid for Georgia

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As another winter blast was poised to pound Georgia
today, President Clinton freed up federal aid to the state to recover from last
week's ice storm. Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes asked the federal government to
declare disasters in 39 northern counties because of the storm that left 500,000
customers without electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage. A
disaster declaration makes federal money available to local governments and
individuals for repairs and loans.

disrupted social services in the aftermath of the territory's vote for
independence. To try to counter the risk, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
recommended that the U.N. transitional administration in East Timor, or UNTAET,
make creating jobs and beefing up East Timor's destroyed infrastructure a
priority. In his report, Annan said the U.N. mission, which has been running the

Poland's Cabinet Won't Be Changed

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's Cabinet emerged
unscathed Friday after the ruling Solidarity party, beset by infighting and
plunging public approval ratings, met to hash out ways to restore its battered
image. After hours of closed meetings, Solidarity party leader Marian
Krzaklewski said there would be no Cabinet changes -- despite a clamor by some
party factions for Buzek to be replaced. Solidarity's troubles are deepening as
former communists exploit public anger over cost-cutting in social services and
a restructuring of moribund state industries that is leaving many Poles without
work.

FDA Advisers Support Drug for MS

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A cancer drug appears to ease advanced multiple
sclerosis, government scientists decided today -- leaving Novantrone in line to
become the nation's first treatment for tens of thousands of Americans with
crippling late-stage MS. But Novantrone can be used only for about two years
before it suddenly and mysteriously increases patients' risk of dangerous heart
damage, and MS is a disease patients battle for decades. The FDA is not bound by
its advisers' recommendations but usually follows them. If approved, Novantrone
would become the first official treatment for "secondary progressive MS," the
most severe form of the debilitating neurologic disease.

SEC Orders Markets To Use Decimals

exchanges to begin quoting at least some share prices in dollars and cents by
July 3, requiring them to fully abandon the 200-year-old use of fractions by
year's end. The exchanges have been putting together plans for phasing in
decimal prices this year, now that the securities industry has cleared the Year
2000 technological hurdle. Supporters say adopting the decimal system would
narrow the difference between a stock's best bid and asking prices, known as the
spread.

Gonchar chased down a puck near the left point and fired a shot with about five
seconds left in the 5-minute OT session. There was some question as to whether
the goal beat the clock, but the officials called to check the video replay and
determined the goal should count. Local television replays seemed to show the

<HEADLINE> Bradley's Funds Now At $20M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just before the New Hampshire primary, former Sen. Bill
Bradley reported Friday that his campaign bank account is up to $20 million. His
opponent, Vice President Al Gore has a little more than $11 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley finished 1999 with more than $8.3 million in the bank, and expects
an additional $11.4 million in federal matching funds. The federal government
matches the first $250 of each individual contribution for presidential
candidates who agree to limit their campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the Bradley campaign reported raising more than $27 million through
Dec. 31, compared with $28 million for his rival, Gore. Final numbers are due
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We always planned to run a national campaign, and as a result of the
overwhelming support we have received at the grass-roots level, we will have the
resources to compete throughout the entire nominating process,'' campaign
chairman Douglas Berman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Helping Bradley's fund raising is the money he has brought in through his
Web site. The campaign said it had raised more than $250,000 this month via the
Internet, bringing its online total to more than $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he trails in national opinion polls, Bradley has been able to match
Gore in fund raising. Gore reported having $11.2 million in the bank as of Jan.
3, and has requested $12.4 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also has raised an additional $2.7 million to pay legal and accounting
costs for the general election.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Filed Against FBI Agent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The family of two brothers killed in a
wrong-way crash filed a $50 million lawsuit Friday against an FBI agent charged
in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
	   The wrongful death lawsuit was filed against David Farrall, 36, a
Miami-based agent in the FBI's organized crime unit.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 23, Farrall was driving south in the northbound lanes of I-95 when
he slammed into the northbound car carrying Maurice Williams, 23, and his
brother, Craig Chambers, 19, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, the highway patrol said Williams was the wrong-way driver. A
month later, the patrol admitted its error and apologized to the brothers'
family.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrall pleaded innocent to vehicular homicide and other charges Wednesday.
His blood alcohol content measured .17 at the time of the crash, more than twice
Florida's legal limit of .08.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrall is under house arrest and on administrative leave with pay from the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Looking at the severity of his actions, going the wrong way while drunk,
$50 million is justified,'' said Levi Williams, attorney for the victims'
family.

<HEADLINE> Hotlanta Braces for the Worst  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Outside the Georgia Dome, workers unloaded the giant mounds
of sand they might need to keep the ramps and entryways from becoming too slick
on Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the entrance to the Delta Airlines terminal at the airport, a huge
scratchpad sitting on an easel spelled out the growing list of flights into
Atlanta that had already been canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one thing was missing as midnight approached in chilly Atlanta on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, it seemed the winter storm making its way across the Southeast was
taking on characteristics of the game itself. Sometimes, the buildup is more
frenzied than the main event.
</P>
<P>
	   "I walked outside earlier today and it was really pretty nice," NFL vice
president of special events Jim Steeg said, noting cloudy skies, still winds and
temperatures in the mid-30s. "We're ready for whatever comes. The forecast seems
to be changing by the minute."
</P>
<P>
	   Late Friday night, a light mist of freezing rain fell on Atlanta. The
National Weather Service backed off on its forecast of snow, but said the
freezing rain could continue into Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   If the worst hits, it could be the kind of storm that might normally stop
Hotlanta in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
	   If anything is still running, however, it figures to be the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel like we're prepared," Steeg said. "It's a matter of flexibility. We
need to be able to adjust to circumstances depending on what the weather
brings."
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the adjustments have included:
</P>
<P>
	   --Rescheduling a rehearsal for the pregame show in the Georgia Dome so both
teams could hold their final full practices indoors Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   --Stationing workers on the Georgia Dome roof to brush off snow or excess
water should it accumulate.
</P>
<P>
	   --Making sure all the food and drinks arrive at the stadium early to prevent
delivery trucks from having to negotiate slick roads.
</P>
<P>
	   --Placing 16 power generators at the Georgia Dome to provide emergency
energy should ice and snow knock out power to the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
	   James Peters of Georgia Power says downtown Atlanta is networked for power
underground.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very, very rare that an outage occurs," Peters said. "If an outage
does occur, we do have contingency plans in place."
</P>
<P>
	   Travelers were searching for backup plans, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta canceled four flights from Nashville to Atlanta. Airline officials
said they canceled the flights to prevent a worse backlog in case it snowed.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision left travel agencies in Tennessee scrambling.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me," said Suzette Bertuccelli,
manager of Embassy Travel in Nashville. "They usually don't cancel until
inclement weather hits. We've just gotten a couple of calls this morning from
people wanting to get protected on another flight."
</P>
<P>
	   She said other airlines were still flying between the two cities, but those
flights are completely booked.
</P>
<P>
	   In St. Louis, Susan Dibb of Lesterville, Mo., climbed aboard a chartered
plane Friday morning and felt fortunate to be on an early flight out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't care if it's got eight inches after we get there because we're
going to the Super Bowl," she said. "I'm very excited."
</P>
<P>
	   Reservation managers at two large downtown hotels, the Hyatt and Marriott,
said the number of room cancellations through Friday had been negligible.
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL has no plans to redistribute tickets that aren't picked up.
</P>
<P>
	   "The league isn't really in a position to do that," Steeg said. "Now, if
Coke learns that half its group isn't going to make it in, it's their decision."
</P>
<P>
	   But Steeg doesn't anticipate seeing a half-empty Georgia Dome come Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   He recalled the 1987 Super Bowl, when the Giants played the Broncos in
Pasadena, Calif., and a giant snowstorm closed airports in the New York area in
the days leading up to the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone still made it out there," Steeg said. "Everyone has four days to
make it to the game. They don't have any other meetings to go to until the big
one at 6 o'clock Sunday. If they can make it here by then, they're good. Then,
the big issue becomes, what's the weather going to be like Monday, when everyone
is going home?"

Clinton Vows Federal Aid for Georgia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As another winter blast was poised to pound Georgia
today, President Clinton freed up federal aid to the state to recover from last
week's ice storm. Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes asked the federal government to
declare disasters in 39 northern counties because of the storm that left 500,000
customers without electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage. A
disaster declaration makes federal money available to local governments and
individuals for repairs and loans.

Moroccan Arrested at Canada Border

<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- A Moroccan man was detained after crossing into the United
States from Canada and was ordered held today as a material witness. Federal
officials, who were treating the case with an unusual level of secrecy, would
not say what alerted them to the man, Youssef Karroum, or in which case he would
be a material witness. Malkin and other authorities would not say whether there
was a connection between Karroum and Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian who was stopped
last month in Port Angeles after crossing into the country from Canada with
explosives in his car.

UN Warns of Unrest in East Timor
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations today warned of the potential for
social unrest in East Timor because of unemployment, high food prices and
disrupted social services in the aftermath of the territory's vote for
independence. To try to counter the risk, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
recommended that the U.N. transitional administration in East Timor, or UNTAET,
make creating jobs and beefing up East Timor's destroyed infrastructure a
priority. In his report, Annan said the U.N. mission, which has been running the
territory for three months, is trying to coordinate humanitarian relief efforts.

Poland's Cabinet Won't Be Changed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's Cabinet emerged
unscathed Friday after the ruling Solidarity party, beset by infighting and
plunging public approval ratings, met to hash out ways to restore its battered
image. After hours of closed meetings, Solidarity party leader Marian
Krzaklewski said there would be no Cabinet changes -- despite a clamor by some
party factions for Buzek to be replaced. Solidarity's troubles are deepening as
former communists exploit public anger over cost-cutting in social services and
a restructuring of moribund state industries that is leaving many Poles without
work.

FDA Advisers Support Drug for MS
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A cancer drug appears to ease advanced multiple
sclerosis, government scientists decided today -- leaving Novantrone in line to
become the nation's first treatment for tens of thousands of Americans with
crippling late-stage MS. But Novantrone can be used only for about two years
before it suddenly and mysteriously increases patients' risk of dangerous heart
damage, and MS is a disease patients battle for decades. The FDA is not bound by
its advisers' recommendations but usually follows them. If approved, Novantrone
would become the first official treatment for "secondary progressive MS," the
most severe form of the debilitating neurologic disease.

SEC Orders Markets To Use Decimals
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators today ordered the nation's stock
exchanges to begin quoting at least some share prices in dollars and cents by
July 3, requiring them to fully abandon the 200-year-old use of fractions by
year's end. The exchanges have been putting together plans for phasing in
decimal prices this year, now that the securities industry has cleared the Year
2000 technological hurdle. Supporters say adopting the decimal system would
narrow the difference between a stock's best bid and asking prices, known as the
spread.

Capitals Beat Coyotes 3-2 (OT)

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calle Johansson scored in the final second of overtime to
give the Washington Capitals a 3-2 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes today and
extend their unbeaten streak to 10 games. The stunning finish began when Sergei
Gonchar chased down a puck near the left point and fired a shot with about five
seconds left in the 5-minute OT session. There was some question as to whether
the goal beat the clock, but the officials called to check the video replay and
determined the goal should count. Local television replays seemed to show the
puck went into the net with 0.1 seconds left.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A Continental Airlines plane with 32 people aboard
skidded off a taxiway Friday after landing at Newark International Airport and
got stuck in the snow. No one was hurt.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets 104, Rockets 98  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Ron Mercer scored 24 points and Nick Van Exel had 21, leading
the Denver Nuggets past Houston 104-98 Friday night and snapping their 11-game
losing streak to the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
	   Antonio McDyess added 18 points before fouling out with 3:16 left. Raef
LaFrentz had 15 points and George McCloud came off the bench to score 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Francis led Houston with 27 points -- 21 in the second half -- and 10
assists. Matt Bullard had 18 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon scored seven points, moving ahead of former Nugget
Alex English into 10th place on the NBA career scoring list with 25,616 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver hadn't beaten the Rockets since a 113-109 decision in Houston on Jan.
30, 1997. Houston also had won six straight games in Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel scored Denver's final eight points of the third quarter, including
back-to-back 3-pointers, helping build a 75-62 lead that the Rockets whittled to
75-67 entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   McCloud's 3-pointer to open the final period made it 78-67, and Houston got
no closer than six points after that. McCloud's basket with 8:01 left gave
Denver its biggest lead, 88-74. Mercer made 4-of-4 free throws to maintain a
12-point advantage. Francis and Kelvin Cato combined for the last 11 Houston
points, cutting the deficit to six.
</P>
<P>
	   Cato's rebound layup made it 102-96 with 1:32 remaining, but Van Exel made
two free throws with 1:14 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Mercer had 15 points in the first half to help the Nuggets take a 46-40
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Bullard scored five points in Houston's 9-0 run that produced a 15-9 lead
midway through the opening quarter. But the Rockets shot only 31 percent in the
period, and Denver outscored Houston 14-4 over the final six minutes for a 23-19
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver started the second quarter hitting just 2 of 12 shots, allowing
Houston to take a 32-27 lead on Cato's rebound slam with 6:20 left in the
period. But the Nuggets again dominated late in the period, outscoring the
Rockets 15-6 in the last four minutes, including nine points by Mercer.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Demand Return of Elian  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Calling the mother of Elian Gonzalez ``an excellent girl,''
President Fidel Castro said Friday she had been ``practically kidnapped'' by the
boyfriend who perished along with her on the boat wreck her 6-year-old son
survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Castro's remarks to a conference of economists were aimed at those who say
that Elian should remain in the United States because his mother sacrificed his
life to take her to ``freedom,'' a vision he called a cliche.
</P>
<P>
	   He placed the blame on Lazaro Rafael Munero, who apparently organized the
ill-fated journey on which Elian's mother Elisabeth Brotons and 10 other people
-- including Munero -- died.
</P>
<P>
	   Castro called Munero -- who reportedly drove a taxi and engaged in
unofficial businesses in the Cuban city of Cardenas -- a ``ruffian'' on whom
Cuban police had amassed ''100 pages of reports.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to sources quoted by the Miami Herald, Munero had fled to Florida
in June 1998 and returned to Cuba later that year, only to be jailed for several
months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy'' to make the
late-November trip, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban leader said Elian had been especially loved by his parents because
the mother had earlier suffered seven miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, Cuba's communist government celebrated the birth of
independence hero Jose Marti on Friday with rallies calling for the return of
Elian Gonzalez, the ``boy martyr'' at the center of an international custody
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of children flooded Havana's Plaza of the Revolution to
deliver a dual homage to Marti and Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban whose rescue off
Florida's coast two months ago set off a tug-of-war between relatives living on
both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing their red Communist Pioneer neckerchiefs, a string of young boys and
girls recited poems they wrote for Elian, dubbed Cuba's ``boy hero'' and
``symbolic child,'' and for Marti, commonly known on the island as Cuba's
``teacher'' and ``apostle.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Communist Party daily Granma compared Elian with revolutionary icon
Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara and said the boy ``has been converted forever into a
symbol of the crimes and injustices that imperialism is capable of committing
against an innocent.''
</P>
<P>
	   The commemorations were similar to those held here annually for Marti, the
revolutionary and poet who fought for Cuba's independence from Spain in 1898.
But this year, children wore T-shirts bearing Elian's portrait with their school
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
	   The commemorations began early Friday morning, as tens of thousands of
Cubans marched through Havana's streets by torchlight. Similar events were held
all day in the capital and across the island.
</P>
<P>
	   In Old Havana, hundreds of children marched around the Parque Central
chanting ``We will save Elian!'' A small group of girls wore construction paper
handcuffs -- an apparent reference to the government's characterization of
Elian's retention in the United States as a ``kidnapping.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fidel Castro's government has been using such traditional political events
-- along with other rallies almost every day -- to draw attention to the case of
Elian, who was rescued Nov. 25 while clinging to an inner tube. His mother and
10 others died at sea while trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past two months, Elian's father has demanded that the boy be
returned to him in Cuba, and the U.S. government has said that father and son
should be reunited.
</P>
<P>
	   But Elian's paternal great-uncle in the United States, backed by the
anti-Castro Cuban American National Foundation, is fighting in the courts to
keep the boy in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba kept up its condemnation of the handling of Wednesday's meeting between
Elian and his grandmothers at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in Miami Beach,
Fla. Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin said after the meeting she thought Elian should
stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First Fruits of the Monstrousness,'' read the full-page editorial on the
front of Friday's edition of the Communist Party daily Granma. It offered more
details and criticisms of the perceived treatment that Elian's grandmothers,
Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, received from O'Laughlin, the Miami
relatives and other anti-Castro Cubans during the encounter.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with the Spanish language broadcast of CNN, Elian's father
also criticized how the meeting was handled. He repeated charges that his
relatives and others in Miami had offered him money to stay in the United States
with his son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are not going to buy me,'' said Juan Miguel Gonzalez. ``What is
important for me is that they return the boy to me as soon as possible.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Isaiah Rider made a pair of free throws with eight seconds
left in overtime and the Atlanta Hawks, helped by Allan Houston's key miss from
the foul line, held off the New York Knicks 98-96 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knicks trailed 98-95 when Houston, who led New York with 22 points but
missed a final shot in regulation, was fouled on a 3-point try with three
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston made the first free throw, but missed the second. He missed the
third one intentionally, but the Hawks got the rebound for their third straight
win.
</P>
<P>
	   Rider's two foul shots put the Hawks ahead 97-95. After Alan Henderson
blocked a shot by New York's Latrell Sprewell, Dikembe Mutombo made one of two
free throws with four seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Rider led Atlanta with 22 points. He made all eight of his free throws, but
made only 6-of-25 shots from the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Mutombo had 24 rebounds -- 13 off the offensive boards -- with 18 points and
four blocked shots. Henderson had 16 points and Bimbo Coles added 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprewell had 21 for the Knicks. Charlie Ward added 16 points and Patrick
Ewing had 10 points and 15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knicks had tied it in regulation at 91 when Sprewell scored with 13
seconds left after Ewing stole an inbounds pass from Henderson.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams had a chance to win it in regulation. Atlanta's Jason Terry
missed a 15-foot jumper with seven seconds left and Houston's 15-footer rimmed
out with two seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knicks had taken a 74-64 lead with 1:01 left in the third period on a
basket by Sprewell. Atlanta came back to go ahead 80-79 on a basket by Lorenzo
Wright.
</P>
<P>
	   The two teams were never separated by more than two points the rest of
regulation before a near-capacity crowd of 18,596.

<HEADLINE> Officer killed while chasing burglary suspects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ESSEX, Conn. (AP) - A Middletown police sergeant died Friday after his
cruiser went off Route 9 and crashed during a pursuit of two burglary suspects,
police said.
<P>
	   Sgt. George Dingwall, a 19-year veteran, was one of several officers chasing
the suspects at about noon when his cruiser went off the left side of the
highway and crashed into some trees, said Lt. Ralph Carpenter, a state police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were investigating whether the cruiser was rammed or forced off the
road by the suspects' car, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dingwall, 47, was taken by Life Star helicopter to Hartford Hospital, where
he died about three hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   "As the (suspects') vehicle proceeded down Route 9, the vehicle rammed a
Middletown police cruiser," Carpenter said. "It continued further down
southbound and ended up ramming one of our state police cruisers."
</P>
<P>
	   The suspects' car continued south onto Interstate 95, where it was stopped
in Branford by troopers using "stop sticks," a spiked device that when driven
over deflates a car's tires.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant Browne, 36, and Victor Santiago, 38, both from New Haven, were taken
into custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Browne faces charges including burglary, larceny, and engaging police in a
pursuit. He was also wanted for a parole violation, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Santiago was charged with burglary and larceny. Both were being held in lieu
of $1 million bonds, and were scheduled to appear in Middlesex Superior Court on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   If it is found they caused the fatal accident, they could be charged with
murder, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The chase began when police interrupted a burglary in progress at a home in
Middletown, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident and investigation closed Route 9 southbound near Exit 3 in
Essex until 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Dingwall lived in Haddam with his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
	   Flags were flying at half staff Friday afternoon in front of the Middletown
police headquarters, and a black bunting had been draped over the front of the
building to honor Dingwall.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had a distinguished career, and he was well respected by all of us at
the Middletown Police Department," said Police Chief J. Edward Brymer. "We have
lost a family member"

<HEADLINE> Storm Spreads More Snow in South  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA M. LaHAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A storm spread still more snow across the Deep South on
Friday, giving children from Arkansas to Georgia a rare chance to build snowmen
but threatening travel to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm, which dumped up to 17 inches of snow in Oklahoma earlier this
week, dropped between an inch and a foot in Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and
Tennessee before stalling near the Alabama-Georgia line for most of the day
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   As midnight approached, however, the storm was moving through northern
Georgia, National Weather Service meteorologist Terry Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Areas in north Georgia and parts of central Georgia got snow, sleet and
freezing rain, he said. Icy rain fell on northeastern Alabama, rain fell on
Atlanta, and snow started falling in western South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The wintery mix was expected to continue on Saturday but play out by Super
Bowl Sunday, when no precipitation was expected, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a precaution, Delta Air Lines canceled some flights into Atlanta Friday
afternoon, but promised to accommodate passengers trying to get to the Super
Bowl. More than 100,000 people are expected in Atlanta for the game between the
Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the customers to get down there to the Super Bowl,'' said John
Farmer, Delta station manager in Nashville, Tenn. ``We'll work with them any way
we can to get them there by kickoff.''

Clinton Plans Aid for Georgia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton freed up federal aid to Georgia to
recover from last week's ice storm as another winter blast was poised to pound
the state Friday. Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes asked the federal government to
declare disasters in 39 northern counties because of the storm that left 500,000
customers without electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage. A
disaster declaration makes federal money available to local governments and
individuals for repairs and loans.

Cubans Demand Return of Elian

	   HAVANA (AP) -- Calling the mother of Elian Gonzalez "an excellent girl,"
President Fidel Castro said Friday she had been "practically kidnapped" by the
boyfriend who perished along with her on the boat wreck her 6-year-old son
survived. Castro's remarks to a conference of economists were aimed at those who
say that Elian should remain in the United States because his mother sacrificed
his life to take her to "freedom," a vision he called a cliche. The Communist
Party daily Granma compared Elian with revolutionary icon Ernesto "Che" Guevara
and said the boy "has been converted forever into a symbol of the crimes and
injustices that imperialism is capable of committing against an innocent."

Strong Quake Hits Northern Japan

	   TOKYO (AP) -- A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 shook
northern Japan, slightly injuring two people. The quake, which hit Friday night
around 11:21 p.m., was centered about 35 miles under the floor of the Pacific
Ocean off the eastern coast of Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, the
Meteorological Agency said. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause damage to houses if
it is centered in a residential area. Japan is one of the world's most
earthquake-prone countries. It sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land
that move across the earth's surface.

Bradley's Funds Now At $20M
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just before the New Hampshire primary, former Sen. Bill
Bradley reported Friday that his campaign bank account is up to $20 million. His
opponent, Vice President Al Gore has a little more than $11 million on hand.
Bradley finished 1999 with more than $8.3 million in the bank, and expects an
additional $11.4 million in federal matching funds. The federal government
matches the first $250 of each individual contribution for presidential
candidates who agree to limit their campaign spending. Helping Bradley's fund
raising is the money he has brought in through his Web site. The campaign said
it had raised more than $250,000 this month via the Internet.

SEC Orders Markets To Use Decimals
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on today ordered the nation's stock
exchanges to begin quoting at least some share prices in dollars and cents by
July 3, requiring them to fully abandon the 200-year-old use of fractions by
year's end. The exchanges have been putting together plans for phasing in
decimal prices this year, now that the securities industry has cleared the Year
2000 technological hurdle. Supporters say adopting the decimal system would
narrow the difference between a stock's best bid and asking prices, known as the
spread.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- A blowout turned into a dazzling drama until
Lindsay Davenport, stalled two excruciating points from victory, finally ended
Martina Hingis' furious comeback and three-year stranglehold on the Australian
