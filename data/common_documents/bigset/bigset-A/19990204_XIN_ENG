<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Proposes High-level Talks With S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Wednesday offered to hold "high-level"
political talks with South Korea this year on condition that Seoul
move to secure national solidarity, said DPRK's official media.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal contained in a letter to the South Korean
authority, Pyongyang urged Seoul to take steps to discontinue
joint military exercises with the United States, abolish its
National Security Law and do away with "anti-North Korean
cooperation with outsiders," said the Korean Central News Agency (
KCNA).
</P>
<P>
The letter, delivered through the Red Cross at the U.N. truce
village of Panmunjom on Wednesday, was the first of its kind since
1994 when the death of former DPRK President Kim Il Song caused
suspension of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The United States maintains 36,000 troops in South Korea and
regularly holds joint military exercises with South Korean forces,
events that provoke howls of anger and protest from Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK hopes that Seoul will carry out the actual measures as
early as possible, which Pyongyang claims is the precondition for
the high-level political talks.
</P>
<P>
The letter, approved at an annual joint conference attended by
deputies of the DPRK's government, political parties and
organizations, is expected to provoke an active response from
South Korea in a bid to seek a breakthrough for national
reunification, the KCNA reports said
</P>
<P>
The letter said the DPRK wants to see the year 2000 serve as a
year full of hope for the realization of national reunification.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK holds the joint conference each year and restates its
policy concerning reunification with South Korea in the form of a
letter following the conference.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Finnish FMs Discuss Mideast Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Wednesday held talks with visiting Finnish Foreign
Minister Tarja Halonen on ways of pushing forward the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Halonen told reporters that she and Moussa
discussed the role to be played by the European Union (EU) in
advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel are
deadlocked due to Israel's suspension of the implementation of the
Wye peace accord signed last October in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel should withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank in three phases. But after carrying out
the first phase of pullback in early December, Israel suspended
the accord, citing the Palestinians' failure to comply with the
deal.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which desires to play a key role in Middle East issues,
keeps close contacts with Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a
peace treaty with Israel and an active mediator in the Mideast
peace march. Finland will hold EU's rotating presidency for the
second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The peace drive is coming close to "a significant date," namely
May 4, on which the Palestinians have planned to declare their
independent state, Halonen said.
</P>
<P>
May 4 is the date designated by the 1993 Oslo accord, which was
signed between the Palestinians and Israel, as the deadline for a
final agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish minister arrived here Tuesday night during a
regional tour, which has taken her to the Palestinian self-rule
areas and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Unveils Plan To Soften Effects of Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Prime Minister Nurlan
Balgimbayev unveiled a program of action Wednesday for the year
1999 which would soften the effects of the Russian and Asian
economic crises on Kazakhstan and to improve the national economy,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which was presented to the lower house of parliament,
covers state expenditures, money policy, international borrowing
and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
A cut of nearly 10 percent must be made in state spending in
1999, an amount which was originally set at 346 billion tenge (
about 4 billion U.S. dollars), or "Kazakhstan will experience the
same crisis occurring in its neighboring states," Balgimbayev was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition to curbing expenditures, measures will be adopted
to improve the overall economy, support agriculture, boost
domestic production, limit imports from the Commonwealth of
Independent States, and strengthen customs controls.

<HEADLINE> Doping Summit Impossible to Meet Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Conference on Doping
in Sport, which is being held here under the auspiece of the
International Olympic Committee, looks hard to reach its goals
when the meeting ends on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IOC, which is staggered by the voting-for-favour scandal
recently, has set two main goals for the conference -- setting up
an anti-doping agency and to standardize the punishment for drug
abusers.
</P>
<P>
After two-days debate, it seemed that all representatives from
international sports federations agreed on the issue of an anti-
doping agency in principle, but some put the idea of sanction
standardization into a boiling bowl.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, has vowed that they
would never bow to the two-year suspension proposed by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA, explained his position that he
was not against the anti-doping policy, but "the drug case should
be judged individually," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In fight against doping," Blatter said, "distinction should be
made and different circumstances should be taken into account."
</P>
<P>
The IOC once warned that any international federation which
does not comply with the common anti-doping policy would be
expelled from the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"If that happened, we will fight," said the president.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's director of communications Keith Cooper said: "we feel
it is important for each sport to have the latitude to fix its
suspension of offenders according to the rhythm of its own
competition."
</P>
<P>
He said the IOC's proposed two-year ban on doping offenders was
unfair to professional soccer players who play more matches than
any other sport.
</P>
<P>
He said FIFA wanted punitive powers kept in the hands of its
national federations who hand down fines and suspensions depending
on the drugs used.
</P>
<P>
Facing the stiff opposition of FIFA, the IOC may take a back-
step in the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Primo Nebiolo, president of association for 28 summer Olympic
sports, said that some professional federations could evaluate
drug offenders individually.
</P>
<P>
"The minimum required sanction for major doing substances or
prohibited methods shall be two years for a first offence," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, based on specific, exceptional circumstances to be
evaluated in the first instance by the competent IF bodies, there
would be a provision for a possible modification of the two-year
sanction.
</P>
<P>
"As was recalled by many authoritative colleagues, I would like
to strong reaffirm the basic principle that the Federations are
the only organisations that can enforce santions in doping cases
or adopt medical codes. In this way, the federations will be in a
position -- if there are indeed the specific, exceptional
circumstances -- to evaluate on a case-by-case basis the
modification of the two-year sanction," he added.

<HEADLINE> UK to Back Human Rights Monitors for N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government said on
Wednesday it might back a plan for human rights observers to be
sent to Northern Ireland to report on punishment beatings rampant
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief spokesman told reporters that
the level of punishment beatings was not at present high enough to
constitute a breach of last year's Good Friday agreement on the
political future of the province.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "On the specific proposal to Amnesty
International, that is not something we would rule out."
</P>
<P>
The idea has been proposed by Northern Ireland's First
Minister, David Trimble, who has written to London-based Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch of New York suggesting they
send teams to Belfast.
</P>
<P>
So-called "punishment attacks" have continued since the Irish
Republican Army and its Protestant counterparts declared
ceasefires in their struggles to influence Northern Ireland's
political future in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Trimble says that so far this year, there have been 40 such
attacks. The victims are often people living in the guerrilla
groups' stronghold areas, and range from drug dealers to defectors
from their ranks.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Eamon Collins, a once notorious IRA guerrilla who
turned police informant, was found dead in the town of Newry. He
had been repeatedly stabbed, savagely beaten around the head and
then run over by a car.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty said in a statement that it had been planning a mission
to Northern Ireland to meet the political parties there and
discuss its concerns about human rights.

MAPUTO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Various activities were held
across Mozambique Wednesday, commemorating the 30th anniversary of
the assassination of Eduardo Mondlane, the founder and the first
Chairman of the ruling FRELIMO party.
</P>
<P>
At a rally in capital Maputo, current Chairman of the
Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO) and President of the
Republic, Joaquim Chissano highly praised Mondlane for
contributing to the national liberation and the state
independence.
</P>
<P>
Chissano called upon his people to follow the steps of
Mondlane, devoting themselves to the reconstruction of the
country.
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the southern African country, lectures and
cultural and sports activities were held to memorize the
anti-colonialism champion.
</P>
<P>
Mondlane had worked in the United Nations and been a teacher in
the United States before he left his family in the U.S. to return
and fight for Mozambican national liberation in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
In 1962, Mondlane united three Mozambican liberation movements
into the FRELIMO in Tanzania to lead the fight against the
Portuguese colonialists.
</P>
<P>
On February 3, 1969, the Mozambican national liberation leader
was assassinated in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam by a blast of
a letter bomb designed by the colonialists.

</P>
<P>
Phieu has written an open letter to the Vietnamese people today

</P>
<P>
In the letter, the Vietnamese general secretary has also asked
local authorities, mass and commercial organizations not to send

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Inflation Falls to 11.2 Percent: C. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's overall
inflation fell to 11.2 percent last December, a drop of 0.9
percentage point from the previous month, the Bank of Tanzania
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The decrease in inflation rate was due to decline in the
non-food inflation," the central bank said in its latest monthly
report.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, warned that overall inflation may increase
slightly in the coming months. "Failure of short rains is expected
to lead to short supplies of cereals, particularly maize in the
market, hence an upward pressure on food prices," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said during December 1998, the country's
trade account deteriorated by 20.3 percent to a deficit of 38.5
million U.S. Dollars compared with a deficit of 32 million Dollars
recorded during the previous month.
</P>
<P>
"The deterioration was contributed by a decrease in export
earnings that went down by 18.2 percent coupled with a 7.8 percent
decrease in import bill," the bank explained.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in export earnings was mainly attributable to
unfavorable performance in the traditional sector, which decreased
by 27.2 percent due to both volume and price factors, it added.
</P>
<P>
During the year ending December 1998, trade account recorded a
deficit of 777.2 million Dollars, compared with 620.6 million
recorded during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
On external debt, the bank said by the end of last year, it
stood at 7. 9727 billion Dollars, an increase of 0.5 percent over
7.9312 billion at the end of December 1997.

<P>
The EU-South Africa deal, which was reached in Switzerland last
week and is yet to be approved by the South African cabinet and

percent of South Africa's exports to the EU and 86 percent of EU
exports to South Africa in a decade.

<HEADLINE> Inderfurth Meets with Afghan Leaders and Pakistani Provincial Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHWAR, PAKISTAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Under
Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Karl Inderfurth
Wednesday met with Afghan leaders and officials of Pakistan's
North West Frontier Province (NWFP) for discussions on a variety
of issues.
</P>
<P>
Official sources told Xinhua that during the meeting held in
Peshawar, capital of NWFP, leaders of the various Afghan factions
briefed Inderfurth about the foreign interference in the Afghan
issue, the formation of a broad-based government and the proposal
for an immediate ceasefire between the warring groups.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan leaders also briefed Inderfurth about the
possibilities of convening a Loya Jirga (grand assembly of people)
and the role of the former Afghan monarch, Zahir Shah, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth Wednesday exchanged views with NWFP Governor Arif
Bangash and Chief Minister Mehtab Ahmed Khan on the matters of
mutual interests, including the current Afghan situation,
narcotics and terrorism, they said.
</P>
<P>
Governor Bangash informed the U.S. delegation about the efforts
taken by Pakistan for the eradication of narcotics and reduction
in poppy cultivation in the tribal areas to achieve a zero level
of poppy growing by 2000.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, Bangash said, Pakistan is concerned about
the return of normalcy to the war-torn country which will enable
the millions of Afghan refugees to go back to their country.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the government's firm commitment to oppose
and arrest terrorism.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Inderfurth, NWFP Chief Minister Ahmed
Khan said the NWFP government is faced with a number of challenges
and difficulties, especially the economic pressure on the social
sector because of the presence of a large number of Afghan
refugees in the province.
</P>
<P>
The NWFP government is keenly desired for an early restoration
of peace in Afghanistan to enable the Afghan refugees to go back
to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the success of Pakistan in its efforts to curb
poppy cultivation especially in NWFP, Mehtab said, "we are not
only fulfilling our international commitment but also feel bound
to get rid of this curse as our own moral and national
obligation."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, because of our firm commitments and concerted
efforts, we have achieved tremendous success in this connection,"
said the chief minister.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that there is a dire need for making continued
and sustained efforts in social sector development and poverty
alleviation in the poppy growing areas.
</P>
<P>
Mehtab said that drug trafficking is also becoming a major
issue of the day and Pakistan is focusing its efforts on further
improvement and strengthening of law enforcing agencies.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth said that the U.S. government is fully supporting
the efforts by the government of Prime Minister Nawaz sharif for
the promotion of peace and harmony in this region especially for
the improvement of relations with neighboring India.

<HEADLINE> Korean Businessman Murdered in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The head of Korean motor
giant Daewoo's South African branch was killed in front of his
residence in Johannesburg Tuesday night, South African Press
Association reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo Motor South Africa President Yong Koo Kwon was found
dead behind the wheel of his dark green Daewoo at the gate of a
guest house in the up market Johannesburg suburb of Sandton at
3:00 a.m. (0100 GMT) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He had been shot in the head through the window on the driver's
side. Nothing was taken from the car or from him, South African
police said.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were treating the case as a hijacking, but the
 possibility of an assassination was not ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Kwon, 49, had just returned from a dinner appointment with
South Korean Ambassador to South Africa, Young Sun Kim at about
10:30 p.m. (2030 GMT) Tuesday when he was shot. Police said he
was apparently shot while waiting for the remote controlled
security gate to open.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the killing, South Korean Embassy spokesman Chong
Kim said that safety was a very important consideration for South
Korean companies, and Kwon's murder could slow down the investment
from his country in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This incident can have a negative effect on Korean business
activities in South Africa. Crime is a deterrent to foreign
investment and the victim in this case is unfortunately a
high-profile figure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Flags at Daewoo offices across South Africa were flown at half
mast on Wednesday in honor of Kwon, who came to South Africa just
over a year ago as the southern African head of the company.
</P>
<P>
He presided over local auto importing and sales, and ran the
company's electronics, earth-moving and trading operations.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo Motor South Africa has been operating in the country for
two and a half years. Its imports account for 3.5 percent of the
car market in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Daimler Benz' financial director, Erich Ellmer, was
killed in front of his home in Sandton, Johannesburg, in an
attempted hijacking. His death sparked an international outcry.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabian Ambassador to South Africa, S M Al-Zeidan,
escaped unhurt from a hijacking last May.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Scientists Make Mice Produce Human Sperm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in Japan claimed to
have made rats and mice produce human sperm, the BBC reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The team at the Tottori University, Japan, said that they
implanted spermatogonia, the human cells responsible for producing
sperm into rat and mice testes in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The spermatogonia were taken from 18 infertile human patients
and used in 10 rats and eight mice. Five months later human sperm
was detected in the animals.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have sent a letter to the Japan Society of
Obstetrics and Gynecology asking permission to see if the sperm
can fertilize human eggs, the BBC said.
</P>
<P>
However, the researchers said that there was much work ahead
before it could be applied to humans.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rules Out Change in Afghan Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Wednesday ruled
out any change in its Afghan policy and reiterated its support to
the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Taliban's senior official in charge of
foreign affairs Maulvi Jalil Akhund, Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz renewed his country's policy to the militia, according
to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Jalil arrived here Wednesday from Taliban's stronghold of
Kandahar for talks with visiting U.S. Under Secretary of State
Karl Inderfurth, which is expected to be held Thursday with a
focus on Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Osama was accused by the United States of involving in the
bombings of U.S. embassies in African last year in which about 200
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
presided over a high level meeting Monday which exclusively
discussed the situation in Afghanistan and decided to continue the
present Afghan policy.
</P>
<P>
"Inderfurth has been given special briefing on the latest
situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan's diplomatic efforts for the
restoration of peace in the war-shattered country," said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
"The United States raised the issue of Osama bin Laden and
renewed concern over his fresh threats to Americans, seeking
Pakistan's support for his extradition from Afghanistan," the
source said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton raised the Osama's issue with Nawaz
Sharif during his visit to Washington in December last year.
However, the Pakistani side expressed inability to influence the
Taliban to extradite the Saudi millionaire.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban have rejected the U.S. call for Osama's
extradition, saying the Saudi millionaire is a guest of the Afghan
nation.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Kurdish Rebel Leader Not in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to Turkey
Aleksander Lebedev said here Wednesday that Abdullah Ocalan, the
leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), is not in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Lebedev made the statement after being summoned to the Turkish
Foreign Ministry to give information on the whereabouts of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported Tuesday that Ocalan
may have returned to Russia where he had gone from Syria
last October after Turkey threatened attacks against Syria if
the latter supported the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy
Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu, Lebedev told reporters that he has
got no new information from Russia, but promised to give any new
information he will get to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that, accompanied by Italian policemen, Ocalan
left his villa in the town of Infernetto, 30 kilometers south of
Rome and took a plane from Rome's military airport Ciampino to
Moscow on January 16.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who had been sought after by Turkey, was arrested in
Rome on November 12 last year after arriving on a flight from
Moscow under international arrest warrants issued by Germany and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Germany said later that it will not seek extradition
of Ocalan for fear of sparking unrest between its own Kurdish
and Turkish immigrnats.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Italy and Turkey rifted after Italy rejected
Turkey's extraditon request on account of the Italian law, which
forbids extradition to countries where the death penalty is in
force.

<HEADLINE> China Supports Reform of U.N. Security Council: Hu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said here Wednesday that his country favors reforming the
United Nations Security Council and that the reform must follow
the principle of regional balance.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who will end his visit Thursday, made the remarks in an
interview with South African media in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
He said since the birth of the U.N. more than 50 years ago, the
biggest change in the world has been that many Asian and African
countries have gained independence and joined the world
organization.
</P>
<P>
"These countries are playing an increasingly important role in
international affairs and any reform of the Security Council must
reflect this change," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"China stands that the possible expansion of the council should
follow the principle of regional balance," he said, adding that a
balance between developed countries and developing ones must be
ensured.
</P>
<P>
He said China treasures the important role of African
countries, including South Africa, in the affairs of the U.N. and
understands the aspirations of African nations to be more
representative in the council.
</P>
<P>
"We believe, on the basis of public, extensive and in-depth
consultations, the wishes of African countries will come true," Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
China believes that the active participation of African
countries in the international affairs will be conducive to
safeguarding the interests of developing countries and to
promoting world peace and development, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Hu arrived in South Africa Sunday for a four-day official
visit.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM, FM to Meet With Jordan's Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon will go to
Amman on Sunday and meet Jordan's Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Talal.
</P>
<P>
Sharon told reporters in Jerusalem on Wednesday that the
purpose of the visit is to strengthen the bilateral relationship
with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel wants to continue the good relations
with Jordan after Abdullah, Jordanian King Hussein's eldest son,
was named the crown prince last week.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Jordan is a very important country in
the region, describing Jordan as "the corner stone for the peace
and stability in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that King Hussein, who is under treatment of cancer in
the United State, will recover soon.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan signed a peace agreement in 1994. Since
then, Israel has considered Jordan as its closest ally in the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a Jordanian official as saying that the
scheduled meeting was first requested by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Abdullah agreed to meet with Israeli leaders is a
signal that he plans to continue his father's policies and
maintain good relations with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao People Pin High Hopes on Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- With the process of applying for
admission into the Selection Committee well under way, many Macao
residents have voiced their high expectations on the novel head of
Macao to be elected soon.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee, which will be composed of 200
permanent residents of Macao, is expected to elect the first chief
executive of the Macao Special Administration Region (SAR) around
the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
Up to 7:00 p.m. on Thursday, 1,779 Macao people from various
social sectors have asked for application sheets since the
registration began on January 26.
</P>
<P>
Those who claimed application sheets have expressed their high
expectations for the Selection Committee and the first chief
executive of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances of economic depression and the lack of
a long-term development program in the current government, the
first chief executive should map out a long-range goal for local
economic growth in an enterprising spirit," Kou Hoi In, member of
Macao's Legislative Assembly, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Macao should maintain close ties with China's
inland areas as well as countries of the European Union in an
effort to attract more human and material resources.
</P>
<P>
Chui Sai Peng, vice chairman of the Macao Association for
Science and Technology Promotion, said that he expected the future
chief executive "to handle certain affairs with just manner,
scientific method and professional viewpoint".
</P>
<P>
As Macao is small and there are strong personal connections,
the chief executive should strive to make things more systematized
and standardized, Chui said, explaining that fair competition has
become a universal trend around the world.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Selection Committee should, in their turn, put
aside personal favor and cast their sacred votes for the chief
executive candidate who has authentic competence, so that the
concept of "Macao people governing Macao" can be actually carried
out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Different from the case of Hong Kong's return to the motherland,
there will be a large number of Macao-born Portuguese, who will
remain working and living in the Macao SAR after the handover on
December. Many of them expect the chief executive to treat them
fairly like Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"The chief executive must be competent, experienced and
accepted by the public, and is able to guide Macao toward
prosperity and stability," said Paulina Y. Alves Santos, a Macao-
born Portuguese lady.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she expressed the hope that the chief
executive should have no bias toward people of different ethnic
origin and employ persons in accordance with their competence.

quarter-finals of the 1990 World Cup in Italy and who is now coach
of Austrian side Sturm Graz.

<HEADLINE> Romania Urges Political Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Romania called for a
negotiated political settlement on the crisis in the Serbian
province of Kosovo, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
As stated in the Ministry's communique Thursday, Romania, as a
close neighbor of Yugoslavia, shares an earnest hope that the
Kosovo crisis could receive "a quick and prolonged settlement" by
political means.
</P>
<P>
The communique reaffirmed Romania's position that welcomed the
Contact Group's decision--made in London last month--to summon
warring Serbs and ethnic Albanians to peace talks in France on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry stressed that Romania will do its utmost
to join the peace initiative on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Both Romanian President Emil Constantinescu and Foreign
Minister Andrei Plesu have reportedly sent separate letters to
their Yugoslav counterparts Slobodan Milosevic and Zivorad
Jovanovic, urging them to attend the talks in Rambouillet,
southwest of Paris.
</P>
<P>
The letters were delivered following the Romanian president's
and foreign minister's meeting with the Yugoslav ambassador to
Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group in charge of Balkans diplomacy threatened
that it could resort to force unless the concerned parties present
at the talks reach a consensus on a peaceful solution to the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, made up of France, Germany, Italy, Russia,
the United Kingdom, and the United States, asked the Kosovo
Liberation Army to attend the peace talks, but denied them a veto
right.

<HEADLINE> Canadians' Medical Data Should Be on Computer, Panel Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- An expert panel has suggested
that the medical data of every Canadian be computerized so they
can get quick and effective treatment and avoid wasting money.
</P>
<P>
The 24-member panel made the suggestion in a report presented
to federal Health Minister Allan Rock on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
All medical records in the country are now kept on paper and
could be scattered among various doctors' offices and hospitals
depending on where someone has received medical care, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
They are often handwritten, sometimes difficult to read, and
can be difficult to get after normal business hours.
</P>
<P>
As a result, emergency-room doctors often have to treat
patients without knowing their history or what medication they are
taking. They often end up repeating expensive tests, said Dr. Tom
Noseworthy, one of the co-chairs of the panel.
</P>
<P>
However, in recommending quick computer access to medical
records, the panel acknowledged there are serious privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
The panel said that privacy legislation in all jurisdictions
should be brought up to a minimum standard to ensure the security
of new computerized medical files.
</P>
<P>
It said encryption and electronic security systems should be
used to make sure medical records are not obtained by people who
have no right to see them.
</P>
<P>
Rock endorsed the report Wednesday, and said he would speak
to the federal cabinet about it. He hinted there may be money in
the federal budget for some of its recommendations.

<HEADLINE> Job Openings Dwindle Significantly in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A paper published Thursday by
a government department shows that job openings dwindled
significantly in Singapore in 1998 and the reduction affected all
occupational groups and sectors.
</P>
<P>
The paper, prepared by the Manpower Research and Statistics
Department with an aim to analyses job vacancy situation in 1998
and highlight changes in trend in recent years, says job openings
dropped to an unprecedented low in the city-state in 1998 and this
is a good indicator of labor market tightness.
</P>
<P>
The paper says the private sector establishments with at least
25 employees only reported 15,465 job vacancies in September 1998,
only about a third of the level recorded in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Job vacancies can arise from staff turnover, retirement or
business expansion and formation. Over the preceding five years
the September vacancies had averaged more than 40,000 in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Using another expression, the paper says, the vacancy rate
(i.e. vacancies expressed as percentage of the total staff demand)
fell sharply to an all time low of 1.5 percent in September 1998
compared with 4.4 percent in 1997 and the peak of 5.4 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The findings contained in the paper point to marked reductions
in job vacancies in all occupational groups and sectors. Among the
three broad occupational groups, the drop in vacancy was most
pronounced for production &AMP; related employees, being its lowest of
1.4 percent although the group remains the bulk of the job
openings.
</P>
<P>
The rate for professional, technical &AMP; managerial employees was
also low at 1.5 percent, reflecting slow demand as well as
availability of such personnel due to increasing supply of new
tertiary graduates.
</P>
<P>
The clerical, sales &AMP; services personnel registered a highest
vacancy rate of 1.9 percent as more and more students choose to
pursue higher education, thus limiting supply of such workers.
</P>
<P>
Along with the shift of the economy towards more capital
intensive and knowledge-based industries, the share of job
vacancies for higher skilled workers has increased over the time.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15,465 job vacancies in September 1998, 27 percent were
for professional, technical &AMP; managerial personnel, up from 14
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Both the Singapore government and its people are concerned
about the labor market situation. About 27,000 people were
retrenched last year, 35 percent more than in the last recession
in 1985 when almost 20,000 were laid off.
</P>
<P>
In its paper published on January 22, 1999, the same
department proposed an "flexible work arrangements" with a view to
expand employment.
</P>
<P>
The proposed arrangements range from conventional part-time
working to high technology teleworking, including part-time
working, temporary working, flexitime working, annualized-hours
working, job sharing, term-time working, homeworking and
teleworking.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Salt Lake City is taking
steps to replace its leadership for the 2002 Olympic Games, but
Robert Graff, chairman of the Slat Lake Organizing Committee said
the job has not been offered so far.
</P>
<P>
"No job offer has been made," Graff said. "If we find a
franchise candidate, someone whose qualities and qualifications
are overwhelming, then we will present his or her name to the
board."
</P>
<P>
Mitt Romney, a businessman and politician, has been said
reported as one of the candidates for the position.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of SLOC's board of trustees has been called for
Tuesday or February 11. Romney's name could be presented then, but
the primary purpose of the meeting is to hear the report of the
ethics panel investigating the scandal surrounding the bid for the
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
On January 8, SLOC president Frank Joklik and vice president
Dave Johnon resigned.
</P>
<P>
The board is likely to be reorganized in the wake of the ethics
report. The inquiry began after the SLOC acknowledged making
scholarship payments to relatives of six International Olympic
Committee members and reports of lavish gift-giving and other
improprieties.
</P>
<P>
Romney, 51, considered to be the leading candidate to replace
Joklik, declined comment Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Proposes Stable 2000 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
proposed a stable union-wide budget for the year 2000, which is
expected to go through approval formalities by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Erkki Liikanen, the European commissioner in charge of
budgetary affairs, told the press that the year 2000 budget would
mean stabilization of expenditures and commitments.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first budget within a new financial framework
that is still being negotiated among European Union member states,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure level on the Common Agricultural Policy is
guaranteed to remain the same as it was in 1999, with a total of
40 billion euros (45.2 billion U.S. dollars) while the budget on
structural funds for aiding poorer regions within the union would
also remain stable with a total of 37.3 billion euros (42.1
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Agriculture takes half of the EU's annual budget in the form of
subsidies to farmers and agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposed increases, however, for funds for
internal policies and external actions, especially funding
programs aimed at countries now applying for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
A four percent increase was proposed for funding internal
policies. But the budget didn't give specific figures concerning
external cooperation; it said funding would increase "
substantially."
</P>
<P>
The executive body of the 15-nation European Union promised in
the budget to step-up cooperation with EU's closest neighbors in
the Euro-Mediterranean area, and with the republics of the former
Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Tung Says His Visit Rewarding, Useful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China said here
Thursday evening that his trip to the World Economic Forum and
Israel was rewarding and useful.
</P>
<P>
Meeting reporters shortly after returning to Hong Kong after
attending the World Economic Forum and visiting Israel, the chief
executive said the annual World Economic Forum provided a very
good opportunity for Hong Kong to explain to the world how
everything was going on since the handover 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he was happy with the fact that the government
officials and business leaders at the forum all spoke highly of
Hong Kong's operation over the past 18 months and expressed
confidence in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Tung told the press that the purpose of the Israel trip "was
really to see why and how Israel over such a short time has become
so successful." He added that he spent a lot of time with not only
senior government officials but the high-tech talents in that
country.
</P>
<P>
"We did some research and we knew that, for instance, the
Israeli defense industry must have assisted the rapid development
in the area of technology and the Russian immigrants must have
contributed to the success of Israel. We were there to understand
what the government did to facilitate this rapid development,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We already have our own vision for Hong Kong... and the
purpose of the trip was to make sure our vision was right and the
way to implement it. There might be some good ideas coming out of
the visit and in fact, the visit has been very helpful," he said.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada To Cut More Jobs in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada has launched a
company-wide cost-cutting campaign that will eliminate another 450
jobs this year.
</P>
<P>
The company has already cut 1,275 of its 22,850 jobs since the
seasonal peak last summer.
</P>
<P>
Lamar Durrett, Air Canada's president and chief executive
officer, hoped the cost-cutting campaign would cut annual costs by
200 million Canadian dollars (132 million dollars) over three
years.
</P>
<P>
While a crippling pilot strike in September last year was
serious, it masked a sharp downturn in Air Canada's fortunes this
year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
A combination of high costs, a roller-coaster airline economy
and over-enthusiastic growth projections would have given the
company a merely average year, even without the strike, they said.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the 13-day pilot strike cut operating
profit by 250 million Canadian dollars (165 million U.S. dollars)
and net profit by 155 million Canadian dollars (102 million
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Discusses Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (parliament)
started a special session Thursday afternoon to discuss a
troubled 1999 state budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the coalition factions
have discussed the state budget and economic arrangement bills and
it is not immediately known whether they have reached agreements
on their budget demands.
</P>
<P>
The United Torah Judaism (UTJ), Shas and the National Religious
Party (NRP) demand an extra of 250 million U.S. dollars to the
proposed 53.75-billion-dollar-budget for schooling, housing,
settlement expansions in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, also acting as finance minister, held urgent
meetings with ministry and budgetary officials Wednesday night in
a bid to win their support for the extra demand by the coalition
parties.
</P>
<P>
But the officials said that the extra demand may lead to a
breakdown in the budget framework and cancellation of many
national infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
It will also mean a deepening of the economic slowdown and an
increase in unemployment, they added.
</P>
<P>
Voting on the budget is expected to begin at midnight if the
disagreements can be solved.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Labor and Meretz parties planned to
filibuster the budget vote, protesting against the government's
intention to give permission to an illegal radio station in the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Due to internal conflicts in the coalition, the 1999 state
budget bill failed to pass through the Knesset last December.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states
have registered a real growth of about 1.3 percent in 1998 despite
the recession in the energy sector due to the sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Independent estimates indicated that gross domestic product of
the Gulf economies increased to some 235 billion U.S. dollars in
real prices last year, compared with about 232 billion dollars in
1997, the Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
GAZA -- The Palestinian Ministry of Tourism has announced that
as of mid-February, the Gaza international airport will receive
foreign planes carrying tourists to Palestinian sites.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Undersecretary of Tourism Abdullah Higazi said that
flights from Morocco, the U.S., Italy, Turkey and Russia will
carry tourists to visit Palestinian religious and archeological
sites, the Al Hayat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Palestinian tourism ministry is seeking to
enhance its ties in tourist industry with all countries,
particularly Arab and Islamic states.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- The state-owned Algerian Oil and Gas Company has
said that its net profits in 1998 dropped by 27 percent to 83
billion dinars (1.43 billion dollars), compared with a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the company Wednesday said that its total
trade volume dropped by about 30 percent to 640 billion dinars
(about 11.3 billion dollars) despite a 4 percent increase in
exports.
</P>
<P>
The results reveal the impact of the sagging world oil prices
on the oil and gas industry in Algeria, a member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Algeria's OPEC-fixed crude production quota stands at 788,000
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Secretary General of the Gulf Industrial
Consultative Organization Abdul Rahman Al Jaafari has disclosed
that the spinning and weaving industry in the GCC member states is
"to play an effective role" in the economic development of these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jaafari said Wednesday that a survey worked out by his
organization showed that there were 400 such factories operating
in the GCC member states in 1997, with the investment totaling
767 million dollars, employing 60,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the spinning and weaving industry became
global in a short time through the export of ready-to-wear clothes
at competitive prices to markets in the U.S, Canada and the
European Union member countries.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan President Call for Settlement on Energy Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February (Xinhua) -- Moldovan President Petru
Lucinschi called here Thursday for emergency measures to resolve
the country's energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
The power predicament is the result of a decision by Russia's
gas monopoly Gazprom, Moldova's major source of energy, to cut its
gas supply to Moldova in half this month to press for immediate
payment of the 439 million dollars owed for gas.
</P>
<P>
Lucinschi urged the department of energy to pay the money in
arrears to Gazprom as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
But only few enterprises and individuals can afford to pay the
costly debts, said Valentin Dolganiuc, deputy prime minister of
Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Power shortages in Moldova have crippled government
institutions, hospitals, banks, telecommunication services and
public transportation.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans to Shine in South Africa's Road Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A strong Kenyan road race
team have reached South Africa to take part in Saturday's 15-
kilometer international race in the coastal city of Port Elizabeth,
South African Press Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural FBC Fidelity Bank race will also draw commitments
of marathon stars from Ethiopia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Russia,
Germany and etc..
</P>
<P>
The Kenyans are renowned for their team tactics and with a
large squad of eight world class runners in the race, the odds are
in their favor to produce the winner on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Former world half marathon champion Shem Kororia and current
world 10km record holder, Joseph Kimani, are the red hot favorites.
</P>
<P>
Kororia outsprinted the great Moses Tanui to win the 1997 world
championships in the 21.1km race in a time of 59:56, which made
him one of only three runners world wide to break 60 minutes mark
for the distance.
</P>
<P>
Kimani, on the other hand, has laid claim to the world 10km
best of 27:20 and the unofficial world best for 15km, with a time
of 42:04 set on a point to point course.
</P>
<P>
Concluding the Kenyan juggernaut are Joseph Kamau, Godfrey
Kiprotich, Hezron Otwori, Julius Kimutai, Stephen Kiogora and Ben
Kimondiu.
</P>
<P>
The one who could upset the Kenyan applecart is Ethiopian Worku
Bekila, who has the second fastest time in history for both the 10
km and 15km distances.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Ethiopian's 15km time of 42:20 is just seven
seconds shy of the world mark set by Paul Tergat of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
South Africans also present a formidable challenge to the race
title, with Gert Thys, Simon Morolong and Abner Chipu the top
contenders.
</P>
<P>
Thys, the current world half marathon champion, has finished in
the top five at the last two world half marathon championships,
while Morolong has recorded a 10km best of 28:00.
</P>
<P>
Other competitors include Russian Dmitriy Kapitonov and German
Michael Fietz, both 61 minute half marathoners, Lesotho's
Commonwealth Games gold medalist Thabiso Moqhali.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Calls For Peaceful Settlement for Kashmir Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minster Sartaj Aziz
Thursday reaffirmed Pakistan's position on the Jammu and Kashmir
dispute with India, calling for "a just and peaceful settlement on
the basis of the relevant U.N. resolutions".
</P>
<P>
During a press briefing at the Foreign Office on the occasion
of "Kashmir Solidarity Day" falling on Friday, Aziz said Pakistan
continues its lasting efforts to draw concerns over the Jammu and
Kashmir dispute from the international community.
</P>
<P>
"We have made every effort for a just and peaceful settlement
on the basis of the relevant U.N. resolutions that provide both
the legal context and framework for a viable solution of the
dispute," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"We have welcomed offers of third party involvement as well as
agreed to settle it under the Simla Agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N resolutions on the Jammu and Kashmir issue provide for
self-determination of the Kashmiri people through a referendum.
</P>
<P>
"The nuclearization of South Asia by India has transformed this
dispute into a nuclear flash point," said Aziz, adding that the
present status quo of instability and tensions in Jammu and
Kashmir "is fraught with dangers for the peoples of South Asia and
beyond."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretaries of the two countries will hold their
next meeting this month in New Delhi, Aziz said, stressing the
talks has to deal with "the substance of the issue to find a
peaceful and lasting settlement of this dispute."
</P>
<P>
He urged India to demonstrate "the requisite will" to
meaningfully address the Jammu and Kashmir issue rather than use
the dialogue process as "a ruse to divert international focus from
the region."
</P>
<P>
Aziz also called on the international community to shoulder
their "important responsibilities" for the settlement of the
Kashmir dispute, because "the objectives of nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament and restraint and stabilization
regimes cannot be achieved in the absence of an over-arching
environment of durable peace and stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
The responsibilities of the international community is to
"oblige India to fulfill its commitment to hold a plebiscite in
Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the U.N. resolutions,"
according to Aziz.
</P>
<P>
In its efforts of seeking third-party mediations, Pakistan made
the latest appeal to the United States when Strobe Talbott, U.S.
deputy secretary of state, visited Islamabad Monday for the eighth
round of bilateral talks on non-proliferation and security.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, however, said only both Pakistan and India accept the
United States as a mediator could it involve in the dispute.

<HEADLINE> EU to Permit Parliamentary Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
agreed to cooperate with a European Parliamentary committee by
allowing them to supervise their work, said a commission press
release on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The promise was made during a meeting on Wednesday by
commission chief Jacques Santer with the people selected to serve
in the parliamentary Committee of Independent Experts.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee was established after the European
Parliament tried in vain to censure the entire commission for
alleged fraud and mis-management.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, promised to authorize and encourage its personnel to fully
cooperate with the committee by releasing them from their normal "
obligations of reserve and discretion" for the purposes of the
commission's work.
</P>
<P>
One of the commission staff was suspended from his post for six
months for divulging information linked to commission mis-
management to outsiders last October.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Santer told the parliamentary
committee members: "The lifting of the "obligations of reserve and
discretion" is a very major and unprecedented action by the
commission. It demonstrates our full-hearted commitment to
maximizing the effectiveness of the work of the commission."
</P>
<P>
Though the parliamentary censure, the European version of an
impeachment, did not get past the parliamentary ballot, the
presidency of the commission was rocked by the political attempt.
</P>
<P>
Different interests have already started touting their
candidates for the commission presidency, which is scheduled to be
selected in June this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The seasonally-adjusted

dropped to 9.8 percent and 10.8 percent respectively last December,
a report from the Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the
European community said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were 13.8 million men and women unemployed in the euro

Spain, going from 20.1 percent to 18.2 percent. The jobless rate
also posted a big decrease in neighboring Portugal, where it
dropped from 6.1 percent to 4.4 percent, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Unveils World Heritage Site Plaque in Sundarbans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Thursday unveiled the world heritage plaque in the
Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a call
for saving the wonder of the nature at any cost, the official BSS
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage Committee of the UNESCO (the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) last year
designated the mangrove forest for inclusion in the world heritage
list under its natural heritage criteria.
</P>
<P>
The Sundarbans world heritage site is composed of south and
west wildlife sanctuaries, with the site's total area of 1,400
square kilometers, out of which 910 sq. km is land area and 490
sq. km is water area.
</P>
<P>
Hasina stressed the need for preserving, development and
expansion of the nation's culture and heritage's. "We must make
efforts to preserve the natural resources of the country including
the Sundarbans and project those to the world community."
</P>
<P>
The Sundarbans, a nature's beauty, "is not only our pride, but
also of the world," and "we must preserve it and develop it at any
cost," she said.
</P>
<P>
The government has already approved the bio-diversity
conservation project at a cost of 3.8 billion taka (78.4 million
U.S. dollars) to manage the various resources of the Sundarbans,
she stated, adding that a plan to develop ecological tourism for
enjoying its natural beauty and its wildlife is also under
implementation.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sundarbans is on the verge of extinction, and it
was going to lose its glory due to excessive extraction of forest
resources and killing of wildlife, she pointed out, saying "we
have to preserve it."

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Senate Democrats vowed to wage an "aggressive battle to keep
witnesses off the floor and prevent any finding of presidential
misconduct while Republicans struggled among themselves over how
to bring President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial to an
appropriate end.
</P>
<P>
-- Top Pentagon officials told members of Congress that any
American participation in the still-uncertain NATO peacekeeping
effort would be limited to a few thousand soldiers, but probably
would last at least three years.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat met in Washington to discuss Israeli security
concerns. Arafat said Palestinians were still discussing whether
to declare statehood on May 4.
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations ordered its two remaining American staff
members in Iraq to leave after Baghdad warned that it could not
guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Adrift in a steady stream of robust economic reports, Wall
Street economists are steering their forecasts almost by instinct,
as traditional guides prove less than reliable. For corporations
that rely on economic forecasting to allocate resources, betting
on instinct can be a very hard sell.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the Asian financial crisis, the Philippines turned
in an impressive export performance last year. The latest
government figures show that shipments overseas grew 17 percent in
1998 to $29.49 billion.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Welcomes Vajpayee's Visit: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz
said Thursday Islamabad will welcome Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan on the inaugural cross border
bus service.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between political leaders of the two countries can be
a stimulus for bilateral dialogue for the settlement of all
outstanding issues, Aziz said during a press briefing at the
Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about Pakistan's reaction to Vajpayee's
plan to visit Pakistan on the inaugural cross border bus service,
Aziz said, "he will be welcomed."
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif immediately
responded Wednesday that Vajpaee is welcome to come "because we
want to have interaction at the political level."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the visit will give an opportunity to the two leaders
to review the progress of dialogue at the foreign secretary level
and see whether it needs to be given impetus from the political
level in one form or the other.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also recalled the two prime ministers' meeting at the U.N.
General Assembly in September last year and said they reaffirmed
their interest in resolving all disputes including the Jammu and
Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
"So if they can meet again in the near future, it will
certainly be a stimulus and hopefully will improve the prospects
of the success of the dialogue," said Aziz.

<HEADLINE> Top Dane Shuttlers Tag China As Biggest Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Denmark's Peter Gade and Camilla
Martin, world top two men's singles shuttlers, were feeling
confident to take on the best of Asia in this month's Baiduri
World Grand Prix Finals in Brunei, a IBF statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Gade, the current world No.1 ranked player for almost 12 months,
said in a press conference: "It's a very big goal for me to win
the World Grand Prix Finals. It's an event I've never won and of
course with the very best in the world competing."
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready and well prepared for this event and if I'm ever
going to win I feel it will be this year," said Martin, ranked
second in world, who was equally positive for the Finals, which is
to take place in Brunei on February 24-28.
</P>
<P>
It was 15 years ago Morten Frost, the only one European who had
ever won the World Grand Prix Finals, took the men's singles title,
while the women's title has never been taken outside China and
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
This year, the biggest concern comes from China.
</P>
<P>
"The China is always my biggest threat," the 24-year-old Martin
said. "But there are only five Chinese players qualified this year,
compared to seven last year."
</P>
<P>
Gade, 22, agreed Martin's worries of Chinese though he added: "
Much depends on the draw of course, but there are players like
Indonesia's Hendrawan, who hasn't been seen for two or three of
the latest tournaments."
</P>
<P>
"He's a player who can really spring surprise and could be a
big threat," Gade added.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Finals have never been played outside Asia
did not worry the Danes. "We're so used to play in Asia that we
know what to expect now. We know what the heat is like and which
foods and drink to avoid," Gade said.
</P>
<P>
Martin, who has never won in Jakarta, was satisfied that the
tournament was to be played in Brunei. "The fact that the event
has moved away from Jakarta will help me. I just feel very
positive about it."
</P>
<P>
The Finals has the biggest prize-fund in badminton of 300,000 U.
S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Economic Cooperation Conference Resolves to Liberalize Intra-regional Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The third SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) Economic Cooperation
Conference ended here Thursday, resolving to liberalize trade
among member countries.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, organized by the Federation of
Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), "has
resolved to submit... resolutions regarding trade to the SAARC
Secretariat and the member governments, as consensus decisions of
the entire business community," said a press release distributed
at a news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
With regard to non-tariff barriers, market access should be
given to all items and commodities originating from within SAARC
by SAARC member states, eliminating all import restrictions, with
exceptions to be made in the case of "sensitive" items for each
country, the release said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of tariff barriers, products are to be put into
primary, intermediate, and finished products, which are to be
treated differently, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
Non-least developed countries (non-LDCs) of the region, such as
India, should establish zero tariffs on imports of all primary
products and unprocessed minerals, while least developed countries
(LDCs) within the bloc may impose a levy of up to 10 percent to be
gradually phased out to zero tariffs over five years' time.
</P>
<P>
For intermediate products, non-LDCs should reduce tariffs on
imports by 25 percent on the existing duty and to establish zero
tariffs within four years from the year 2000, while LDCs like
Bangladesh should reduce tariffs on imports by 17.5 percent each
year to establish zero tariffs within six years from 2000.
</P>
<P>
Non-LDCs should reduce tariffs on imports on finished goods by
20 percent each year to establish zero tariffs within five years
from 2000, while LDCs reduce tariffs on imports by 12.5 percent a
year to establish zero tariffs within eight years from 2000.
</P>
<P>
For purposes of preferential tariff concessions, the conference
recommended that the rules of origin be adjusted so that local
content of the exports for intra-SAARC trade would be 30 percent
for LDCs and 40 percent for non-LDCs, and 50 percent for
cumulative regional content for non-LDCs and 40 percent for LDCs.
</P>
<P>
The conference also emphasized the need for a regional
agreement on investment promotion and protection, which shall
include avoidance of double taxation, easy repatriation of
profits, national treatment of joint ventures from members states,
and an arbitration mechanism for the settlement of business
disputes.
</P>
<P>
It proposed for "immediate implementation" a motor-vehicular
agreement between at least five of SAARC's seven members which are
connected by road, to facilitate goods transportation without
transshipment and to increase intra-regional trade.
</P>
<P>
More than one-fifth of the world's population live in South
Asia, but the share of the region in the world trade is less than
1 percent and intra-regional trade is only 3 percent of its total
trade, according to FBCCI President Abdul Awal Mintoo.
</P>
<P>
As 90 percent of the imports of the South Asian countries come
from outside, there is immense potential for promoting
intra-regional economic interaction, Tofail Ahmed, Bangladeshi
commerce and industries minister, said at the inaugural session on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About the possibility of a single currency for South Asia,
President of the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kantikumar
R. Podar told reporters that it would take at least 10 years to
achieve that goal, considering the political and economic
differences among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the creation of a "limited currency" in the form of
coupons to facilitate transportation from one country to another
within the region.

<HEADLINE> IRA Says Weapons "Stolen" by Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
has admitted that it is investigating the theft of weapons from
its stockpiles of arms by former members of the organization.
</P>
<P>
An IRA statement, published in Thursday's edition of the
Republican News, confirmed that a "small" quantity of weapons was
"secretly misappropriated" by defectors before they left a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Some of the weapons have reportedly been recovered, but the
unprecedented public acknowledgment of the incident has
dramatically underlined increasing tensions within the Republican
movement.
</P>
<P>
The IRA statement accused dissidents of attempting to "derail
our investigations," saying that "those involved have recently
visited the homes of some republican supporters and their families.
"
</P>
<P>
The statement came at a time when further political progress is
on hold, with the mainstream paramilitary organizations refusing
to hand over any weapons. It seems certain to add to a general
sense of unease over the stability of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The issue of decommissioning continues to be a major stumbling
block in the implementation of Northern Ireland's Good Friday
peace agreement. No paramilitary weapons have been handed over
voluntarily to date, apart from a token gesture by the small
loyalist group.

<HEADLINE> Pak Leaders Reaffirms Support for Kashmiri People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- President Rafique Tarar said
Thursday the observance of "Kashmir Solidarity Day" is a mark to
"extend unequivocal support of Pakistan to the legitimate struggle
of the Kashmiri people for their right of self-determination."
</P>
<P>
In his message issued on the occasion of "Kashmir Solidarity
Day" falling on Friday, Tarar said that for the past fifty years
India has sought through force to keep Kashmiri people imprisoned
in their own homeland.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir people have been denied their right to
self-determination in accordance with their wishes as stipulated
by the relevant resolutions by the U.N. Security Council, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan once again condemns Indian atrocities against
Kashmiris and extends it's" unwavering support" to the just cause
of Kashmiris on the occasion of Solidarity Day.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Pakistan's "unflinching and consistent support"
to the just cause of the Kashmir people and vowed to remain
committed to upholding the alienable right of Kashmiris for
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his message the Pakistani
people and the government reaffirm their complete solidarity with
the Kashmir people and full support to their just struggle for
their inalienable right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic events of the last year which saw the
nuclearization of South Asia by India have resulted in renewed
international focus and acknowledgment that the Jammu and Kashmir
dispute remains the root cause of the tensions and hostilities in
the region," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
There is overwhelming recognition that a solution of the
Kashmir issue is imperative for regional peace and security, said
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"It is universally accepted that peace in South Asia is
directly dependent on the final and just settlement of the Jammu
and Kashmir dispute which has now become a nuclear flashpoint,"
the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that since the assumption of the prime
ministership in February 1997, his government sincerely endeavored
to work for an early and just solution of the Jammu and Kashmir
issue.
</P>
<P>
In the resumed bilateral dialogue with India, Pakistan has made
it clear that "the settlement of this core issue in accordance
with the U.N. resolutions is essential for a regional environment
of durable peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of "Kashmir Solidarity Day", Sharif said, "we
demand an immediate end to India's gross and systematic violation
of their fundamental and human rights."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan urged the international community, particularly the
U.N. Security Council to redeem its commitment to the Kashmir
people, he said.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Due to low oil prices, Norway
recorded only a growth of 2 percent in the GDP last year, a report
of Norway Central Statistics Bureau said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Low GDP growth was attributed to the oil and shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
More import and fewer export had a significant influence on
Norway's economy, causing a 8.7 billion kroner(1.1 Billion U.S.
dollar) deficit last year, the first deficit since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Due to reduced oil prices and production, this year's growth
rate in the Norwegian economy is not expected to exceed one

JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Free condoms will be

<P>
From next Monday, free condoms will be up for grabs at taxi
ranks, all- night garages, hospitals, clinics, government
facilities and work places, departmental spokeswoman Nono Simelela
said.
</P>
<P>
The previous practice of distributing free condoms only during
working hours had caused some problems, she said.

<P>
The government had named next week as the national condom week,
and events will be organized all over the country to promote the
use of condoms as one of the best ways to dodge the killer HIV
virus, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She said in time, condoms will also be free at educational
institutions,

nightclubs and shebeens.
</P>
<P>
The departments of health and education were discussing

KUALA LUMPUR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia registered a
significant drop of 28.7 percent in the number of workers
retrenched for the week ending January 30, according to an
official Report on Development of Labor Market issued here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Only 616 workers were retrenched during the week under review,
and this figure was a far cry from 864 retrenchments recorded a
week earlier, Ministry of Human Resources said in its annual
Report on Development of Labor Market.
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively, 86,924 workers were retrenched by 5,025 employers
for the year ending January this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The highest number of retrenched workers during the past year
was recorded by the manufacturing sector, accounting for more than
half of the total, followed by the wholesale and retail trading,
restaurants and hotels (12.4 percent), construction (11.4
percent), financial, insurance, properties and business services
(7.9 percent), agriculture, forestry, livestock and fishery (5
percent) and 3.6 percent from other sectors.
</P>
<P>
On average, the report said, 1,610 workers were retrenched
weekly for the period from February last year through January 31
this year.
</P>
<P>
Various reasons were cited by employers for the retrenchment
and among the popular ones were the reduction in product market,
increase in production costs and organizational restructuring, it
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, for the period of January 1998 to
January 1999, a total of 81,641 job vacancies were reported by
employers to the Labor Offices under the Human Resource
Department.
</P>
<P>
The figure formed only a fraction of all job vacancies
available in the labor market as employers were not required to

<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee showed flexibility to some competent international
sports federations in its final declaration of the World
Conference on Doping in Sport which ended here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minimum required sanction for major doping substances or
prohibited methods shall be a suspension of the athlete from all
competition for a period of two years for a first offence, as set
by the IOC in the declaration.
</P>
<P>
However, based on specific, exceptional circumstances to be
evaluated in the first instance by the competent IF bodies, there
may be a provision for a possible modification of the two-year
sanction.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has set its target of the meeting to uniform a sanction
policy, but the suggestion met opposition from some professional
sports federations, mainly FIFA, the world soccer governing body.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter said Wednesday that the drug
offence should be judged individually.
</P>
<P>
The conference agreed in principle to establish an independent
international anti-doping agency prior to the 2000 Olympic Summer
Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"This institution will have as its mandate, notably, to
coordinate the various programs necessary to realize the
objectives that shall be given in particular to expanding out-of-
competition testing, coordinating research, promoting preventive
and educational actions and harmonizing scientific and technical
standards and procedures for analyses and equipment," said the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, a working group representing the
Olympic Movement, including the athletes, as well as the
governments and inter-governmental organizations concerned, will
meet, on the initiative of the IOC, within three months, to define
the structure, mission and financing of the agency. The Olympic
Movement has committed to allocate a fund of 25 million U.S.
dollars to the agency.
</P>
<P>
The conference also made achievements in following areas:
</P>
<P>
1. Education, prevention and athletes' rights
</P>
<P>
The Olympic oath shall be extended to coaches and other
officials, and shall include the respect of integrity, ethics and
fair play. Complete transparency shall be assured in all
activities to fight doping, except for preserving the
confidentiality necessary to protect fundamental rights of
athletes.
</P>
<P>
2. Olympic Movement anti-doping code
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Movement anti-doping code is accepted as the basis
for the fight against doping, which is defined as the use of an
artifice, whether substance or method, potentially dangerous to
athletes' health and/or capable of enhancing their performances,
or the presence in the athletes' body of a substance, or the
ascertainment of the use of a method on the list annexed to the
Olympic movement medical code.
</P>
<P>
The conference also appealed that collaboration in the fight
against doping between sports organizations and public authorities
shall be reinforced according to the responsibilities of each
party.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Plans Attacks to Help Netanyahu Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Islamic
militant group Hamas were planning terrorist attacks on Israelis
in order to help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu win the
May elections, Israel Radio reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ghazi Jabali, the Palestinian police chief,
as saying that the message was obtained in interrogations of
Hamas activists who were detained early this week.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police have arrested dozens of Hamas activists
after a Palestinian security officer was shot dead by three Hamas
members on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The detainees confessed that they were planning to launch
bombing attacks in the next two weeks to support Israel's
hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Jabali said.
</P>
<P>
They also planned to blast an Israeli bus outside the Jewish
settlement of Kfar Daron in the Gaza Strip, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jabali said he had passed relevant information on to the
Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
In response, David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's top policy adviser,
said the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) had made similar
claims before Israel's elections in 1996, which he described as
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said in a statement
Thursday that his group had no interest in influencing the
Israeli elections, which are to be held on May 17.

<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China, seeking
to defend its top position at the gold medal tally, took three
more golds Thursday to keep the overall lead with 12 at the gold
medal race at the Winter Asiad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Koreans, who are vying for the second rank,
raked in two golds from the men's speed skating and men's slalom
to add up their golds to 10, four ahead of the close rival
Kazakhstan, who won one gold Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is Japan's goalless day as its athletes took three silver
and three bronze medals on the ice and snow, but no gold at all.
</P>
<P>
China bagged all the three golds on the ice of the day. Song Li
revenged a defeat two days ago in the 3,000m race to claim the
women's speed skating 1,500 meters in the Chunchon Outdoor Ice
Rink.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old was timed two minutes 08.66 seconds for the
triumph, beating Japan's Kanae Kobayashi into second in 2:09.68.
Another Japanese Aki Narita, gold medalist of the 3,000 meters
Tuesday, was third by 2.27 seconds behind of Song, who took the 3,
000m bronze.
</P>
<P>
"Song is our new hope for the women's long distance events,"
said Song's coach Liang Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"The winning time is her best personal result, which is just
one step away from the Asian record of 2:07.95 and the Games'
record of 2:08.50 though the two records were set in indoor ice
rinks," Liang added.
</P>
<P>
Song, born in Qiqihar of China's northeast Heilongjiang
Province, began to learn skating at the age of 10. Last month she
won the four golds at the National Winter Games in Changchun,
Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's ice hockey team won an deserving gold medal
after trouncing its last rival Kazakhstan 10-2.
</P>
<P>
The reigning champion kept unbeaten record in the four-team
tournament after it overpowered Japan 6-1 and South Korea 15-1 in
the previous matches.
</P>
<P>
"The gold is not a surprise," said Zhang Zhinan, head coach of
the Chinese Team. "My players did a good job today and deserved
the victory."
</P>
<P>
The third gold Thursday came from the men's singles figure
skating event where Li Chengjiang outperformed other 11 skaters to
win after the free skating program.
</P>
<P>
However, Roman Slornyakov of Uzbekistan edged defending
champion Guo Zhengxing, who ranked second after Wednesday's short
program, with a flawless performance to take the silver away. Guo
picked up the bronze.
</P>
<P>
After two day's gold medals dry, hungering South Korea was
rewarded two golds from its skater and skier.
</P>
<P>
Choi Jae-Bong won the speed skating men's 1,500 meters with a
new Asian record of one minute 56.11 seconds on the Chunchon
Outdoor Ice Rink.
</P>
<P>
He broke the old mark of 1:56.18 set by a Japanese in the 1996
Asian Winter Games in Harbin's indoor ice rink.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old student was followed by his teammate Chun Joo-
hyun in 1:58.04 and Hiromichi Ito of Japan in 1:58.59.
</P>
<P>
Choi, 12th finisher in the 1,500m race at the Nagano Olympics,
skated to his best time of 1:49.49 in Canada in January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hur Seung-wook became the host's hero when he came from behind
to beat Japan's Joji Kawaguchi, winning the men's slalom gold, his
second at the Games.
</P>
<P>
Hur, winner of the Super-G slalom Sunday, skied behind leader
Kawaguchi in 55.15 seconds in the first round, surpassed the
Japanese after he was the best of the second round in 59.53, which
gave him the gold with a combined time of 1:54.68.
</P>
<P>
Kawaguchi had to take the silver in 1:55.00, followed by
another South Korean Choi Moon Sung in 1:56.67.
</P>
<P>
"Our Alpine skiers can win the international matches as Korea
has one of the world's best Alpine slopes like the Rainbow Course
in Yongpyong," Hong added.
</P>
<P>
The Rainbow Course is familiar to Hur as he has trained there
repeatedly over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan was the only other country to win a gold on Thursday.
Andrey Nevzorov and Vladimir Smirnov swept the gold and silver
medals in the men's 30-km cross country, called "marathon on the
snow".
</P>
<P>
Nevzorov won his second and the country's sixth gold medal with
a time of one hour 13 minutes 19.2 seconds. He also took a 4x10
kilometers relay gold with his teammates Tuesday and netted the
bronze in the 15-km event on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Smirnov, 34-year-old Kazakhstan's winter sports legend, took
the silver by 10.8 seconds behind of Nevzorov. Japan's Mitsuo
Horigome stopped Kazakhstan's medals sweep, taking away the bronze
in 1:14:04.9.

<HEADLINE> Appointment of Head of Constitution Commission Is Legal: Philippine President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Thursday that the appointment of former chief justice
Andres Narvasa to head a preparatory commission on amendments to
the Constitution is legal.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the former chief justice will accept the
chairmanship if there's anything illegal about it," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker reportedly had questioned the legality of the
Preparatory Commission on Constitutional Reform Estrada created
last year to study and advise him about amendments to the 12-year
old Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Government officials, meanwhile, backed Estrada's statement on
the issue, saying that the Narvasa commission does not have any
power to directly amend the Charter as an advisory body.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said
the preparatory commission will not infringe on the powers of
Congress to revise the Charter.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot imagine how it can become unconstitutional. It's a
study group and has no powers to amend the Constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican also said the Narvasa
commission does not infringe upon the powers of any other branch
of government.

<HEADLINE> Most American, British Relief Workers Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Most American and British
humanitarian staff except two Americans working in Iraq have left
the country under U.N. instructions, said U.N. spokesman in
Baghdad on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
George Somerwill, spokesman for the U.N. Humanitarian
Coordinator's Office in Iraq, told reporters that 13 American
and British relief workers had left Iraq, but he did not say
when they left.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two Americans would leave next week, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced Wednesday in New York
that the U.N. had ordered its American and British humanitarian
staff working in Iraq to leave the country, saying Iraq had
claimed it could not guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said U.N. Under-Secretary General Benon Sevan, who is
in charge of security, decided that all American and British
nationals working for the U.N. in Iraq should leave.
</P>
<P>
Iraq sent a letter to the U.N. on January 4, saying it was
unable to ensure the safety of American and British nationals in
the aftermath of the mid-December U.S. and British bombardment on
Iraq and requesting they leave the country immediately, a move
rejected by the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said that the pullout decision was made on the fact
that Iraq had not responded to letters from the U.N. that Iraq
had an obligation to protect all U.N. staff members.
</P>
<P>
He said the two Americans affected by the decision were Darlene
Bisson, deputy director of the World Food Program and the
secretary to Prakash Shah, chief U.N. envoy in Baghdad. Her name
was not released.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether some 420 U.N. relief workers in Iraq, of
whom 220 work in the northern Kurdish autonomous region. They are
responsible for supervising the distribution of food and medicine
under the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export a
limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its 22 million people who are suffering from the over
eight-year U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> 541 Israelis Killed in Road Accidents in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 541 Israelis were
killed in 25,046 road accidents in 1998, said Israeli traffic
police in a report published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians accounted for 37 percent of the total fatalities,
while drivers for 25 percent, passengers 22 percent, motorcyclists
9 percent and bicyclists 7 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Though the 1998 fatalities almost leveled those of 1997,
traffic accidents have increased by 54 percent over the last
decade, partly because road infrastructure development has failed
to keep up with the increase in vehicles on the road, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 saw a 71 percent increase in vehicles on the road
from those of 1989. However, there was only a 21 percent growth in
kilometers of road built during that period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Private cars are most often the vehicles involved in both
fatal and non-fatal accidents, accounting for 29,489 of all the
46,852 vehicular accidents in 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
Illegal overtaking is considered to be one of the primary
causes of accidents, which accounted for 24 percent of the
collisions, the report said.

on opposing dismemberment of Iraq, the Middle East News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Splitting Iraq involves "great perils," Presidential Political

31st Cairo International Book Fair.
</P>

Egypt is "doing its utmost" to prevent disintegration of Iraq,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, el-Baz called on Iraq to abide by the United Nations
Security Council resolutions and respect the national security of
Arab countries and stop threatening its neighbors as such a move
affords pretexts for major powers to strike Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Inter-Arab fighting weakens the Arab national security, he
said, adding that Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait was the first of
its kind in modern Arab history.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Egypt is against interfering in the internal
affairs of Iraq, opposing any attempts to topple its regime by
force.
</P>

The U.S. is reportedly providing support for Iraq's opposition
abroad in an attempt to take over the power in case the government

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Holds Talks with Hun Sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday held talks with visiting Cambodian
counterpart Hun Sen, focusing on bilateral cooperation and the
issue of Cambodia's admission into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed his happiness that Cambodia now has a stable
and cohesive government and is moving towards achieving national
reconciliation, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said
at a news briefing here after the talks.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperation, Syed Hamid said Cambodia requested
for personnel training in Malaysia in various areas such as
industry, foreign policy, oil and gas and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir reiterated Malaysia's willingness to do so, the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia also requested Malaysia to look into the
possibility of importing maize, rice and soya bean from Cambodia
and Malaysia agreed to look into this.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, Malaysia is keen to strengthen and enhance the
relationship," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the talks, the two parties signed a trade
agreement between the two countries, Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
He said overall, the talks were "most productive."
</P>
<P>
He assured that Malaysia would continue to provide necessary
support to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
On Cambodia's admission into ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) which presently comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam, Syed Hamid said Cambodia needed to fulfill the
requirement of establishing a Senate to facilitate its formal
entry.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said that Hun Sen informed Mahathir that he was
moving in that direction according to the law and constitution of
Cambodia to do so.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we are informed of the formation of the senate then
I think the ASEAN foreign ministers will meet in Hanoi to sign the
formal agreement on Cambodia's admission, " the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the ASEAN summit in Hanoi last December, ASEAN
leaders agreed in principle to admit Cambodia as the grouping's
10th member subject to Cambodia's fulfillment of the requisites
for the establishment of a senate before it joins ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Mahathir, Hun Sen arrived here earlier
Thursday for a three-day official visit to Malaysia, his first
since Cambodian general election last July.

<HEADLINE> Internet Links Tibet with World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And as a result, Lhasa's telecoms bureau has been able to
register 300 Internet users over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tibet's tourism department has set up a website
about travel routes and programs for people interested in visiting
this mysterious land and the Internet has shortened the distance
between this remote plateau and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Nyima Cering, an official in charge of Internet registration
with the Lhasa Telecommunications Office, said that anyone who has
a valid identification card can register an Internet account
number which is very cheap, costing about two pennies every three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the authorities plan to open public cyber-
cafes to meet the demand from Internet users.
</P>
<P>
"Before democratic reform in 1959, the whole region of Tibet
had only ten telephones and they were available only to rich
families living in Lhasa," Nyima Cerging added. "But now
telephones are very popular throughout Tibet even amongst farming
and herding families.
</P>
<P>
Although Internet use in Tibet is much less than in other
Chinese regions, the users in the region can obtain the same
information as in metropolises like Beijing and Shanghai," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Users in Tibet can also read domestic news stories issued by
such organizations as the Xinhua News Agency, People's Daily and
China Daily. They are also able to visit foreign websites," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Today, more and more people in Tibet are able to have access to
domestic and international information through the Internet and to
open a window on Tibetan folk customs and culture for worldwide
websurfers.
</P>
<P>
For example, Australian scholar Charles Ramble is translating
the "dBa'bzhed", the oldest book tracing the arrival of Buddhism
in Tibet some 1200 years ago. He is also working on a translation
of the first Tibetan Buddhist "Samyai" scripture and says that E-
mail contact with Tibetan academic Pasang Wangdu is helping his
project enormously.
</P>
<P>
And Wangdu, a social sciences researcher, says that he is also
enjoying the benefits as he has conducted many joint projects with
foreign experts who are keen to translate ancient Tibetan books
into English.
</P>
<P>
"For such work I was obliged in the past to attend
international seminars or lecture abroad," he said. "But now I can
do this easily via the Internet every day."
</P>
<P>
Last month, Pasang received 23 E-mails from foreign scholars
looking for his assistance.
</P>
<P>
Qoipei Norbu, a young lecturer in the University of Tibet, also
maintains regular communication on the Internet with his British
chum Ian Ormesher.
</P>
<P>
"Through the net Ian is learning Chinese and Tibetan from me,"
said Qoipei."And merely by using the Internet at home I am able to
receive information from across the world very conveniently,"
added Norbu, who often visits the websites of American
universities.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Accused to Train Sierra Leonean Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
has been using its country as training base for the rebels in
Sierra Leone, Sierra Leonean Chief of Defence Staff Brig.-Gen.
Maxwell Khobe was quoted as saying here.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Liberian leader had propped the rebels by
offering them logistic support as well as military training, This
Day newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Khobe who arrived here on Tuesday told reporters that Taylor
had charged one of his ministers with the responsibility of
providing the rebels' need and created a training field at Camp
Shefling for the recruitment and training of fighters.
</P>
<P>
"He also receives fighters from Burkina Faso for training and
onward distribution to the war zones in Sierra Leone," said Khobe,
a Nigerian, who, until his appointment as Sierra Leone's chief of
defence staff, was the commander of the West African peace-keeping
force of ECOMOG in Sierra leone.
</P>
<P>
He urged African leaders and the international community to
prevail on Liberian President Taylor and Libyan leader Col. Muamar
Ghadaffi to stop funding the rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Khobe's appeal to African leaders came on the heels of a report
that Col. Ghadaffi had offered to mediate in the Sierra leone
crisis, saying that he would use his good offices to help end the
fighting in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Sierra Leonean parliament had approved an
army of 5, 000 men to form the nucleus of the country's armed
forces, adding that the sooner the goal was realized, the better.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member military delegation led by Khobe which is on a
seven-day visit to Nigeria was aimed at strengthening military
cooperation between the two countries including the training of
armed forces in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Under the Status of Forces Agreement signed in 1997 between the
two countries, Nigeria was given powers to train the army of
Sierra Leone and develop its navy and air force.

<HEADLINE> PBOC to Expand Open Market Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sources close to the People's
Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank, said today that
the bank will further expand its open market operations for better
implementation of its monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that efforts will be made to increase the
number of first-grade dealers in the open market, add new types of
business, raise the ceiling of business volume, and expand inter-
bank facilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the central bank will support policy-oriented
banks to issue bonds through public bidding while improving the
bond settlement and capital clearance systems to lessen trading
risks in coordination with the country's pro-active fiscal
policies.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC resumed its open market bond business on May 26 last
year in a bid to manage base money with more flexibility and
efficiency and to meet commercial banks' demand for capital.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 28 first-grade dealers in the open market,
and operations on the market have developed greatly in terms of
trading style and variety.
</P>
<P>
Open market operations have become a significant channel for
PBOC to supply base money, as in the second half of 1998 the
central bank supplied 70 billion yuan in base money via the open
market.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Back in Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
returned to the Kremlin Thursday after a meeting with Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his chief of staff Nikolai Bordyuzha
in the Barvikha sanatorium, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yeltsin stressed "the need to work out and
implement efficient measures to enhance stability and combat
corruption in Russia," presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 68, was released from the Central Clinical Hospital
last Sunday after a 15-day treatment for gastric ulcer bleeding.
</P>
<P>
He came to the Kremlin briefly Tuesday, sacking four of his
advisors and accepted the resignation of Prosecutor General Yuri
Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov tendered his resignation "for health reasons," but
Russian media and politicians believe there were political reasons
behind it.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, Primakov and Bordyuzha also discussed aspects of the
government's recent activity, Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
They focused on preparations for the Security Council meeting
scheduled for Friday, and considered Primakov's upcoming meeting
with the Duma leadership next week.
</P>
<P>
The issue of appointing a new prosecutor general was not raised
at the meeting, since Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov has not
been officially relieved of his duties yet, Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian constitution, the prosecutor general is appointed
and dismissed by the Federation Council, or upper house of
parliament, on the initiative of the president.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has sent a letter to the Federation Council, urging it
to relieve Skuratov of his duties.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Welcomes DPRK's Proposal for Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung Thursday hailed the proposal by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) to hold inter-Korean high-level political
talks.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the North offered to hold dialogue itself is
noteworthy," Kim said when he met a group of South Korean citizens
whose hometown is in the North.
</P>
<P>
However, Kim said it is difficult to say now whether or not the
proposal will lead to dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We need to take more time to watch the North's attitude and
make a judgment based on the principle of pursuing security and
cooperation simultaneously," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president's comment came one day after Pyongyang offered to
hold high-level political talks with Seoul to discuss ways of "
preventing war and providing an epoch-making opportunity for
national reunification."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the South Korean Unification Ministry said
earlier on Thursday that "we view the offer positively. We urged
North Korea to arrange the talks as soon as possible without any
conditions attached."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The China Industrial and
Commercial Bank (CICB) announced today that it plans to increase
housing loans by 40 billion yuan in 1999 to make it easier to
build and buy mainly cheaper residential homes.
</P>
<P>
According to information supplied by CICB, at the end of 1998
the outstanding amount of housing loans it extended reached 82.9
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Promoting individual housing credit was one of CICB's key
business activities in 1998, for which the bank drew up a series
of policies and measures. The improvement of services and
diversified marketing strategies enabled a rapid development of
the bank's individual housing credit business.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 CICB granted individual housing loans of 14.2 billion
yuan, providing finance for 250,000 families to buy their own
houses. Based on last year's results, residential loans have
become the bank's fastest growing credit sector.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Cambodia Sign Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Cambodia
signed here Thursday a trade agreement to further expand and
deepen trade, economic and industrial ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The government of both countries agreed to provide necessary
assistance and encourage private enterprises to explore the
opportunities in trade, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) said in a press release here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would facilitate bilateral trade development
through granting to each other most favored nation treatment in
matters relating to custom tariffs, taxes, charges and customs
procedures in connection with importation and exportation of
products, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would also facilitate both the countries'
participation in trade fairs and exhibitions which include
exemptions from customs duties and other similar charges on
articles and samples intended for exhibition and fairs.
</P>
<P>
It would also lead to the establishment of a joint-trade
committee to discuss measures to enhance two-way trade, the MITI
said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Malaysia's International Trade and
Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz and Cambodia's Minister of Commerce
Cham Prasidh on behalf of their respective governments, was the
outcome of the bilateral talks between visiting Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen and his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad
who both witnessed the signing.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's bilateral trade with Cambodia totaled 326.8 million
ringgit (about 86 million U.S. dollars) in 1997 and 175.4 million
ringgit (about 46.157 million U.S. dollars) for the period from
January to November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's import items from Cambodia were rubber products
while its main export items to Cambodia were aeroplane and other
aircraft, knitted fabrics and fibers, tracklaying bulldozers and
angledozers.
</P>
<P>
According to MITI, Malaysia's investment in Cambodia up to
December 1998 amounted to 1.7 billion ringgit (about 447.368
million U.S. dollars), accounting for 31 percent of the total
foreign direct investment in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's investment are in the areas of infrastructure
development, power generation, tourism, banking, property
development, oil refining and production, education and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the signing of the trade agreement will
provide the conducive framework for the two countries to enhance
bilateral trade and ensure expansion of Malaysian investment in
Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Anti-Smoking Campaign Unsuccessful Among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Government anti-smoking
campaigns had failed to decrease tobacco use among school children
and may have even encouraged them to take up the habit, the
country's New South Wales Cancer Council said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Council chief executive officer Andrew Penman, while releasing
a report which showed 30 percent of girls and 27 percent of boys
aged 15 years being of smokers, called for a different approach to
getting the anti-smoking message across.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen over the last five years a shift in tobacco control
policies to focus almost exclusively on youth," Penman was quoted
by Australian Associated Press as saying in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is counterproductive. The more we stylize the
smoking problem as being a youth problem, the more we will create
a forbidden fruit phenomenon and encourage children to start
smoking."
</P>
<P>
The Australian School Students' Alcohol and Drugs Survey showed
there had been no overall improvement in smoking patterns since
1993.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Medical Association's David Brand said the
statistics showed more needed to be done to push the anti-smoking
message to children. He called on the federal government to boost
funding to combat teenage smoking to at least 64 million
Australian dollars (41 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The federal government collects 4.5 billion Australian dollars
(2.88 billion U.S. dollars) a year in tobacco revenue, but this
year is expected to spend just 2.2 million Australian dollars (1.4
million U.S. dollars) on tobacco control projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 10,026 students aged 12 to 17 years - about two
percent of the New South Wales secondary school students - showed
a third of all students were smokers by their mid-teens.
</P>
<P>
Children barely out of primary school were buying their own
cigarettes, with 19 percent of 12-year-old male smokers saying
they purchased cigarettes themselves.
</P>
<P>
Of the children that did not buy their own, 70 percent got them
from friends. Other sources were siblings or parents, and eight
percent said they took them from home without permission.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Attorneys for Turkey's People's
Democracy Party (HADEP) have asked the Constitutional Court to
reject a lawsuit demanding the party's closure on charges of its
alleged involvement with the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
They had presented a petition to the court's secretary general
on Wednesday, arguing that the suit is against Turkey's Political
Party Law, the local Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas has asked the Constitutional Court
to ban the HADEP on charges that it was operating as a branch of
the PKK, inciting separatist activities based on ethnic lines and
enlisting volunteers for the PKK.
</P>
<P>
He cited a nationwide hunger strikes staged by HADEP members in
November in support of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained in Rome in November and many HADEP members
began hunger strikes to protest attempts to have him extradited
to Turkey to stand trial on terrorist charges.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the Constitutional Court, Turkey's highest court,
has banned 14 political parties.
</P>
<P>
The court's most recent decision to ban a political party was
made last year when it closed the pro-Islamic Welfare Party on the
grounds that the party had become the center of anti-secular
activities.

<HEADLINE> Side Effects of Egypt's Economic Reforms Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Shura Council, the
consultative upper house, was discussing a report which offered
different views on the country's much-praised economic policies,
and warned against side effects.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the Council's Economic Affairs
Committee, called on the government to reconsider its
reform-oriented policies in an effort to safeguard social
stability.
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, privatization (has) proved to be destructive
when it goes to extreme levels, such as selling off airports and
public utilities," said the report.
</P>
<P>
It asked the government to retain control over strategic assets.
</P>
<P>
According to the English-language weekly Al-Ahram, the report
pointed out that economic reforms might be damaged by social
inequality.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started the privatization process in 1995 to sell 314
state-owned companies, one third of which have been sold to the
private sector or foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The drastic economic reforms have improved the efficiency of
Egypt's enterprises, upgrading the economic growth from 2 percent
to more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, the reform has led to more layoffs and
more unemployment, which many feared might cause social
turbulences.
</P>
<P>
"Social equality should be reinstated by the state as a top
priority," the report said, claiming that the allocation for
social spending in the 1997-98 budget was "not enough."
</P>
<P>
The budget puts aside 29.8 billion Egyptian pounds (8.76
billion U.S. dollars), or 36 percent of the overall spending, to
meet the social costs brought about by the economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The 25-page report warned the government "not to be deceived
any longer by calls for capitalism and globalization," which it
contended were prescribed by Westerners "for developing countries
as the panacea for all of their economic woes and financial
troubles."
</P>
<P>
Government officials, however, defended the application of
market capitalism in Egypt. The liberal Minister of Economy
Youssef Boutros Ghali is one of them.
</P>
<P>
The gradual application of market capitalism in Egypt will mean
that resources will be used more efficiently, production will be
of a higher quality and citizens will be protected from sudden
economic decisions, Boutros Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
"Market capitalism is the best system for achieving prosperity
in Egypt provided that the instruments of this system operate
naturally and spontaneously," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Brahimi to visit Pakistan for talks on Afghan issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. General Secretary's
Special Envoy on the Afghan issue Lakhdar Brahimi will undertake a
visit to the region later February for talks on the long-running
Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Besides Pakistan, Brahimi is expected to visit Saudi Arabia,
Iran, Russian and Central Asian state in continuation of his
efforts for restoration of peace in the war-ravaged Afghanistan,
U.N. sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed meeting of so-called Six plus Two Group in
Uzbekistan will also come up for discussion in the talks of the
U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors - Pakistan, Iran,
Uzbekistan, China, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan - formed the group
along with the U.S. and Russia under the aegis of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif chaired a high-level
meeting Monday in Lahore, provincial capital of Punjab, which
reviewed regional situation with special reference to the Afghan
issue.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the meeting observed that Pakistan's Afghan
policy was sound and Islamabad would continue to promote peace
efforts in the strife-torn country in collaboration with the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the proposed meeting of six plus two group in
Tashkent, the officials said some ideas had been floated which
were under consideration in the concerned capitals.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi will also meet representatives of the Taliban militia,
which control more than two-thirds of Afghanistan, and leaders of
the anti-Taliban alliance during his forthcoming visit to the
region.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi visited Pakistan in October last year and exchanged
views on the possibility of bringing all warring factions to the
negotiating table to find out a solution to the lingering Afghan
problem.
</P>
<P>
The expected visit by Brhimi this time will be significant
because he will also discuss with the leadership of these
countries the matters pertaining to six plus two meeting scheduled
to be held in Tashkent, the U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic activity on Afghanistan has intensified over the
last four months after high-level contacts between Pakistan and
the other countries neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
After Brahimi's visit to the region last October, foreign
ministers of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan visited
Islamabad while Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad paid a
visit to Tehran and held talks with the Iranians leading to the
removal of misgivings between the two countries and greater
understanding for solution of the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi is also expected to
visit Islamabad soon for talks with his Pakistan counterpart
Sartaj Aziz.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will send eight
companies to attend the G-15's trade exhibition in Jamaica which

</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Develops Infrared Device for Firemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Evan Zhang, a Chinese living in
the United States, has developed a prototype device that allows
firemen see clearly through otherwise blinding smoke.
</P>
<P>
The battery-powered device includes a camera-like lens, viewer
and transmitter, all built into a firefighter's helmet. In a
recent experiment sponsored by the U.S. Air Force, the infrared-
technology based device helped a fireman successfully locate
victims in one minute in a smoke-filled building, but those
without the device had to spent 15 to 20 minutes fulfilling their
mission, according to Zhang, who just arrived in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang sees a wide range of potential uses for these inexpensive
infrared viewers. For example, temperature changes could allow
surgeons to tell living tissue from dead tissue or pinpoint
blockages in blood vessels. It can also help soldiers locate the
enemy at night.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a former professor at the Shanghai Jiaotong University,
emigrated to the United States in 1987 and launched his company
called Zybron Inc. As a prominent photo-electronics expert, he was
received together with a number of scientists by Chinese president
Jiang Zemin in New York in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is working to obtain a license from the U.S. government
to export his device to China.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
backtracked Thursday as recent gains were unwound by a
surprisingly weak retail trade figure.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed the session at 63.90 U.S. cents from
63.98 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
During the day it hit a high of 64.19 U.S. cents and hit lows
in the 63.70 region.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported Thursday consumer
spending on retail goods recorded the biggest drop in almost five
years during the Christmas period.
</P>
<P>
The report showed retail turnover fell by 2.1 percent in
December, while economists had forecast a 0.5 percent rise in
retail trade following November's seasonally adjusted rise of 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also finished here at 0.5636 Euro from
0.5637 Euro Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A small recovery by the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen
also worked against the local currency.

<P>
In response to a question on China's efforts to guarantee woman'
s rights and interest, she said China has greatly upgraded women'
s status through both legislative and administrative means, and
scored achievements that have attracted world attention.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said as a contracting member of the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, China
has submitted a report to the on-going UN meeting ratifying the
convention.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always attached great importance
to the upgrading of women's status, the elimination of
discrimination against women, and the protection of their legal
rights," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the Chinese government will continue its
efforts in this regard in a bid to realize the purpose of equality,
peace and development for women defined at the 4th World Women's
Conference convened in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhang during the briefing also said that illegal entries into
the Chinese territory by citizens from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea were on rise in the past years. "The Chinese
government has properly handled the situation," she said, adding
that those people should not be considered as refugees.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also denied a recent Amnesty International
report accusing China of torturing Uygurs in the Xinjiang
Autonomous Region, saying that the accusation is "totally
groundless and irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
Also, "China hopes that the conflicts in Afghanistan will be
ended at an early date through peaceful consultations among
various factions of Afghanistan," she said, adding that China's
stand on the Afghanistan issue is "consistent."
</P>
<P>
She added that a group of officials from the Chinese Foreign
Ministry is now in Afghanistan to inspect the venue of the Chinese
Embassy in that country.
</P>
<P>
On Wang Ce's case, she said that "China is trying the case
according to law." According to Zhang, Wang Ce, a Chinese citizen,
has violated Chinese laws because he illegally crossed the border,
used fake identification card and was engaged in activities
detrimental to the national security. "The law enforcement body is
trying the case according to the law," Zhang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman
Zhang Qiyue said all countries in the world should abandon "Cold
War" mentality and obsolete security concepts in the new historic
era.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks in response to a question on comments in
a recent U.S. Central Intelligent Administration report to critize
so-called China's military threat.
</P>
<P>
She said: "Peace and development is the main tone of our era.
The main historic tide is to seek peace, development and
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
All should make common efforts to build up 21-century-oriented
world peace, stability and development with "new security concepts
as the starting point," she said.
</P>
<P>
China's defence policy is defensive, she said, adding that the
country adopts an independent foreign policy for peace.
</P>
<P>
"It is well-known that China's defence budget is the lowest
among major countries in the world. Either it calculates in terms
of proportion to GNP and per-capita defence expenditure, the
figure is one of the lowest worldwide," she said.
</P>
<P>
"China is not a threat to any country. On the contrary, China
is an important force to safeguard world peace and stability," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the heads of state between China and the
United States paid reciprocal visits in the recent two years,
injecting an impetus to the growth of Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. government and relevant sides to do more
concrete works for strengthening and improving the Sino-U.S.
relations, not vice versa," she said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also announced that a delegation of Chamber of
Deputies of Uruguay led by President Jaime Mario Trobo will pay a
goodwill visit to China from February 7 to 12 at the invitation of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Iran to Swap POWs: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Iran will swap some
500 prisoners of war (POWs) in the coming days, a senior Iraqi
official said.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Zawra weekly quoted a senior Foreign Ministry official
as saying that in the coming days 424 Iraqi POWs will be released
from Iran, and in return Iraq will set free 67 Iranian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Swap proceedings will take place in a joint meeting of the two
countries on the Iraqi side of the border point, said the unnamed
official.
</P>
<P>
The weekly reported that Khalid al-Saadi, chairman of the Human
Rights Committee of Iraq's National Assembly (parliament), said
the contacts between Iraqi and Iranian lawmakers are under way to
accelerate the release of another 400 Iraqi POWs jailed in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Saadi said the Iranian side had promised, during an Iraqi
parliamentary delegation's visit to Tehran, to release the 400
Iraqi POWs before January 23 this year, but failed to honor its
commitment.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has long been standing in the way of
normalizing ties between the two neighbors, which fought a bitter
eight-year war in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Since last April, the two countries have stepped up efforts to
solve this long-standing issue to better bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> South Africans Seek New Life in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africans, wary about
the changes in their country, have been coming to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) in increasing numbers, lured by its tax-free and
attractive salary system.
</P>
<P>
According to recruitment agencies in the capital, in the last
18 months, there has been a large influx of South Africans into
the labor market, the Gulf News daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago there were no South Africans here. But suddenly
they are coming here in a big way because of the good tax-free
salaries and the absence of crime," said Wayne Horwitz, branch
manager of Middle East S.O.S. Recruitment Consultants.
</P>
<P>
"During the apartheid era, there was no contact between the UAE
and South Africa. But, in 1994 when the gates opened, there's been
a lot of interest back home about the UAE as an attractive place
to work in," said Yusuf Saloojee, South African Ambassador in the
UAE.
</P>
<P>
He said the reason why South Africans are fanning out into
other countries was because it's still a new country and many are
unsure about where it is headed.
</P>
<P>
"They want to take a break, travel abroad and give a chance to
see how the South African government functions," the ambassador
added.
</P>
<P>
Out of the estimated 3,000 South Africans in the UAE, nearly
two-thirds entered the country in the last 18 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africans are being placed here as nurses, teachers,
musicians, technicians, secretaries and sales people. They are
also frequently seen in the construction industry.

<HEADLINE> "Cold War" Mentality Called to Abandon, FM Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Zhang Qiyue said all countries in the world should abandon "Cold
War" mentality and obsolete security concepts in the new historic
era.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks in response to a question on comments in a
recent U.S. Central Intelligent Administration report to critize
so-called China's military threat.
</P>
<P>
She said that "Peace and development is the main tone of our
era. The main historic tide is to seek peace, development and
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
All should make common efforts to build up 21-century-oriented
world peace, stability and development with "new security concepts
as the starting point," she said.
</P>
<P>
China's defence policy is defensive, she said, adding that the
country adopts an independent foreign policy for peace.
</P>
<P>
"It is well-known that China's defence budget is the lowest
among major countries in the world. Either it calculates in terms
of proportion to GNP and per-capita defence expenditure, the
figure is one of the lowest worldwide," she said.
</P>
<P>
"China is not a threat to any country. On the contrary, China
is an important force to safeguard world peace and stability," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the heads of state between China and the
United States paid reciprocal visits in the recent two years,
injecting an impetus to the growth of Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. government and relevant sides to do more
concrete works for strengthening and improving the Sino-U.S.
relations, not vice versa," she said.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Economies Urged to Improve Transparency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Mideast economies need to
improve their statistical practices and data dissemination, and
show greater business transparency and disclosures, said an
official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The Gulf News on Thursday quoted Owen Evans, assistant director
of the Statistics Department of the IMF as saying that attitudes
toward transparency and disclosures are changing throughout the
world and these are in the interests of the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Evans is conducting a five-day seminar on the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) in Abu Dhabi along with World Bank
officials.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which began on Wednesday, is part of the IMF's
global effort to help economies improve data dissemination systems
to have a new "international financial architecture", said the
Arab Monetary Fund (AMF).
</P>
<P>
Citing the importance of data dissemination in terms of
globalization, Evans noted that the culture was changing quickly
worldwide toward improved transparency and greater disclosures.
</P>
<P>
The Midease region is no exception and improvements can be
made, the IMF official said.
</P>
<P>
The Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), which was
introduced in March 1996 by the IMF, now has 47 subscribers and it
targets at countries participating in global capital markets or
aspiring to do so, he said, but there are no subscribers from the
Middle East so far.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, the IMF set up the GDDS to provide a
framework for countries to adapt and improve their statistical
systems.
</P>
<P>
Although the GDDS is on a voluntary basis, he said, it may have
incentives as potential investors will lean toward countries
having more transparency and disclosures.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis, which has spread from Asia 18 months ago
to many countries, has made it vital for economies to introduce
sound statistical systems to shelter themselves from the volatile
fluctuations in market sentiment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the IMF's efforts on the GDDS seminar
is even more timely and relevant, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, attended by 50 people from 18 countries, is the
first official joint seminar of the IMF and AMF, and a new
landmark in their cooperation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Minister Warns of High Unemployment Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Labor and Social
Affairs Minister Michel Moussa has warned that his country's
unemployment is increasing with the current official figures
setting at 9 percent of Lebanon's workforce.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star Thursday quoted the minister as saying at a
conference on employment that the country's joblessness rate will
rise to 25 percent if hidden unemployment, where several people
perform jobs that can be done by one person, is taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
He said that university graduates were the group most affected
by rising unemployment and would be the most likely to emigrate to
find jobs.
</P>
<P>
"There should be awareness campaigns specifically aimed at
students to direct them toward gaps in the productive sector,"
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the traditional view of the successful child as
a lawyer, physician or engineer was fading and parents were
beginning to see technical and vocational education as an asset.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Hamdan, president of the independent Consultation and
Research Institute, attributed the high level of joblessness to
Lebanon's post-war policy of borrowing to fund reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"A major chunk of the country's financial resources are being
channeled into debt service which meant less for actual
investment and job creation," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the institute's 1997 statistics, Lebanon's
workforce was currently around 1.36 million, of which 60 percent
was aged between 30 and 44. Lebanon's population stands at about
3.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Increases Duty on Some Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Imported cooking oil, butter,
margarine and sugar will soon cost consumers in Zambia more
because the government has decided to increase duty on the
imports.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the items under the customs and excise schedule
include soap, detergents, flour, tyre, confectionery and
automobile batteries, Times of Zambia reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to effect an increased alternative duty rate on
the selected goods was announced by Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi
last week, when she presented this year's budget to parliament.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to complaints about unfair
trading practices which have disadvantaged the local manufacturing
sector for sometime.
</P>
<P>
The local companies manufacturing these goods will now be in a
position to compete on the market because the landed cost of the
imported items will be higher.
</P>
<P>
All the items under the schedule will attract a 25-percent duty
or an alternative Kwacha charge per specified unit of measurement.
</P>
<P>
The measure will not only increase revenue to the government
but safeguard jobs in the long run as local companies become more
viable by sustaining and increasing their production.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the move will help switch demand from
the imported goods to the comparatively cheaper local goods.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Prospects: Opportunities And Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lingering Asian financial crisis, the slowdown in
investment by multinationals, and the recession weakening most
Asian countries pose a threat to China's use of overseas
investment this year.
</P>
<P>
But, in spite of these, China has a goal of overseas investment
contracts worth 40 billion U.S. dollars, with 30 to 35 billion
dollars in direct overseas investment. Exports of foreign-funded
enterprises are also expected to be up 3 percent, Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said
recently.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that the domestic investment environment will be
improved along with management and services to maintain overseas
investment and more areas will be opened up to overseas investors,
especially commerce, foreign trade, and aviation.
</P>
<P>
He said that more preferential policies will be provided to
encourage overseas investors to set up research and development
centers in China and to co-operate with domestic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Xie Shusheng, the president of the Foreign Investment
Corporations Association, says that overseas investors will be
given more incentives if they invest in agriculture, high-tech
industries, infrastructure, and environmental protection and
government departments should work out measures and policies that
encourage investment in China's central and western areas to
redress the development imbalance.

<HEADLINE> Rare Giant Panda on Critical List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Veterinary doctors and zoo
officials in Tianjin are desperately trying to save the life of a
rare giant panda which is on the critical list after falling
mysteriously ill last week.
</P>
<P>
But the zoo's director believes their efforts are in vain as
the 28-year-old panda, named Zhaizhai, is vomiting continuously,
passing blood in his urine and all indications are that he has
suffered renal failure.
</P>
<P>
The panda was recently introduced to a new mate which zoo
keepers thought would help improve his life after his first mate
died.
</P>
<P>
However, last week he seemed to be in low spirits, according to
zoo keepers refusing his food and then after falling ill he began
to show renal failure symptoms earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Vets are trying every way to save his life including blood
transfusions, oxygen-feed and injections but to little effect.
</P>
<P>
Zhaizhai, whose age is equal to over 70 years in human terms,
first came to Tianjin from northwest China's Gansu Province 19
years ago, immediately becoming the zoo's star attraction.
</P>
<P>
But after his first mate Rongrong died six years ago he became
unhappy and contracted epilepsy and a cataract, which could be
attributed to his old age.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to cheer him up, animal psychologists introduced
him to a new mate last month, a 16 year old female panda brought
in from a zoo in southwest China's Sichuan Province and he was
very friendly to her, following her around for the first few days
before he became ill.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Rule out Sale of Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's parliamentary working
committee which was given the task of seeking ways of expediting
the sale of 49 percent shares of Uganda Airlines Corporation (UAC)
has ruled out liquidating the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the importance of the national flag carrier, the
corporation should not be sold, Thursday's Monitor daily quoted
the committee report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The committee suggested that the government should form and
incorporate a limited liability company.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed after President Yoweri Museveni's
announcement that the money-gobbling UAC must be sold before end
of March, holds that if the government forms a new company, all
the assets will be transferred to the new company while the
government will shoulder the liabilities.
</P>
<P>
The MPs also rejected the option of entering negotiations with
Transnet/ South African Airways (SAA), which is one of the bidding
parties on grounds that it would preempt the question of the
disputed route rights that were designated to Alliance Air/SAA.
</P>
<P>
They said that the route rights belong to the state and not the
airline. Earlier, some bidders had complained that UAC was a shell
because its lucrative routes of Entebbe-London and Entebbe-Dubai
were awarded to Alliance Air and Iran Air respectively.
</P>
<P>
The only fair way of ending UAC's problem, they noted, is to
put it on open competitive bidding and any successful bidder
should be able to develop Entebbe International Airport into a
regional hub.
</P>
<P>
The privatization of the UAC is high on the agenda of the
privatization unit and the parliament. If its privatization is
delayed beyond March, the government will need to pump in one
million U.S. Dollars to sustain it.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are five companies interested in buying the
parastatal: Kenya Airways, Air Mauritium, Alliance Air/SAA, Sabena
and British Airways.

<HEADLINE> China to Ban Illegal Telecoms Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Tighter controls are to be
introduced in China's telecommunications sector and government
officials have warned they are to crack down hard on what it
describes as illegal telecoms businesses which have suddenly
sprung up of late.
</P>
<P>
The move follows the actions of two brothers in southeast
China's Fuzhou city who opened up an international phonecall
business on the Internet without authorization and were taken to
court. The two brothers are currently in detention awaiting
further trial by China's judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Baoxin, Deputy director of the Telecommunications Bureau
under the Ministry of Information Industry (MII), said that the
telecommunications businesses is a specialist and complicated
sector. He pointed out that strict administration and official
authorization of such services are common practices
internationally, and that China adheres to these principles as
well.
</P>
<P>
He commented that unauthorized telecoms activities in China
have caused severe economic losses to the country and must be
banned immediately.
</P>
<P>
Zhou stressed that only China Telecom and China Unicom are
authorized to run international telecoms business in China and
anyone flouting that is liable to prosecution under China's
draconian Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
Under a MII directive, China only permits the flow of computer
information services on the Internet, and at this present time
telephone and fax services through the net are forbidden.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Ratifies Convention on Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly of
Tanzania has ratified the international conventions on protection
of migratory wild animals and conservation of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Zakia Meghji,
said the objective of the conventions is to safeguard animals
which migrate from time to time as a lifestyle, local newspapers
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is renowned for its vast wildlife resources but human
being's activities have also greatly destroyed their habitats.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Assembly in the central city of Dodoma
Wednesday, Meghji said signatories to the conventions have the
responsibility of ensuring the species' habitats are not
disturbed.
</P>
<P>
She said the costs of safeguarding the animals and birds will
be shouldered by respective countries which get assistance from
interested organizations.
</P>
<P>
Hulda Kibacha, a member of parliament (MP) representing the
ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party (CCM), welcomed the decision to
ratify of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species
of Wild Animals, known as the Bonn Convention, and the Convention
on Wetlands of International Importance. She said the decision
"is long overdue."
</P>
<P>
Debating the bill, another MP from CCM, Juma Akukweti, said the
 convention is timely but it is silent on farmers' crops which are
destroyed during the migration of animals.
</P>
<P>
He said people's property should also be considered when states
take measures to protect wild animals.

<HEADLINE> China Unicom Review Good for Investors: MII </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China Unicom has been told that
it should dispense with any foreign investment or joint ventures
because these activities do not conform with the government's
regulations.
</P>
<P>
An inquiry into the methods used by the company, the sole
domestic competitor to China Telecom, to raise capital has been
completed and a decision on how it should do this in the future
handed down.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunjiang, director of the Telecommunications
Administrative Bureau under the Ministry of Information Industry (
MII), said at a press conference today that it will be easier for
it to raise funds under the existing government policy system if
it has no foreign ownership, which in the long terms will be good
for the company's expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
"If the ownership of the company is simplified it will be
easier to float shares on the security market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Jianzhou, director of the MII's Department of
General Project, added that China Unicom's China-China-foreign
mechanism to raise fund is at the present time "irregular" under
the policies and regulations that the Chinese Government has
introduced for raising new capital.
</P>
<P>
He said that MII has now completed its investigations and will
soon announce how it will deal with the 45 contracts the
telecommunications company has already signed to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
"We will not permit the signing of any further such contracts,
because they do not conform with existing regulations." he
commented.
</P>
<P>
"The restrictions on foreign investment in the service sector
of China's telecommunications industry is actually aimed at
protecting the proper interests of foreign investors," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, "This does not necessarily mean that there
will be any changes in foreign investment policies and China will
continue to encourage foreign investment in its telecommunications
equipment manufacturing sector."

<HEADLINE> Zambian Press Hails Duty-Free on Newsprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Press Association of Zambia
(PAZA) has commended the government for waiving duty on all
newsprint.
</P>
<P>
Association President Hicks Sikazwe said Wednesday that the
move was good as it would boost the newspaper industry in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Zambia Daily Mail quoted Sikazwe as saying that it
was now up to would-be investors to take advantage of the gesture
and bring in business in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The PAZA chief said it was high time Zambia became like
Tanzania and Zimbabwe with pulp industries of their own as this
would help lessen the cost on the material.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia Union of Journalists (ZUJ) general secretary
Angels Banda said it was encouraging to note that the government
was beginning to recognize that local media needed to be protected
against foreign publications.
</P>
<P>
Zambian government has with immediate effect suspended the five
percent customs duty on all newsprint and slapped 25 percent duty
on all imported newspapers and periodicals in a deliberate move
aimed at boosting the newspaper industry and the manufacturing
sector in the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Previously, publishers never paid any duty on such
publications and the government hopes that the introduction of the
25 percent duty will work to the advantage of the local industry.

<HEADLINE> Audina Says Marriage Will Make Life Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's top female
badminton player Mia Audina believes her planned marriage to her
boyfriend this year will create stability in her life, ending the
turbulent ups and downs she has experienced in her career and her
life.
</P>
<P>
"Married people usually live peacefully and I hope that all the
gossip about my relationship with my boyfriend will die down once
we marry," Mia said after a practice session at the National
Badminton Center in Cipayung here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Mia, who turns 20 on August 22, denied that she had
set a February 26 date for her wedding with her boyfriend, Dutch
gospel singer Tylio Lobman.
</P>
<P>
"We will have our wedding service in the Netherlands before or
after the general election in June. That is our plan. We don't
even know if we can hold a wedding celebration here (in Indonesia),
" she said.
</P>
<P>
The executive chairman of the Badminton Association of
Indonesia Karsono said on Tuesday that Mia would marry Lobman on
February 26. Mia is scheduled to play in the Grand Prix Finals in
Bandar Seri Begawan around that date.
</P>
<P>
Lobman shares Mia'a views on the planned marriage, saying that
both of them hope to create a stable life that will help them
focus on their respective careers.
</P>
<P>
"This year is the right time for us to marry because we don't
think living in the public eye for so long is good for us," said
Lobman, whose mother is of Javanese descent.
</P>
<P>
Lobman is preparing a solo album which is expected to be
released later this month. Indonesian pop composer and musician
Dodo Zakaria is collaborating with him on the album.
</P>
<P>
Mia met Lobman in a South Jakarta church in mid-90s. Since
then, the love struck pair has been inseparable, with Lobman
always accompanying Mia to her badminton competitions.
</P>
<P>
Their romance, however, drew a barrage of criticism because of
a slump in form suffered by Mia. Her world ranking dropped from
number three to 11.
</P>
<P>
The rumours took a malicious turn when a Jakarta tabloid
recently reported that Mia might be pregnant. A sobbing Mia denied
the report.
</P>
<P>
"After our marriage, we hope the public will no longer blame my
defeats on Tylio," she was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesians love to gossip. They always had negative thoughts
every time I returned late to my dormitory after going out with
Tylio. Everybody blamed him without knowing that we had gone out
on family business," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mia said she would not retire after her marriage. She insisted
that she would qualify for the Sydney Olympic Games to make amends
for her loss in the finals at the Atlanta Games three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"God endowed me with a talent to play badminton and I mustn't
give it up. Besides, that's the only thing I can do now. I want to
play for six or seven more years. I'll compete in the Sudirman Cup
and the World Championships this year," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mia's marriage plan drew new criticism and questions.
</P>
<P>
National coach Liang Chiusia said she regretted Mia's decision,
although she said she would not ask her to cancel her plans.
</P>
<P>
"As a coach, I hope that she can accomplish even more. I had
hoped that she would top the world rankings and collect a lot of
titles before getting married," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that Mia will get pregnant too young. Her career
still has a bright future. But that's her decision," she added.

<HEADLINE> China to Slash Telecommunications Charges: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China will greatly reduce
charges for telecommunications service this year, Minister of
Information Industry Wu Jichuan said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference this morning that charges for
international telephone calls, telephone line installations, and
data communications all will be slashed. The current two-way
charge system for cellular telephones will be replaced by a one-
way charge system.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua after the press conference that the State
Council has already approved the charge reduction plan of his
ministry, and this major readjustment of telecommunications
charges is expected to be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
China's telecommunications sector has seen double-digit growth
for the past several years, and in 1998, it earned 229.5 billion
yuan in operations revenue, an increase of 25.4 percent over 1997.
This sector is expected to take in 285.2 billion yuan this year,
an 24 percent hike year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that it is necessary to lower telecommunications fees
so that consumers will benefit from technological advances and
expansion of the country's telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, China has reduced the average charge for a
telephone installation from 5,000 yuan to 1,100 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Levy on Portfolio Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia announced
Thursday the imposition of a levy on portfolio capital
repatriation to replace the 12-month holding period of foreign
portfolio capital in Malaysia's equity market.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imposed capital controls on September 1 last year,
keeping foreign portfolio capital for at least 12 months, which
Malaysian First Finance Minister Tun Daim said had contributed
significantly to economic stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
The levy is aimed at encouraging existing portfolio investors
to take a longer term view on their investments in the country and
discourage destabilizing short-term flows at the same time, Daim
Zainuddin told a press conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the new policy, made in response after the authorities
had had discussions with fund managers, would allow portfolio
investors to repatriate their capital and profits as well as
encourage new capital inflows into the country.
</P>
<P>
There are two categories of funds -- funds in Malaysia prior to
February 15, 1999 and those that come in on and after the date,
according to Daim.
</P>
<P>
He said the original capital brought into Malaysia before
February 15, 1999 would be allowed to be repatriated, subject to a
graduated levy based on the duration of investment.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules, for capital repatriated within a period
of up to seven months from the date of entry into Malaysia (since
September 1, 1998), the levy is 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
For a period exceeding seven months and up to nine months, the
levy is 20 percent and for a period exceeding nine months and up
to 12 months the levy is 10 percent and after 12 months, no levy
is imposed.
</P>
<P>
No levy will be imposed on the repatriation of profits made
within the 12-month holding period. But all profits made after the
12-month holding period will be subjected to a repatriation levy
of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dividends, interests and rentals are not subjected to any levy.
</P>
<P>
For funds brought in on and after February 15, 1999, the
principal is allowed to be repatriated without any levy.
</P>
<P>
Profits, however, will be subjected to a levy of 30 percent if
repatriated within a period of up 12 months from the date when
profits are made, and the levy is reduced to 10 percent if the
profit is repatriated after 12 months from the date profits are
made.
</P>
<P>
For purposes of control and monitoring, funds brought into
Malaysia on or after February 15, 1999 will be placed in special
external accounts to distinguish these funds from the existing
external accounts.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Population to Reach 26m by 2051: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia's population could
swell by more than 8 million, topping 26 million by the middle of
the next century, an official population study forecast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the nation's population from 18.53 million to
between 23.5 million and 26.4 million in 2051 was forecast in an
Australian federal government publication "Population Flows:
Immigration Aspects."
</P>
<P>
The publication released Thursday in Sydney by the Australian
Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, was based on
current migration levels and birth and death rates in the country,
which covers 7.68 million square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that at the end of June 1997, Australia's
population had increased by 221,500 people to 18.53 million, or
1.2 percent since the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Migrants arriving in Australia made up more than 43.2 percent
of this growth, while the remainder was due to the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
Women continued a post-World War II trend of having less
children, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
It showed Australia's fertility rate has steadily declined
during the 1990s with women in 1997 having an average of 1.775
children.
</P>
<P>
In the financial of 1997-1998, Australia took in 79,162
migrants, a fall of 17.4 percent on the 1996-1997 figure of 95,800
following cuts by the government in immigrant quotas.
</P>
<P>
Both the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the
Australian Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
have reached the same projection for the year 2051.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Economy Expected to Grow by 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The economy of China's
industrial and commercial center is predicted to grow by 9 percent
this year, according to information supplied by the municipality's
economic departments.
</P>
<P>
This figure is two percentage points higher than the nation's
average, and local economists say that such a growth rate is not
only necessary but also practical for such a high powered area.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's economy has maintained two-digit growth since 1992,
and rose by 10.1 percent last year despite a tough international
and domestic economic environment.
</P>
<P>
To continue a growth momentum in the industrial sector on the
basis of last year's 10.8 percent, Shanghai has given priority to
30 designated products, whose annual sales income is expected to
reach 150 billion yuan, accounting for one-fourth of total
industrial sales of the city.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will boost its exports by tapping markets in Europe,
North America, Latin America and Africa, and by encouraging joint-
ventures and private businesses to expand their exports.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiaoming, head of the Shanghai Municipal Foreign Trade and
Economic Commission, said that Shanghai will ensure its foreign
trade reaches 16.5 billion US dollars this year, 600 million US
dollars higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will also take various measures to stimulate
consumption, to bring about more than 13 billion yuan of retail
sales of consumer products on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
To raise the ratio of the service sector in the economy is
another task facing the municipality. Experts project that the
added value of the service sector will, for the first time, hit
200 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite many lingering economic problems such as dullish
domestic demand and increasing employment pressures, local
officials are still optimistic about hitting the target of nine
percent growth in 1999.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan President Calls for Political Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Thursday called on implementing a
constitutional initiative to resolve the ethnic strife which has
plagued the nation for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
In her speech to the nation to mark the 51st Independence Day,
President Kumaratunga said her government has addressed the urgent
and vexed task of designing a set of proposals to arrive at a
political solution to the ethnic problem between the majority
Sinhalese and minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this constitutional initiative is the
replacement of bigotry and intolerance by understanding; suspicion
by confidence; and exclusion by empowerment and fruitful
partnership," said the president.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance (PA) government proposed the
constitutional initiative in August, 1995. But the initiative was
shelved in Parliament because without the cooperation of the main
opposition United National Party the PA cannot secure a two-thirds
majority in Parliament to make amendments to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The president said the initiative was introduced by the
government to empower all ethnic groups, so that they will be full
partners and shareholders in the decision-making processes at all
levels of government.
</P>
<P>
She said once they are implemented, they will build a strong
basis for people of all races, religious, cultural and social
backgrounds, speaking all languages to build together a strong and
united country.
</P>
<P>
However, the initiative was rejected by Tamil rebels who have
been fighting a war against the government since 1983 for a
separate state of its own in the north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Massive Corruption Case Discovered in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Massive corruption and
irregularities at the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZ) have
cost the parastatal at least 1.4 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (over
35 million U.S. Dollars) over the last five years, the daily
Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, uncollected debts stand at more than
700 million Zimbabwean Dollars (over 17.5 million U.S. Dollars),
238 million (5.95 million U.S. Dollars) of which is for
unreceipted products delivered to clients.
</P>
<P>
Most managers were Wednesday sent on forced leave and a new
interim management team of professionals from the private and
public sectors was put in place.
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary investigation report compiled by the
 National Economic Conduct Inspectorate (NECI), debt management at
NOCZ was in shambles, maladministration rampant, the tender system
openly flouted, conflict of interest a common phenomenon, and some
managers had become part of cartels responsible for the financial
downfall of the giant oil company.
</P>
<P>
The report which was released Wednesday in Harare painted a
grim picture characterized by looting, lack of control, and
cheating on the part of those managers accused of misleading the
board while working to enrich themselves.
</P>
<P>
Most of the managers are said to be owners of large properties
whose value is inconsistent with their earnings or declared
sources of income, suggesting they could have been involved in
irregular practices.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport and Energy Enos Chikowore, who chaired an
inter- ministerial Cabinet Committee tasked with the initial NOCZ
probe, said the affairs of NOCZ were from Wednesday being run by a
team of experts drawn from the public and private sectors, with
Zimbabwe Investment Center director Nicholas Ncube as its acting
managing director.

market competition.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Industry Wu Jichuan said the central
government is reviewing this division proposal put forward by his
ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that paging services have already been separated from
the mammoth China Telecom and have been formed into an independent
company.
</P>
<P>
The mobile communication business also will soon be taken from
China Telecom and incorporated into a new company, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom will be left mainly with fixed telephone services,
including local and long-distance telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
With assets estimated at 560 billion yuan, China Telecom is the
dominating telecommunications company in China, accounting for
about 95 percent of the service market.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom, the only other operator authorized to offer
nationwide telecommunications services, has assets of only 130
million yuan and accounts for five percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
"The division of China Telecom is a major step to separate
enterprises from the government, introduce competition, accelerate
expansion, and break up the telecommunications services monopoly,"
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed division of China Telecom is "still under
discussion and yet to be approved by the State Council."

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand now has the
longest
job-seekers' queue since 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Household Labor Force Survey released
Thursday by Statistics New Zealand, 7.7 percent of the workforce
was
jobless in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
That was the highest percentage since the third quarter of
1994.
The rate was up from 7.5 percent in the previous quarter and 6.8
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Most economic statistics in New Zealand have been improving and

local economic analysts are expecting more growth in the New
Zealand
economy this year.
</P>
<P>
Employment figures often lag trends in the rest of the economy
as
companies delay laying off staff in the hope of riding out a
downturn.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Government Statistician Len Cook said in a release
that 144,000 people were unemployed in the last quarter of 1998,
up
5,000 from the previous quarter and 18,000 on the same quarter in
1997.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Associate Social Services Minister Peter McCardle
was
quoted as saying the figures are in line with expectations and
show
the lingering effects of last year's Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
"There is every reason to look forward to improving employment
statistics through 1999," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua)-- Areas in northern China may
experience a severe drought this spring, after a warm winter, the
13th in a row, and small amount of precipitation, experts have
warned.
</P>
<P>
About 6.7 million ha of farmland in China's major winter wheat
growing areas have suffered from the dry spell, according to Wen
Kegang, of the China Meteorology Administration.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists are urged to give priority to drought
information in the coming months to try to keep crop failures
caused by drought to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
The official was quoted by local media today as asking
meteorologists to tell local governments about major regional
weather changes within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, meanwhile, had a 650-km section that was
frozen, hampering irrigation efforts along the river. Ice blocks

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ringgit Peg to U.S. dollar to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian First Finance
Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin said Thursday the present ringgit peg
of 3.80 to the U.S. dollar since early September last year will
stay at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to review it at this stage," Daim, who is
also Special Functions Minister, said at a press conference here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Daim's statement came when some quarters have called for
changes, including the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and
Industry Malaysia (ACCCIM) whose President Lim Guan Teik said
Wednesday the peg rate of 3.80 ringgit to the greenback should be
raised to a more stronger level of 3.50 ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imposed the peg on September 2 last year to stop
speculation in the ringgit which depreciated markedly against
major currencies following the regional currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit was traded at about 2.70 to the U.S. dollar before
the crisis, but once fell to as low as 5.20 to the greenback,
severely disrupting the currency market and making the country's
imports very expensive.

<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Hur Seung-wook
of South Korea came from behind to beat Japan's Joji Kawaguchi,
winning his second gold by taking the men's slalom gold medal at
the Winter Asiad on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first two places of the event was a reversal of the giant
slalom on Tuesday when Kawaguchi beat Hur in the Rainbow Course.
</P>
<P>
Hur, also winner of the Super-G slalom Sunday, lagged behind
leader Kawaguchi in 55.15 seconds in the first round, surpassed
the Japanese after he clocked the best of the second round in 59.
53, which awarded him the gold with a total of 1:54.68.
</P>
<P>
Kawaguchi had to take the silver in 1:55.00, followed by
another South Korean Choi Moon Sung in 1:56.67.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Hur, who first joined the national team in 1987,
has been the "face" of the South Korean Alpine skiing team for the
past 12 years although Thursday's victory only marked his second
gold medal in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Hur took two silver medals at the second and third Winter
Asiads in Sapporo, Japan, in 1990 and in Harbin, China, in 1996
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean is known more for his technical skills rather
than his speed, according to his coach Hong Inki.
</P>
<P>
"Our Alpine skiers can win the international matches as South
Korea has one of the world's best Alpine slopes with the Rainbow
Course in Yongpyong," Hong added.
</P>
<P>
The Rainbow Course is familiar to Hur as he has his training
there over the year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Court Asks PM to Reply to Petition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Supreme Court has
passed an order asking for a statement from the prime minister on
her reported remarks concerning the highest court of justice, The
Daily Star newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The order, which came Wednesday after the Appellate Division of
the Supreme Court heard both the petitioner and the attorney
general in a contempt petition against Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, asked the attorney general to submit a statement within
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The is the first time in the country that a contempt petition
has been moved against an incumbent prime minister and the
country's highest court has asked for a written statement form the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The directive was issued upon a petition filed by Habibul Islam
Bhuiyan, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, who
quoted reports of two Bengali newspapers. The papers quoted Hasina
as saying at a press conference late last month that "1,200 bail
petitions were granted by the High Court in two days (in August
last year)... the matter was brought to the notice of the chief
justice who took no action, instead, expanded the bench," The
Independent daily reported.
</P>
<P>
He charged that the statement of the prime minister was
"contemptuous interference in the administration of justice and
had shaken the people's confidence in the judiciary."
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Mahmudul Islam said that what the prime
minister stated about granting of a large number of bail petitions
in two days was a fact, but the figure was not correct. "This was
an impromptu opinion of the prime minister, it is not a prepared
speech," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was neither contemptuous, nor was it intended to undermine

</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Prime minister

</P>
<P>
Extra troops, roadblocks, anti-aircraft weapons and helicopters

away from the Independence Square.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considers Small Contribution to Kosovo Peacekeeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States would send
a "relatively small" number of troops to Kosovo to help NATO
monitor a genuine peace accord, Defense Secretary William Cohen
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
And General Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, put the number at somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000 if NATO
settled on an overall force of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
Shelton, however, said the figures were hypothetical, but he
had no doubt that the United States would be asked to contribute.
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are still being worked," Shelton told a Senate
Armed Services Committee hearing on the U.S. defense budget.
</P>
<P>
"The numbers that we would be asked to give would depend on
what the final numbers are," he added.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia --
the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Russia --
last week ordered warring Serbs and ethnic Albanians to begin
negotiations in France by February 6. NATO has threatened air
strikes if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the "Kosovo
Liberation Army" fail to meet and reach a peace agreement by
February 19.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Cohen said that "there would have to be a real
agreement and not something that is illusory" before the United
States would consider sending troops to help monitor a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Any agreement would have to ensure that U.S. forces would not "
be caught in the cross-fire between the warring and ethnic
factions", he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen added that other NATO countries would have to provide the
majority of troops to a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that whatever contribution we make to NATO in this
regard should be relatively small by comparison because we have
been carrying a very large load," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows Vigilance on Food Aid to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agricultural Secretary Dan Glickman vowed the vigilance on
Russia's food aid delivery while announcing the signing by Moscow
of the final documents for the food shipment which would start
this month.
</P>
<P>
The food aid includes 885 million U.S. dollars of grains agreed
last November, and $35 million of poultry meat and $33 million of
seed just signed. The whole food aid package would amount to 953
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Glickman said, "if we believe that the shipments are being
illegally diverted or are not going to the right places or are
going into the pockets of organized crime, the shipments will be
stopped immediately."
</P>
<P>
"I think the Russians clearly understand that we are watching
them very closely," he said.
</P>
<P>
Marcy Kaptur, a member of the House Appropriations Committee,
said nine people had been assigned to monitor the aid shipments.
</P>
<P>
She would press to earmark part of the aid package "to get
decent inspectors on the ground" to monitor the delivery.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Agriculture Department plans to deliver the package of
grains, oilseeds and meat over a six-month period.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Accepts Pyongyang's Proposal on Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Thursday accepted a
proposal by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to
hold high-level political talks, but urged the DPRK to arrange the
talks unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
"We view the offer positively. We urge North Korea to schedule
the meeting without any conditions attached," the Unification
Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It is a new progress for the North to offer dialogue with the
South in the name of high-level political talks, presidential
spokesman Park Jie-won said Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The North's Wednesday proposal on high-level political talks
and its move toward an agreement on a visit by a U.S. mission to
its Kumchangni underground facility showed that the socialist
country was moving in the right direction," said the presidential
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that substantial development in inter-
Korean exchanges and cooperation could be achieved if such
positive moves by the North could be further expanded.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the South Korean government, political parties
and people from all walks of life on Wednesday through the truce
village of Pamunjon, the DPRK proposed "inter-Korean high-level
political talks to discuss ways of "preventing war and providing
an epoch-making opportunity for national reunification."
</P>
<P>
However, Pyongyang said that for the political talks, South
Korea must first renounce anti-DPRK cooperation with foreign
powers, suspend joint military exercises with the United States,
repeal the National Security Law and guarantee free activities of
unification and patriotic organizations.

<HEADLINE> Thai Education Ministry Seeks Funds for Compulsory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite a 5-percent budget
increase, the Education Ministry of Thailand is seeking another
3.5 billion baht (97.2 million U.S. dollars) partly to fund its
12-year compulsory education project, a ministry official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official quoted Education Minister Panja Kesornthong as
saying after a review of budget spending plans for fiscal 2000

program, the private Education Commission and a milk distribution
project for some private schools.
</P>
<P>
The minister has ordered all the agencies to revise their
budget spending plans, due to be submitted to the Budget Bureau
for consideration Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the initial plan, the Primary Education
Commission receives the largest share of some 8 billion baht
(222.2 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Feature: Myanmar to Turn Pyin Oo Lwin Into Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is striving to turn Pyin
Oo Lwin in central Mandalay division into a coffee growing region
where arable land has been found for the move.
</P>
<P>
Pyin Oo Lwin, previously known as Maymyo, is reported to have
good climatic and physical conditions for successful cultivation
of coffee.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Farm Enterprise under the Ministry of Agriculture
and Irrigation has allotted 1,912 hectares of reclaimed land in
the area to thousands of local private growers for coffee
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
According to the enterprise, plans are under way to grow about
2,000 coffee plants and 220 shady trees per acre (0.405 hectare)
of land in the areas to make the region lush and green.
</P>
<P>
In the years prior to the fruiting of coffee trees, mixed
cropping used to be done.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise is also planning to extend the cultivation of
coffee plantations to other states such as Shan, Kachin and Chin
which have climatic and physical features similar to Pyin Oo Lwin.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Vietnam provided to Myanmar Catimor variety of coffee
seeds which was grown on an experimental basis at state-owned
coffee plantations in Pyin Oo Lwin area with good yield of
high-quality coffee achieved.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1 million Catimor coffee saplings have been
distributed to growers in the region in the 1998-99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is one of Myanmar's main crops having an average annual
production of 2,000 tons of coffee beans in the last three years,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The state enterprises procured annually 50 tons of coffee beans
for local distribution, exports and industrial use in the past
three years.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Set to Be World Top Glove Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The rubber glove industry in
Thailand recorded a double growth last year and the trend is
expected to continue this year, an official from the Board of
Investment (BOI) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is expected to overtake its neighbor Malaysia as the
world's largest producer within two years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Rubber gloves have been among the few industries that still
enjoyed significant growth amid the economic recession.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 13 new investors received promotional privileges
from the BOI. Their combined production capacity will be 8 billion
pieces per year, compared with 5 billion in 1997 produced by five
BOI-promoted manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The new investors would employ up to 7,400 workers.
</P>
<P>
The BOI official said the success of the industry should be
attributed to the abundant and low-cost local supplies of quality
materials.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been the world's largest supplier of rubber sap
and raw rubber sheets since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia currently faces problems ranging from a shortage of
raw materials to domestic economic and political trouble.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many foreign investors have shifted to Thailand,
particularly the southern part of the country.

but now circumcisions in hospital have become quite popular
because they are safer, cheaper, more hygienic, and allow for a
quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
Hasmu, a 31-year old Uygur, took his 7-and-a-half-year old son
to a nearby hospital recently for the operation. Twenty minutes
later, the boy walked out of the operation room with a smile.
Thanks to the anesthesia, he'd felt no pain even though he was a
bit nervous.
</P>
<P>
These days, Hasmu says, many boys of his son's age get
circumcised in a hospital and often recover within a week. He
himself still feels the fear when he recalls his own circumcision
24 years ago. "My father invited an imam to our home for the
circumcision when I was seven. I had a burning pain and remained
in bed for a month," he explained.
</P>
<P>
On many occasions, the imam wore a robe with long sleeves and
kept the scalpel in his sleeves to keep the children from being
afraid. This method of circumcision often resulted in infections
and difficulties in urinating, Hasmu said. This tradition still
survives in some remote rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The custom can be traced back to ancient times on the Arabian
Peninsula. It traveled to China with Islam and is an accepted
practice among the Uygurs, Hui, Kazaks, and some Han. It teaches
that a male child should have his prepuce cut in an odd month at
seven years of age. To prevent infections, the operation was often
done in spring or in autumn.
</P>
<P>
Abul'ahat, a doctor at the Friendship Hospital in Urumqi, the
capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said that it's a
simple surgical operation that usually takes about 20 minutes and
costs 50 to 60 yuan.
</P>
<P>
It has been demonstrated that people who are circumcised have
are less likely to suffer from cancer of the penis and a growing
number of other ethnic minorities are trying to be circumcised
before the marriage because they think it will help their sex life,
he said.
</P>
<P>
All major hospitals in Xinjiang do circumcisions, he said. His
hospital performs 400 such operations a year. Winter and summer
holidays are the busiest times.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadjan Ahat, a Uygur scholar, said that the shift to
hospitals and from clergymen to doctors shows how the traditional
culture is merging with modern tendencies.

<HEADLINE> Illegal IP Telephony Operation Strictly Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Illegal operation of IP
telephony is an act of information smuggling and should be
strictly banned, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunjiang, director of the Telecommunications
Administrative Bureau under the Ministry of Information Industry,
told a press conference that the ministry has decided in principle
to apply the IP telephony, a kind of Internet-related telephone
service, to the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already entrusted several telecommunication
companies to run the business on a trial basis, Zhang said, adding
that licenses will be formally issued later this year.
</P>
<P>
"The IP telephony should be subject to the strict government
regulation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the country has suffered an annual loss of
billions of yuan to the illegal operation by some domestic
operators in collusion with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
"We'll reinforce the crackdown on such unlawful practices," he
told the press conference.

COLOMBO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Twenty nine members of Sri
Lanka's North Western Provincial Council (NWPC) from the ruling
People's Alliance (PA) took oaths Wednesday while those from the
opposition boycotted the ceremony, informed sources said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PA won 30 seats out of 52 in the bitterly contested NWPC
election which was held last Monday, beating the opposition United
Nation Party (UNP) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which
obtained 19 and three seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of the results touched off protests from
opposition parties and religious leaders who accused the PA of
rigging the elections and demanded cancellation of election
results.
</P>
<P>
However, the government denied the allegations and instead
charged the UNP with resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
The UNP and the JVP have also declared that they would boycott
the new council. But earlier the PA leader of the provincial
council S.B. Nawinna said he will take office as chief minister
whether the opposition comes in or not.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Chinese
people have turned to post offices for savings deposit services, a
senior officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Post offices across the country registered a 313.3 billion yuan

Postal savings deposits, Wu said, are some of the healthiest in
China's finance sector, and, thanks to strict management, the risk
of losses from bad operations are kept low.
</P>
<P>
Post offices now handle over 90 percent of individual
remittances in China. About 120 million people have opened savings
accounts with post offices since they resumed postal savings
deposit services in April 1984.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the postal service has a network of 5,738
outlets in 527 cities around the country, and they also provide
debit cards, or "green cards," that allow customers to send money
all over the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, post offices handled more than five million
transactions, worth more than 43 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Russia Wednesday
urged the conflicting parties in Kosovo to start negotiations
before the February 6 deadline set by the six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mikhailova and visiting
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov met and discussed the Balkan
situation, particularly the Kosovo issue here.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after their meeting, the two
ministers called on the parties in the Kosovo conflict to begin
negotiations as scheduled at Rambouillet near Paris.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailova said that a lasting peace in the province must be
achieved without altering the existing borders of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that the way out of the crisis is to speed up the
negotiation process and the establishment of an autonomous
authority should be done within the borders of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister added that any diplomatic initiative aimed
at resolving international issues, especially those such as the
Kosovo crisis, should not be monopolized by a particular side.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group which handles Balkan diplomacy issued a
summons last Friday to the Yugoslav government and representatives
of Kosovo Albanians to take part in the talks to discuss autonomy
for the province.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) threatened to
attack Yugoslavia's military targets and block the borders between
Albania and Kosovo if either side in the conflict refuses to sit
down at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit, also met
Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov, National Assembly Chairman
Iordan Sokolov and Prime Minister Ivan Kostov on Wednesday. Both
sides agreed to develop an equal and mutual beneficial
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister announced to offer a preferential
trade status to Bulgaria from March 1, under which customs duties
on Bulgarian exports to Russia will be reduced by 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Predicted to Remain Sluggish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy is
predicted to remain gloomy in the first half of this year but
would begin to pick up after the general election scheduled for
June 7, a director of Indonesian central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The economic recovery would depend not only on an improved
monetary policy but also on other factors, particularly a
successful bank recapitalization program and general election,
Bank Indonesia (BI) Director Miranda Goeltom told a seminar here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She forecast that the economy would contract by up to 2 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
After hitting by the worst monetary crisis since July in 1997,
the value of the Indonesian rupiah has lost more than 70 percent
against the U.S. dollar. The country's economic growth in 1998 was
minus 13.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is to hold a general election in June and a
presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita also said Indonesia's economic
recovery would depend on a successful general election and
consistency in implementing economic reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Described as one of the most important move to overcome the
prolonged economic crisis, the Indonesian government has decided
to finalize the recapitalization of more than 70 troubled banks in
the country by June this year.
</P>
<P>
The funds required for the bank recapitalization program are
estimated at as much as a third of the gross domestic product, or
between 35 billion and 40 billion U.S. dollars. The government
will finance 80 percent of the recapitalization program by issuing
bonds.

<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China's State Drug
Administration Law will be revised and drafting of a law of
professional pharmaceutists is under consideration.
</P>
<P>
The State Drug Administration (SDA) said it plans to take firm
measures to clean up national medicine market disrupted by
increasing amount of fake and substandard medicines.
</P>
<P>
A selective inspection on some major categories of medicines,
from July to September last year, showed that 13 percent of the
products tested failed to reach national standards and posed
potential threats to public health, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
SDA's head Zheng Xiaoyu said Wednesday that law enforcement
would be tightened to root out profiteering from making and
selling fake and substandard medicines.
</P>
<P>
Gradually the pharmaceutical market would be standardized to
promote the healthy development of the pharmaceutical sector, he
said, quoted by the paper.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the country needed more rules and regulations
for drug administration because some existing laws and regulations
have become outdated with the development of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Drug administration departments have been asked to be entirely
separated from industries in order to ensure their independent
role of market supervisor, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China's New Rules to Control Use of Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Land and
Resources will implement new legal and administrative means to
strengthen the control of land, ocean and exploitation of mineral
resources.
</P>
<P>
The new law on land administration took effect on January 1,
under which a national program of overall planning of the country'
s land use has been worked out and approved by the State Council,
putting 80 percent of the farmland under strict protection.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Minister Zhou Yongkang as saying
that the ministry would promulgate three sets of regulations this
year to govern annual land-use, land-occupying construction
projects and land that has been taken out of production.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's ministry is also drafting three other new regulations on
managing the transactions of the land-use rights, land-leasing and
collecting fees from new land occupying construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The work of land-use arrangement is being carried out step by
step and an advanced monitoring mechanism has been established to
provide basis for strengthening enforcement, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Last year, seven illegal cases of land transactions and land-
occupation for the construction of non-agricultural projects, such
as golf courses, were cracked down on and made public to increase
the public awareness.
</P>
<P>
Zhou also noted that this year was very important for improving
the order in mineral exploration and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The certificate-renewing process starting from this year will
be employed to bar small and poorly-equipped enterprises from
exploiting mineral resources, as they often seriously polluted the
environment, according to Zhou.

<HEADLINE> Cardoso Confirms Talks With IMF Progressing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Cardoso said Wednesday that talks with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) on a rescue fund had made significant advances, and
expressed his confidence that foreign capital would return to the
country.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with IMF's First Deputy Managing Director Stanley
Fischer, Cardoso said that talks on IMF's rescue deal to Brazil
were progressing.
</P>
<P>
"We are again stressing what Brazil's goals should be in the
face of a new economic scenario," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, Finance Minister Pedro Malan and a team of IMF
economists reviewed on Tuesday and Wednesday the terms of a 41.5
billion U.S. dollars IMF-led aid package financed last November in
light of Brazil's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the naming of a third central bank president, Cardoso
said it was a necessary evil to restore investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the floating of the currency had allowed the
central bank to save its hard currency reserves and the government
would take measures to prevent the return of hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
Fischer will return to the United States Thursday and the IMF
team, who arrived Brazil last Saturday, will finish their
activities next weekend.

<HEADLINE> Haitian President Calls For Dialogue on Credible Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Haitian President Rene Preval on
Wednesday called for a dialogue with the opposition over the
creation of a "credible" electoral organization, reports from Port-
Au-Prince said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech broadcast on local TV, Preval said that talks and
elections were the only possible way to end the 20-month political
crisis which has left the country without a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Preval said that foreign observers should be allowed to monitor
the elections to ensure the "credibility" of the process.
</P>
<P>
Preval's message came one day after his met with Haiti's main
opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
The head of the opposition Democratic Union Federation, Evans
Paul, criticized Preval for not having called for talks during
Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Haiti's political crisis became acute last month when Preval
dissolved congress without calling new elections and threatened to
rule by decree.
</P>
<P>
Haiti has been without a prime minister since June 1997 after
Rosny Smarth stepped down.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Plastics Producers Lose Price Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's plastic producers
are about to lose their price competitiveness in the world market
to rival neighboring countries, according to the Federation of
Thai Industries.
</P>
<P>
Thongchai Ampiegulwatana, chairman of the Plastic Industry Club
of the federation, was quoted Thursday by the Bangkok Post as
saying other countries in the ASEAN, as well as India and China,
were stepping up their export drives in an intensely competitive
market environment.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's price disadvantage was caused by high investment
costs and interest rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Thailand's manufacturers will need to
invest 50 billion baht (1.38 billion U.S. dollars) to upgrade
technology to produce higher-value products.
</P>
<P>
The club expects exports of plastic products this year to be
worth 30 billion baht (833 million dollars), the same as last
year. Exports of plastic pellets would also total 30 billion baht
(833 million dollars), up 17 percent.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why VFA Meets Strong Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A year after Washington and
Manila reached the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), the fate of
the proposed accord has not been decided yet due to the strong
opposition of senators, church leaders and other politicians in
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, which would enable large-scale joint military
exercises, must be ratified by the Philippine Senate before it
becomes a treaty, although U.S. President Bill Clinton has already
signed it as an executive agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration submitted the draft VFA to the
senate for ratification last October, but until now the senate is
still deliberating on it, because of the strong opposition in the
country, a former U.S. colony.
</P>
<P>
Calling the covenant disadvantageous to the Philippines, the
Catholic Bishops Conference (CBCP) last Friday even called for
re-negotiation on the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Within the senate, according to local press reports, three
senators are strongly opposed to the VFA, while five are in favor
and eight have not expressed clearly their opinions.
</P>
<P>
The public is also divided over the VFA, as there are heated
debates over the issue in the newspapers and TV programs. A lot of
people have staged demonstrations recently against the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Why is the VFA facing such strong opposition in the
Philippines?
</P>
<P>
One very touchy point is the matter of nuclear arms. The
Philippine Constitution has an explicit policy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
But the phrase "nuclear arms" is nowhere to be found in the
draft. Instead, what is provided is that U.S. vessels and aircraft
may enter Philippine territory "in accordance with procedures
stipulated in implementing arrangements," says a Today newspaper
commentary.
</P>
<P>
But there is no hint of what the "implementing arrangements"
will be, it says. In effect, the commentary says, the draft
amounts to a request by the executive department to be given the
blanket discretion to allow or not to allow entry of nuclear-armed
vessels and aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Mexican President Pushes for Electricity Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo said here on Tuesday that he would push the endorsement of
two constitutional amendments at congress to allow the
participation of both domestic and foreign private investors in
electricity production, distribution and commercialization.
</P>
<P>
"It is indispensable to transfer from a system limiting private
participation in the electric industry to a new one promoting it,"
Zedillo said in a message to the nation Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would only prepare the reforms and that
the next administration would launch the privatization in 2000.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, however, that the state would maintain its grip on
the process.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said the government needed 250 million dollars for the
electricity sector over the next six years. But he added that the
privatization was "not due to any short-term financial pressure."

<HEADLINE> China Builds Leading Information Technology Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China has built one of the
world's leading information technology manufacturing industries,
Minister of Information Industry Wu Jichuan said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu told a a press conference this morning that the nation's
information technology (IT) products sales reached 310 billion
yuan (37 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, up 14.1 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
He noted that sales revenues for telecommunications services
grew by 25.4 percent on a year-on-year basis to 229.5 billion yuan
(27.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
China has emerged as the world's major producer of telephones,
TV sets and stereo equipment. In addition, the 1998 output for
personal computers hit 2.88 million units, up 73.9 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China also produced 33 million program-controlled
telephone switchboards, 32.7 million color TV sets and 1.5 billion
integrated circuit boards, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
Rapidly increasing market demand has been the driving force
behind the expansion of China's IT industry.
</P>
<P>
The number of cellular telephone subscribers in China grew by
11.3 million last year, with the country producing 10.2 million
handsets. Some 98 percent of 22.2 million telephone switches
installed during 1998 were produced domestically.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that Chinese manufacturers have developed
internationally competitive IT products, including mobile
communications equipment and program-controlled telephone switches.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that China exported IT products valued at
over 27 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Coastal areas fueled the rapid growth of the country's IT
industry. Eight provinces and municipalities in coastal areas
accounted for 85 percent of the total 1998 output for the IT
industry. South China's Guangdong Province was the first province
in the nation to break the 100 billion yuan sales barrier for IT
products.

Sanguinetti on Wednesday vowed to continue pushing forward the

Cardoso said his country would overcome the current financial
troubles and resume its strong position within Mercosur.

<HEADLINE> Italy to End Conscription in Five to Six Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Italy is to end the conscription
system and transform its armed forces into a professional body in
five to six years, Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Defense Committee of the Lower House,
Scognamiglio said the process, which will open up military careers
to women on an equal footing, would cost the country two trillion
lire (1.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the "quality leap" brought about by the transformation
would need adequate financial resources, urging the parliament to
take actions to boost the recruitment incentives.
</P>
<P>
Valdo Spini, the committee chairman, said one of the main
considerations for the transformation was Italy's growing role in
the international peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
He added that as the number of conscripts has fallen steadily
in recent years, the new model armed forces would be composed of
well-motivated professional soldiers.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why VFA Meets Strong Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another issue which has aroused a fierce debate is the criminal
jurisdiction over erring U.S. military personnel.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed agreement, U.S. soldiers could enjoy
immunity if they commit crimes when they are on duty in the
Philippines and the U.S. side would decide how to deal with the
criminals.
</P>
<P>
But many Filipinos described the provision as unfair, unequal
and discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
"Are we, or are we not, a free and independent country that has
sovereignty over our territory? This is the crux of the matter. If
we allow America to decide whose laws are applicable and
enforceable within our territory, what does that make of our
country, a protectorate?" asks a Malaya newspaper columnist.
</P>
<P>
Under the public pressure, local reports said, the senate
favors improvements on certain provisions of the VFA, among which
are such matters as a more controllable criminal jurisdiction over
erring U.S. military personnel and a categorical declaration from
the U.S. troops on whether they are carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, the Estrada administration has rejected the call for
re-negotiation on the VFA, saying the agreement is "most favorable
to the country under the prevailing conditions."
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said Monday that there is
no need to re-negotiate the VFA since it was forged after
"extensive talks between representatives of the Philippines and
the United States."
</P>
<P>
He said President Estrada has urged the senate to look at the
VFA from a "global stand point and from the large context of the
country's relations with an economic power."
</P>
<P>
But some politicians still do not agree to the government
stand. Senator Raul Roco said that before the VFA is satisfied, it
should satisfy the constitutional provision calling for an
independent foreign policy and banning of nuclear weapons from
Philippine territory.
</P>
<P>
Since the VFA has divided the public and even the senate
deeply, its fate is unknown despite the government's strong appeal
for the senate ratification, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> UK Voices Concerns about Russia's Space Mirror Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- British astronomers Wednesday
reiterated their grave concerns about the threat that Russian
space mirror test poses to fundamental astronomical studies.
</P>
<P>
The 25-meter space mirror Znamya, designed to direct strong
beams of sunlight down to places on Earth where it is night, is
scheduled to be tested by Russian cosmonauts aboard the Mir space
station on 4th February.
</P>
<P>
Such an experiment will inevitably cause unwanted light
pollution in the night sky, which could impede many ground-based
observatories at remote dark site, UK's Royal Astronomical Society
said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, radar studies of our own atmosphere could be
seriously hindered by the presence of many reflectors or large
individual reflectors," the society said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Although it has been done before, Thursday's mission will be
the world's first controlled space mirror. It will be able to
control the direction of the reflected light beam to a given spot
on the Earth for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
If the deployment of the reflecting surface is successful and
the light beam can be controlled accurately, observers in parts of
Europe and North America may witness a light in the sky
significantly brighter than the full Moon for up to several
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Two cities in North America as well as some in Europe will be
illuminated during the 24-hour experiment.

ROME, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema Wednesday reaffirmed that Italy supports the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's guidelines over the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking prior to Saturday's peace talks, at Rambouillet,
outskirts of Paris, D'Alema called for more international efforts
to halt slayings of civilians and bring culprits before an

</P>
<P>
As for the peace talks, D'Alema stressed the importance of
persuading the Albanian government to push ethnic Albanians in the
Serbian province of Kosovo to accept broad autonomy within
Yugoslavia, rather than independence.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema once again highlighted the risk of the fighting
degenerating into full-scale war and sparking an exodus into Italy.
</P>

talks, stressing that "it is the only possible solution" for all
parties concerned.

<HEADLINE> Imelda Marcos to Be Tried for Dollar Salting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of the
Philippines Wednesday ordered a lower court to try former first
lady Imelda Marcos on 24 counts of illegally maintaining U.S.
dollar accounts abroad, the Journal newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court also castigated Judge David Nitafan of the
Manila Regional Trial Court for dismissing the charges, filed by
the government in 1992, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The government charged Imelda Marcos with "dollar salting" in
violation of a Central Bank regulation prohibiting Filipinos from
maintaining foreign currency accounts abroad without the bank's
permission.
</P>
<P>
The charges stemmed from the discovery of deposits belonging to
the Marcoses in Swiss banks shortly after the former president was
ousted by a revolt in February 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss accounts, which have been claimed by succeeding
administrations as part of Marcos' alleged ill-gotten wealth, have
gathered interest over the years and are now valued about 570
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The money has been transferred to an escrow account in a
Philippine bank, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Each count for Imelda Marcos carries a five-year jail term, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Gloomy Prospects for Indonesia's Instant Noodles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- This year's prospects for
Indonesia's instant noodle industry are gloomy due to the economic
crisis, the head of the country's top instant noodle manufacturer
said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect no growth in the demand for instant noodle in 1999,"
the president director of PT Indofood Sukses Makmur Eva Rianti
Hutapea said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rising price of instant noodles in the market, to cover
expenses on wheat imports, will discourage consumers from
increasing their purchase of the commodity, Hutapea was quoted by
Antara News Agency Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman of Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry for Food and Various Industry and Pharmacy Thomas
Darmawan, Indonesia is the second biggest instant noodles market
in the world with 8.6 billion packs sold in 1997, which was second
only to China with a total of 16 billion packs in the same year.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that domestic consumption of noodles dropped by 600
million packs in 1998 due to the economic crisis and the increase
in the price of wheat flour.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we are projecting that noodle consumption will be
flat, which constitutes an improvement already from the currently
declining consumption," Darmawan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) on Wednesday praised Chile's economic policy, which has
led to a strong growth and decreasing inflation in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report on the Chilean economy, the IMF also
lauded the Chilean authorities for their continued commitment to
implementing cautious macroeconomic policies.
</P>
<P>
The IMF report noted that last year Chile reacted promptly to
the world financial turmoil to curb pressure on its currency, the
peso.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted good economic prospects for Chile this
year due to healthy economic indicators, a strong banking system,
adequate hard currency reserves and favorable debt indicators.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF warned that the possible worsening of global
and regional conditions might affect Chile's trade balance and
market confidence.
</P>
<P>
The IMF expressed support for Chile's 1999 economic goals,
including a 3 percent economic growth, a lower 4.3 percent
inflation and a reduced current account deficit of between 5
percent and 5.5 percent of gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Rules Out Currency Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The head of Yugoslavia People'
s Bank Dusan Vlatkovic Wednesday ruled out the possibility of
devaluing the currency, the dinar, for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Vlatkovic made the remark in a televised speech in response to
the widening gap between the official foreign exchange rate and
that of the black market over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was officially traded at 10.39 dinars on
Wednesday while the exchange rate was as high as 14.3 dinars per
dollar on the black market.
</P>
<P>
Vlatkovic attributed the growing gap to an imbalance between
the supply and demand of foreign currencies, namely, businesses'
demand of foreign currencies for imports which exceed the value of
exports.
</P>
<P>
Vlatkovic said Yugoslavia could narrow the gap between the
official exchange rate and the black market as long as it
increased its exports and foreign revenues.
</P>
<P>
If it failed to do that, Vlatkovic said, Yugoslavia People's
Bank would intervene by reducing the currency issuance volume.
</P>
<P>
The banker said the People's Bank would continue to pursue
strict financial policies this year and would keep the currency
issue in the first quarter at the same level as the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The bank will consider increasing the volume of currency
issuance in the second quarter on the basis of growing production
and expanding exports, Vlatkovic added.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Defends Trade Pact with Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian Prime Minister's
Office on Wednesday denied that the country's proposed free trade
pact with Croatia would affect its bid for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The office was responding to complaints by European Union
officials who said the trade pact was incompatible with EU
membership, the official Hungarian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hungary would consider related policies and regulations when it
joined the EU, but before that, it had the right to sign
agreements with any countries including those that had not signed
free trade pacts with the bloc, the office argued.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Slovenia had signed a similar agreement
with Croatia, but drew no criticism from the EU, adding that more
countries were ready to sign similar agreements in the future.
</P>
<P>
The office reiterated that the planned pact was aimed at
strengthening bilateral ties and promoting trade between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Hungarian Prime Minister Orban Viktor paid a
three-day official visit to Croatia, during which he and Croatian
leaders discussed plans for a free trade pact and a free trade
zone.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Admit Political Motives in Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian police Wednesday
admitted that the riots in Ambon, capital of Maluku province, were
a direct consequence of "power games" among Jakarta's political
elite.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that there was a political ploy (behind the riots). I
am not making an accusation but there have been factual reports
that top levels were involved in the Ambon riots," National Police
Chief General Roesmanhadi said.
</P>
<P>
Police have only been able to arrest those who were directly
involved in the riots, even though they have a fairly good idea of
who coordinated and masterminded the massive unrest, Roesmanhadi
told reporters after meeting with members of the U.N. Human Rights
Commission here.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the provocateurs in the field were (following
orders) from coordinators, but the provocateurs arrested so far
have not admitted there were any coordinators," he was quoted by
the press here Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Roesmanhadi said the security situation in Ambon has not
returned to normal because there remain considerable mistrust and
tension among locals.
</P>
<P>
The violence, which erupted on January 19, was sparked by a
fight between a Muslim migrant and a local Christian public
transport driver. The incident quickly degenerated into full-scale
riots between members of the two religious communities.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Karyono, the provincial police chief, Wednesday said
the bloody riots killed at least 95 people and injured 226 others.
Police have detained 80 suspects while 120 others are awaiting
interrogation.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
plans to increase its exports this year by five percent, according
to a senior trade official.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Zhejiang's exports expanded by 7.
7 percent to 10.8 billion U.S. dollars last year, the fourth

department of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhong said that efforts will be made to increase market share
in Europe and the United States, try to recover diminished exports
to East Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and
tap markets in Africa, South America, the Middle East and East
Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that about a quarter of Zhejiang's products will be
exported this year, with the major export commodities including
silk, tea, textiles, garments, foodstuff, handicraft, machinery,
electronics, daily light industrial goods, medicine, chemical
products, and livestock products.

<HEADLINE> Gloomy Prospects for Indonesia's Instant Noodles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- This year's prospects for
Indonesia's instant noodle industry are gloomy due to the economic
crisis, the head of the country's top instant noodle manufacturer
said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect no growth in the demand for instant noodle in 1999,"
the president director of PT Indofood Sukses Makmur Eva Rianti
Hutapea said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rising price of instant noodles in the market, to cover
expenses on wheat imports, will discourage consumers from
increasing their purchase of the commodity, Hutapea was quoted by
Antara News Agency Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman of Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry for Food and Various Industry and Pharmacy Thomas
Darmawan, Indonesia is the second biggest instant noodles market
in the world with 8.6 billion packs sold in 1997, which was second
only to China with a total of 16 billion packs in the same year.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that domestic consumption of noodles dropped by 600
million packs in 1998 due to the economic crisis and the increase
in the price of wheat flour.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we are projecting that noodle consumption will be
flat, which constitutes an improvement already from the currently
declining consumption," Darmawan said.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Severity of Indonesia's Crisis Underestimated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Director for Asia-Pacific Hubert Neiss has said the IMF had
underestimated the severity of the economic crisis in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We have indeed underestimated the severity of the crisis, but
we have immediately changed and improved our policies in helping
Indonesia pull out of the economic turmoil," Neiss said here
Wednesday prior to a meeting with several Indonesian cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Neiss admitted that a mistake had been made in predicting the
crisis when Indonesia turned to the IMF in October 1997 for a
multi-billion-dollar rescue package to help solve the crisis and
the mistake continued to go on until May 1998, official Antara
News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under a series of agreements signed by the Indonesian
government and the IMF before May 1997, Indonesia was urged to
conduct wide-ranging economic reforms, including the close of 16
private banks. IMF estimated that Indonesia's economy would
recover immediately after the economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said, "If you look up in the 'letter of intent' signed
after May 1998 we predicted the gross domestic product (GDP) would
contract by 15 percent. Thus, we no longer made a mistake."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is in the grip of its worst economic crisis in 30
years, with the rupiah (national currency) losing more than 70
percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Neiss is here for a one-week visit to review the economic
recovery program the IMF has orchestrated for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The 182-nation lending agency would not structurally change the
macroeconomic program prepared for Indonesia as it has always been
making improvements, Neiss said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A vice president from the
Los Angeles Lakers said the team is interested in Dennis Rodman,
the seven-time rebounding champion.
</P>
<P>
Jerry West spoke with Rodman's new agent, Steve Chasman, on
Tuesday, and was awaiting word from the 37-year-old forward.
</P>
<P>
Rodman has said he would like to play for the Miami Heat or the
Orlando Magic, but neither team can offer him enough money.
</P>
<P>
"We've discussed it, but everyone's putting the cart before the
horse," West told the Los Angeles Times tody. "We don't have any
idea whether there's any interest on his part."
</P>
<P>
The Lakers can offer Rodman a veteran minimum starting salary
of 1 million US dollars under the new labor deal. Rodman has
earned 9 millions last season with the Chicago Bulls.

<HEADLINE> Younger Chinese More Concerned About Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Younger people in China are
more concerned about environmental protection, according to a
recent survey by the Chinese Youth Research Center and Development
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,796 questionnaires were distributed among young
people in 27 cities in China, and 6,534 were returned, an official
with the foundation said today.
</P>
<P>
Some 81.2 percent of the interviewees think that it's very
important to protect the environment, while only 14.9 percent
regard it as relatively important.
</P>
<P>
Those who take the same view on environmental protection
account for 86.2 percent of the interviewees below 19, and this
percentage make up 79.3 percent among the age group between 20 and
24, and 78.8 percent over the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that awareness of environmental
protection is not necessarily connected to education standards.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Financial Market Weakens on 3rd Central Banker in Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian stock markets
and currency trading closed slightly weaker Wednesday after the
naming of the third central bank president in one month.
</P>
<P>
In Sao Paulo, Latin America's largest stock exchange, the
Bovespa index on Wednesday closed down 0.6 percent on thin volume,
following Tuesday's appointment of international finance
specialist Arminio Fraga.
</P>
<P>
The real, Brazil's currency, traded 1.78 against the dollar,
down slightly from Tuesday's close but much above Monday's 1.91.
</P>
<P>
Fraga, 42, who has a Ph.D.degree in economy from Princeton
University and is a former advisor to billionaire financier George
Soros, replaced Francisco Lopes who stayed in office only three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
During Lopes' brief stint in office, the real was allowed to
float freely on the markets and lost over 40 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
Most financial analysts welcomed Fraga's nomination, saying his
expertise would avoid a moratorium on Brazil's internal and
foreign debts and controls on foreign currency transactions.
</P>
<P>
But others said that his close ties with Soros, one of the
world's most powerful speculators, would lead to his focusing more
on the needs of the international financial community rather than
on Brazil's economic growth needs.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Refuses to Extradite Osama bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A high-level Taliban
delegation Wednesday met U.S. Under Secretary of State for South
Asian Affairs Karl Inderfurth, but refused to extradite Saudi
dissident Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Afghan sources said Wednesday night that the Taliban delegation
led by Maulvi Jalil Akhund, a senior Taliban official responsible
for foreign affairs, met Inderfurth here and reiterated the
Taliban's policy toward bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
It was the first high-level contact between the United States
and the Taliban militia since the U.S. air strike at the alleged
terrorist camps run by bin Laden in Afghanistan's province of
Khost in August last year.
</P>
<P>
Jalil arrived here in a special plane for talks with Inderfurth
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth, who accompanied U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott for the eighth round of talks on nuclear
non-proliferation with Pakistan, stayed here for talks with the
Pakistani government and the Taliban on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The United States conveyed its serious concern to the Taliban
over the presence of bin Laden in the Taliban-controlled area and
his threats to the Americans, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched a Cruise missile attack on
Afghanistan's Khost Province in August last year in a move to
eliminate bin Laden, who however remained unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Inderfurth visited Peshawar, capital of
Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, and met Afghan opposition
leaders and intellectuals in the city.
</P>
<P>
Afghan opposition leaders criticized the Taliban policies in
the meeting with Inderfurth and called for an active role by the
United States in the settlement of the long-running Afghan crisis.

<HEADLINE> IRA Suspects Admit Manslaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Four of the five Irish
Republican Army men accused of murdering an Irish police officer
changed their pleas to manslaughter during a trial at Dublin's
Special Criminal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Detective Gerry McCabe, 52, died after being shot during a
bungled IRA robbery in County Limerick two years ago. His
colleague was badly wounded.
</P>
<P>
Pearse MaCauley, Kevin Walsh, Michael O'Neill and Jeremiah
Sheehy had pleaded innocent to manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
The men will be sentenced Thursday along with John Quinn,
another suspected IRA member who pleaded guilty to conspiring to
commit robbery, according to BBC reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
All five pleaded guilty to two new charges of maliciously
wounding Det McCabe's colleague, Detective Ben O'Sullivan, and
possessing firearms with intent to commit robbery.
</P>
<P>
Last December a Dublin court ordered McCauley, 32, to be
extradited to Britain. He was ordered to be held in custody in
Ireland until his trial for the death of Det McCabe.
</P>
<P>
McCauley is wanted in Britain on charges of conspiring to
murder former brewery chairman Sir Charles Tidbury and to cause
explosions in Britain in November 1990.

<HEADLINE> Tyson to be Sentenced Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson's fate will be
decided on Friday when the former heavyweight champion faces jail
time after attacking two men during a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
Though the two men beaten at a fender bender think Tyson
shouldn't go to jail, the prosecutor feels otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Judge Stephen Johnson will sentence the fighter on two counts
of second-degree assault, prompting a decision on whether Tyson
violated his probation for a 1991 rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas Gansler believes
Tyson is "nothing less than a time bomb buried in our back yard",
and has urged to put him back into the jail.
</P>
<P>
"If he goes to jail here, it's much, much more likely he'll go
to jail there," said Paul Kemp, Tyson's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
The two victims, Abmielc Saucedo and Richard Hardick, were
given an undisclosed amount to avoid a civil suit. They will
testify on Tyson's behalf on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gansler called Tyson a "bully". "The state needs go no further
than the defendant's own statements to arrive at the conclusion
that he is not only volatile, but dangerous," said Gansler.
</P>
<P>
But Gansler cannot ask the judge to put Tyson in jail, because
the no-contest plea agreement negotiated by Gansler's predecessor
forbids that.

<HEADLINE> German Chemists Make Molecular Replica of The World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chemists in Germany have built a
single-molecule replica of the World Cup, New Scientist magazine
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At 3 nanometers, the molecular replica is less than a 100-
millionth the size of the real cup, which is 36 centimeters high
and consists of a globe supported by an angel in the shape of a
vase.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany,
decided to make the replica when they realized the molecules they
were working with were ideal for the job.
</P>
<P>
They used a spherical buckyball molecule for the globe. For the
vase, they used a bowl-shaped molecule called a calixarene, named
after the Latin for cup or chalice.
</P>
<P>
Although the researchers admitted that they made the molecular
replica for "scientific fun", they hoped it to be able to trap
light energy in the same way as chlorophyll, so that it could even
be used to make solar energy cells.

<HEADLINE> Medicine Price Cuts Well Embraced in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The first massive medicine
price cuts in several years has met an enthusiastic welcome from
residents of this economic and financial center of China.
</P>
<P>
The price cuts effective last Thursday average 19 percent for
103 types of medicine, the majority being regularly used items
such as antibiotics and digestive tonics.
</P>
<P>
The price reductions will save local residents an estimated 100
million yuan in medical expenses each year, according to Luo
Huimin of the Shanghai Municipal Pricing Bureau.
</P>
<P>
One local resident, Jiang Guozhi, said that the price of
medicine had surged so strongly in recent years that prescriptions
for a cold could cost up to 100 yuan. He expressed the hope that
the authorities will make continued efforts to further cut back on
where possible.
</P>
<P>
Prices in general in Shanghai have declined steadily in recent
years, with the price index showing a negative 4.9 percent in 1998.
The price of medicine, however, rose by an average of eight
percent over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
"High medicine prices have increased the burden on patients and
is harmful to proposed reforms of the medical care system," one
official said.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that high medicine prices have come as a result of
unusually high rebate rates in the sale and prescription process.
Official regulations stipulate that hospitals can enjoy a five-
percent rebate for the medicines they buy, but in practice the
rate has gone up to 25 percent and, in some cases, as high as 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest price cuts in Shanghai have reduced the rebate rate
while keeping the wholesale price unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Medicine is one of few products in China whose prices are
still regulated by the government.
</P>
<P>
Patients are passive consumers when they buy medicines in
accordance with doctors' prescriptions therefore the price cannot
be wholly decided by the market, and the government must enforce
appropriate regulations, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Mayor Zuo Huanchen revealed that Shanghai will reduce
prices for more types of medicines at a proper time.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Claim Sport Doping "Breakthrough" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have for the
first time found a way of detecting human growth hormone, a drug
which helps athletes put on muscle, the BBC said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The test, developed by researchers at St Thomas's Hospital in
London, will require athletes to give just a pinprick amount of
blood.
</P>
<P>
Human growth hormone (HGH) has a similar affect to steroids,
allowing cheating competitors to put on extra muscle. Because HGH
is a naturally occurring substance in the body, it is more
difficult to be detected.
</P>
<P>
The British researchers have been working for three years to
find a means of identifying athletes who have been injecting
themselves with HGH.
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, we were optimistic to do something. I think
we've exceeded our wildest dreams", said professor Peter Sonksen,
who led the research.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a test which is more sensitive, more specific than
we ever imaged", he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Breakthrough in Carbon Fibers Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
shattered world records by developing 3-millimeter-long special
carbon fibers which are each 1/50,000th the width of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which handled
the project, explained that the minuscule fibers can be sorted
into groups within a cable only three millimeters in diameter.
</P>
<P>
The technological breakthrough, which has been reported in the
internationally renowned "Nature" magazine to much worldwide
interest in scientific circles, is expected to have huge benefits
for the telecommunications and broadcasting industries.
</P>
<P>
Code-named the Aligned Carbon Nanotube Array, the cable has
high tenacity and electrical conductivity. It is also ten times
the strength of steel while its specific gravity is only one-sixth
that of steel.
</P>
<P>
Scientists worldwide, who have also been researching such
technology, also believe the new techniques will help push forward
the development of flat-bed television sets and may even become
superior substitutes for silicon chips.

<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Four of the five Irish
Republican Army men accused of murdering an Irish police officer
changed their pleas to manslaughter during a trial at Dublin's
Special Criminal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Detective Gerry McCabe, 52, died after being shot during a
bungled IRA robbery in County Limerick two years ago. His
colleague was badly wounded.
</P>
<P>
Pearse MaCauley, Kevin Walsh, Michael O'Neill and Jeremiah
Sheehy had pleaded innocent to manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
The men will be sentenced Thursday along with John Quinn,
another suspected IRA member who pleaded guilty to conspiring to
commit robbery, according to BBC reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
All five pleaded guilty to two new charges of maliciously
wounding Det McCabe's colleague, Detective Ben O'Sullivan, and
possessing firearms with intent to commit robbery.
</P>
<P>
Last December a Dublin court ordered McCauley, 32, to be
extradited to Britain. He was ordered to be held in custody in
Ireland until his trial for the death of Det McCabe.
</P>
<P>
McCauley is wanted in Britain on charges of conspiring to
murder former brewery chairman Sir Charles Tidbury and to cause
explosions in Britain in November 1990.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Leaves Short-Term Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
policy-makers concluded on Wednesday their first policy meeting
this year and decided to leave short-term interest rates
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's decision-making body -- the Federal Open
Market Committee -- ended the two-day, closed-door meeting by
signaling it had left the benchmark rate on overnight loans
between banks at 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
It's been at that level, a four-year low, since November 17
last year. The Fed had cut it from 5.5 percent in three
quarter-point moves over a seven-week span to insulate the U.S.
economy from the turmoil then rocking financial markets following
the collapse of the Russian ruble.
</P>
<P>
Since then, financial markets have become more stable and the
economy has continued to grow at a surprisingly robust rate.
During the final three months of last year, it shot up at a 5.6
percent annual rate, the strongest in two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Normally, according to economists, the surprisingly robust
recent economic numbers would prompt the Fed to raise interest
rates to cool demand and head off the possibility of higher
inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, the world slump -- spreading to Brazil and elsewhere
in Latin America -- poses enough of a threat to the U.S. economy
and financial markets to keep the Fed from raising interest rates
at the just-ended policy meeting.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, an increase in rates could touch off a sharp drop in
the U.S. stock market. That, in turn, could quickly snowball into
big trouble in the so-called real economy.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Says to Push Ahead with Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Wednesday stressed his intention of pushing ahead with
the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I am insistent on following up the peace process," Arafat
told reporters after a 40-minute meeting with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was invited here to attend an annual National Prayer
Breakfast on Thursday. He met with Albright and members of
Congress on Wednesday and hoped to have a few minutes with
President Bill Clinton at the prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
Albright was said to be hoping that Arafat's brief visit could
give a push to the stalled land-for-peace accord the Clinton
administration engineered between Israel and the Palestinians at
Wye last year.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, in a brief exchange with reporters at the doorway of
the State Department, did not say how he thought to revive the
peace process, which went aground late last year because of Israel
refusing to yield more land on the West Bank on the pretext that
the Palestinian Authority had not imposed rougher restraints on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
When asked about a Palestinian state, Arafat said Palestinian
leaders were grappling with the problem. "This can't be
mentioned now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has admonished Arafat not to
publicly declare his intention to establish a state next May
if negotiations with Israel fail to produce what he wants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Rubin dismissed
Israel's accusations that the Palestinian Authority had set free
five militants suspected in attacks in which Americans were
victims.
</P>
<P>
"We have checked into this thoroughly, and we have not seen
any evidence that would confirm the (Israeli) charges that the
individuals released were involved in the killing of Americans,"
Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Military Threat Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
diplomat said here Wednesday that China is resolutely against
foreign military threat against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(FRY) over the question of Kosovo, a southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, told a Security Council session that "China resolutely
opposes any wanton foreign intervention in the internal affairs of
a sovereign country by military force."
</P>
<P>
"China shows grave concerns over the January 30 decision by
NATO, again without the authorization of the U.N. Security
Council, to announce military threat against a sovereign country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the 15-member Security Council Wednesday
met behind closed doors to discuss a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the latest developments in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
As a regional organization, NATO has no right to make a
decision to launch military strikes on Yugoslavia. Any military
action against a sovereign country should first have the
authorization of the Security Council, which has unshirkable
irreplaceable responsibility in maintaining world peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned at the violences which affect peace and
stability in Kosovo," he said. "But the international community
should strictly distinguish between violences staged by terrorists
in the region and actions by the government of the sovereign
country to crack down on terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any sovereign country has the legitimate rights to attack
illegal activities, terrorism in particular, within its
territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
The question of Kosovo should be, and can only be, solved
through dialogue on the basis of respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the FRY and the guarantee of equal rights
of all ethnic groups in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo after ethnic Albanians had been
fighting against Serbs for independence since February last year.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Market Reduces in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The real estate market in
Romania reduced by half over the past 2-3 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Ion Radu Zilisteanu, President of the Romanian
Association for Real Estate Agencies, the Romanian real estate
market started declining in 1997. While about 230,000 deals were
concluded in 1994, it decreased till below 100,000 deals in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the real estate market was affected by a weak
credit system for most of the population, by the narrowing of the
mortgage credit market and by the population's low incomes.
</P>
<P>
The only way out of this situation is to attract foreign
investors so that welfare housing using tracts of land leased by
the City Hall and through goernmental funds could be built, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zilisteanu's association was established in 1995, as a
professional organization including 60 agencies, out of which 70
percent working in Bucharest. It is a member of the Central
European Real Estate Associations Network, along with similar
organizations in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and
other countries.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday emphasized the need to make the U.N. Economic
and Social Council (ECOSOC) more effective in meeting U.N. Charter
goals on social progress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ECOSOC organizational session, he said the U.N.
system and the ECOSOC should make a constructive contribution in
the international effort to manage and minimize the risks and
uncertainties of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue between the ECOSOC and the U.N. Administrative
Committee on Coordination (ACC) whose chairman is Annan himself,
"has acquired even greater significance this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Summing up ECOSOC records last year, including a high-level
dialogue with the Bretton Woods institutions, Annan said the U.N.
agencies must move in tandem with the work towards the goals of
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
According to Annan, the ACC in 1998 addressed such issues as
poverty eradication, gender equality, population, international
drug abuse control, natural disaster reduction and peace-building.
</P>
<P>
"Coordination implies more than decisions and directives, it
implies continuous dialogue and real engagement among all
partners," the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
"I have made it my priority to promote that process," he said.

<HEADLINE> Birds Can Sleep with One Eye Open, Study Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Birds can overcome the problem
of sleeping in risky situations by developing the ability to sleep
with one eye open and one hemisphere of the brain awake, U.S.
scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a research published in the scientific journal Nature, Niels
Rattenborg and colleagues from Indiana State University, Terre
Haute, the United States, showed that birds can detect approaching
predators while one half of the brain is asleep.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also found that birds can increase their use of
the so-called "unihemispheric" sleep as the risk of predation
increases.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this is the first evidence of an animal
behaviourally controlling sleep and wakefulness simultaneously in
different regions of the brain", they wrote.
</P>
<P>
The study could also have some implications for humans, the
researchers believed. Some sleep disorders, such as sleep walking,
are thought to occur when parts of the brain wake up while other
parts are still sleeping.

<HEADLINE> China Not to Devalue Currency: Chinese VP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao Wednesday reiterated that China will not devalue its
currency of Renminbi this year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said this in an interview with five South
African media while answering questions concerning the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the crisis has made some Asian countries'
currencies devalue by a large margin and imposed great pressure on
the Chinese currency, greatly affecting China's export in
particular.
</P>
<P>
However, Hu continued, China has taken timely steps to cope
with the crisis and increased investment in the infrastructure
sector, expanded the domestic demand and helped maintain the
economic growth in a sustainable and steady way.
</P>
<P>
China has been running a favorable balance of international
payments, with a steady growth of its foreign exchange reserves
now exceeding 140 billion U.S. Dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So, we have the objective condition to keep the value of our
currency, " Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
If China volunteers to devalue its currency, he went on to say,
this might offset, for a while, some negative effects of the Asian
nations' devaluation of their currencies, but it will kick off a
new round of devaluation in Asia, making the victim nations'
situation worsen.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that this vicious circle will do no good to the
financial and economic stability in Asia and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"China, as a responsible country, is ready to sacrifice its
interests and will never shift troubles onto its neighboring
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who arrived here from Cote d'Ivoire Sunday for the last leg
of his 13-day four-nation African tour, will end his South African
visit Thursday and return to China.

court, said the meeting called on Commonwealth non-governmental
organizations (ngos) to discuss how they can help Africa's young
democracies to survive peacefully and advance the theories of
good governance.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference looked at the democratization process in
Africa and how tribal conflicts had affected them, adding, it
resolved that there should be collaboration among human rights
ngos globally and locally.
</P>
<P>
Mkandawire said :"of great importance to Malawi is the issue
that all human rights ngos were urged to have a clear objective
and that they should be non-partisan and should not be used as
vehicles to advance any party's political ambitions."
</P>
<P>
The same pleas were made to churches represented at the
conference by the world council of churches, he said, and that
the resolutions shall be presented to Commonwealth law ministers
 in Trinidad and Tobago in May and finally to the group's heads
of government in Durban, South Africa in November.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Passing Laser Technology to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Ministry
denied Wednesday allegations by a U.S. newspaper that it had
passed secret technology on laser weaponry to China.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's spokesman Dan Weinreich said in a statement that
the allegations published in the Washington Times last month are
completely baseless.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited U.S. sources last month as saying that some
Israelis involved in the development of a joint U.S.-Israel
weapons system, which employs laser to intercept Katyusha
missiles, are transferring secret data to China.
</P>
<P>
Israel has never shared classified U.S. technology passed
during the Nautilus project, and no Israeli personnel have tried
to obtain restricted information from American contractors
involved in the project, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
All Israeli activities have been conducted in precise
conformity with relevant agreements, including those governing
project security and delineating the extent of cooperation with
the United States in the program, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
All inferences that Israel has circumvented the terms of its
agreement with the U.S. are unfounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged the U.S. sources cited by the Washington
Times to publicly refute the charges levelled against Israel by
the newspaper, he said,
</P>
<P>
The first Nautilus laser gun, currently being worked on by the
U.S. and Israel, is expected to be deployed later this year.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Contact Group Decision on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday hailed the Contact Group's "timely
decision" to convene peace talks on the Serbian province of
Kosovo, saying that "a peaceful settlement can only be reached
through direct dialogue between the parties concerned."
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued via his spokesman here, said he
"welcomes the timely decision of the Contact Group to convene
peace talks on Kosovo at Rambouillet", France, and he "is
convinced that a peaceful settlement can only be reached through
direct dialogue between the parties concerned."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief "urges the Yugoslav authorities and the Kosovo
Albanian leadership to shoulder their responsibilities and to use
the opportunity to settle the Kosovo crisis by committing
themselves to the Rambouillet peace talks without preconditions or
delays," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the U.N. Security Council is meeting
behind closed doors to discuss a report by Annan on the latest
development in Kosovo, rather than considering NATO's threat of
military action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at the
request of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In his report presented to the Security Council on Monday,
Annan called on the warring parties in Kosovo to undertake peace
talks in a bid to avert what he said "a situation of all-out war."
</P>
<P>
"Full and unconditional acceptance of peaceful negotiations is
the only way to resolve the crisis in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the current consultations, some Security Council members
would raise the issue of a letter to the Council President from
the Yugoslav Government calling for an emergency Security Council
meeting to prevent NATO's armed aggression of the Balkan country,
diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Michel Duval, deputy Canadian permanent representative to the
United Nations, told reporters on Tuesday afternoon that the
Security Council would take up the Yugoslav request later this
week.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council for the month of
February, Robert Fowler of Canada, is recovering from appendicitis
operation performed last Saturday, and he is most probably going
to take up his presidency early next week, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group, in charge of the Balkan
diplomacy, last Saturday called on Kosovo warring parties to begin
peace talks in France by Saturday this week to end the conflicts
in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo in February last year after
ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million, have been fighting for independence.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will chair a
conference with states from the Caucasus region in Luxembourg in
June.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer announced in Berlin
Wednesday after talks with his Azerbaijani counterpart Tofik
Sulfugarov.
</P>
<P>
The EU is very interested in developments in the Caucasus,
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer met with the Azernaijani minister in Berlin in his
first such meeting with a foreign counterpart in the capital.
"This is a real premiere," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though Berlin is Germany's nominal capital, day-to-day business
is still run from Bonn ahead of the government's move to Berlin
full- time later this year.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Germany and its European partners would continue
to support efforts by the Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to find a solution to the conflict
regarding Nagorny Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a six-year war over the mainly
Armenian-populated enclave Nagorny Karabakh which ended in 1994
with a ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The government of Nagorny Karabakh - which has not been
recognised internationally - refuses to return it to Azerbaijani
jurisdiction. It has the support of Armenia, which considers the
territory an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Sulfugarov left Berlin for Bonn Wednesday afternoon.

BERLIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Germany

Bonn.

"A visit of the Iranian foreign minister to Bonn or a meeting

<HEADLINE> Doping Summit Seems Hard to Meet Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Conference on Doping
in Sport, which is being held here under the auspices of the
International Olympic Committee, looks hard to reach its goals
when the meeting ends on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IOC, embroiled by the voting-for-favor scandal surrounding
the Salt Lake City recently, has set two main goals for the
conference -- setting up an anti-doping agency and uniform
punishment for serious drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
After two-days debate, it seemed that representatives from
international sports federations agreed on the issue of an
anti-doping agency in principle, but some put the idea of sanction
standardization into a boiling bowl.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, has vowed that they
would never bow to the minimum two-year suspension proposed by the
IOC.
</P>
<P>
Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA, explained his position that he
was not against the anti-doping policy, but "the drug case should
be judged individually," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In fight against doping," Blatter added,"distinction should
be made and different circumstances should be taken into account."
</P>
<P>
The IOC once warned that any international federation which
doest not comply with the common anti-doping policy would be
expelled from the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"If that happened, we will fight," said the president.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's director of communications Keith Cooper said:"we feel it
is important for each sport to have the latitude to fix its
suspension of offenders according to the rhythm of its own
competition."
</P>
<P>
He said the IOC's proposed two-year ban on doping offenders was
unfair to professional soccer players who play more matches than
any other sport.
</P>
<P>
He pointed that FIFA wanted punitive powers kept in the hands
of its national federations who hand down fines and suspensions
depending on the drugs used.
</P>
<P>
Facing the stiff opposition of FIFA and other professional
sports federations, the IOC might have to take a back-step in the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Primo Nebiolo, president of association for 28 summer Olympic
sports, said that some professional federations could evaluate
drug offenders individually.
</P>
<P>
"The minimum required sanction for major doing substances or
prohibited methods shall be 2 years for a first offense," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, based on specific, exceptional circumstances to be
evaluated in the first instance by the competent IF bodies, there
would be a provision for a possible modification of the two-year
sanction.
</P>
<P>
"As was recalled by many authoritative colleagues, I would like
to strong reaffirm the basic principle that the Federations are
the only organizations that can enforce sanctions in doping cases
or adopt medical codes. In this way, the federations will be in a
position -- if there are indeed the specific, exceptional
circumstances -- to evaluate on a case-by-case basis the
modification of the two-year sanction," he added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations had
ordered its American and British humanitarian staff working in
Iraq to leave the country, saying it could not guarantee their
safety, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said Under-Secretary-General Benon Sevan, who is in
charge of Security, decided that all American and British
nationals working for the United Nations in Iraq should leave.
</P>
<P>
Iraq sent a letter to the United Nations on January 4, 1999,
saying that it was unable to ensure American and British nationals
after the two countries launched military strikes against the
country in December and requesting they leave the country
immediately, a move rejected by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said Iraq had not responded to letters from the United
Nations that it had an obligation to protect all U.N. staff so the
decision to full them out was made.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had exempted two Americans, the deputy director of the
World Food Program and the Secretary to chief U.N. envoy in
Baghdad, Prakash Shah, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last month presented a list of one American and 14 Britons
working in the northern part of the country it wanted out of the
country.

<P>
HARARE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Health and Child
Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps Wednesday said here it is
incorrect to say as many as 220 people are dying of AIDS related
diseases in Zimbabwe every day.
</P>
<P>
Stamps said he could not provide a specific figure as there was
no regular analysis to monitor causes of death in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"At least 220 people are dying from AIDS related diseases each
day as the Aids scourge continues to wreak havoc in the country,"
daily Herald quoted Stamps as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that for 1997 on average weekly AIDS related
deaths were between 450 to 500, and the ministry had projected
that the figure should be lower.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a press conference with visiting U.S.
Director of National AIDS Policy at the White House, Sandra
Thurman.
</P>
<P>
The press, Stamps said, needed to be educated on a lot of
issues about the AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
There was a myth that there was no commitment on the part of
politicians in curbing AIDS, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Thurman's visit was encouraging as it had
created partnership and networking which will help in eliminating
the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thurman said there was need to work on preventive
messages and educate people on talking about AIDS to prevent its
further spread.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. did not have the epidemic under control as
was widely believed and she hoped the two states wILL learn and
share information.
</P>
<P>
Thurman is on a four-day visit to Zimbabwe to access the plight
of children orphaned by AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Seeks Foreign Help in Oil Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister
Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah Wednesday reiterated the importance to
seek foreign help in developing its oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait should seize opportunities to invite foreign oil
companies to develop the oilfields in the country's northern and
western areas, Saud said after a meeting of the National
Assembly's Financial and Economic Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said inviting foreign companies to help develop upstream
operations, which involve exploration, development and
production, will greatly boost Kuwait's ability to face future
challenges, raise its oil output and safeguard its interests.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait hopes to introduce high technology it does not possess,
secure markets to absorb Kuwaiti oil and win foreign capital, Saud
said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that 7 billion U.S. dollars are needed to develop
the northern oilfields.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that foreign companies are not allow to own
the oilfields and no such agreements were signed with potential
foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers have voiced their opposition to the development
project, fearing that the government can grant ownership of some
Kuwait's oilfields to foreign oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, with a crude reserve of nearly 10 billion barrels and
an output capacity of 2.5 million barrels a day, has held several
rounds of negotiations on the oil development project with some
world oil giants, including Chevron Corp. But no deals have been
clinched so far.

BERLIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The German European Union
presidency on Wednesday called a meeting of the bloc's leaders to
be held in Bonn this month to tackle tough issues linked to budget
reform, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's spokesman said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state and government from the 15 European Union (EU)
nations will meet February 26 at the Petersberg state guest house
and compound in Koenigswinter, a Bonn suburb, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at preparing a second special EU summit in
Berlin March 24 to 25, at which leaders are supposed to hammer out
a final deal on the Agenda 2000 - a package reforming the E.U.
budget, farm subsidy spending and aid for poorer regions of the
bloc.
</P>
<P>
Germany has demanded a cut to its 22 billion-mark (13 billion-
dollar) annual net contribution to Brussels. Schroeder wants to
achieve this by slashing EU farm spending and cutting structural
development aid to southern EU members.
</P>
<P>
But changes to farm spending are firmly opposed by France and
Spain leads countries fighting a reduction in development funding.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Schroeder has vowed to reach an Agenda 2000 accord at
the Berlin summit.
</P>
<P>
German holds the rotating E.U. presidency for the first half of
this year. A further E.U. summit will be held in Cologne June 3 to
4.

BERLIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army(KLA) will decide whether to keep on fighting in
the troubled southern Serb province after high-pressure peace
talks with the Serbs planned for the weekend, a leading KLA
spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on German breakfast television, KLA spokesman Sabri
Kicmari said the final decision on whether rebels would continue
their year-old conflict would be made by top KLA military leaders.
</P>
<P>
Kicmari said the KLA could only accept a peace solution that
would lead to the independence of the province where most of the
citizens are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"We will convince the negotiating partners that independence is
the better solution for the Balkans in the long term," said
Kicmari.
</P>
<P>
The KLA spokesman said the rebels did not oppose the possible
deployment of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) ground
troops to police the conflict, saying such a move made sense in
order to protect the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Belgrade government are due to sit down
with KLA and other Kosovo Albanian delegates at the talks near

NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Three Rwandan genocide suspects
have been sentenced to death, whereas 11 others got life
imprisonment in a genocide trial in southwest Cyangugu Prefecture,
official sources in the area told the Rwanda News Agency
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the same sources, seven other culprits were
sentenced Tuesday to a 15-year jail term, while one suspect was
acquitted by the court. The seven got a lenient punishment because
they had confessed to the genocide crimes.
</P>
<P>
The 22 genocide suspects were arrested on charges of
involvement in the 1994 genocide and other crimes against
humanity, including rape, they perpetrated in Gisuma commune, in
Cyangugu prefecture. The prosecutor had charged them with
massacring 27 Tutsis during the genocide which claimed the lives
of more than 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were assisted by a defense council provided by the
Belgian non-governmental organization, Lawyers Without Borders.
They have 15 days to file an appeal.

<HEADLINE> German Chemists Make Molecular Replica of World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chemists in Germany have built a
single-molecule replica of the World Cup, New Scientist magazine
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At 3 nanometers, the molecular replica is less than a
100-millionth the sized of the real cup, which is 36 centimeters
high and consists of a globe supported by an angel in the shape of
a vase.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany,
decided to make the replica when they realized the molecules they
were working with were ideal for the job.
</P>
<P>
They used a spherical buckyball molecule for the globe. For the
vase, they used a bowl-shaped molecule called a calixarene, named
after the Latin for cup or chalice.
</P>
<P>
Although the researchers admitted that they made the molecular
replica for "scientific fun", they hoped it to be able to trap

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Not to Sign Ceasefire Deal If Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD) fighting to oust President Laurent Desire Kabila
will never sign a ceasefire it has not negotiated itself, a rebel
official told the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) late Wednesday in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
''That could be a ceasefire for another country, not the
Democratic Republic of Congo,'' said Bizima Karaha, the RCD head
of security and former Foreign Minister of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
''We are committed to peace, to the ceasefire, and we have been
showing this since the launching of our struggle,'' Karaha
underscored, saying that the Congolese rebels were never invited
to the technical meeting going on in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The RCD rebels said that negotiation for a ceasefire can only
take place between two main belligerents: the armed opposition,
and the regime of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in negotiation, but we are not beggars for
negotiations,'' Karaha said, claiming that they will fight until
Kabila gives up, or is removed from power.
</P>
<P>
Karaha indicated that the RCD rebels would not like anyone to
sit down and decide on their behalf. He deplored that no
invitation had been extended to his movement, whereas during the
summit in Gaberones, Botswana, it had been agreed that from then
on the rebels would directly take part in future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said Kabila's regime is still committing
massacres of Congolese nationals, especially in Kasai province in
the south where it is using militia made of Rwandan Hutu extremist
Interahamwe, and the youths of the Uferi party.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Promises to Protect Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government said here
 Wednesday that local industries should be protected from unfair
competition from cheap imports.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister Godfrey Simasiku said local industries
should be protected by the creation of a level ground for business
in the wake of unfair competition from imported goods.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has received overwhelming appreciation
from the business community of the country for addressing some
issues in this year's budget which are negatively affecting the
operations of companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
A number of companies have folded up because they are not
sufficiently protected from unfair competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Simasiku, the government has taken positive
measures in the budget to ensure creating a level playing field
for both Zambian and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister urged foreign investors to establish
industries and other business ventures in his country.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Zambians to support this year's budget
submitted by Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi to the parliament last
Friday, to realize long-term economic growth.

MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia will formulate a national
plan to deal with the millennium bug, Chairman of the Russian
State Committee for Communication Alexander Krupnov said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be submitted by the end of the month to the
country's interdepartmental commission for the Y2K issue led by
Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak, Krupnov told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the national plan provides for Russia's cooperation
with the seven major industrialized countries in tackling this
global problem, and with the U.S. and France within the framework
of the bilateral commissions for economic, scientific and
technical cooperation, and envisions appropriate state
measures.
</P>
<P>
Krupnov said that the most serious concerns were over the
Defense Ministry and the Federal Aviation Service which are
particularly far from finding solutions to this problem.
</P>
<P>
He called for coordination with the international community and
that an agreement on this had been reached with the Russian
Foreign Ministry.
</P>

Krupnov said an estimated 2 billion to 3 billion U.S. dollars
will be needed on preventing errors in information systems in the

<HEADLINE> Romania Launches Program to Include Itself in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Romania launched on Wednesday
a national program for drawing an economic corridor between
Central Asia and Europe, with transit through the country.
</P>
<P>
"Politically speaking, Romania's inclusion in this route will
provide its rapid, organic integration into the Euro-Atlantic
structures and opportunities for an economic growth for a few
decades," said President Emil Constantinescu at the Cotroceni
presidential Palace where the program was launched.
</P>
<P>
The head of the state said that the necessity of a Southern
corridor for the transport of energy between Central Asia and
Europe was unanimously accepted and that the creation of
complementary and not competitive routes was aimed at.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the program identifies, in a first stage,
concrete objectives to be fulfilled for Romania's participation in
the East-West economic corridor. These targets concern various
fields - legislation, infrastructure, restructuring,
privatization, finance-banks, investment, foreign policy - and
they need a coordination "at the highest level, in order to
provide mandatory deadlines and successions."
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu underscored that the program offered a chance
for the invigoration of economic units and referred to the
refining and petrochemical processing capacity and to building
companies. "This stage will enjoy the participation of many
persons skilled in special construction which will lead, in time,
to a solution to unemployment and other regional social problems,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Romania proposes the creation of a transport corridor through
the Black Sea, towards Romania's Constanta port, the use of
Romanian production, processing, storing, distribution, export and
transit capacities, and further on, the use of the European
transport corridors and links.
</P>
<P>
This will give a boost to Romania as a potential economic
supplier, of energetic resources and products in particular.

<HEADLINE> Annan's Special Envoy to Meet Ethiopian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General's special envoy for Africa, Mohamed Sahnoun, is
due to arrive here Thursday to meet with Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi, the Office of Ethiopian government Spokesperson
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the office said, U.N. chief Kofi
Annan has sent his special envoy for Africa to the region in
support of the framework agreement of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) on the Eritrean- Ethiopian border conflict.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "Ethiopia welcomes Sahnoun's visit because
we do not want to leave any stone unturned in the search for
peace."
</P>
<P>
The OAU peace plan, which was endorsed by the Central Organ
summit of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management
and resolution in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in December, 1998,
calls for withdrawal of Eritrean forces to positions it held
before May 6, 1988 and return civil administration to Badme, the
disputed border area.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has accepted the OAU framework agreement. OAU
spokesman Ibrahim Dagash said Tuesday that OAU is awaiting a reply
from Eritrea following last week's OAU response to a series of
clarifying questions the Eritrean government posed to the OAU
regarding the peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a resolution on
January 29, 1999, voicing its strong support for the OAU framework
agreement as "the best hope for peace" between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.

<P>
KHARTOUM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to provide
Sudan with 100 million yuan (over 12 million U.S. dollars) in soft
loans to fund its fishing project in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua here on Wednesday, Chinese Deputy
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation He Xiaodi also
said the fishing project will be implemented by the end of June
this year.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation between the two countries in oil
exploration and gold mining has turned out to be successful.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister, who came here to attend the fifth session
of the Sino-Sudanese Joint Ministerial Committee to open on
Wednesday, said another 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million
dollars) will be given to Sudan as a government grant.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sudanese Minister of International Cooperation and
Investment Abdullah Hassan Ahmed, who chaired the meeting, said
Sudan, as the largest country in Africa, has huge water, animal
and agricultural resources and thus there are great potentials for
investment, especially in agriculture, industry and mining.
</P>
<P>
The successful Sino-Sudanese cooperation in oil exploration and
gold mining have smashed the western allegation that China has no
technical capabilities to help develop Sudan, Ahmed added.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Sudanese economic cooperation dates back to the
1970s. China has provided up to 780 million dollars to Sudan in
economic aid, with which more than 30 projects were implemented.
</P>
<P>
The projects include the Friendship Conference Hall in
Khartoum, the Friendship Hospital in Umm Dorman, the Friendship
Spinning and Weaving Factory in Al-Hasahisa, and highways and
bridges over the Nile River.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Ambassador to China Abdul-Hamid Abidine has said the
projects have played an important role in helping develop Sudan's
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Abidine also voiced hope that the bilateral economic
cooperation will enjoy a promising prospect on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Meet Foreign Ministers on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to meet with Foreign Ministers of
Indonesia and Portugal on East Timor in New York next Monday, a
U.N. spokesman announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions will focus on a review of the U.N. plan for a
wide ranging autonomy for East Timor, and the reported Indonesian
proposal of independence for East Timor in case the autonomy is
rejected by the majority of East Tomorese, the spokesman Richard
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers will have preliminary meetings on
Sunday, February 7 with Annan's personal representative for East
Timor Jamsheed Marker.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials of Indonesia and Portugal are
currently on discussions in New York on the issue and Marker is
expected to tell the press about the outcome of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with an area of about 15,000 square kilometers and
a population of 800,000, had been a Portuguese colony for some
four centuries until 1975. It has been under Indonesia's control
since 1976.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has since been seeking a comprehensive and
just resolution of the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has offered special autonomy to East Timor. Most
recently it has reportedly proposed for its independence.

The meeting caught more attention than usual after the European
Parliament attempted in vain to censure the entire 20-member

commission with Jacques Santer as its head.

Though the censure, the European version of an impeachment, did
not get past the parliamentary ballot, the presidency of the

<HEADLINE> S. African Cabinet Approves Trade Deal with EU in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The South African cabinet
has in principle approved a free trade deal with the European
Union (EU) which was struck last week by negotiators from both
sides, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But there were still a few issues that need to be looked at,
Mbeki said after meeting visiting Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
in Cape Town, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
A deal was reached between the two sides in Switzerland last
Friday after South Africa agreed to stop using the names "Port"
and "Sherry" for its wines, thus removing the last obstacle to the
conclusion of the long- mooted deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the new deal, South Africa will stop using the terms for
exports in five years and will phase out the terms in domestic
market in 12 years. This is a compromise on the request by
Portugal and Spain, which see "Port" and "Sherry" as their
exclusive brands.
</P>
<P>
The pact, hammered out after four years of negotiations, will
open EU market to 95 percent of South African exports over 10
years, and will allow 86 percent of EU exports to South Africa
free access over the same period.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the EU made some concessions to compensate
losses of South Africa, including better access to the EU for
certain South African goods.
</P>
<P>
"Cabinet discussed the matter today. In principle we think the
agreement that has been reached is a good one. But we will still
have to look at details," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said Mbeki's remarks did
not mean there were still outstanding issues on the table. Mbeki
meant he had still to be thoroughly briefed by Erwin on the final
details of the agreement, Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
Klima said he hoped the agreement was signed during Austria's
presidency of the EU. He said his country supported a compromise
as they wanted a trade deal as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission (EC), the executive body of the EU, on
Wednesday approved the draft trade pact. The foreign ministers of
the 15 EU nations will be asked to give their opinion on February
22.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said South Africa preferred that the EU announces the
deal, considering the sensitivity of its nature.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Prime Minister Kim
Chong-Pil arrived here Wednesday evening for talks with Egyptian
officials to boost economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay here, Kim will mainly discuss with
President Hosni Mubarak and Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri the
cooperation between the two countries in developing the Valley of
Technology in Ismailia, a city on the shore of the Suez Canal,
about 110 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean organization has conducted feasibility study for
the Valley of Technology, which Egyptian officials said is "of
special interest" to the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South Korean Ambassador in Cairo Yim Sung-Joon hailed
Egypt as a promising trade partner, saying Egypt which lies at the
heart of the Middle East has huge potentials for economic
cooperation with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Nagi al-Ghatrifi
said Kim's visit is "of special significance" in view of "the
active and historical relations" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which established diplomatic relations with Egypt
in 1995, has invested 160 million U.S. dollars in oil, auto,
electronic industries, banking and construction in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It has expressed readiness to invest more in Egypt's national
projects, including the giant land-reclamation Toshka project in
the south to channel the Nile River water to irrigate a swatch of
desert.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries stood at 591 million
dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first stop of Kim's regional tour, which will also
take him to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Earth's Magnetic Pole Is Moving Faster: Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Earth's magnetic north pole
is moving faster than it has since records began, Danish
geophysicists have found.
</P>
<P>
New measurements made in Greenland by the Danish Meteorological
Institute showed that the magnetic north pole is moving northwards
at 20km a year, 10 percent faster than 12 months ago, according to
a report in the February issue of the British magazine Physics
World.
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly the quickest movement since we started
measurements in Greenland in 1928", Torsten Neubert, who heads the
research, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The magnetic pole constantly moves, because of the interior
motions of the Earth that generate the magnetic field are
inconstant.
</P>
<P>
In the past century, the magnetic north pole has moved over
1000 km towards the geographical north pole, and over the past
decade the strength of the magnetic field has fallen by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Neubert said that the accelerating of movement and weakening of
the field may point to a switching of the magnetic poles, perhaps
within the next thousand years.
</P>
<P>
"In the period up to a reversal, the Earth's magnetic field
would lose its strength and would no longer be able to protect the
Earth from radiation coming from space", he said.
</P>
<P>
However, other geophysicists are sceptical about the theory
that the northward movement of the magnetic pole is a sign that
the field is about to reverse.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Bloxham, an Earth and planetary scientist at Harvard
University, the United States, suggested that the pole would have
to be moving towards the equator, rather than the true pole, in
order to make a flip likely.

<HEADLINE> EU to Tighten Checks on Agricultural Expenditure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Wednesday that it would take measures to reinforce checks on
agricultural expenditure.
</P>
<P>
European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said that the
measures so taken reflect the priorities of the commission's wider
initiative to ensure the sound and efficient management of the
European Union finances.
</P>
<P>
The sound and efficient management includes, according to the
commissioner, systematic policies to monitor, evaluate and check
that contribute to ensuring value for money for the European
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc,
admits that European taxpayers have the right to expect that all
public money is spent efficiently under both national and EU
budgets.
</P>
<P>
Half of the EU annual budget goes toward financing the union's
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This amounts to 40 billion euro
(45.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, or around 0.6 percent of the
gross domestic product of the union as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The size of the agricultural expenditure thus requires a joint
responsibility of the European Commission and the European Union
member states to make sure that the agricultural budget is spent
correctly and that CAP payments are administered and audited in
the most efficient way.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Claim Sport Doping "Breakthrough" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have for the
first time found a way of detecting human growth hormone, a drug
which helps athletes put on muscle, the BBC said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The test, developed by researchers at St Thomas's Hospital in
London, will require athletes to give just a pinprick amount of
blood.
</P>
<P>
Human growth hormone (HGH) has a similar affect to steroids,
allowing cheating competitors to put on extra muscle. Because HGH
is a naturally occurring substance in the body, it is more
difficult to be detected.
</P>
<P>
The British researchers have been working for three years to
find a means of identifying athletes who have been injecting
themselves with HGH.
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, we were optimistic to do something. I think
we've exceeded our wildest dreams", said Professor Peter Sonksen,
who led the research.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a test which is more sensitive, more specific than
we ever imaged", He said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Hopeful of Peace Talks at Rambouillet: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO expressed its hope
Wednesday that the Contact Group-demanded peace talks concerning
Kosovo would go ahead this weekend at Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official told the press that the Western military
alliance was hopeful that the peace talks would begin punctually
Saturday and that he expected the Serbian side to go to
Rambouillet as well.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
though Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was not expected to
go by himself, a high-level delegation was expected from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"The Serb side is an indispensable part," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Council, the decision-making body of the
alliance, met Wednesday to review, among other things, the current
situation of Kosovo and NATO's preparation for an eventual
military intervention.
</P>
<P>
The same official said none of the allies has so far committed
any ground troops for a possible deployment of NATO force in the
Yugoslav province, and the alliance has been busy studying a
conceptual plan of deployment of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
The conceptual planning will have to be followed by operational
planning and force generation planning before NATO can go ahead at
the request of the Contact Group to implement the peace settlement
expected from the Rambouillet negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The NATO official stressed that the alliance was expecting a
Dayton-like mandate from the Contact Group for a clear-cut
instruction on its mission in Kosovo in the event of deployment of
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
"NATO wants to be ready to implement the peace settlement,"
said the official at the NATO headquarters. "NATO has to be ready
at short notice."
</P>
<P>
NATO last October had worked out a plan for deployment of
ground troops in Kosovo. The revised plan, codenamed as A-minus
option among NATO officials, concerns reduced force size in a
mission aimed at implementing a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
No decision had been taken as to the size of the force to be
deployed in Kosovo, said the official who disclosed however that
NATO is in the process of deciding on the advance element of the
eventual deployment of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
The Western military alliance has stationed a 2,300-strong
extraction force in Macedonia and that back-up force for the 700
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe truce
verifiers is expected to serve this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here differed as to how big the size of the NATO
ground troop in Kosovo should be. Some say 40,000 would suffice
for the implementation of a peace settlement whereas others say at
least 200,000 are needed in a no-peace settlement no-cease-fire
scenario to impose peace.

<HEADLINE> Economic Globalization Termed as Egypt's Biggest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A renowned international
economist said on Wednesday that the biggest challenge facing
Egypt is fusion with global economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international conference on Egyptian economy held
here, Jeffrey Sachs, Harvard University president, cautioned Egypt
against the hazards of economic globalization, which he termed as
"a two-edged sword."
</P>
<P>
Sachs was selected by the Time magazine of the United States as
the world's best economist in 1997. The two-day conference was
organized by the Egyptian Center for Economic Studies and the
Harvard Institute for International Development.
</P>
<P>
Sachs recommended that Egypt reduce investment costs for
setting up new industries to increase competitiveness and improve
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He urged the country to speed up the application of technology
in economic development and give priority to investment in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economist expressed optimism about the future of
the Egyptian economy due to the country's unique geographic
position, saying Egypt stands on the crossroads of international
trade, linking Asia with Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic reforms have spared Egypt the dangers of
a financial crisis, which is afflicting Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started in 1991 the economic reforms to loosen control
over and privatize state-run enterprises. Since then, the
country's gross domestic product has grown from under 2 percent to
more than 5 percent and inflation fallen from 20 percent to under
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Economy Youssef Boutros Ghali told the
conference that Egypt will sustain the progress achieved in the
economic reforms and has set a target to attain an economic growth
rate at 7 to 8 percent in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Boutros Ghali said this requires increase of production and
quality control, and development of small and medium size
projects, which employ 90 percent of Egypt's workforce of more
than 17 million people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Egypt possesses a huge wealth of skilled
workers in all fields, who can play a leading role in upgrading
the economy.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao Wednesday reiterated that China will always respect the
choice of political system and road of development by African
countries on their own in light of their national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner given by the South African business
community and the African-Asian Society in honor of Hu's visit to
this "Rainbow Nation", Hu said China always supports African
countries' just struggle to safeguard national independence,
state sovereignty and territorial integrity and help them boost
national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China also supports their endeavor to enhance solidarity and
cooperation with one another, fend off foreign interference and
settle differences and disputes among themselves through peaceful
consultation, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to give African countries government
assistance with no political strings attached within our power and
actively carry out wide- ranging and multi-form economic
cooperation and trade with them in accordance with the principles
of mutual benefit, reciprocity and complementarity.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to call on the international community, the
developed countries in particular, to pay more attention and
attach more importance to peace and development in Africa and
adopt effective measures to promote its stability and assist in
its economic development," Hu said.
</P>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
Vice-President Hu Jintao Wednesday spoke highly of the China-South
Africa relations upon the first anniversary of establishment of
bilateral diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a dinner hosted for Hu by the South African business
community and the African-Asian Society, Hu said, "The first of
January 1998 was a memorable day for both the Chinese and South
African people."
</P>
<P>
!0The formal establishment of diplomatic relations between
China and South Africa was a logical historical development of the
traditional friendship between the two peoples and marked the
beginning of a new chapter in the annals of history of bilateral
relations,!1 he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of great achievements since the normalization of
Beijing-Pretoria relations, Hu said the relations have been
developing smoothly, with exchanges and cooperation gradually
unfolding in all fields, thanks to the concerted efforts of the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
During the successful visit by South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki last year, the two sides decided to work for a
constructive partnership oriented toward the 21st century,
mapping out the direction and framework of future development of
China-South Africa relations.
</P>
<P>
!0A constructive China-South Africa partnership featuring
long-term stability, true friendship and all-round cooperation
oriented toward the 21st century serves the fundamental interest
of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"President Nelson Mandela's upcoming state visit to China will
even more forcefully push forward the bilateral relations," Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Africa in 1996, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin put forward a five-point proposal for consolidating and
developing the 21st century-oriented relationship of long-term
stability and all-round cooperation with the African country.
</P>
<P>
Its gist consists of sincerity and friendship, treating each
other as equals, unity and cooperation, joint development and
being oriented toward the future.
</P>
<P>
Referring to cooperation over world affairs, Hu said that both
China and South Africa are important developing countries, sharing
much common language in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said: "China attached importance to the important role
played by South Africa in international and regional affairs as
the presiding state of Non-Aligned Movement, the UNCTAD and the
Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
!0China and South Africa, through increased consultation and
cooperation in international affairs, will make even greater
contribution to world peace and development and to the cause of
human progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu began visiting South Africa on January 31. During his stay,
he has met South African President Nelson Mandela and had talks
with his deputy Thabo Mbeki and other government ministers in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Mercury Poisoning Disease Re-Emerges in Brazil: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A debilitating illness of the
nervous system caused by mercury poisoning has re-emerged in
fishing communities of the remote Amazon rainforest in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the so-called Minamata disease has been
diagnosed outside the Japanese town of the same name, the New
Scientist magazine reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, some 1,500 people from Minamata suffered terrible
damage to their nervous systems, which resulted in uncontrollable
shaking and muscle wasting, and produced appalling deformities in
their children.
</P>
<P>
A toxic, organic form of mercury known as methyl mercury is
believed to be responsible for the disease. The Japanese victims
had eaten fish from a bay polluted by mercury from a metals plant.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Maszumi Harada of Kumamoto University and Junko
Nakanishi from the Yokohama National University claimed that the
same symptoms are showing up in the Amazon, according to New
Scientist.
</P>
<P>
Harada, an expert on the disease who works near Minamata,
examined 50 people from villages around San Luis do Tapajos. All
had high levels of methyl mercury in their bodies and three had
symptoms of Minamata disease.
</P>
<P>
The experts found methyl mercury present in fish in the Amazon
region. However, there is confusion about whether it comes from
gold mining or soil deposits that collect following deforestation,
New Scientist said.

<HEADLINE> Hu: China's Economy Grows Despite of Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
Vice-President Hu Jintao said here Wednesday that China had
sustained its economic development despite the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a banquet given by the South African business
community and the African-Asian Society, Hu noted that China 's
GDP grew by 7.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP rose from 362.4 billion Yuan (about 44 billion U.S.
Dollars) in 1979 to 7,974.8 billion Yuan (about 961 billion
Dollars) in 1998, registering an average annual growth rate of
nearly 9.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rapid development to a proactive fiscal
policy -- to increase input in building infrastructure, to
stimulate domestic demand, and to implement a strategy of
diversified foreign trade markets.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we adopted a responsible attitude, staunchly
 safeguarding the stability of RMB Yuan (Chinese currency) and
took an active part in International Monetary Fund's bailout
program for the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
"By doing so, we made our contribution to alleviating the Asian
 financial crisis and stabilizing the economy of Asia and the
world at large. "
</P>
<P>
Referring to future economic policy, Hu said that the Chinese
government are taking effective measures and working hard to
solve, in the main, the problem of food and clothing for those
poverty-stricken people within this century.
</P>
<P>
China is trying its best to gradually narrow the gap between
the western and eastern parts of the country in a bid to achieve
co-ordinated development for different parts of China and common
prosperity for the entire people.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is here for a four-day official visit following his
visit to Madagasca, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, is scheduled to wind
up his South African tour and leave for home Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki met visiting Austrian Chancellor Viktor
Klima Wednesday on the promotion of bilateral ties, especially in
the trade and economic fields, South African national television
reported.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries were very good and trade
and economic links were a stepping stone for South Africa's
business community to enter into large European Union (EU)
markets, as well as eastern European markets, Mbeki said after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
South African companies should use the opportunities as Austria
has had good relations with many European countries for years,
Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Klima, who arrived in South Africa Tuesday night for a two-day
visit, said South Africa was an important partner for Austria, and
the two countries shared excellent political and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a need to further enhance ties between South
Africa and other EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The high-level Austrian delegation led by Klima will hold
separate meetings with South African trade and industry minister
and finance minister on Thursday. A number of bilateral
cooperation agreements are expected to be signed or ratified.
</P>
<P>
Austria is among the biggest trade partners of South Africa,
with its total investment in the country amounting to 800 million
Rand (133 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Klima played a key role in securing the newly-struck free trade
deal between the EU and South Africa. The deal, reached in
Switzerland last week, would open EU markets to 95 of South
Africa's exports over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Mbeki and Klima also discussed conflicts
in Africa, especially in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo
and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he was pleased with Austria's willingness to
contribute to ending conflicts in these war-torn countries.

LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Two senior envoys from Togo
started Wednesday to mediate between the two warring parties in
Guinea Bissau on behalf of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Togo's Foreign Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh and Defence
Minister Assani Tidjani arrived in capital Bissau Wednesday to
consult with President Joao Vieira and rebel leader Ansumane Mane
on a draft of immediate ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted diplomats in Bissau as saying that there was
fighting earlier in the day with the sound of automatic gun fire
getting closer to the city center.
</P>
<P>
But, there had been "relative and comfortable calm" since the
two envoys arrived in the capital city after mid day.
</P>
<P>
In Lome, capital of Togo, an official statement said that
Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current ECOWAS chairman,
had been in " permanent contact" with President Vieira and rebel
leader Mane who had agreed to sign a new ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
A peace accord signed by the two parties last November in
Nigerian capital Abuja was shattered by renewed fighting broke out
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja accord called for the withdrawal of foreign troops,
the deployment of a peacekeeping force of ECOMOG, a government of
national unity and general elections in March this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 ECOMOG troops, mostly from Togo, are already in
Guinea Bissau as part of the Abuja accord and hundreds more are
due to arrive this week to replace Senegalese and Guinean troops
backing President Vieira.
</P>
<P>
However, some 300 peacekeeping soldiers from Benin and Niger
have been stranded on a French navy ship off Bissau since Sunday
because of the fighting in the capital city.

Such a piece of information was published in the local daily

Observers here do not exclude the possibility that the
information - which quoted unidentified sources in the ruling
Democratic Party be either a litmus test or a suggestion to Andrei
Plesu who became foreign minister at the proposal of this party,
but who has no political affiliation.
</P>

Andrei Plesu, a well-known cultural personage, was the first

<HEADLINE> Millions of Children Without Basic Education in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (XInhua) -- More than 130 million children
of primary school-going age in developing countries, including 73
million irls, are growing up without access to basic education,
Ghana News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in the 1999 State of the World's Children
Report, which said the world can no longer afford such an
enormous waste of human potential.
</P>
<P>
The 132-page report on education highlights what to do in
ensuring the right to education and the strides and challenges for
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The report, launched by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
and the Ghana National Commission on Children (GNCC) in Accra
Wednesday, says nearly one billion people, two-thirds of them
women, will enter the 21st century unable to read a book or sign
their names, much less operate a computer or understand a simple
application form.
</P>
<P>
"And they will live, as now, in more desperate poverty and
poorer health than most of those who can. They are the world's
functional illiterates and their numbers are growing," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the consequences of illiteracy are
profound, even potentially life threatening, inclduign the denial
of fundamental human rights and the right to education.
</P>
<P>
It said without education, people cannot work productively,
care for their health, sustain and protect themselves and their
families or live culturally enriched lives.
</P>
<P>
Illiteracy makes it difficult for them to interact in society
in a spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance and gender equality
among all peoples and groups.
</P>
<P>
"Making education revolution a global reality is the soundest
investment in a peaceful and prosperous future that we can make
for our children," said the report.
