RED SOX OVERCOME DEFICIT TO BEAT TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For one dark moment on a glorious September afternoon, grand old
Fenway Park Thursday felt like Bleak House.
</P>
<P>
   A game the struggling Sox sorely needed to win was slipping
away. Fans who had cashed in comp days to cheer the hometown team
were all but covering their eyes at the ugliness. And it was only
the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, just when a crescendo of boos suggested all faith had been
hijacked, the Sox stormed back from the precipice, overcoming a 5-0
deficit to dump the Minnesota Twins, 11-6, and keep hope alive in
their quest for a place in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The win stopped the bleeding from a rough loss to Oakland the
night before and bolstered the Sox for Friday's opener of a
four-game showdown with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   With 25 games to play, the Sox remained six games behind New
York in the AL East but crept to within two of Cleveland in the
scramble for the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge,'' said third baseman Lou Merloni, whose three
hits and two RBIs were instrumental. ``Every game from now on is
big, but this one, it just seemed like we had to have this game.
There's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The crucial comeback was powered by a late-blooming power
hitter, Jose Offerman, and a supporting cast led by the
no-longer-dizzy Merloni, returning to full-time action from a mild
concussion, and the increasingly reliable newcomer Dante Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   But it might have failed without a timely turnaround by Ramon
Martinez, who swiftly righted himself after the Twins shelled him
for the five first-inning runs. The game was a makeup of a July 26
rainout.
</P>
<P>
   The big blow in the first was a grand slam by David Ortiz. It
was the third first-inning slam Martinez has yielded in his last
five starts. Jay Buhner hit one against him in Seattle July 31 and
Will Clark crushed one in Baltimore July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Corey Koskie followed Ortiz's shot with a solo homer
to make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out there and give up five runs, you don't have to
give up,'' Martinez said. ``You can never give up. You have to give
your team a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Which he did splendidly. After Koskie's bomb, Martinez retired
the next 10 batters and 16 of the next 17. He then yielded a bloop
single to Koskie and a run-scoring triple to Torii Hunter before
manager Jimy Williams inserted Jeff Fassero as the first of five
relievers who helped seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Martinez departed, the Sox were sitting on a 9-6
lead. And Williams credited Pedro's big brother for withstanding
the first-inning pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a sign of a guy who has been through the war, so to
speak,'' Williams said. ``He's a professional, to be able to
maintain his composure. He bent a little, but he didn't break.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez received a standing ovation when he left, not long
after many of the same patrons jeered him. And he can thank the Sox
hitters for giving him the lead that helped make it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, power starved for much of the season, launched the
comeback by lacing a home run into the screen in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   And Bichette, who doubled to open the second, scored on
Merloni's two-out single to make it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing to do when you're down 5-0 is try to get all
five back right away,'' Merloni said. ``You just chip away.''
</P>
<P>
   They chipped plenty in the fourth. Bichette made the first dent
with a leadoff homer into the screen, his second homer in as many
games. He said he is trying to use the pressure of the pennant race
to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is at stake right now,'' Bichette said, ``so I'm
just trying to enjoy it and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the inning ended, the Sox batted around, chased starter
Eric Milton, and scored five runs on three more hits and two walks.
The big hit other than Bichette's homer was a one-out, two-run
double by Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Sox a 7-5 lead, which they increased to 9-5 in the
fifth on a single by Jason Varitek, an RBI double by Merloni, and
Mike Lansing's run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we've always had since I've been here, the
ability to come back,'' said Varitek, who joined the team in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After the Twins scored the run off Martinez in the sixth, the
Sox countered in their half of the inning. Offerman led off with a
double to the gap in left-center. A batter later, Nomar Garciaparra
lined a single that left fielder Matt Lawton let scoot past him for
an error, allowing Offerman to score, making it 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman's second homer of the day, another screen job, made it
11-6 in the eighth. It was his third homer in two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in our offense,'' Williams said, ``and they did an
outstanding job on a day when we had to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday brings a new test, as Roger Clemens goes against rookie
Tomo Ohka, who was in grade school in Kyoto, Japan, when Clemens
was winning 24 games and pitching the Sox into the 1986 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of games and we've got to make up some
ground, so every game is big,'' said Bryce Florie, who pitched a
scoreless ninth to preserve the victory. ``But if we can do
something against those guys, we can put ourselves right back in
the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing bleak about that.

BUSH SUGGESTS WILLINGNESS TO MOVE ON DEBATE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES ``referendum'' to ``reflection'' in 2nd graf  
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service      
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid Republican concerns that he needs to end the
debate over debates, Gov. George W. Bush and several of his
advisers sent signals Thursday that they were willing to be
flexible about the original position that they had outlined and
that Vice President Al Gore had rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been seeking to cast that rejection as a reflection on
Gore's credibility, asserting that the vice president was breaking
a promise to debate anytime and anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But a few of Bush's advisers conceded Thursday that Bush had not
made significant inroads with that argument, which the campaign
made the centerpiece of a television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas governor hinted that he was ready to break the
stalemate, a step that many Republican officials have described as
a necessary part of putting his campaign back on a better track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident there will be debates,'' Bush said in Detroit
Thursday morning. ``As to what they look like and where they are,
it will be worked out in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added, ``You cannot run for the presidency without
presidential debates.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference to uncertainty over the details and formats of the
debates suggested an inclination to negotiate, as did the later
remarks of one of his campaign aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's on the table,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Four days ago, Bush agreed to just one of three 90-minute
debates that were proposed by the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates and guaranteed to be broadcast by all the
major networks. Gore previously agreed to all three.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he also wanted to do two 60-minute debates
sponsored by individual networks, an arrangement that would almost
certainly shrink the television audience. He called for the first
of those debates to take place next Tuesday, in Washington, on a
special weeknight edition of the NBC news program ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, several advisers said that the Bush campaign was
considering whether to agree to a second commission debate if Gore
would agree to the 60-minute network debates. The latter would have
the kind of less formal setting in which Bush and his aides feel he
shines, the advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's advisers and officials with the debate commission
said late Thursday that they had not received any word from the
Bush campaign that it was prepared to negotiate along these lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said, ``The
governor has made no decisions on what he'll do. He's still going
to hold Al Gore's feet to the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer was referring to Bush's tentative plans to travel on
Tuesday to Washington for the debate on ``Meet the Press.'' But
Gore has said he will not be there, and NBC has said it will not
air a show without both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the campaign, Gore had said he would debate Bush on
the program, but that was before Bush had rejected two of the three
commission debates. Gore's current position is that other debates
should be added to _ not substituted for _ the commission's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's advisers said that the signs that the Bush
campaign might move from its original position reflected ``the
realization that people didn't buy their debate strategy that Gore
was hiding from debates. It was a ludicrous argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser, however, said that Bush was always prepared to
move from his initial position, which reflected his preferences but
was largely the opening bid in an inevitable poker game.

U.N. SPEAKERS URGE INCREASE IN CHARITY TO THE POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS to ``King Harald''   in 10th graf)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A succession of leaders speaking on the second
day of the United Nations' Millennium Summit on Thursday demanded,
with passion and often eloquence, that the industrialized world
show more tangible charity toward the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billions among the living struggle to survive in conditions of
poverty, deprivation and underdevelopment as offensive to
everything humane as anything we decry about the second
millennium,'' President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor of the world stand at the gates of the comfortable
mansions occupied by each and every king and queen, president,
prime minister and minister privileged to attend this unique
meeting,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, relatively few speakers of the 70 leaders who were
scheduled to speak Thursday offered specific remedies beyond debt
forgiveness, leaving it to some Western countries, like Canada and
Italy, to endorse additional, if less dramatic, measures.
</P>
<P>
   A declaration to be signed on Friday when the summit meeting
ends has set ambitious benchmarks for resolving the global ills of
war, disease, poverty and environmental degradation. One such goal
proposes to reduce by half over the next 15 years the number of
people earning less than a dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela reckoned,
``we should increase that income to levels of fairness and dignity
for 140,000 persons each day of each month and of each year from
the present until Dec. 31, 2015.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian prime minister, Giuliano Amato, agreed that radical
efforts were required. ``Debt cancellation is important,
indispensable even, but not enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed opening markets to developing countries by
abolishing quotas and tariffs and allocating fresh resources for
education.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the misgivings expressed about the impact of
globalization on poor countries, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of
Canada said: ``We must share the benefits of globalization. We must
give it a human purpose and a human face. The poorest countries
require access for their goods to export markets. Faster, deeper
and broader debt relief should be pursued vigorously.'' And
Chretien added: ``We must ensure that the benefits or the
information revolution are shared by all.''
</P>
<P>
   King Harald V of Norway observed that poverty is inextricably
linked to problems like environmental deterioration. ``For we shall
never be able to cooperate effectively on how to husband the scarce
resources of our planet, how to prevent the degradation of the
environment, as long as so many are trapped in hopeless poverty,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   President J.J. Rawlings of Ghana blamed Western corporations for
``thrusting'' corruption on Africa, which, he contended, ``has
drained some of our countries of resources which should have been
used to improve the quality of life of the poor and
disadvantaged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be less corruption in Africa,'' he said, ``if there
is no place to hide the proceeds of corruption or if the proceeds
of corruption, once uncovered, are returned to their real owners,
the people of Africa,'' he said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a remote jungle of Guatemala, among the remains of a
little-known ancient city with a name meaning Place of Serpents,
archaeologists have uncovered one of the largest and most splendid
palaces of Maya kings ever discovered. Its 170 high-ceiling rooms
were built around 11 courtyards and spread over an area greater
than two football fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has found anything like this since the turn of the last
century,'' Arthur A. Demarest, an archaeologist at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville and leader of the discovery team, said
Thursday in describing the palace, which dates from the eighth
century A.D. ``What is most incredible about this site is that most
of the palace is buried virtually intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Demarest said that in size and preservation the palace, at
Cancuen, rivaled the buildings at the central acropolis in Tikal,
one of the grandest seats of Mayan power in Guatemala. Earlier
expeditions had either overlooked or underestimated the size and
grandeur of the palace and the city around it, a prosperous center
of commerce and crafts at the head of navigation on the Pasion
River.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery and the first excavations at Cancuen were made
this summer by archaeologists led by Demarest and Tomas Barrientos
of Guatemala. The expedition is sponsored by the Guatemalan
Institute of Anthropology and History, the National Geographic
Society and Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinarily important find,'' David Freidel, a
specialist in Maya studies at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas who has no connection to the work, said in an interview.
``It's been a long time since a major palace complex has come to
light. A scientific investigation of the ruins should help us
understand political life in the late classic period of the Maya.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maya civilization was at the peak of its power in Central
America and Mexico from 250 to 900, known as the classic period.
The king who completed the palace _ inscriptions give his name as
Tah ak Chaan _ ruled Cancuen for about 50 years, beginning in 740.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Freidel said, the focus of Mayan political life
and state ceremony had shifted from the grand outdoor plazas to the
palaces, which means that the buildings' art and architecture may
reflect the changing relationships of powerful rulers, nobles and
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Even a preliminary study of the site and its inscribed monuments
has already produced one surprise: There is no evidence that the
city's rulers engaged in any major wars with neighbors. Nor is
there any sign of pyramids, the typically spectacular bases for
temples and manifestations of the religious roots of a city's
power.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of pyramid temples was the main reason previous
archaeologists largely passed by the ruins and failed to
investigate the true size of the palace.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries alone may cause scholars to reconsider some of
their ideas about the Maya civilization, Demarest said. Here was a
city that appeared to prosper for hundreds of years without warfare
or the usual display of religion as sources of the power of Maya
kings, particularly toward the end of their dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a book in press that I'll have to revise,'' Demarest
remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Maya cities, Cancuen appeared to use its strategic
position at the foot of the highlands, a source of jade, obsidian
and other valuable commodities, to become a commercial power
throughout the lowlands. Demarest said the city must have been
larger, richer and more powerful than anyone had expected. Its
rulers appeared to have been single-mindedly dedicated to commerce.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first excavations of residences disclosed that the
city had a relatively wealthy middle class and many workshops for
artisans producing elite goods for trade far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   Jade is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. A young
middle-class woman was found in her grave with 10 jade inlaid
teeth. Workmen were buried with fine ceramic figurines with
beautiful headdresses. At a workshop lay a 35-pound chunk of jade,
which artisans had been slicing for pieces to manufacture
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Other excavations turned up large amounts of pyrite, commonly
known as fool's gold. Thin sheets of it were being used in making
mirrors, one of the more prized possessions of the elite.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All this might never have been uncovered if Demarest had not
literally fallen into the discovery of the palace.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of excavations at Dos Pilas and other sites in
northern Guatemala, where he found ample evidence of a highly
militaristic city-state called Petexbatun, Demarest decided last
year to visit Cancuen to follow up a lead. Members of his team had
found records of a marriage alliance between a Dos Pilas prince and
a Cancuen princess. She then came to Dos Pilas to live in her own
small palace.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the architecture and crafts of Cancuen, Demarest said,
``It looks as if the princess brought her own artisans, because the
stonework on her palace is just like that at Cancuen and far
superior to anything in the Petexbatun region.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the archaeologists looked more closely at the ruins of what
turned out to be the royal palace. ``To the untrained eye, the
palace looks just like a great, jungle-covered hill,'' Demarest
said.
</P>
<P>
   While walking along the ruin's highest level, Dr. Demarest fell
up to his armpits into vegetation filling one of the courtyards.
``That's when I realized the entire hill was a three-story building
and we were walking on top of the roof,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, archaeologists have only dug test holes into the palace
ruins, enough to estimate the dimensions of the building. The walls
are build of solid limestone. They enclose a densely packed
labyrinth of rooms with 20-foot-high corbel-arched ceilings. The
team's leaders estimate it will take at least 10 years to excavate
and partly restore the palace.
</P>
<P>
   They are making plans to deploy a larger team of researchers and
excavators at the site next February, at the end of the rainy
season. The region is free of civil war now, Demarest said, but the
government of Guatemala has little presence there and it is still a
virtually lawless place.
</P>
<P>
   Demarest said the expedition has mobilized and trained the
people of the nearest village, El Zapote, to stand guard over the
newfound palace.

 TRUTH BENT IN ADS FOR SCHOOL INITIATIVES  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truth has been a casualty in a pair of hot races involving two
educational initiatives. The battle over ballot measures on school
vouchers and school bonds is flooding the airwaves with TV and
radio spots that are more aggressive than accurate.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the campaigns for Proposition 38 and Proposition 39
have run the most visible media campaigns in California, bombarding
voters with their own contrasting views of political reality. Who's
doing the fudging, however, depends on who you talk to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed that (school voucher opponents) are getting away
with saying so many things that aren't true,'' said Chris Bertelli,
a spokesman for Proposition 38, the school voucher initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But the opponents have their own complaints about the
pro-voucher ads, which feature young schoolchildren talking about
their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yes on 38 TV ad in Spanish is deceptive and offensive to
the Latino community in California,'' said Hector Chacon, a
Southern California school board trustee. ``Prop. 38 will prevent
our children from succeeding by abandoning the public school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar complaints echo from the Proposition 39 camp, which is
fighting for a measure that would reduce the present two-thirds
vote requirement to pass school bonds to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to combat the ridiculous and false statements
being made in the (anti-Prop. 39) ads,'' said Rick Claussen,
campaign manager for the school bond effort.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SCHOOLAD (70523 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``They're not running the most straightforward campaign,''
countered Sheri Annis, a spokeswoman for the Proposition 39
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gov. Gray Davis has gotten involved _ in a way not to his
liking.
</P>
<P>
   Although Davis is chairman of the anti-voucher campaign and has
done a television ad for the effort, he has found himself the
unexpected star of a pro-Proposition 38 TV spot.
</P>
<P>
   The ad shows Davis saying in his January State of the State
address that ``California schools still rank near the bottom of the
50 states. That's not good enough for me, and it's certainly not
good enough for the children of California.''
</P>
<P>
   If the governor thinks California schools are lousy, the ad
suggests, parents should vote for vouchers to improve their
children's education.
</P>
<P>
   Both the governor and the anti-voucher campaign are crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers sent all kinds of letters to the `Yes' side telling
them the footage was used illegally,'' said John Lenzner of the
``No on 38'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Political advertising has never been held to the same standards
as courtroom testimony, so it's no surprise that the best response
to many of the claims being made might be ``yes, but ... .''
</P>
<P>
   When voucher backers claim that Proposition 38 will bring a new
renaissance to California education, for example, they don't
mention that no state has ever run a voucher system before and the
promised results are largely guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   And while opponents charge that Proposition 39 puts no limits on
tax increases, there aren't any limits now, even without the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of SCHOOLAD (70523 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  One reason the two school campaigns might be nastier than usual
is that they both repeat earlier efforts. In November 1993, a
school voucher effort lost big, due largely to a flood of money
from teacher groups opposed to the plan. And last March, voters
rejected Proposition 26, which would have required only a majority
vote to pass school bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Proposition 39 are hoping that familiarity will
breed contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters didn't go for 50 percent, so now (Prop. 39 backers)
are trying 55 percent,'' Annis said. ``We think the voters will get
a little perturbed at having to vote on something they already
rejected once this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But both voucher and bond advocates argue that they are bringing
new and improved measures to the voters and expect new and improved
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't Proposition 26 again,'' said Claussen. ``Now we're
keeping the supermajority vote and adding new accountability
procedures, which makes this different and much better.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against the proposals haven't changed much,
however, and neither have their advocates. The anti-voucher effort,
for example, again is backed by education money and supported by
many state and local political powerhouses.

ON TENNIS: HINGIS FORMS AN ALLIANCE WORTHY OF `SURVIVOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Hingis plopped down at a table in a
restaurant outside Hilton Head, S.C., to lay a fork on some
Southern cooking for the first time. But before the waiter could
take her order, she noticed a palm-sized wooden triangle next to
the salt and pepper. It was a pegboard stuffed with colorful golf
tees, one stuck in every hole but one.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, a game she'd never before seen became her
obsession. Throughout the entire dinner, the uncommonly patient
teen from Switzerland eliminated tees by leaping one over the
other, switching and plucking them, more fixated on decoding the
inanimate opponent than making conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the plates were cleared, Hingis finally slapped the
triangle on the table with a satisfied smile. She'd done it. Just
one tee remained.
</P>
<P>
   This was the spring of 1997, days after Hingis became the No. 1
ranked player in women's tennis. In the span of one dinner, she had
unwittingly demonstrated her strategy for survival at the top.
Whatever maneuver or manipulation it took, however long was
necessary, she could devise a plan to be the last one standing, to
be the last peg left.
</P>
<P>
   Although her body type wouldn't stand out in a crowd at the Gap,
her muscle-bound savvy separates her from the rest of the tour.
Mischievous by nature, if she's the host of a slumber party, it's
best to stay awake.
</P>
<P>
   With those qualities, it is not surprising that Hingis, faced
with the daunting power of the Williams sisters, would form an
alliance with Lindsay Davenport in a maneuver that seems lifted
from an episode of ``Survivor.'' It may seem petty on the outside,
but Hingis understands that whether one is on a remote island or in
a shark-infested office, there is one elementary-school lesson of
safety that never fails: the buddy system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Lindsay a while ago,'' Hingis said after she spent
almost two hours developing her blueprint on a practice court
Thursday at the National Tennis Center. ``I told her, `One to
go.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Davenport completed the first stage of the
Plot. Inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, Davenport methodically pounded
shot after shot at the shoestrings of Serena Williams' lilac Pumas,
leaving her zip-quick opponent pinned behind the baseline and
desperate to end draining rallies with trick shots.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Hingis was flashing her Garfield smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Lindsay played a great match,'' Hingis said. ``It
was good for Lindsay to get by a player who had beaten her five
times.''
</P>
<P>
   It was good for Hingis, too. Friday, Hingis will try to
dismantle Venus Williams' awesome force with the nerve and delicate
touch of a bomb technician. If her strategy works _ if she can
handcuff Williams by firing at her gangly body, if she can snap up
balls on the rise and turn them into winners _ Hingis could face
Davenport in the U.S. Open women's final. And if not her, then
Davenport's semifinal opponent, Elena Dementieva.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, at least Hingis would avoid facing the mighty
Williams sisters on consecutive days, and perhaps have a little
more left to win a Grand Slam title for the first time since the
1999 Australian Open. To that end, it was to Hingis' advantage to
motivate Davenport before her match against Serena Williams by
saying these simple words, ``You're first.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few courts away from Hingis, Richard Williams practiced
Thursday with his daughter Venus. ``I think it's a good idea,'' he
said of Hingis' strategy. ``If I'm chasing the damn rabbit, I'd ask
the dog to help, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's part of the issue beneath the surface here. The
Williams sisters aren't ahead of the higher ranked Hingis and
Davenport; it just seems that way. Colorful, charismatic and
creative in their style, they are the focus of every camera, at the
heart of all the buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is too polite in public to openly admit she's hyped
out on the Williams sisters, but the more candid Hingis sees the
sensation as a personal affront.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think the Williams sisters are good for women's
tennis because they bring a lot of people out to see the sport,''
Hingis said. ``But I'm still the No. 1 player, and Lindsay is No.
2. Venus has only played half the year, and Serena missed several
weeks, too. They're injured a lot, and don't play as many events.
For years, they've done a lot of talking about how they're going to
be No. 1 and No. 2. They aren't, and it gets _ I don't know _
tiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say they are big talkers. That's not what I
mean. But it's been five or six years of this, and they haven't
done it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What they have done is rattle Hingis, if only momentarily. And
that, too, is good for tennis. The Williams sisters have sent
Hingis back to the drawing board. And in her own crafty way, Hingis
has motivated Davenport to regroup with her. Just like Serena and
Venus, Lindsay and Martina have the ability to push each other.
</P>
<P>
   Now the real competition is on. Which alliance will have to
adjust next? Hingis and Davenport or Williams and Williams?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not going to change,'' Richard Williams said. ``We
changed tennis to the extent that everyone is playing to a higher
level.''
</P>
<P>
   The clever Hingis has a plan to match it. But she needs
Davenport by her side. After all, there is safety in numbers. At
least until Hingis and Davenport have to meet each other in a
final. If that happens on Saturday, on the island of center court,
the alliance will end. Last peg left wins.

WILL AX FALL ON JOHNSON?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Davey Johnson has never been told he would lose
his job as Los Angeles Dodgers manager should the team fail to make
the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, an understanding that anything shy of the
playoffs, given his often-chilly relationship with general manager
Kevin Malone, would result in his termination despite having one
year and $1.5 million remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are 73-67, just got pummeled by Pittsburgh and are
10 games behind San Francisco in the National League West, and they
trail the New York Mets by 7 games in the wild-card picture. In
other words, Johnson has 22 games remaining in his two-year tenure
as Dodgers manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things you'd like to improve, and improve at a
faster pace,'' Johnson said. ``I've been here two years, and came
here late in the first year, and in two years I'm in the playoff
picture. I don't feel real good about not being five or six games
up. In this game, you want to fit and you want to make it work, and
if somebody decides something different, that's not even an issue.
That's not a part of my issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a decision already appears to be imminent, the brain
trust said it will evaluate everything after the season ends, Oct.
1 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides will bring their issues. There are reasons to side
with management and there are reasons to side with the manager:
</P>
<P>
   __ Keep him _ Even though the Dodgers are 150-152 in Johnson's
two years in Los Angeles, he remains the winningest active manager.
He's 1,135-879, a winning percentage of .564. Atlanta's Bobby Cox
is second at 1,603-1261(.560). Johnson's won a World Series and
qualified for the playoffs six times.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dump him _ Malone questioned Johnson's managerial strategy,
saying the Dodgers needed to manufacture more runs. Malone said
they needed to bunt more, needed to situational hit better, needed
to improve fundamentals and needed to improve on their record
(12-33) when they don't homer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Keep him _ The Dodgers have a payroll of $98 million, but
they don't have a fourth or fifth starter worth their salt. Kevin
Brown, Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort are a combined 37-21 with a
3.49 ERA. But the Dodgers tried Orel Hershiser, Mike Judd, Carlos
Perez, Matt Herges, Eric Gagne and Ismael Valdes in the fourth and
fifth spots, and they've responded by going 7-25 with a 6.70 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dump him _ The club has no consistency. The Dodgers beat
Philadelphia three straight and seemed to have some fight left.
They turned around and got swept for the first time in 12 years by
the Pittsburgh Pirates, getting outscored 28-4. In Johnson's
tenure, the Dodgers' longest winning streak is six games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Keep him _ There is no depth in the minor-league system. When
center fielder and leadoff hitter Devon White went down for nearly
three months with a partially torn left rotator cuff, Todd
Hollandsworth and F.P. Santangelo wound up playing center field and
leading off, roles in which they were miscast. The team had nobody
to turn to in the minors and didn't have enough talent to make a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dump him _ Johnson said in spring training he had everything
he needed, i.e., a better bullpen and better bench. Trading leadoff
man Eric Young was an issue, but Johnson said Hollandsworth and
White would be able to handle the load. Instead, the Dodgers'
leadoff men are batting .238 with a .313 on-base percentage. The
Dodgers' top spot in the batting order has scored 86 runs, ahead of
only the seventh, eighth and ninth spots.
</P>
<P>
   __ Keep him _ Gary Sheffield missed 11 games with a viral
infection, Mark Grudzielanek missed six and nearly everyone else
was stricken with the illness and missed some time. There was also
the cloud from Wrigley Field incident hanging over the season for
three months, and it's still not resolved since 21 members of the
organization were subpoenaed for a pair of criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dump him _ The club spent $98 million so talent could be
mixed and matched to overcome the loss of a player or two for a
certain period of time. And the only lengthy injury that could have
ailed the Dodgers was the loss of White for 71 games. Kevin Brown
suffered a broken right pinkie, but it kept him out for only two
weeks and the type of injury that could devastate a season was not
present.
</P>
<P>
   __ Keep him _ Johnson's a veteran manager with a veteran team.
Matt Herges was the only rookie on the roster for the whole season.
Many players in the clubhouse, despite some differences of opinion
at some point during the season, said Johnson is the perfect
manager for this collection of players. Shortstop Alex Cora and
third baseman Adrian Beltre are the only two starting position
players with less than five years of experience at the major-league
level.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dump him _ Johnson still doesn't communicate with many of his
players. The back-biting that became commonplace last September
isn't around now, but players still wonder about their roles and
often turn to the front office for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Davey has done the best job any coach can possibly do
under the circumstances,'' Sheffield said. ``To take nothing away
from anyone else, I think Davey has handled the situation probably
as best as anyone could, and to be honest, we just haven't
responded as a team. It's not a reflection of the manager, it's a
reflection of looking in the mirror and saying, 'Do I put the team
first?' `'
</P>
<P>
   Managing general partner, CEO and chairman Bob Daly would not
comment on the managerial issue, other than to say that Johnson is
the club's manager under contract. Malone said he wanted to focus
on the rest of the season, and that Johnson was the manager and is
under contract for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that comes after Daly told Johnson in early July the
Dodgers needed to play with more fire. And after Malone criticized
Johnson's managerial style at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The organization hoped that stating those things publicly would
motivate the Dodgers. Instead, it brought a death watch over the
club once it started playing poorly. That subsided for a while last
month when Malone said Johnson would remain for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the cast of players in here and we're sitting (10)
games out of first place,'' Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter said.
``Where we have faltered as a team, and this involves players _
this does not involve the coaches or anything _ we have faltered in
that we have not done the things to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those include moving guys over when needed, getting bunts
down, making defensive plays and being a smart player out there.
There's been too many mental mistakes made and each one of us is
guilty of it, so to say we underachieved is probably a good
statement, a true statement. I think it falls on the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment for the season falls on the players, but when
a team spends likes the Dodgers and doesn't win, especially when it
sells itself as a contender, someone else will take the fall.
</P>
<P>
   That appears to be Johnson. He has a few more punches left in
him when a decision is made on his future, but it apparently will
take an unforeseen turn of events for him to make it to a third
season.

IN EXPLOSIVE RALLY, YANKS SWAMP ROYALS, 7-3 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Chili Davis played the last two seasons with
the New York Yankees and walked away believing they defied the old
sports axiom that you cannot turn on your intensity like a light
switch. The Yankees, Davis told a friend, were absolutely capable
of doing that, and did it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Davis would have smiled if he had been watching his old
teammates Thursday night. They gave away a game in the ninth inning
Wednesday, and then Thursday night, they failed to score in the
first eight innings, even though the Kansas City Royals' Dan
Reichert issued nine walks.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of a disheartening 1-0 loss, the Yankees exploded
for seven runs in the top of the ninth and went on to a 7-3
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle pitched eight strong innings, improving his record
to 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (79-58) have a sturdy six-game lead in the American
League East as they prepare to play the Red Sox four games in four
days _ a three-game weekend series in Boston, and then a makeup for
an early-season rainout at Yankee Stadium on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens will pitch against Boston's Tomo Ohka Friday in
Clemens' first Fenway Park outing since his disastrous playoff
start last fall; Clemens lasted only two innings in Game 3 of the
American League Championship Series, allowing five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly half of the 110 pitches thrown by Reichert were strikes,
and he tied a club record with all the walks, but incredibly, he
was in a position to win after the Royals scored a run in the
eighth. Ricky Bottalico came on to pitch the ninth inning for
Kansas City and walked Jose Canseco before Scott Brosius singled;
Chuck Knoblauch, pinch-running for Canseco, advanced to second.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Wilson replaced Bottalico, and the pinch-hitter Luis
Polonia bunted toward third. Wilson came off the mound, fielded the
ball and threw toward third, attempting to get the force play _ and
missed his target by several feet, the ball bounding down the line.
Knoblauch scored the tying run, Brosius reached third and Polonia
went to second. The Royals' infield moved in, and Jose Vizcaino
pulled a single through the right side, driving in the go-ahead
run. The Yankees added five more runs, the last on a two-run homer
by David Justice.

ROGERS ROLLS, THEN IS ROCKED

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kenny Rogers was perfect for 4 1/3 innings Thursday
night, conjuring up images of that brilliant night in 1994 when he
retired 27 consecutive hitters against the California Angels. But
when Carlos Lee singled with one out in the fifth, that vision went
poof in the warm humid night.
</P>
<P>
   It was replaced by another vision, this one more real and
relevant to what has been happening to Rogers lately. Rogers'
terrific pitching performance turned to disaster faster than Scott
Sheldon can switch positions in the middle of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox scored five runs off Rogers and Jeff
Zimmerman in the sixth inning to erase the Rangers' 5-1 lead and
Chicago went on to a 10-6 victory at Comiskey Park on Thursday
night. The victory gave the White Sox a split of the four-game
series and denied the Rangers a chance to win their first series of
any length since July 24-26, when they took two of three from the
Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were able to contain the rampaging White Sox for the
first two nights with the pitching of Ryan Glynn and Doug Davis.
They weren't so lucky with Rick Helling on Wednesday and Rogers on
Thursday, their two best pitchers who have hit a slump heading down
the home stretch.
</P>
<P>
   They may be tired. They may have lost that adrenaline edge that
can sustain tired players on teams with a chance to win. They may
be making bad pitches, which is their basic theory. But they are
not winning.
</P>
<P>
   Helling is 0-3 with a 9.12 earned-run average in his past five
starts. Rogers, even though Zimmerman got the loss last night, is
0-4 with a 6.00 ERA in his past six starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt fine; I wasn't tired,'' Rogers said. ``I just made a
couple of bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Johnny Oates, ``He may have run out of gas after
throwing 70 pitches, but my personal opinion is fatigue wasn't any
part of what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers retired the first 13 hitters he faced before Lee lined a
single to center in the fifth. Paul Konerko's single moved him to
third and he scored on Herbert Perry's sacrifice fly. Rogers got
out of that inning, but he got into immediate trouble in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny looked like he was cruising through the first 13
batters,'' Oates said. ``Give Carlos credit. That pitch was just
off his shoetops. We got out of that, but things started unraveling
in the sixth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers walked Charles Johnson leading off the inning and, after
getting ahead with two strikes, hit Ray Durham. Those were the two
batters that irritated Rogers and Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walk the first guy of an inning and hit Durham, I basically
created that inning by not getting guys out I should have,'' Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graffanino followed with a single into the left-center gap
to score one run, and Frank Thomas then lined a two-run double into
the same general direction, making it a 5-4 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch to Thomas wasn't that bad, down and in,'' Rogers
said. ``But he's good hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates brought in Zimmerman to stop the bleeding, but Magglio
Ordonez jumped on a first-pitch slider _ also down and in _ and hit
it deep over the left-field fence to make it a 6-5 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch was where I wanted it,'' Zimmerman said. ``Ordonez
usually looks first pitch away, and I wanted it on the inner third
of the plate. But they're a good hitting team. When they get hot,
they can really get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Streaks are part of baseball, both good and bad. For Rogers and
for Helling, right now it's bad.

 HOUSE FAILS TO OVERRIDE ESTATE TAX VETO  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House failed to override President Clinton's
veto of estate-tax repeal Thursday, with four Northern California
Democrats who originally voted for repeal backing away, one after a
telephone call from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Estate-tax repeal resonates in the Bay Area, where soaring house
prices and swollen stock portfolios threaten to subject many people
to the tax who consider themselves middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Zoe Lofgren of San Jose, Anna Eshoo of Palo Alto, Tom
Lantos of San Mateo and Sam Farr of Carmel all originally voted for
repeal but switched sides with 10 other Democrats to sustain the
veto.
</P>
<P>
   The 274-to-157 vote to override fell 14 short of the required
two-thirds majority, with 53 Democrats voting in favor, down three
from the original 56. Democrats also picked up most of their 11
members who were not present for the original vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren spokesman Ron Eckstein said Clinton called the
congresswoman from New York Thursday to give ``the assurances she
needs to make sure the president will ... continue to work on
solving the problem of middle-class property owners and estate
owners who are in high-property-value areas that would be hurt by
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other Bay Area Democrats who originally voted for repeal _
Walnut Creek's Ellen Tauscher and Napa's Mike Thompson _ sided with
the override attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The original bill proved popular with many Democrats, but their
leaders urged members to hold party lines to support the
administration in a critical election year. Control of the House is
at stake, and Vice President Al Gore is focusing his White House
bid on an assault against GOP nominee George W. Bush's tax cut
plan, which includes estate-tax repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Democrats for sustaining his veto, Clinton echoed
Gore's campaign language, saying the bill ``would take us back to
the days of deficits, high interest rates and fiscal
irresponsibility'' and would provide ``a huge tax break for the
most well-off Americans at the expense of working families.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign quickly responded: ``Gov. Bush believes it's
wrong to make people who have already paid taxes pay them again
when they die. When he is president, there will be no veto to
override because he will sign the abolition of the death tax into
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax _ which Republicans deride as the ``death tax'' _
starts with a 37 percent rate on inheritances worth more than
$675,000, rising to 55 percent on estates over $3 million. With
various surcharges and generation-skipping taxes, the rate can
reach as high as 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP bill would have gradually phased out the tax over 10
years, with most of the cut occurring at the end of the period. It
would have reduced government revenue by $105 billion over the next
10 years, and $50 billion a year when fully phased in.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would have signed a Democratic alternative that
would have immediately cut estate tax rates by 20 percent and
increased the exemption for farms and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo said she switched sides because the GOP bill was never
altered to meet Democratic objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much for giving people a sensible and needed tax
break for their properties, especially as a Californian and
especially as someone who helped bring about this economic
prosperity,'' Eshoo said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the GOP bill would have ``blown a hole'' in the
budget and that she was pushing a new compromise measure that she
said could be wrapped up in a year-end budget bill.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP leaders said they plan to make the estate tax veto a
campaign issue, waiting until the next congress (when they hope
Bush will be president) to push again for full repeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this will be part of the campaign,'' said GOP whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ``We'll let the American people decide by their
own votes. If the American people really want this tax relief,
we'll have a Republican Congress with a Republican president who
will sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay accused Democrats of wanting to spend the surplus. ``The
president doesn't want tax relief,'' DeLay said. ``He wants to keep
this money in Washington so he can spend it, and Gore is the same
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Farr, who had originally voted for repeal, angrily accused
Republicans of being ``more interested in a political message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were really interested in pure tax reform and helping
the people you're talking about, you would have gone down and
worked out with the president something he would sign,'' Farr said.
``But this is just total repeal, and you knew that he would veto
that, and that is mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted that the Democratic alternative was a sham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately this targeted approach touted by President
Clinton and Vice President Gore will target American families right
out of relief,'' said sponsor Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said the existing exemption for family farms and small
businesses _ which Democrats would have increased _ is so complex
that only 3 percent of businesses and farms qualify. Of those that
do, Dunn said, two thirds are then challenged by the Internal
Revenue Service and ``are forced to pay thousands of dollars in
attorneys' fees to defend themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one way to rid the code of this immoral, unfair
and economically unsound tax, and that's to eliminate it,'' Dunn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sought to make the veto a campaign issue of their own.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Senate Minority
leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., held a press conference denouncing the
attempt to override the veto and touting Gore's economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been tremendous unity in this party between the
presidential campaign and the congressional campaigns,'' Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other California Democrats joining the override attempt included
Santa Barbara's Lois Capps, Modesto's Gary Condit, and Visalia's
Cal Dooley. Only one Republican, Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., voted to
sustain the veto.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have made nine attempts to override Clinton vetoes,
but only two _ on the line-item veto and securities litigation _
prevailed by passing both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders will make another attempt next week to override a
Clinton veto, this one on the so-called ``marriage penalty.''
Republicans are picking out a few of their most popular tax bills
to either gain legislative victories or draw a contrast with the
White House.

VIOLENCE ON DECLINE BUT MANY LIVE IN FEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call it secondhand fear - most people, even those
who are not crime victims, feel threatened by the perception that
violence lurks everywhere, a trio of clinical psychologists at
California State University, Northridge, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have dubbed the condition Secondary Violence
Syndrome, characterized by chronic underlying feelings of
alienation, depression, anger and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Although more criminals are in prison than ever before and crime
declined sharply over the past decade, many people still cloister
their children, covet walled homes in gated communities or even
keep weapons because of this affliction, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assault on your feelings of safety and security is
attacking us from all directions,'' wrote the three Ph.D's, Corinne
Wilburne Barker, Marshall Bloom and Bruce Shapiro. ``Whether real
or imagined, most of us feel we are not safe on the streets, the
highways, in our homes, in our schools or even in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which is nearing completion after four years of
research, included a recent survey of faculty and staff members at
CSUN and a 1998 survey of employees of a large corporation. The
team also drew on other research and the members' own observations
about society and tolerance for violent or threatening behavior and
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you move in the wrong way, or I give you an aggressive
look, there's that threat of violence'' that pervades and
suppresses human interaction, Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing reports about high school and elementary school
shootings, even such simple activities as signing one's child up
for kindergarten can be filled with apprehension, Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, do we need to check out the other parents to see if they
might keep a loaded gun at home?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hesitance in meeting new people and helping new people''
because of an overwhelming fear of crime, Shapiro said, ``that
becomes a restriction on our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2,500 people responded to the statewide company survey,
which the researchers describe as a good cross-section of incomes,
education levels and urban/suburban/rural dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of those surveyed, or 58 percent, said they were
likely to be the victim of violence or a criminal act. Even more,
81 percent, said they were concerned about becoming a crime victim.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, Mike Winnik, 44, of Tarzana said he could
identify with the issues raised by the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out to live here (from New York) because of the
difference in raising kids,'' he said as he collected his two
daughters, Mariana, 6, and Julia, 3, from a fenced-in playground at
a local park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read the newspapers and I don't watch television just
for that reason: Because I don't want to learn about it. I hate
hearing about a child who just got killed today by a stray bullet
or there's a maniac on the loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Although only about 8 percent of the respondents in the
statewide survey said they ``stopped watching the news'' to ``cope
with violence and crime in our society,'' it did find that many
people had changed their lives in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent agreed with the statement, ``I try not to open my
door to strangers or solicitors.'' Thirty-nine percent said, ``I
watch my children more closely in public,'' and 32 percent
selected, ``I use my car horn with caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Barker said she recently honked her horn at an errant
motorist, ``and I thought, uh-oh, this is not a great area of town,
maybe a gun's going to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   A significant number of respondents also took more drastic
measures to help them feel safer in what they perceive, correctly
or not, to be a crime-infested world.
</P>
<P>
   A full quarter of them said they kept a weapon at home, 14
percent said they carried pepper spray and 15 percent checked off,
``I do not go out at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The three said they hope their research, which they are
incorporating into a book on the fear of crime, will lead to the
development of strategies to help people cope with the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Calling attention to the side effects of a fear of crime - often
an irrational fear - is a worthwhile pursuit in the eyes of Barry
Glassner, a University of Southern California sociology professor
and author of ``Culture of Fear: Why Americans are Afraid of the
Wrong Things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time that we recognized that the fear of crime is
dangerous in and of itself,'' Glassner said. ``It results in
parents raising frightened children. It results in people voting
their fears, rather than their ambitions or self-interests in an
election.''

COWBOYS ISSUE CALL TO ARM TO RANDALL CUNNINGHAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Head coach Dave Campo said ``this'' is precisely
why the Cowboys signed two-time MVP quarterback Randall Cunningham
in the off-season to back up Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, 37, however, didn't have ``this'' in mind when he
chose the Cowboys over a number of free-agent suitors.
</P>
<P>
   He could have stayed in Minnesota or gone to Detroit if he
wanted the burden of carrying the hopes of a team two games into
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here Cunningham is, set to start for an injured Aikman on
Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals in what is considered a
crucial game for the Cowboys after last week's season-opening
meltdown against the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared as any backup to do whatever,'' Cunningham
said. ``But I wasn't thinking this. My friends were telling me, `We
thought maybe you could get a couple of reps every once in a while,
maybe some mop-up reps. We didn't think you get in there that
quick.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Cunningham and the Cowboys have their way, his stay in the
lineup will be brief. Although no timetable has been set for
Aikman's return from the concussion he suffered Sunday, he could be
back for next Monday's game against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   And that will be the plan no matter how well Cunningham plays in
Aikman's stead.
</P>
<P>
   Campo snapped at any queries about Cunningham's possibly winning
the Cowboys' starting job with a brilliant performance. Two years
ago, Cunningham led the Vikings to a 15-1 record and won the league
MVP award after subbing for an injured Brad Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a question,'' Campo said. ``Troy is our
quarterback. This particular week, Randall is our quarterback. We
will go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said accepting a lesser role would have been tough on
him years ago, particulary during his days in Philadelphia from
1985-95.
</P>
<P>
   He credits his new outlook to maturity and a spiritual rebirth,
which dates to 1996 when he sat out of football for a year after
retiring from the Eagles. Cunningham said he signed with Minnesota
in 1997 looking to fit in any way he could. He said the situation
with the Cowboys is the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been frustrating back in my egotistical days,''
Cunningham said. ``I'm humbled now. I know my role. I understand
it. I'm approaching it just like Minnesota when Brad was the
starter. Troy has done a lot in Dallas with three Super Bowls. I
pray for Troy to be healthy and continued greatness. The emphasis
for me is to be a role player and use my strengths to help this
team out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, the Cowboys are hoping Cunningham can recapture
some of the greatness he showed in 1998 when he passed for 3,704
yards and 34 touchdowns. Campo said visions of backup quarterback
grandeur is what prompted the Cowboys to sign Cunningham to a
three-year contract in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a plan involved when we signed Randall, now we'll
get to see what happens,'' Campo said. ``We think he can win games
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith _ pointing to Jason Garrett, Rodney
Peete, Steve Beuerlein and Bernie Kosar _ said the Cowboys have
never had a problem rallying around a backup quarterback. He said
Cunningham's illustrious resume and the vivid memories of the
``whippings'' he put on the Cowboys during his stops in
Philadelphia and Minnesota simply give the Cowboys more reasons to
believe they can get back on track against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently overlooked in the Cunningham equation was his
disappointing 1999 campaign, when he led the Vikings to a 2-4 start
and was benched. Campo discounts any suggestions that the 15-year
veteran has diminished skills. In fact, Campo says the Cowboys plan
to tweak the offense to take advantage of Cunningham's mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not any different physically than he was two years ago,''
Campo said. ``And talent-wise he is very good at this point. You
have to be aware of his ability to scramble. He can run with ball.
He can throw the ball. You could see anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham promises a better performance against the Cardinals
than he showed against the Eagles on Sunday when he was plagued by
communication failure and rust.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first real game action since October. Cunningham
didn't get off the bench in the final 10 games of last season, and
he played sparingly in the 2000 preseason because of bursitis in
his throwing shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been cramming a lot,'' Cunningham said. ``I know the
plays, the protections, the blitz protections. Playing \RSunday\S
helped me get back in the flow after not playing as much as I
wanted last year. I'm anxious to play and do well.''
</P>
<P>
   And then go back to the bench. nn

EMMITT SMITH EXPECTED TO PLAY SUNDAY DESPITE BRUISED RIGHT HAND
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Emmitt Smith gave the already gun-shy Cowboys a
scare Thursday when he was forced to leave practice with a bruised
right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the X-rays on the running back's hand were negative.
Smith, 31, is expected to play Sunday night at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging,'' said owner Jerry Jones, who has had
to deliver injury statements every day but one this week on three
of his top players: Joey Galloway (season-ending knee surgery),
Troy Aikman (concussion/out this week) and now Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through Thursday's practice, Smith took a helmet to the
hand during a nontackling, short-yardage drill. He returned 45
minutes later with his hand iced and covered by a beehive-size
wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Smith broke the same hand last season Oct. 8 against Minnesota.
Surgery the next day, using a plate and screws, repaired the
fracture, located just behind the big knuckle of the ring finger.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers are eager to compare the October 1999 X-rays with
Thursday's X-rays ``just to be real cautious,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's return from his broken hand in 1999 _ he sat out one
game _ coincidentally enough, came at Arizona in a 13-9 loss, with
Jason Garrett subbing for the injured Aikman at quarterback. That
day, Smith rushed for 127 yards on 29 carries while wearing a
protective cast on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has carried the ball in his left hand throughout his
career. His right hand guides him.
</P>
<P>
   In light of all that has happened this week, Jones described the
feeling when Smith was at a local hospital Thursday in one word:
``Numb.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Smith returned, Jones _ tipped off to the positive
news only five minutes earlier _ ran across the practice field to
greet his running back.
\Nsubheds:Concern for the Valley That the Cowboys do not yet have
an agreement to relocate training camp to Pepsi Park in the
Sharyland Plantation development apparently is not a good sign for
the Rio Grande Valley group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the status,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said
Thursday. ``But I am concerned that for the length of time that
we've been dealing with the Valley \Rnearly two years\S and haven't
gotten something consummated ... well, that should concern
everybody as to whether we can get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that returning to Midwestern State University in
Wichita Falls for a fourth year is still a possibility.
\Nsubheds:Cardinals of habit After Sunday's loss against
Philadelphia, the Cowboys probably can expect to encounter
opponents' blitz packages throughout the season. Tight end Jackie
Harris said, however, that although the Cowboys will be ready for
the attack he doesn't expect Arizona to blitz more than usual,
which historically hasn't been much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams still have their own personality,'' said Harris, an NFL
veteran of 144 games.
</P>
<P>
   Harris added: ``This week, the Cardinals \Rdefensively\S have
something extra for them to prepare for: Randall Cunningham. He's a
guy who can move around.''
\Nsubheds:Goodrich thinking 'Skins Rookie cornerback Dwayne
Goodrich hopes to makes his NFL debut a week from Monday night at
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich returned to practice this week after nursing a strained
hamstring for a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels tight,'' the Cowboys' top draft pick said. ``But I'm
really excited to be back practicing. I woke up feeling good about
myself again.''

HOME-GROWN YOUNGSTERS ARE STARS' PLAN FOR FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock will not arrive in Vail, Colo., Saturday for the
opening of Stars training camp in a particularly pleasant frame of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   It's not his team he's irritated with; that may or may not come
later. It's ingrates like you and me.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think, Hitch said this week in so many words, we'd have
learned to put a little trust in him and general manager Bob Gainey
by now.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like me, you've probably spent the days since late
June, after the Stars were beaten by the New Jersey Devils in six
games in the Stanley Cup Finals, awaiting the team's next Ed
Belfour-Brett Hull-type move.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Stars were back in the finals, but barely. If not for
Belfour's spectacular performance in the conference championship
series, the Stars would never have gotten past Colorado. And though
they fought back, the Stars were dominated by New Jersey in the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   So what difference-maker would Gainey and Hitchcock bring in
this off-season? Would they strike big and trade for disgruntled
but flashy Ottawa star Alexei Yashin? Take a chance on a big stick
like Eric Lindros? Sign malevolent but talented free-agent forward
Claude Lemieux?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did they go out and bring in a veteran defenseman to anchor
their third defensive pair, as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, the Stars instead added free-agent center Shaun Van
Allen and forward Ted Donato, solid players but not the kind that
grab splashy headlines.
</P>
<P>
   That's caused at least some minor grumbling among the media and
fans, who had hoped for a little more flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of \Rticked\S off about that,'' the almost always
affable Hitchcock admitted. ``Anybody who knows our organization
knows what we're about and that we've had a strong belief in
development from within. We've nurtured players along here at a
very deliberate time frame, players like \RBrad\S Lukowich,
\RRichard\S Jackman, \RMarty\S Turco, guys who have been players in
our organization for three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have this opportunity to put them into our lineup and
bring them along. We want to make the transition from old team to
younger team without missing a beat. Last year was Year 1, this is
Year 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Not missing a beat is fine. Missing the boat is what some of us
worrywarts are concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   The inexorable closing of the ``window of opportunity'' we've
talked about so often in relation to the Cowboys can be applied to
the Stars now as well.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans such as Craig Ludwig, Brian Skrudland and Guy
Carbonneau, key players in the Stars' Stanley Cup march two years
ago, are already gone. Belfour will turn 36 in April and Hull is
already there. Joe Nieuwendyk turns 34 Sunday and Mike Keane joins
him in May. Even forever-kid Mike Modano hit the dreaded 3-0 mark
in June.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't Gainey and Hitchcock be trying to squeeze one more Cup
out of this group while they're all still viable players?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our core is set up long-term,'' Hitchcock countered. ``We want
to be a franchise that wins long-term. That's our goal. we don't
want to win just one Stanley Cup. We want to be good every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We slid four young players in last year and we want to slide
three or four in this year. We'll be a younger team with bigger
potential. I think that's smart management.''
</P>
<P>
   To some of us, it smacks of what the Rangers tried to do this
summer with disastrous results. Then again, there should be no
surprise that the management philosophy of the two organizations
might be similar, because both are owned by Tom Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   What the Stars are hoping to avoid is the same trapdoor that the
Detroit Red Wings have fallen through. Remember them? Two years ago
they were the team everybody wanted to emulate. Now they're just
old and basically forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, remember, won the Cup in June with a plethora of
young, basically unknown but very talented players, like Donato,
for example, who the Stars hope can join Nieuwendyk and
Langenbrunner on the second line. Van Allen will attempt to fill
Carbonneau's big skates on the checking line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have players _ \RGrant\S Marshall, Langenbrunner,
\RRichard\S Matvichuk, \RDarryl\S Sydor, _ who are really eager for
a bigger bite of our team,'' Hitchcock said. ``If we just keep
bringing in stop-gap people, we don't allow ourselves to develop
chemistry from within. We don't want to make that mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season when we had to play players who were younger, like
Jon Sim, he responded, so it's his turn to grab a full share here
and see how he does. People like \RRoman\S Lyashenko and
\RBrenden\S Morrow aren't going to get worse, they're going to get
better. They're good players and we need to give them that
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you continue to shut out younger players, you crash and
burn in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens this week in Vail is more about ice time than it is
playing spots. Hitchcock has a pretty good idea ``who's'' going to
play. It's how much that has yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is set and the starring roles are filled by familiar
faces. Modano, Hatcher, Zubov, Hull, Lehtinen, Nieuwendyk,
Matvichuk, Sydor, Belfour. You know them well.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who had hoped for another major addition to the cast
will just have to trust that Gainey and Hitchcock know what they're
doing.
</P>
<P>
   You have to admit, their track record looks pretty good.

SURGING SURPLUS CREATES NEW POLITICAL CALCULUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Sweeping economic proposals from Democrat Al Gore
and Republican George W. Bush _ including two in the past week _
boil down to one thing: what to do with the gigantic federal budget
surplus, projected at $4.6 trillion over the next decade.
<P>
   Both candidates have big plans for that surplus, and they would
take the country on two very different paths. Both plans carry
significant risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big, big issue is how we're going to use the surplus,''
said David D. Hale, chief economic strategist for Zurich Financial
Services in Chicago. ``That's the great defining issue in American
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, Bush would use the bulk of the surplus for an
across-the-board tax cut, combined with smaller spending increases.
Gore would use the bulk of the surplus for spending increases,
combined with smaller, targeted tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In opposite ways _ Gore with increased spending, Bush with tax
cuts _ both would stimulate an economy that many economists believe
is already running at full capacity.
</P>
<P>
   With the record expansion now in ``uncharted waters,'' said Alan
Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley,
``it's hard to know what we should do at this point, but one could
easily see a large expansionary fiscal policy as pushing us into
the danger zone where the Fed would start raising interest rates
again.''
</P>
<P>
   But because the vast projected surpluses have unleashed
political appetites on both sides, many economists believe that
it's inevitable the surplus will be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs associated with the Bush and Gore plans underscore
the likelihood that the days of rapidly growing surpluses are
probably soon over,'' said a recent report by the investment bank
Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   As for choosing between the Bush and Gore plans, Hale said that
``depends on your politics. If you are concerned about stimulating
growth, you favor tax cuts. If you want to redistribute income, you
favor public spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Hale agreed that both risk ``a collision with
monetary policy'' by the Federal Reserve, which wants to contain
economic growth at a level that keeps inflation low.
</P>
<P>
   Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly advised that the
surplus be used to pay down the national debt, rather than to cut
taxes or spend more. He has said that using the surplus ``to build
up irrevocable spending programs ... is the worst of all
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show voters agree with Greenspan on debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, both Gore and Bush are calling for a degree of
fiscal prudence that once was unimaginable. Both candidates vow to
stash the $2.4 trillion of the surplus that is generated by Social
Security in a ``lock box,'' where it would help pay down the $5.7
trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the two candidates part company. Gore claims his
plan would leave a $300 billion cushion and eliminate the national
debt by 2012, while Bush's would leave $2.8 trillion of debt. Bush
sharply disputes that, claiming that his plan would pay off the
debt by 2016 and that Gore's would overspend the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight over arithmetic _ which both sides can easily
manipulate _ is far less important than the two strikingly
different paths that Bush and Gore recommend for the $2.2 trillion
surplus left after Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offers a classic economic populism.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference in this election,'' Gore tells crowds.
``They're for the powerful, we're for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore blasts drug companies, HMOs, insurance companies and ``Big
Oil,'' promising to side with ``working families'' against
``powerful interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He promises higher Social Security benefits for women and a
prescription drug benefit in Medicare. Gore would provide universal
health care and preschool for children. He would spend more on
teachers, police, environmental protection, medical research and
dozens of other programs outlined in his 191-page economic plan,
which was issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also offers limited tax cuts targeted at certain groups _
for college tuition, child care, care for elderly parents,
fuel-efficient vehicles, after-school programs and many other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Gore's tax plan _ which the campaign estimates at $480
billion _ would go to giving matching government tax credits, up to
$1,500, to lower and middle-income workers who save money in a
special retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers who fail to meet any of these selected criteria would
not see a tax cut, opening Gore to the charge from the Bush
campaign that his plan would exclude half of all taxpayers and
require the rest to hire an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has also begun to clothe his populism in the softer
fabric of ``fiscal responsibility,'' promising to ``underspend the
surplus'' _ a direct response to polls showing voters prefer debt
reduction, and an effort to counter Bush's charge that he is a big
spender.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offers a classic economic conservatism, draped in the
softer cloth of social compassion.
</P>
<P>
   The basic thrust of the Republican plan is an across-the-board
cut in income tax rates, estimated at $1.3 trillion over ten years,
that Bush says would return the surplus to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say that the growing the federal surplus means Washington
has more money to spend,'' Bush said in his convention speech.
``But they've got it backwards. The surplus is not the government's
money. The surplus is the people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush contends that his tax cut would cut tax rates more for
lower-income workers: 100 percent for people earning less than
$20,000 and 10 percent for people making more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But because people in the top tax brackets pay the great bulk of
income taxes, a rate cut is inevitably skewed toward higher-income
groups, who would see far more tax relief in dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign emphasizes that a single mother with one child
earning $22,000 would receive a 100 percent tax cut totaling $1,000
and that an average family would see a $1,600 tax cut each year.
</P>
<P>
   But the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice says that most of
Bush's tax cut would go to households earning $92,500 or more, with
an average tax cut of $6,410.
</P>
<P>
   This opens Bush to Gore's charge that his plan is ``a massive
tax giveaway that primarily benefits the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush defends cutting the top tax rate as a way to ``encourage
entrepreneurship and growth'' _ the same argument he uses in
favoring the repeal of the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Appeal to the `Investor Class'
</P>
<P>
   Bush also aims to appeal to the new ``investor class'' _ the
half of U.S. households that now own stocks _ by offering to allow
younger workers to invest a portion of their Social Security
payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also issued a large Medicare proposal this week, where he
would add a prescription drug, remodel the program to provide
choice in health plans and increase costs by an estimated $198
billion.
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates have tapped economic luminaries for
backing _ Gore snagging former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and
Bush six Nobel-winning economists, including Milton Friedman _
independent analysts voice skepticism. Goldman Sachs economists
warned that Bush's tax cut ``could pose a threat to the health of
the business expansion, exacerbating pressures on an already tight
labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   And they warned that Gore's plan could prove much costlier than
he says. As an example, they say Gore has provided no basis for his
claim that his retirement savings plan would cost $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the ongoing cost could be considerably higher,''
Goldman Sachs said _ as much as $1 trillion, enough by itself to
wipe out nearly half the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Roach, chief economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
said both candidates would make the surplus vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If either of these plans comes to pass, the political economy
of the 1990s, which helped drive the country's longest period of
prosperity, could be turned inside out,'' Roach wrote. ``The era of
fiscal restraint would be over. The days of fiscal expansion would
be back.''

CHRIS SIMMS WANTS TO REGULAR GUY AS HE AIMS FOR PERFECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A television set in the corner of the room spits
out an endless stream of sports highlights, capturing the undivided
attention of Texas quarterback Chris Simms.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a familiar face fills the screen. Before the smiling
blond in the burnt orange jersey utters a sound, Simms changes
channels. It is an exercise Simms began long before most of his
interviews involved questions about whether he or Major Applewhite
should start Saturday for the sixth-ranked Longhorns in their
season opener against Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore counts ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' among life's basic
pleasures. But he plans to go a lifetime without seeing his own
``SportsCenter'' moment. Simms hates watching himself in action, as
a pinpoint passer or a public speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real critical of myself,'' Simms said. ``I never feel like
I do anything good enough to make myself happy.''
</P>
<P>
   That underlying insecurity explains why the 6-foot-5, 222-pound
son of a former NFL quarterback has experienced recurring
nightmares about underthrowing open receivers throughout fall camp.
It justifies Simms' compelling need to finish first in wind sprints
during Longhorns practices. It offers insight into why Simms has
summoned cornerback Roderick Babers, his close friend and
suitemate, for midnight games of catch in the courtyard outside
their dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   As much as he relishes being the son of Phil Simms, former Super
Bowl most valuable player, Chris acknowledges that his desire to
make his own name on his own terms has shaped his perfectionist
personality and fueled a relentless drive that few outsiders
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' Simms said. ``I've gone through that a lot in my
life. I don't know if people really thought I was a very good
athlete until high school. If they did, it was only because my dad
was who he was. I always took that very personally. I enjoy proving
people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to Simms' cocoon mindset, one he said has served him
well in his ongoing battle with Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The less praise I hear, the better I like it,'' Simms said.
``As long as they say something good about someone else, I'll go
out the next day and work hard so I can beat him, whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Babers, like Simms, said the biggest misconception about the
quarterback dubbed ``Golden Boy'' is that he was born to play
football because his father, Phil, won two Super Bowls in 15
seasons with the New York Giants. Nick Gallo, a former high school
teammate who plays for Rutgers, said Simms has the ``strongest work
ethic'' of any player he has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much natural ability he really has,'' Babers
said. ``He's the guy in front, all the time, when we work out. He
goes running on his own. You wouldn't think Chris Simms would want
to do that. But he's willing to pay the price to be the best.
That's why we look up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most fellow members of Texas' 1999 signing class, Babers
admitted he had concerns after watching Simms unload his personal
belongings from a white limousine (provided by an Austin hotel,
over Simms' objections) during his first day on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, `Here's a guy from a family that's pretty well
off. He's going to come down here and be a stuck-up kid. He's going
to think he's all-world,' '' Babers said. ``But he completely threw
me for a loop when I met him. He's down-to-earth. He believes in
hard work. His family taught him a lot of great, real-world values.
It's unusual to see someone from his background with those
values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unusual'' could serve as a blanket description of the
left-hander from Franklin Lakes, N.J., who has taken a majority of
the snaps with Texas' first-team offense during fall drills and is
expected to become a focal point of the Longhorns' attack as the
season progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Simms was tough enough, as a high school freshman, to chew out
team trainers when he thought they asked too many questions while
checking for a possible concussion. He was sensitive enough, three
years later, to write a poem to his high school sweetheart for a
class assignment even though he knew it meant taking heat from his
buddies. Danielle Puleo, Simms' girlfriend for the past four years
and a student at the New York School of Interior Design, still has
the poem.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to music, movies and clothes, Simms' taste runs
toward yesteryear. His favorite band is Led Zeppelin, a group that
reached its zenith of popularity before Christopher David Simms,
20, was born on Aug. 29, 1980. Simms' favorite film is ``The
Godfather,'' an epic from the 1970s. His wardrobe includes
bell-bottoms and necklaces that would have been trendy at a Vietnam
War protest rally.
</P>
<P>
   Witty and chatty, Simms is quick to converse and joke with
strangers. At the dining hall, he loads up on candy and ice cream.
Regardless of the endeavor, Simms is more likely to set his own
agenda than follow the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   That happened during recruiting when both parents urged him to
attend Tennessee because of an imminent job opening at quarterback.
Instead, Simms went with his instincts and signed with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guys admire him for that,'' defensive end Cory
Redding said. ``I'll be glad to tell my kids someday that I played
with Chris Simms. He's a special guy. Everything around him that
you think would affect him in a negative way, Chris handles it in
the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the ongoing debate about whether Simms, the
nation's top-ranked quarterback signee in 1999, or Applewhite,
holder of 37 school records, should be the Longhorns' starter. For
Simms, the situation brings back vivid and painful memories of a
protracted quarterback battle in 1991 that led to Jeff Hostetler
supplanting his father as the Giants' starter after New York won
Super Bowl XXV.
</P>
<P>
   As the controversy raged, an 11-year-old Chris Simms stared up
at a tackler in a youth-league football game who unleashed a series
of obscene comments about the Giants and his father before
shouting, ``Hostetler rules!'' Simms recalled crying the day his
father announced he'd been benched.
</P>
<P>
   Simms has shared those sentiments with Applewhite. Although he
favors a one-quarterback system because it makes for ``less turmoil
within the team,'' Simms said he's willing to abide by coach Mack
Brown's decision to leave the situation open-ended, at least for
the time being. And he will harbor no ill feelings toward
Applewhite, no matter the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't want to be at home in 20 years thinking,
`Oh, I hated college because of Major Applewhite,' '' Simms said.
``That would be stupid. We get along. I think we're both mature
enough to realize that it's all on the field. And outside of that,
we have fun and joke around.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as long as the jokes don't hit ``too'' close to home. Simms
laughed this week when told that Applewhite expressed gratitude
that Simms had hidden his knee brace only ``a couple of times''
during fall drills. Applewhite's humor fell flatter last November,
shortly after Simms made his lone career start in a 20-16 loss to
Texas A&AMP;M. Stricken with food poisoning, Applewhite sat out the
first three quarters and was unable to rally the Longhorns after
replacing Simms in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days after the A&AMP;M game, he joked, `OK, don't poison my
food this week,' '' Simms said. ``He made me mad. Actually, I was
like, `Don't ever say that again.' I really turned on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Simms is positioned to be the quarterback Texas coaches
turn to for the majority of playing time in a season filled with
national championship hopes. To meet those expectations, he must
produce some ``SportsCenter'' highlights.
</P>
<P>
   If Simms has his way, he will wear out his remote control
changing channels to avoid seeing them.

CAN TWO DEEP BE TOO DEEP AT QUARTERBACK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas Longhorns are ranked in the top 10 and one of a
handful of teams considered as legitimate national championship
contenders. But around college football, there is one question
above all when it comes to coach Mack Brown's team:
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's the quarterback?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown will answer that question _ at least for the season opener
against Louisiana-Lafayette _ Saturday when he selects either Major
Applewhite or Chris Simms to take the first offensive snap. But the
Applewhite-Simms debate figures to be a seasonlong sideshow. Brown
has been down this road before. He rotated two quarterbacks on a
1997 North Carolina team that went 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   And the Longhorns are not alone in their two-quarterback
quandary. (It's not a controversy _ yet.)
</P>
<P>
   More and more coaches, it seems, are struggling choosing between
two quarterbacks of equal ability and talent. All coaches must make
their decision based on their team's needs, but some coaches
believe the quarterback is the team leader and should never share
the role.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama coach Mike DuBose is not one of those coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good part of having two quarterbacks is you've got depth
in case of injury or off days,'' DuBose said. ``The negative aspect
is that it allows people outside the program to second-guess and
wonder if you're making the right choice or decision.''
</P>
<P>
   DuBose, who alternated Andrew Zow and Tyler Watts in the final
two games last season, decided against sticking with a gimmick that
produced 68 points against Florida and Michigan. Before the Crimson
Tide's opener against UCLA on Saturday, DuBose said Zow, a junior,
would start while Watts, a sophomore, would play.
</P>
<P>
   Zow completed eight of 23 passes for 92 yards and Watts was
3-of-7 for 27 yards. Alabama's 35-24 upset loss was more a result
of sloppy tackling than poor quarterback play. However, DuBose's
handling of his quarterbacks will add to the heat provided by an
unexpected loss. 'Bama fans, who live to analyze and critique their
team, no doubt will find a way to ignite a quarterback controversy
with the fuel of the UCLA loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do what's best for this football team, and
nothing else,'' DuBose said.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches, like Arkansas' Houston Nutt, always choose a No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big guy on alternating quarterbacks,'' Nutt said.
``I want one guy stepping in the huddle with 10 sets of eyes
looking at him. And all those eyes hear one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Steve Spurrier, whose team upset Florida State in
1997 by alternating quarterbacks each snap, doesn't see playing two
quarterbacks as a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get in a situation where two quarterbacks are about
equal, then you should play both of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, though, won the national championship in 1996 with
Danny Wuerffel, the clear-cut, no-debate starter, at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Utah coach Ron McBride is splitting time between seniors Darnell
Arceneaux and T.D. Croshaw, even though McBride said it goes
against his training. He has never used a two-quarterback system in
10 seasons as the Utes' coach. One of his quarterbacks is resigned
to sharing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand \Rthe two-quarterback system\S, but I'm not a fan
of it,'' Croshaw said. ``I do think we can hurt teams because of
our different styles. And if one of us happens to be struggling,
the other can come in and pick up the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The last team to win a national championship playing two
quarterbacks was Nebraska in 1970 (Jerry Tagge and Van Brownson).
Last year, Arizona played two quarterbacks (Keith Smith and Ortege
Jenkins) but finished 6-6 after being ranked No. 4 in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Auburn was ranked No. 1 and couldn't decide between
three quarterbacks. All three played at Tennessee _ and the Tigers
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State, using Stanley Jackson as a starter and Joe Germaine
as a backup, won 10 of its first 11 games in 1997. In the
regular-season finale against Michigan, Buckeyes coach John Cooper
switched. He started Germaine, who struggled and brought in
Jackson, who failed in relief. Final score: Wolverines 20, Buckeyes
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to worry about the intangibles, the chemistry, the
leadership, the morale of the football team,'' Cooper said. ``A
coach has to do what's best for the football team and not worry
about what anybody else thinks. The biggest downside is if you play
two and you lose. The whole secret to making it work is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   There it is. Simple.
</P>
<P>
   For Texas _ or any other team _ that attempts to utilize two
quarterbacks, contentment of the players and the fans comes with
winning. Losses, not the coaches or the quarterbacks, create
controversy. \Ntagtop:Wendell Barnhouse, (817) 390-7760

BELFOUR SEEMS READY TO PROVE THAT HE CAN BE `BETTER' AGAIN

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Eddie Belfour rolled into town Tuesday so, of
course, Wednesday had to be spent taking care of the errands that
accumulate after a summer away.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars goalie's first stop was Cole's machine shop in Denison
to work on his skate-sharpening jig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up there, and one of his staff on the computer had on
his screen saver `Eddie's better,' '' Belfour said. ``I started
laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't thought about those words since the Reunion Arena
crowd chanted them during Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals
last May. The crowd's serenade was its answer to Colorado Avalanche
goalie Patrick Roy's assertion that he was the better goalie. They
thought the Stars' victory, led by Belfour, proved otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Stars leaving this afternoon for Vail, Colo., where
training camp commences Saturday, the better question is:
</P>
<P>
   Can Eddie be better this season?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, for one, are hoping he doesn't have to be all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to be that good,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
clarified. ``We just don't want to have to ``need'' him to be that
good for us to get points.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Stars were predictable for good portions of last
season. When Belfour was good, they were good. When Belfour wasn't,
they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars returned to the Stanley Cup Finals, which tells you a
little something about Belfour's season.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with a 2.10 goals-against average in 62
regular-season games. He proved equally stifling in the postseason,
allowing less than two goals a game. He almost single-handedly
defeated Colorado in the Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he isn't satisfied. He wants more this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm motivated to be back and definitely looking forward to
another great year,'' Belfour said. ``Any time you go that far in
the playoffs and fall short, it definitely makes you want to come
back and be stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hitchcock: ``I think he has some specific goals. He's very
determined. He really wants to have a heck of a year. He wants to
go back to the top again. Where he's at, he looks the same to me as
he did halfway through last year.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last season, Belfour had established himself as
arguably the best goalie in the NHL. His stellar play in the
playoffs sealed the distinction in most people's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, well, he simply thought he had done what he had been
doing all along.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that nobody in the media or awards-voting circles
noticed simply served as motivation for him. He liked the fact that
few gave him a lot of credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, any time for me someone said I couldn't do
something or put me down, I love to try to prove them wrong,''
Belfour said. ``I know what I can do inside. I know what I am
capable of doing. This team gives me the opportunity to show what I
can do.''

 DON'T FLINCH, TAKE IT FOR THE TEAM  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This baseball thing is getting exciting, with
the Giants and A's heading for a World Series showdown, assuming
both teams manage to clear a few minor hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the time of year when writers start campaigning for
their personal MVP candidates. I'm not a sportswriter (don't be
fooled by these nachos and Tums), but I'd like to put in a good
word for my man.
</P>
<P>
   Vote for Fernando Vina for National League MVP. Even if the
trophy has to be presented posthumously.

COMERICA GIVES ANGELS BIG ASSIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Tim Belcher found the perfect place to pitch for a
38-year-old returning from an elbow injury _ Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher might start referring to the Detroit Tigers' new
ballpark as ``Comerica the Beautiful'' after the expansive outfield
helped him pitch the Anaheim Angels to a 6-4 victory Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Several well-hit fly balls stayed in the park and allowed
Belcher to stick around for six innings in his first start since
July 2. And he wasn't about to apologize for his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good and when I didn't feel good, I was glad to be
pitching in Comerica Park,'' Belcher (3-2) said. ``I got away with
a couple mistakes. When you're pitching in a park like that, your
main objective is to throw strikes and exercise damage control.
That's what I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my feet to the fire the first couple of innings and made
it work. . . . Kudos to the architect of Comerica.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 420 feet to straight-away center field. The power alley in
left is 398, but the deepest part of the ballpark is at the
flagpole just slightly left of center field _ it's 435 feet from
home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia, though, said Belcher deserves some
of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't make that many mistakes,'' Scioscia said. ``There
were a couple balls hit hard to left field. But he made good
pitches in key situations and went six strong innings for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of start we saw when he came back the first
time and pitched two good ballgames. If he can maintain that, he's
going to give us a boost down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   While Comerica might have kept the Tigers in the park against
Belcher, it didn't keep the Angels' big hitters in. Troy Glaus (No.
41), Tim Salmon (No. 33) and Scott Spiezio (No. 15) each homered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Troy Glaus, Tim Salmon and Scott Spiezio get ahold of
`em, they're going to go out anywhere,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus and Spiezio hit their homers off Tigers starter Dave
Mlicki (4-11), who like Belcher was returning from an extended
absence. Mlicki hadn't pitched since July 22 because of a chronic
sinus infection that required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the Angels' second in a row, the first time they've
won two straight since beating the New York Yankees back-to-back
nights on Aug. 11 and 12. Because Seattle also won, the Angels
remained six games out in the American League West. With Cleveland
losing, the Angels moved to 6 games of the wild-card lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina tied a career high with four hits, including a
double and a triple. But probably Molina's biggest hit of the game
was a two-out, opposite-field single to right that drove in two and
gave the Angels a 5-1 lead in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try to hit the pitch somewhere,'' Molina said when
asked if he was trying to go the other way. ``I try to hit `em hard
and hope they fall for a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers narrowed their deficit to 5-4 on Wendell Magee's solo
homer in the seventh off Angels reliever Mark Petkovsek, but Salmon
made it 6-4 in the top of the eighth with his homer.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia went to Shigetoshi Hasegawa in the eighth and kept him
in to pitch the ninth for his ninth save. Troy Percival, who made
14 pitches to get his 26th save Wednesday, was available if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be careful with how we use Percy down the
stretch,'' Scioscia said. ``He's coming off the situation with his
elbow (inflamed nerve) and we want to keep his command where he
needs it to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   After struggling in the previous series against the White Sox,
Hasegawa returned to form, giving up only one single while striking
out three in his two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was just mechanics,'' Hasegawa said of his recent
struggles. ``Maybe I was thinking too much about being a closer (in
place of the injured Percival). Now I'm just thinking about my
mechanics and making my pitches. That's it.''

RECOVERY INCOMPLETE, BUT MARTIN GAINS SEMIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first two sets of their quarterfinal match of
the U.S. Open Thursday night, Todd Martin forgot his legs were
attached to cinderblocks, his broken-down body hastily repaired by
intravenous fluids and massages for the last 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 30, was no longer the folk hero inspired by his own
resuscitation just two nights before in an epic five-set comeback
victory over Carlos Moya.
</P>
<P>
   He was just the long-faced, gray-haired man from the Midwest
Thursday night, not flashy, but triumphant when it counted,
offering but few fist-pumps reminiscent of his battle cries in
Wednesday's magical morning hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin wanted a quick sequel in his quarterfinal against
unseeded Thomas Johansson, and for 1 hour 16 minutes he had it,
racing to a two-set lead. Then his legs slowed, and Johansson, who
had obviously cribbed a page in his opponent's two-sets-down
comeback chapter, rocked aces that shook Martin and threatened to
send the match into murky five-set territory.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Martin knew what he had to do. ``I understood that I
didn't need to play great tonight,'' he said. ``I just needed to
play the points at the right time better than Thomas did.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth set, Martin threw off his first-game service
break, and he recovered from a 4-2 deficit to win the final set by
cracking a crosscourt forehand winner, returning to his second
straight U.S. Open semifinal with a 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the semis of the Open was the greatest thing since
sliced bread,'' said Martin, who lost to Andre Agassi in the finals
last year. ``Cutters are still sharp. This is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   He will face 20-year-old Marat Safin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Safin, seeded sixth, defeated 14th-seeded Nicolas Kiefer, 7-5,
4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-3. Safin played both brilliant and head-scratching
tennis on the sun-bleached Arthur Ashe Stadium Court on Day 11 of
the U.S. Open to advance to his first semifinals of a Grand Slam
event.
</P>
<P>
   While Safin arrives on the adrenaline of youth, Martin advances
one more round with the veteran experience and the crowd behind
him. ``You do need to draw on energy that is there,'' he said.
``And then from there, their energy inspires more energy from
you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin was not the only medical miracle out on the court
Thursday night. Last year, one week before the U.S. Open, doctors
diagnosed a viral infection around the lining of Johansson's heart.
Johansson, 25, who is from Sweden, had a rocky year, losing in the
first round at 10 of 15 tournaments before the Open. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He looked lost early. A break in the fifth game was all Martin
needed to win the first set. In the second set, again in the fifth
game, Martin earned the only break he needed. When he ripped a
crosscourt winner with an unforgiving angle, Martin pumped his fist
triumphantly. He had few of those moments Thursday night. ``It's
not supposed to happen every day of the year,'' he said of his
unusual show of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   But it would emerge more later. In the third set, Johansson got
his break in the fourth game, and he won the set on his 15th ace,
committing just three unforced errors. ``He was too good; he really
picked his serve up,'' Martin said. ``Walking back and forth to
receive his serves really took me out of my rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Martin was showing signs of fatigue and was not able to
run to every drop shot. Johansson broke him in the first game of
the fifth set, when Martin's backhand half-volley landed
halfheartedly into the net. Johansson finished a love serving game
with his 20th ace, to take a 4-2 lead. But Martin held onto his
serve and carried the momentum. He broke Johansson on a forehand
that clipped the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally made it up in my mind to make him see me a little
more, just putting that extra pressure on him changed the rhythm of
the match and also took some of his ball striking away,'' Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin capitalized on the ugly points, and suddenly, they were
back on serve, and Johansson was serving to reach a tiebreaker when
Martin spoke to himself. ``I said some things to myself before the
points. `Do this, so even if you don't get through this game, he
knows what you're doing and you plant the seed for the
tiebreaker.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not need to do that. Martin had two match points when
he blasted a forehand cross court and Johansson's backhand return
fell into the net.
</P>
<P>
   A tired Martin, wearing heating pads on both of his knees and in
a subdued mood, was in contrast to the more playful Safin.
</P>
<P>
   A booming 6-foot-4-inch Russian baseliner with a bronze tan,
Safin boasted about not smashing his racquet for five straight
matches now, since way back in the first round of the U.S. Open,
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot about this already. I'm a new man,'' Safin said
Thursday, his devilish grin suggesting otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   If he can figure out who he is _ a 20-year-old boy with a
hiccuped attention span of a bored A-student, or one of the top
men's players _ his career could take another sharp turn. On
Thursday, his personalities swiveled back and forth, along with his
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still young, and if he believes in himself, he can be No.
1, if he becomes more concentrated on the court,'' his new coach,
the most current of four this year, Alexander Volkov said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this swing Thursday: Kiefer held a 5-2 lead and was
serving for the set at 5-3. But Safin broke him and won four
straight games to take a 1-0 lead in the match. ``I knew I was very
close to losing this set, so I was a hundred percent
concentrated,'' Safin said.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage plummeted in the next set, as Safin responded in
reverse to momentum. Kiefer took advantage. ``When he loses his
serve, he gets better,'' Volkov explained.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer saved three match points in the final set, but Safin
finished off the match on his serve, blasting a second serve 131
mph for a service winner. Safin had 16 aces, 47 winners and 42
unforced errors. Afterwards, Kiefer said that Safin has the tools
to win this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his confidence is getting much bigger and bigger,''
Kiefer said. ``I expected a hard fight against him because I saw
him playing many matches now. I knew that he goes for every shot.
He has a great serve.''

ELVERA DAVIS, TAP DANCER   AND MOTHER OF SAMMY DAVIS JR., DIES AT
95  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Calif.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elvera Sanchez Davis, a tap dancer and the mother of
Sammy Davis Jr., died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was
95.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Baby Sanchez, Davis began performing at 16 in the
chorus line at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem and continued her
career into the early 1940s, dancing for six years in the chorus
line at the Apollo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, performing in a touring show called ``Holiday in
Dixie,'' Davis met and married Sammy Davis Sr., also a dancer in
the show. Their son, born in 1925, often traveled with his touring
parents as a child. ``I don't mind him watching from the wings, but
I don't want him stealing all my steps,'' John Bubbles said of
Sammy, then 2, to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The boy became a tap-dance prodigy by the age of 10, trained and
brought up by his father after his parents separated. But he was
``Baby Sanchez's son,'' said the dance historian Delilah Jackson,
when he first appeared at the Apollo Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Davis decided to retire when the Apollo disbanded its dance
chorus, though she danced informally into her 90s. She also
performed in touring revues and in films including Carl Micheaux's
1936 ``Swing.''
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the stage, she worked as a waitress and
became something of a house celebrity at Gracie's Little Belmonte,
a popular bar on Kentucky Avenue, a street of glittering black
clubs in Atlantic City. Telling jokes and carrying a special gold
napkin, Davis was often visited at her station by star performers
like Count Basie when they finished their acts.
</P>
<P>
   Davis continued to be involved with New York tap dance until her
death, serving from 1989 as an adviser to the New York Committee to
Celebrate National Tap Dance Day.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Ramona, of Manhattan.

USC SUSPENDS COUSINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC defensive end John Cousins has been suspended
indefinitely for a violation of team rules. He has not practiced
this week and will not suit up for Saturday's game against
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer from West Los Angeles College enrolled at USC last
spring. He was switched from linebacker to defensive end during
training camp. Cousins has played football despite being deaf in
one ear and impaired in the other. He did not play in USC's
season-opener against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Grootegoed to redshirt: Although it's not official, strong
safety Matt Grootegoed is almost certain to redshirt after tests
revealed he has mononucleosis. USC coach Paul Hackett was
optimistic Grootegoed could return to practice within three to four
weeks, but that would probably be too late to salvage the true
freshman's season, since he would need to get in shape again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the card we've been dealt and will have to deal with,''
Hackett said. ``I don't know how long it will take, but we will let
it go very slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Grootegoed has been playing on special teams and been the No. 3
strong safety behind sophomore Troy Polamalu and junior DeShaun
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   __ Wide right: USC practiced in the Coliseum on Thursday and it
was a rough workout for kicker David Newbury. He missed all three
attempts at the end of practice, with one ball glancing off the
pole that supports the net behind the goal post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just really a confidence builder today,'' Hackett joked, then
added, ``We'll hope it doesn't come down to a field goal, but if it
does, he'll be the guy. That's why we came over here today, so we
could see what it was like.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Hackett was pleased that the team tested the Coliseum
out for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to get in our home. The turf looks great,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ MacKenzie limited: With an ankle injury now added to his
hamstring problem, tailback Malaefou MacKenzie's status for the
game is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ginger and very limited,'' Hackett said. ``I don't know
if I'll play him or not. I'm very concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Redshirt questions: While Grootegoed will now redshirt, there
is some debate whether several other freshmen will sit out the
season. Defensive tackle Kenechi Udeze will probably redshirt,
barring a major injury on the defensive line. Tailback Chris
Howard, who has not fully recovered from knee surgery last spring,
is another redshirt candidate. Howard's status will probably remain
uncertain, however, since MacKenzie has been injured and Petros
Papadakis is the only other backup to Sultan McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys who are on the fence, and there's eight to 10, I'll
sit down with their families before the San Jose State game (on
Sept. 23),'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Matt Cassel of Chatsworth will not be officially
redshirted until after the season, because he is the No. 3
quarterback, and will make every road trip in case of injury to
Carson Palmer or Mike Van Raaphorst.

5 ARRESTED ON SEX CHARGES OUTSIDE MTV AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two men and three teen-age boys were arrested outside
the MTV Video Music Awards Thursday evening after rubbing up
against young women on the jammed sidewalks near Radio City Music
Hall, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   All were charged with third-degree sexual abuse, a misdemeanor,
said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman. Both the victims and the
abusers were fully clothed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first incident occurred just before 6 p.m, when Mehran
Sedaghatpour, 39, of Great Neck, N.Y. pressed his crotch against
the buttocks of a 21-year-old and a 22-year-old woman on Avenue of
the Americas across the street from Radio City, which is at 50th
Street, Nikas said. He was also charged with resisting arrest, the
sergeant said.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:25 p.m., three teen-agers who an investigator said were
related to one another were arrested for similar offenses on 51st

LEADERS OF ARYAN NATIONS FOUND NEGLIGENT IN ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 5th graf, adds 6th , 10th and 11th grafs with details)  
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Issuing a verdict that civil rights
organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest
white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a
state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan
Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two
years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's
compound near here.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of
the Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were
ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the
nine-woman, three-man jury.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, delivered late Thursday afternoon in the Kootenai
County Courthouse, prompted tearful hugs among the plaintiffs, a
mother and son who were beaten and shot at in the attack, and their
lawyers. The defendants responded defiantly outside the courthouse,
even as protesters shouted at them to stop their ``message of
hate.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law
Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that has
successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Morris S. Dees Jr., a founder of the center, hailed the jury's
finding as a powerful message against racial intolerance and one
that could force the group out of its 19-acre property. ``We intend
to take every single asset from the Aryan Nations now and
forever,'' Dees said at a news conference after the verdict was
announced. ``We intend to even take the name Aryan Nations and
hopefully, through the judicial pro- cess, close a sad chapter in
this na- tion's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Butler and the Aryan Nations were liable for
$4.8 million and Teague was lia- ble for $600,000. The guards were
liable for most of the remaining amount.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of
message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly
sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called
North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist
views.
</P>
<P>
   But Butler scoffed at the verdict, variously comparing himself
to figures in the Bible and to signers of the Declaration of
Independence who were harassed for their views. ``This is
nothing,'' he said, after the verdict. ``We have planted seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Teague: ``The message doesn't take a lot of money. We will
spread the message.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the group said an appeal was planned.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of group's assets re- mained unclear, raising
questions about whether Butler and his followers, whose numbers
have been described by the local authorities as dwindling, would
pay anything close to the full amount if the award is upheld.
Nonetheless, Dees vowed that it was the beginning of the end for
the group and that the verdict was a rebuke of the Aryan Nations
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  leaders, who were technically found to be
negligent in the training and supervision of the security guards
who carried out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now
21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the
Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12
million in compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan
Nations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of
racial hate and persuade the jury to ``return a verdict that will
be heard all over this nation,'' a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees
said in closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's lawyer, Edgar Steele, argued throughout the six-day
trial that however offensive jurors might find the views of Butler,
he should not be held responsible for the actions of a group of
drunken young men.
</P>
<P>
   Steele said the Aryan Nations property was not the incubator of
violence that Dees had portrayed it to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the
jurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly
politically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts
and all manner of people that drift in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenan and her son were attacked after stopping their car near
the entrance to the 19-acre Aryan Nations property near Hayden
Lake, about 20 miles north of here, on their way home from a
wedding. They were looking for a wallet that Keenan had
accidentally dropped from their 1977 Datsun. He had been in the Job
Corps and had thrown his Job Corps card out the window on a whim
and, inadvertently, his wallet along with it. He quickly retrieved
the wallet, but when the car started, it backfired, Keenan told the
police after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   At the compound, three guards, one of whom later told the police
that he had thought the place was about to be attacked by militant
Jews, picked up their guns, jumped in a pickup truck and chased the
car. They shot at the car, flattening a rear tire and forcing the
car into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   In tearful testimony, Keenan said one guard, Jesse Warfield, 45,
struck her with the butt of a rifle, grabbed her by the hair and
screamed at her. She and her son testified that they thought they
were going to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said that she begged the men not to kill her son and that
one of the guards then asked her if she was Indian. She testified
that while she is part Cherokee, she told the men, ``No, I'm a poor
white farm girl.'' A guard then said that because they were white,
the men would let them go.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, another security guard, John Yeager, 21, testified
that he was too drunk that night to remember whether he or the
other men had fired at the Keenans. Under questioning, Yeager read
portions of a letter from jail in which he expressed his allegiance
to Butler, saying, ``Next to Christ you are the greatest man to
ever walk the face of this earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeager and Warfield have pleaded guilty to criminal assault and
are in prison, while the third guard, Shane Wright, 23, remained a
fugitive. The two imprisoned men were brought here for the trial
and testified that they were responsible for their actions, a point
repeated by Steele.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the pleasures of an end-of-summer vacation is unessential
reading. I'm not talking about the melt-in-the-mind bonbons called
``beach books,'' but those more ambitious and alluring books that
linger on the shelf from year to year, only to be pushed aside
again and again by volumes that seem more essential to one's
workaday life.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, one of those I'll-get-around-to-it books has been
``Last Train to Memphis,'' Peter Guralnick's well-reviewed
biography of the young Elvis Presley. It has been on my shelf since
its publication in 1994, and a few weeks ago my musician son wanted
to borrow it for an upcoming road trip. Thus prodded, I bought him
a new copy and took my own long-neglected book along on a Maine
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   There was something oddly relaxing yet stimulating about
revisiting those steamy Memphis summers and long-ago Mississippi
River nights from the vantage point of an austere Northern coast.
The most sobering surprise for me, as a journalist, was that even
in the era of segregation, Southern newspaper writers exhibited a
surer grasp of what Presley was creating _ a new transracial
synthesis in American popular music _ than did the New York critics
quoted in the book. The latter concentrated on the sexual threat of
his hip movements, the hoodlum symbolism of his ducktail hairdo,
and the supposed limitations of one of the century's great vocal
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, a number of writers had already observed with a
surprising lack of prejudice that ``our homegrown hillbilly
singer'' was fusing Nashville music with vocal and instrumental
licks picked up from B.B. King, Rufus Thomas, Arthur Crudup and
other black musicians. I was also struck by the fact that from the
first day of his national fame, Presley freely acknowledged his
musical debt. ``The colored folks been singing it and playing it
just like I'm doin' now, man, for more years than I know,'' he told
The Charlotte Observer in 1956. ``I got it from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Guralnick has something to teach about the biographer's
problem in writing about those American geniuses who burst upon us
with culture-changing force, then dissipate their gifts in lives of
self-parody. One thinks, in a literary context, of how Carlos
Baker's essential biography, ``Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story,'' is
distorted by the author's animosity toward the paranoid, posturing
Hemingway of the final years. Albert Goldman's ``Elvis,'' published
in 1981, exhibited a striking authorial condescension for its
subject.
</P>
<P>
   But Guralnick, by focusing on the early years of naive
brilliance, re-creates that period described with Fitzgeraldian
grace in Variety in 1957 by Hal Kanter, a screenwriter assigned to
hang out with Presley and help launch his movie career. The Presley
story, he said, is that of ``the young man with the ancient eyes
and the child's mouth . . . ((who)) awoke from the nightmare of
poverty to find the brilliant sun of Fame suddenly burst in his
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of reading for pleasure rather than purpose is
that one encounters unexpected connections. The description of
Vernon Presley, the singer's father, as a ``taciturn, suspicious
man'' comfortable only in the family's ``private world'' rang a
couple of bells. I remembered the description of Albert Gore Sr. in
``The Prince of Tennessee,'' by David Maraniss and Ellen Nakashima,
as a man ``with that distant look in his eye.'' ``It's a mountain
thing,'' observed a family friend, who purported to see the same
Appalachian remoteness in Vice President Al Gore. What connections,
if any, I wondered, could be drawn between the hereditary political
prince and the self-invented king of rock 'n' roll, between a
sort-of Tennessee mountaineer and a deep-dyed son of the Southern
flatlands?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the younger men lived in an era when the outsider
mentality that so powerfully shaped their Southern fathers _ both
the ne'er-do-well Vernon Presley and the relentlessly striving Al
Gore Sr. _ has been subjected to powerful forces of cultural
nationalization, including, as it happens, rock music. Yet a
literary visit to '50s Memphis _ to the white musicians in the Sun
Records studios and the black blues shouters along Beale Street _
carries a message that can also be gleaned from a week's sojourn
among the persistently laconic residents of modern-day Maine.
Distinctive regional differences do endure as factors in a nation
that may be getting smarter about celebrating and preserving them.
Those differences seem interwoven somehow with the quintessentially
American mystery of true genius emerging from as unlikely a place
as East Tupelo, Miss. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Theodore L. Deglin, a longtime public relations
executive, died in Manhattan on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   He was 92 and lived on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Deglin, known as Ted, was Madison Square Garden's public
relations director from 1935 until he entered the Army in 1942. He
became a colonel and was awarded the Legion of Merit in 1945 for
his work as a public relations officer with Army forces in the
western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he became the president of a new, Manhattan-based
public relations firm, Deglin-Wood Inc., with clients including
Madison Square Garden Corp., ``21'' Brands, and Wine Producers of
California Ltd. The firm later became Ted Deglin &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Deglin was born in Philadelphia and received a bachelor's degree
in 1930 from the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Ann Reirden, whom he
married in 1961 after three early and brief marriages; twin
daughters, Dorian Scammon of Hopkinton, N.H., and Kane Peterson of
Westport, Conn.; and six grandchildren.

C. PHILIP WILSON, 79, EXPERT IN TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn.)   By ANAHAD O'CONNOR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. C. Philip Wilson, an expert in the treatment of
eating disorders and other severe psychosomatic problems, died Aug.
17 at his home in Manhattan. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart disease, said his son Scott, a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   While a resident in psychiatry at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital
in New York, Wilson developed techniques for treating
gastrointestinal problems and anorexia nervosa, which was then
rarely diagnosed. Much of his treatment for anorexia and bulimia
focused on the earliest phases of childhood development and
mother-infant interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the argument of nature versus nurture,'' Scott Wilson said,
``my father was very much a proponent of the nurture side and
emphasized that childhood developmental influences were crucial in
causing anorexia nervosa and other psychosomatic eating
disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wrote extensively for professional journals and reference
books. He was also an editor or co-editor of five books on eating
disorders. The best-known, ``The Fear of Being Fat,'' is widely
used in treating anorexia today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he received the Sigmund Freud Award of the American
Society of Psychoanalytic Physicians for distinguished service in
psychiatry and psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Philip Wilson was born in Scarsdale, N.Y., graduated
from Yale and from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of
Columbia University, and began his medical career in the Navy in
World War II. While serving on a transport ship in the Pacific, he
became interested in the body's sensitivity to emotional changes,
having noticed that many enlisted men reported gastrointestinal
problems upon leaving home port.
</P>
<P>
   As a civilian he continued to explore the effects of emotional
stress on physical health, an interest that became a mainstay of
his private practice and his work at St. Luke's Hospital in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Scott, Wilson is survived by his wife,
Christine; his son Marc; his daughter, Cynthia; two brothers, H.
Donald and Stephen; and a grandson. All live in New York.

MARTIN LANG, 85, ENGINEER AND WATER POLLUTION EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N . Y . , Minn., Conn.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Lang, an engineer and water pollution expert who was a
New York City commissioner in the Lindsay and Beame
administrations, died Monday at a hospital in Roslyn, N.Y., where
he lived. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an environmental engineer and chemist, he worked for
the city for four decades, retiring in 1977 as administrator of the
Department of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs. His
streetwise, hands-on approach gained him national respect and
bolstered the city's reputation as a leader in environmental
management during the '60s and '70s, despite technological and
fiscal constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Lang, an ebullient, craggy-faced man, set out in public service
in 1935 and worked in several departments before being put in
charge of the division of sewage disposal in 1964. The following
year he was named director of the Bureau of Water Pollution
Control, a post he held for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1970s he advanced to commissioner of the Department
of Water Resources, first deputy administrator of the city's
Environmental Protection Administration and commissioner of the
Department of Sanitation. He took the post at Parks and Recreation
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Working in water resources and sanitation, Lang initiated
studies and long-range programs to adapt water pollution controls
to solid-waste and air-pollution management. He also could be out
before dawn, trailing garbage trucks to see how he might improve
collections.
</P>
<P>
   In the Parks Department, he involved the federal Bureau of
Outdoor Recreation, which, he felt, was directing its programs and
money to nature conservancy out West, and ignoring other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing with their representatives in front of a handball
court in a so-called ghetto area in Brooklyn,'' he said, ``I
finally convinced them that it had greater personal usage than a
backpack trail in the Sierras, was equally worthy of federal
support, and was part of the total environment of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lang grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. He
entered City College in 1930 at age 15 and graduated as a chemical
engineer in 1935. He also received a master's degree in civil
engineering from New York University in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he was an officer with a sanitation unit in
the Army's engineering corps from 1943 to 1946. After leaving the
city government, he was a private management consultant for the
World Health Organization and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's survivors include his wife of 62 years, Bertha Friedman
Lang; two daughters, Judith L. Zaimont of Edina, Minn., and Doris
L. Kosloff of Simsbury, Conn.; a son, Robert D. of Great Neck,
N.Y.; and four grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My simple thesis,'' Lang told Consulting Engineer magazine in
1978, ``is that man's total environment transcends pure air, food
and water, and must also encompass employment, housing, energy,
transportation and recreation.'' &QL;

DAVID R. ALTMAN, FASHION ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Md.)   By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David R. Altman, a fashion advertising executive
whose tag lines did for bolts of fabric what tigers in tanks had
done for gasoline, died Aug. 30 in New York. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of lymphoma, said his wife, Floria
V. Lasky.
</P>
<P>
   Altman, as chairman of Altman, Stoller, Weiss, built several
obscure clothing lines and textile products into household names.
He put Wrangler jeans on the map, making millions of American
teen-agers want what until then had been a little-known brand of
denim work clothes. His ads promised that Wrangler's fabric would
fade exactly the way that teen-agers wanted it to.
</P>
<P>
   Altman elevated Monet jewelry from its budget status,
photographing inexpensive pieces on his generation's version of
supermodels.
</P>
<P>
   He also created the ``RRRRRRRRRuss Toggs'' sign that for years
hailed motorists in red neon as they used the Midtown Tunnel in
Manhattan. Associates said he got the idea after hearing a
stuttering art director struggle to say ``Russ,'' and decided to
elongate the name into a sexy purr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find your character; create your character; concentrate on
your character,'' Altman once urged the textile division of the New
York Board of Trade, chiding Seventh Avenue entrepreneurs who were
too busy pitching their products to stores to focus on their
ultimate market, the retail shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing what he preached, Altman was even able to attract
consumer attention to plain bolts of cloth, with a campaign called
``Lean on Klopman,'' which showed an unusual photograph of a woman
leaning confidently on what appeared to be thin air. The ads
convinced legions of shoppers that the fabrics of Klopman Mills,
which they had never heard of before, possessed a high degree of
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, Altman decided to diversify his firm beyond
fashion advertising, going after accounts with the Spanish tourist
board, Ezo denture adhesive, Lanson champagne and others. His firm
also handled the introduction of Newsweek's Inside Sports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Altman said in a 1979 interview with The New York Times that he
no longer wanted to concentrate on fashion advertising because, as
he put it: ``There's no visible fashion industry. It's all
merchandising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never photographed a dress in my life,'' he added. ``I
photographed an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman, who earned a law degree but did not practice law, also
developed strong ideas about the role of advertising in electoral
politics. In 1978, he published an essay on the Op-Ed page of The
New York Times in which he acknowledged that as an ad man, he was
appalled at what television advertising had done to election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it an outrage that advertising professionals would
fashion a political campaign along the same lines as a marketing
program,'' he wrote, describing the way background music, ``trick
lighting,'' and ``a full gamut of Hollywood special effects'' were
being used to sell incompetent but glib candidates to American
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A candidate is not a can of soup,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Altman served as an Army weapons instructor during World War II,
then attended New York University law school on the GI Bill. He
completed his law degree at night, working during the day as
advertising director for The Women's Reporter, a trade publication.
In that job, he was often called on to design his customers' ads.
From there, he joined Irving Serwer Advertising, a fashion house,
as an account executive.
</P>
<P>
   At Irving Serwer he worked with Max Stoller, with whom he
founded Altman &AMP; Stoller in 1950. Melvin D. Weiss joined the firm
in the mid-1970s. The firm was later sold.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Altman is survived by two daughters,
Emily Altman of New York and Dara Altman of Potomac, Md., and a
grandson.

EDITORIAL: THE ECONOMIC SCOREBOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan turned ``tax and spend'' into a near-fatal label
for traditional Democrats. One of President Clinton's big
achievements has been to rebuild his party's reputation for
budgetary restraint and fiscal discipline. Vice President Al Gore,
with his carefully crafted economic plan, has been careful to
preserve the political capital inherited from Clinton's success in
reducing the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the hefty document Gore released on Tuesday is as
much a campaign manifesto as it is an economic blueprint. Indeed,
by combining his previously proposed spending and tax-cutting ideas
in one package, he directed attention to the stark differences
between his policies and those of Gov. George W. Bush. What emerges
is an economic program that is cautious almost to a fault, yet
determinedly progressive in its general thrust. Gore has, properly,
focused spending on families most in need.
</P>
<P>
   On the tactical level, Gore was smart to provide specifics,
nearly 200 pages of them. Bush has so far refused to lay out his
plans with equal precision, and his campaign advertisement saying
that Milton Friedman and other famous economists endorse his
general approach is not, in campaign terms, a totally satisfactory
substitute for specific details.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sets down 10 goals, including cutting poverty to an
all-time low, eliminating federal debt by 2012, doubling the number
of families with substantial savings, raising home ownership from
its current 67 percent to 70 percent of the population by 2004 and
college attendance rates from 66 percent to 75 percent by 2010.
These goals are only loosely tied to the plan's specific
provisions. The important directions are set by the big-ticket
items.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 10 years, the surplus is expected to exceed $4.5
trillion. Gore proposes to use about $3 trillion to reduce federal
debt. By contrast, Bush's plan would reduce the debt by at most $1
trillion. Traditional Democratic liberals would much rather put
this money into social programs, and we share a concern for the
nation's unmet needs in health, housing and education. But debt
reduction is clearly popular with centrist voters, who see it as a
component of today's prosperity. Gore would be foolish to give away
the Democrats' hard-won advantage on the issue of fiscal
trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president would devote about $500 billion to
``targeted'' tax cuts, including a poorly designed tuition tax
credit that will do more to enrich colleges than low-income
families. But he also includes a $200 billion tax cut for
retirement savings that heavily favors low-income families. He
proposes to increase tax credits for low-paid workers and to
provide a refundable tax credit to offset child care expenses. Bush
would devote about four times as much to tax cuts, reducing
revenues by almost $2 trillion. About 40 percent of that would go
to the wealthiest 1 percent of families.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spending proposals are also designed to help low- and
moderate-income families. He wants to spend $340 billion on
prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees, with the largest
subsidies going to poor families. He proposes to spend $50 billion
on preschool programs for needy families and about $100 billion on
health coverage for uninsured children. The design of these
programs largely avoids election-year handouts to well-off voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has criticized Gore for outspending the projected surplus.
True, Gore's proposals to subsidize drugs and retirement savings
are likely to cost far more than he concedes. But the better way
for Bush to press the economic policy debate is to publish an
equally detailed plan instead of asking the public to depend on
reassurances from economists in his own ideological camp.  &QL;

<P>
   At the largest assembly ever of world leaders, they rattled
through five-minute forgettable speeches and promised fine things
they will soon forget. Then they prepared to put their names to a
declaration that commits them to make the 21st century fairer, more
humane and more peaceful than its unmourned predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   But will this week's conclave of around 160 heads of state or
government at the United Nations' ``millennium summit'' in New
York, make a bit of difference to the billions of victims of
poverty, cruelty or war?
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is determined that it should, even though the
past decade has been littered with worthy U.N. conferences
resulting in even worthier pledges that, by and large, have changed
people's lives very little.
</P>
<P>
   This time may be different, says Kofi Annan, the U.N.
secretary-general, who wrote the report that became the basis for
the declaration that the summiteers will be signing on Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for thinking so is that this bid to better
the world, to ensure that ``globalization'' becomes a beneficial
force for all _ and not, as at present, regarded by the poorest as
a term of abuse _ is an unusually collective effort; as well as the
private get-togethers in the shadow of the official summit,
business leaders, nongovernmental organizations and others are in
New York holding meetings on roughly similar agendas.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, the United Nations sees itself as catalyst and
target-setter _ and monitor of the steps that may, or may not, be
taken to turn the pledges into reality.
</P>
<P>
   A main target, set by Annan and agreed to by the summiteers, is
to halve by 2015 the 22 percent of people who live on less than a
dollar a day and to ensure primary education for all by the same
date.
</P>
<P>
   Towards this end, the declaration calls on the industrialized
world to adopt a policy of duty- and quota-free access for exports
from the least-developed countries, and to be much more generous
about debt cancellation. The special needs of Africa, the poorest
continent, receive special attention.
</P>
<P>
   If such commitments do succeed in making the rich world a little
less selfish in its dealings with the poor world, the puff and
flummery will have been worth while.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, said Annan firmly, is a working session, not a
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Just as well: the celebration of the United Nation's 50th
birthday in 1995 turned into something of a wake. But that party
took place at the organization's darkest hour, just after its
peacekeeping catastrophes in Rwanda and Bosnia, when it looked as
if the United Nations should steer clear of anything but the most
conventional post-conflict peacekeeping measures.
</P>
<P>
   That prognosis is now slowly being revised as it becomes clear,
yet again, that often it is only the United Nations that has the
universality and moral legitimacy to intervene when the world
decides that something should be done about some dreadful
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The other options _ regional intervention or coalitions of
like-minded states _ work only on rare occasions.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a cliche to say that intervention should be
``robust.'' But it would be folly to expect 160 statesmen to agree
on how and when this robustness should manifest itself: many
sovereign states think intervention as dirty a word as
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration calls for the United Nations to be given the
resources and tools it needs, but for peacekeeping in calm waters,
not in stormy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nation's own report on peacekeeping, which describes
what happens when an under-equipped and under-trained U.N. unit
meets well-armed militia forces uninterested in peace, is mentioned
as a matter for the General Assembly, not for governments.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness for U.N. commanders is when governments with the
capacity to help, choose not to do so: countries with large armies
often send in their troops but only to evacuate their own
nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, Britain's foreign secretary, suggested this week
that a U.N. military staff college should be set up, and that
Britain could be its host.
</P>
<P>
   This would be an improvement on what happens now, with every
mission starting from scratch, but it is still a long way from the
earmarked, quickly available units that the United Nations has
asked for, let alone the standing army that it dreams of.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, says Lieut.-General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian
U.N. commander who called in vain for reinforcements when the
Rwandans were butchering an unprotected minority, is that countries
interpret their national interests so narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   At a seminar in London this week, the brave general called
passionately for ``global humanism.'' Could there be a better, or
alas more remote, form of globalization? &QL;

<P>
   Suffering from a touch of deja vu?
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have more than tripled since the end of 1998;
political leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, are
appealing to OPEC countries, whose oil ministers are meeting this
weekend, to increase production; France has seen the return of long
queues at gas stations, as truckers protesting about fuel prices
block supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Such news brings back scary memories of the three previous big
oil-price shocks, in the early and late 1970s, and in 1990. On each
of those occasions, when oil prices also roughly tripled, inflation
duly rose and the world economy slipped into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, oddly, hardly anybody seems worried about such a prospect
today _ not least investors, who have been pushing share prices
towards new highs in many stock markets around the world. Oil no
longer matters, they seem to believe: the new economy runs on
information and silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   But, although there is no cause for panic about oil prices, this
view looks terribly complacent.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the complacency seems understandable. The world
economy has rarely looked in better shape. This year it is likely
to enjoy the heady combination of the fastest growth for 16 years
and the lowest inflation for 30.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, at such times it is always prudent to ask: ``what
might go wrong?'' One answer is sticky and black, and hit a
ten-year high this week of nearly $35 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   At this weekend's meeting, OPEC ministers are likely to agree to
raise production quotas, but this is unlikely to have much
short-term effect on prices.
</P>
<P>
   American oil stocks are at a 24-year low, there is a lack of
spare refining capacity, the world economy _ and hence demand for
oil _ is booming, and the northern hemisphere is heading towards
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a risk that, no matter what OPEC does, oil
prices could spike above $40 a barrel, especially if the winter
proves severe.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, oil prices are likely to fall: high prices and
new technology will reduce demand and encourage exploration. But in
the short term, oil prices may well stay high _ and that could be
enough to do serious damage to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   There are, admittedly, good reasons to expect the impact of this
oil-price ``shock'' to be less severe than its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the recent tripling of oil prices followed a
sharp drop. In real terms, prices are still one-third below their
level in 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, and half their level in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also right to believe that oil now plays a smaller
role in the economy. Thanks to energy conservation, a switch to
other fuels and a shift in the composition of output from heavy
industries to services, rich economies use only about half as much
oil for every dollar of GDP (in constant prices) as they did in the
early 1970s. A higher oil price has a correspondingly smaller
impact on inflation and output in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, in comparison with previous oil-price shocks, when
economies were already overheating, inflation is currently more
subdued. The Economist's non-oil commodity price index has barely
budged over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But even if oil is less important in the new ``weightless
economy,'' that is a far cry from saying that it does not matter at
all. If they last for long enough, higher oil prices will certainly
hurt oil-importing countries.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule of thumb, the OECD reckons that a $10 increase in the
oil price, sustained for a year, lifts inflation in rich economies
by half a percentage point after a year, and reduces growth by a
quarter point.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although rich countries may be less dependent on oil
than they were, many oil-importing emerging economies now use more
oil per dollar of GDP than in the 1970s, thanks to rapid
industrialization and rising car ownership.
</P>
<P>
   A sustained rise in oil prices could set back the recovery in
emerging Asian economies, in particular. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of higher oil prices depends in part on how
policymakers respond. There seem to be striking differences in
attitudes towards higher oil prices between America's Federal
Reserve and the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB has raised interest rates as oil prices have pushed
headline inflation above its medium-term target of 2 percent. In
contrast, the Fed has held rates unchanged for the past four
months, even as its headline inflation rate has jumped to 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Central banks have to weigh two opposing forces. On the one
hand, higher oil prices push up inflation; on the other, they act
as a tax that squeezes real incomes (and hence consumer spending),
thereby muting underlying inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The more serious the risk that higher inflation will feed into
wages and trigger a wage-price spiral, the more urgent it is that a
central bank raises interest rates. That is why the ECB was right
to raise rates last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, however, seems to fret less about headline inflation,
and focuses instead on core inflation, which excludes energy prices
and has accordingly risen by much less. The Fed believes that wages
are less responsive to headline inflation in America than in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If the jump in oil prices proves temporary and inflation comes
down next year, this may well turn out to be correct. But it is
adding to the risks it is already taking. In not raising nominal
interest rates, it has allowed real interest rates to fall, which
seems hardly suitable for America's steaming economy.
</P>
<P>
   America's labor market is already squeaky tight, so wage demands
could start to follow headline inflation more closely than in the
past. The cost of holding rates down now may be higher rates _ and
a sharper economic slowdown _ next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It is worth recalling that economists have repeatedly
underestimated the impact of previous oil shocks.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in December 1990, after oil prices had soared, the
OECD forecast growth in rich economies for 1991 of 2 percent; in
the end growth turned out to be only 0.8 percent, as America and
other countries dipped into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmingly, some economists are now arguing that higher oil
prices may even be good news for the American economy (and for Wall
Street), because they will help to slow consumer spending and so
reduce the need for higher interest rates. This may partly explain
why share prices are rising yet again.
</P>
<P>
   And here lies the biggest risk of all. Even if the direct impact
of higher oil prices is more muted than it once was, they may
prompt even the most fervently bullish investors to notice such
things as America's gaping current-account deficit and dismally low
saving rate _ and to realize that there is still such a thing as
bad news.
</P>
<P>
   That might just be the trigger for a long-overdue slide in share
prices. The effects of that would be far more widespread than
higher gasoline prices. &QL;

<P>
   Few cities are as gloomy as Yangon, the rot-blackened capital of
Myanmar, known in better days as Rangoon and Burma respectively.
</P>
<P>
   By day, unemployed youths line the streets. By night, in the
deserted center, soldiers stand guard behind barbed-wire blockades.
</P>
<P>
   Under the grip of military rule, few people dare talk politics,
even in private. Beyond the capital, it is worse: in some parts
people must endure slavery, eviction from their villages,
destruction of their crops, murder and theft by the army.
</P>
<P>
   The one bright light amid the murk is Aung San Suu Kyi, the
leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD).
</P>
<P>
   Her nine-day protest, trapped in a car on the outskirts of
Yangon, and her subsequent detention under what amounts to house
arrest, remind her countrymen, and the wider world, both of the
intransigence of the military junta and of the fact that an
alternative still exists, despite years of oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Suu Kyi's party won a general election, in 1990, by a
landslide, but the soldiers refused to move aside. Instead, they
dug in, occasionally making a few cosmetic changes to improve their
image: three years ago, for instance, they changed their name from
the State Law and Order Council to the State Peace and Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays they claim to bring order and stability to a country
divided by ethnic rivalry, though in reality their intimidation
encourages rebellion, notably along Myanmar's borders, and
thousands have fled to Thailand in search of jobs and safety.
</P>
<P>
   They also claim that a new election will be held once a new
constitution has been written. In truth, the soldiers' intentions
remain unchanged, as they admit in their franker moments.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago they openly vowed to ``eliminate'' the NLD, and
they have recently been forcing members to leave the party in
droves.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Suu Kyi's protest was timed, in part, to show that the
party will not yield. It is welcome evidence of her continuing
readiness to defy the junta and fight for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, since a similar set of protests in 1998, she had
lain low, leading some of her countrymen to fear _ and the junta to
hope _ that the democrats were a spent force. They are not.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has been going their way, though. Although ritual
denunciations of Myanmar are still made in various world bodies,
and though Indonesia, the biggest country in Southeast Asia, has
junked its military autocrat in favor of a democratically chosen
president, Myanmar's junta has been all too successful at
ingratiating itself with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It enjoys cordial relations with China. And, more importantly,
it is looked on with an increasingly benign eye by most members of
ASEAN, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, which admitted
Myanmar to its ranks in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ASEAN argued then that ``constructive engagement'' would soften
the generals and that trade would bring liberalization, much as
Japan claimed when it tried to promote investment in Myanmar
earlier in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, other countries have also tried to engage the
junta. India has sent its army chief to discuss their common
border. Australia has offered to help set up a human-rights
commission in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   Now even the European Union says it is ready to abandon its
previous standoffishness towards the regime and attend an ASEAN
meeting in Laos in December at which Myanmar will be represented.
</P>
<P>
   All bar Britain purport to believe that engagement, not
isolation, will bring a change for the better. They are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As the continuing persecution of Miss Suu Kyi and her party
shows, ASEAN's policy has not achieved either its declared aim of
reforming the junta or the underlying strategic aim of many of the
region's diplomats: stopping Myanmar becoming a cockpit of
Chinese-Indian rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Like North Korea, Myanmar is a weak country run by vicious
people whose one diplomatic skill is an ability to play more
powerful countries off against one another.
</P>
<P>
   ASEAN should realize that any decent club, even one that admits
a communist country like Vietnam, lays down some basic standards
for its members' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It should censure Myanmar in the strongest terms and make it
plain that its membership will be suspended if Miss Suu Kyi is not
released, her party allowed to organize freely and a realistic plan
put forward for a return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Others should help ASEAN to that realization _ and prominent
among them should be the European Union, with a prompt announcement
that it won't go to the Laos meeting in December. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS, TEXAS _ What would Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson make of
Paris, Texas? This barren town in the state's northeastern corner
has long been the center of Democratic Texas _ a place where an
elected Republican was a contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   It was the stomping ground of Rayburn, the speaker of the House,
who shepherded the New Deal laws through Congress; Johnson,
Rayburn's protege, counted on it as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in many ways, Texas Democrats no longer have Paris. As in
hundreds of rural towns throughout the state, they have lost their
stranglehold there, and now face fierce Republican competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in Texas's first congressional district, which also
includes Texarkana (a straddle-town that is half in Arkansas),
Paris is still represented in Congress by a Democrat, Max Sandlin.
But Republicans have hopes of winning Sandlin's seat in November.
</P>
<P>
   Rural Texas's turn to the right is an ominous sign for state
Democrats, who are grimly watching as their sinecure slowly becomes
a one-party state for the Republicans. There are currently more
Libertarians than Democrats on the ballot for statewide office in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So demoralized is the once-almighty Texas Democratic Party that
it is not even putting up a fight for several important offices,
including the state Supreme Court posts, choosing instead to devote
its limited resources to battle in a handful of closely contested
races for seats in Congress and the Texas legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans currently hold all 29 statewide elected offices and
both United States Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the first governor in state history to have
been elected to two consecutive four-year terms, and Rick Perry,
the lieutenant-governor, is the first Republican to hold that
position since Reconstruction in the 1860s, after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lower house of the Texas legislature and most of
the state's congressional districts remain in Democratic hands,
this is largely thanks to a crafty redistricting scheme devised by
Democrats in the legislature after the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republicans now holding the reins of power in Austin,
it is unlikely that the state's electoral map will be so friendly
to Democrats after the next redistricting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other states of the old Confederacy, Texas began
turning towards the Republicans as a reaction against the
civil-rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Southern Democrats, alienated by the growing
influence in their party of minorities and Northern liberals, began
to cast ballots for Republicans throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Johnson, as the vice-presidential nominee, just managed
to deliver the state to John F. Kennedy; but after he himself
signed civil-rights legislation into law in 1964 and 1965, the fate
of Lone Star Democrats was sealed.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the South the Democrats, by dint of alliances
between blacks and moderate whites, began to recover a little
ground in the 1990s, electing governors in Alabama, Georgia and the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, with a relatively small black population of 12 percent,
could not follow that lead. And Texas Democrats have been less
successful than their California counterparts at turning the
state's Latino population (nearly 30 percent) into a solid
Democratic voting block.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won roughly 40 percent of the Latino vote when he was
reelected in 1998, and he and other Republicans are careful to
pander to Latinos by speaking Spanish, enjoying Tejano culture and
being friendly to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As a Democratic political consultant, George Christian, puts it,
``Republicans in Texas knew that if they didn't develop long-term
appeal to Latinos, they would have a short life in Texas
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Another unhelpful trend for the Democrats has been the drift
from the rural counties, LBJ's heartland, to the more Republican
big cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the votes in Texas are cast in the Dallas and
Houston metropolitan areas, and Republican presidential candidates
carried these regions easily all through the 1990s. But nowadays
even the rural parts of Texas are wavering.
</P>
<P>
   These failures have started to affect the sort of people the
Democrats put forward for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   Although a throng of young, ambitious Republicans currently hold
statewide offices, the Democratic Party has tended to field
politically inexperienced trial lawyers _ a breed not much loved in
Texas, or indeed, anywhere (save possibly New York). In fact, the
Democrats seem to be concentrating most of their puny firepower on
local races, especially the Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, the Democrats are biding their time until
Bush leaves the stage.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats in the state, the ultimate humiliation came when
the last great Democratic power broker, the former
lieutenant-governor Bob Bullock, who had dominated Texas politics
for four decades, threw his support behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bush visited him on his deathbed and Bullock wished
the presidential candidate good luck in the coming fight. He died
the next day. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It's six in the morning on Labor Day and Al Gore is
addressing an overflowing crowd at a fire station in Tampa, Fla. He
warms them up with a few firefighting anecdotes _ it turns out that
his uncle Everett was a fireman _ before reverting to his usual
catalogue of policies and promises.
</P>
<P>
   He will reduce prescription-drug prices for old folk (a forest
of crutches is raised aloft in approval), raise the minimum wage by
a dollar an hour (loud cheers), and provide tax credits for
university education (even louder cheers).
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first rays of dawn can be seen on the horizon,
he has promised something to almost everyone present (with the
notable exception of the man holding a huge sign demanding the
appointment of a special prosecutor), and the crowd marches off
happily into the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that a swot like Gore should want to get
an early start on Labor Day, the traditional kickoff point for the
home stretch of the campaign. But this is actually the fifth event
in what the Gore team is billing as a 28-hour workathon.
</P>
<P>
   So far the vice president's audiences have included building
workers in Philadelphia (at 6 p.m.), hospital workers in Flint,
Mich. (at close to midnight), shop-floor workers at a truck factory
(at just before 1 a.m.), and twelve customers at Pop and Son's Cafe
in Tampa (at 5 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Joe Lieberman, who tagged along as far as Tampa, jokes
that running mates should start demanding collective-bargaining
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore packed in two Labor Day rallies later that day _ a huge
event in Pittsburgh and a smaller one at a speedway in Louisville,
Ky. _ and even managed an unexpected visit to a high-tech factory
on his way to bed.
</P>
<P>
   America is the first society in the world that has tried to
organize itself on the assumption that human beings do not need to
sleep. There are 24-hour news channels, 24-hour wedding chapels,
and, of course, 24-hour lap-dancing emporiums.
</P>
<P>
   So it was only a matter of time before someone invented the
24-hour political campaign; and it is only right that that someone
should be Al Gore, the protege of the man who invented the
``permanent campaign.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Today's presidential campaigns are untrammeled by the
constraints of time and money that bring sanity to politics in
other countries. It is more than a year since the unofficial start
of the campaign _ the Iowa straw poll _ and there are still two
months to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore campaigns have already spent more than a
quarter of a billion dollars collectively, and this could well turn
out to be America's first billion-dollar presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of a better way to satirize all this excess
than for the world's best-known environmentalist to fly from
Pennsylvania to Florida and back again in the space of a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only hurtles around in a giant Boeing 757, Airforce
Two. He has another giant aircraft full of journalists following
behind. (This week W. finally closed the ``jet gap'' by getting a
757 of his own, handing his old Boeing 727 to Dick Cheney.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Even the mundane business of eating is over the top. Gore
started his tour with a cheese-steak sandwich with the building
workers, followed shortly afterwards by pizza. He started the next
day with some country ham and biscuits at Pop's place at 5 a.m.
before eating a mushroom omelette with the local firefighters. On
the way to Louisville he stopped to pick up 20 boxes of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   There are two powerful defenses of this extraordinary way of
doing politics. The first is that the United States is a darn big
place. The only way to prevent politicians from becoming completely
cut off from the people is to force them to spend years on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   America's way of democracy thus obliges politicians to spend
weeks hanging around diners in Iowa and New Hampshire (thanks to
the caucuses and primaries) and then later to get to know some of
the dullest parts of the Midwest (thanks to the concentration of
swing states in the Rust Belt).
</P>
<P>
   The second defense is that being president is a hard job, and
voters need to make sure that the candidates are up to it. How
better to test their ability to take the punishing pace of the 24x7
global economy than to force them to ricochet from coast to coast
and north to south?
</P>
<P>
   And how better to test their ability to stand up to tub-thumping
fanatics than to force them to discuss prescription-drug charges
with Florida pensioners?
</P>
<P>
   There is also a more subtle defense of the American political
system: the hazing defense.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate is bent on subjecting politicians to all sorts of
humiliating rituals before handing them power. Politicians not only
have to prove that they can stuff themselves all day long with junk
food while remaining telegenic. They have to prove that they can
endure in-your-face rudeness without batting an eyelid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Al Gore,'' the smiling vice president said to one man in a
Florida diner. ``When Clinton leaves,'' the man replied, ``why
don't you go with him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even something to be said for this four-state,
five-city extravaganza. Gore and Lieberman made a great fuss about
the fact that, unlike W., they understand people who have to work
at odd hours of the day and night. (Gore's mother put herself
through college by waitressing in an all-night coffee shop;
Lieberman's father drove a bakery truck before dawn.)
</P>
<P>
   But the real point of the exercise is to raise doubts about
Bush's capacity for hard work.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is the Energizer Bunny of this campaign, Bush is the
napster, taking his favorite feather pillow wherever he goes _ an
aide carries it in a special bag _ and pining if he has to spend
too many nights away from home.
</P>
<P>
   For all its symbolic virtues, however, Gore should hesitate
before organizing another workathon, if only to keep the press from
staging a revolt. Listening to one speech by Gore is hardly a
rousing experience. Listening to several speeches in a row,
including one just before dawn, verges on torture.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started the week with yet another faux pas: calling a New
York Times journalist a ``major-league (vulgarity)'' in the range
of a live microphone. (A hint: it's an anatomical part in the human
southern hemisphere; site of hemorrhoids.)
</P>
<P>
   That word was mild compared with the ones being bandied around
by some members of the press as they completed their 28th
consecutive hour of following the vice president. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Who better deserves a prominent memorial: the
singer whose ``My Way'' launched a thousand karaoke bars, or his 16
million contemporaries who fought in the Second World War?
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, it looks as if New York City will erect a statue
of Frank Sinatra before Washington gets around to building a
tribute to the troops whose ranks Sinatra joined only on celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   But neither is proving particularly easy work. The Sinatra
statue would stand on a small pedestrian island in the heart of
Times Square (ironically, just a few feet from the city's most
prominent Army recruiting office, and close to the spot where
wartime sailors once pelted his image with tomatoes).
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say that the statue will only make the square's
appalling traffic problems worse; a few also gripe that Broadway is
an inappropriate spot for a memorial to a man who seldom trod the
boards, at least in a theatrical sense.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the first time, Sinatra might be saved by having friends
in the right places. The city's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, has vowed to
put up a memorial to the local hero.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that he actually came from New Jersey, a place with
nothing else to recommend it in New Yorkers' eyes. But Sinatra not
only sang ``New York, New York''; he was also one of the first
Italian-Americans to become a national idol.
</P>
<P>
   Turn now to Washington. The most bizarre thing about the
memorial to those who fought in the Second World War is that it
does not already exist.
</P>
<P>
   The capital is full of physical appreciations of one sort or
another (including one to Franklin Roosevelt's dog, Fala).
Memorials have already been built to those who fought in Vietnam
and Korea, and one has been eagerly proposed for Ronald Reagan,
even though he is still alive and therefore, by law, is not
eligible to get a Washington monument for at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even more bizarrely, the campaign for the Second World War
memorial seems to have gotten off the ground only because of the
involvement of actor Tom Hanks (of ``Saving Private Ryan'' fame),
though it now enjoys wide political support.
</P>
<P>
   The monument will stand on the National Mall, the strip of
parkland between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.
But before ground-breaking in November, two federal agencies must
make final reviews of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained that the first rather hulking design looked
inappropriately fascist.
</P>
<P>
   The revised seven-acre plaza, which would feature two massive
archways, 56 free-standing pillars, fountains and waterfalls,
several bronze eagles and a nine-foot wall emblazoned with over
4,000 gold stars, would still not shame ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial's chief architect, Friedrich St. Florian, says the
design celebrates America's ``unprecedented unity'' during the war.
The National Coalition to Save Our Mall bemoans the design's
``institutional and corporate abstraction and anonymity'' in
contrast to, for example, the Vietnam Memorial, which lists every
fallen soldier by name.
</P>
<P>
   And there is even dissent among ex-servicemen's groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing there that tells you anything about World War
11,'' says John Graves, an ex-serviceman who has starred in a
television spot opposing the current design. ``A memorial that
needs explaining is not a memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   These complaints have not gone unheard. This week, an
independent federal agency urged Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of
the interior, to reconsider the plans before approving them.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's report contends that, as proposed, the memorial
would clash with its subdued surroundings and ``intrude upon the
uncluttered historic vistas of the Mall.''
</P>
<P>
   That's always a problem with memorials: they tend to obscure as
much history as they commemorate. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's presidential election has been
transformed. For much of the past year, it had seemed George W.
Bush's to lose. Streets ahead in most polls, he had been able to
set the policy agenda and stamp his authority on his party.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, meanwhile, written off by many as the president's
apologist-in-chief, lurched from one public persona to another
while his fractious party squabbled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an inspired choice of running mate, a lingering
uxorial kiss and a policy-laden speech at his party's nominating
convention, it is Gore who is surging ahead in the polls, with an
average lead of three percentage points in most and ten points in
one.
</P>
<P>
   On some measures Bush, whose troubles began with his own
lacklustre choice of running mate and were compounded by a
convention speech that, in retrospect, looks vacuous on policy, is
scoring lower than the generic Republican vote _ a remarkable
setback for someone who has built his campaign on not being one of
those awful partisan congressional Republicans whom voters loathe.
</P>
<P>
   So now it is an animated and forceful Gore who is setting the
agenda, forcing Bush into spelling out his prescription-drug plan
this week by challenging him to ``put up or shut up'' about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   And it is Bush who is stumbling on the hustings, getting his
billions and his trillions muddled up (twice) and blurting unsavory
things into open microphones.
</P>
<P>
   The event mainly responsible for this turnaround was Gore's
acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention. Criticized at the
time as a catalogue of pandering to special-interest groups, his
policy promises are now seen to have cemented his reputation as the
candidate talking most about the bread-and-butter concerns of
America's middle class: i.e., most voters.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Joe Lieberman's harping on religion and morality,
this has given the Gore ticket a double appeal to the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   It has also revealed the weak points of Bush's appeal. When he
was ahead in the polls, he tended to stress his policy proposals:
partial privatization of Social Security, tax cuts, school vouchers
and the like.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention he changed tack, stressing instead the
failures of leadership and character of Clinton and Gore and
promising to ``change the tone in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   This seemed like a good idea at the time. Gore looked vulnerable
to some kinds of personal attack, especially for the fund-raising
scandals that bedevilled his and Clinton's re-election campaign in
1996. Conversely, the policy debate seems less promising for the
unwonkish Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift in strategy ran two hidden risks. First, the
character thrusts were made in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Before the convention, voter ignorance about Gore had been
profound, even though he had been in the public eye for years. As
it turned out, they liked what they saw in Los Angeles, and the
``leadership gap'' (in which Bush was deemed by poll respondents to
be the more decisive leader) disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That undermined the force of Bush's first big anti-Gore
televised advertising campaign. He ended up attacking
pre-convention views about Gore while the candidate and voters had
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Second, by attacking at all, he was not doing much to change the
tone in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these travails, some of Gore's more enthusiastic
supporters now think the vice president has done more than merely
erase the early Republican lead. They think he has put himself in a
position to romp home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There are two bits of evidence to support this. First, it is
possible that voters may be making up their minds a little earlier
than usual. Historically, around two-thirds of voters have made
their decision by this point in the campaign cycle, a share that
has fallen slightly over the years (to 55 percent in 1992).
</P>
<P>
   This time, some pollsters have found that as many as nine-tenths
of voters say they have made up their minds, which, if true, makes
Gore's current poll lead the more significant. (Since 1960, the man
ahead at this point has gone on to win in November.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, some of Gore's backers think that the state of the
economy is the most reliable guide to any presidential race, and
that this should be enough to see their man home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A rule of thumb says that assuming there is peace abroad and
neither candidate is affected by personal scandal (the outgoing
president's disrepute does not count), the incumbent will win if
the economy is growing by more than 4 percent at an annual rate in
the first half of the election year.
</P>
<P>
   It has been growing by far more than that (rising 5.8 percent in
the first six months of 2000 compared with the second half of
1999).
</P>
<P>
   It is true that voters split the credit for this, giving some to
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, some to the
Republican Congress, and some to America's entrepreneurial spirit.
But, argues Tom Mann of the Brookings Institution, that has always
been true. And if this election is like any other, then Gore should
benefit from the growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the final years of the Reagan boom helped George W.
Bush's father erase a 17-point gap in the summer and destroy
Michael Dukakis. The 2000 election has started to follow that
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be foolish to think it is all over. For one thing,
around a fifth of voters have changed their minds in the past
month. That suggests considerable volatility.
</P>
<P>
   For another, if you take the polling evidence state by state,
rather than nationally, the race looks like a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is ahead in three polls, Gore in three others. Based on the
most recent state polls, Bush has 223 Electoral College votes to
Gore's 228, which means neither has the 270 needed to win. Since
America chooses its president through the Electoral College, not by
direct popular vote, this is the relevant measure.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the character of the policy debate points to a
close contest. The race is turning into a debate about how to react
to growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Partly, that means it is about how much of the forecast budget
surplus to hand back in tax cuts and how much to spend in
government programs or for paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, it is a debate over the virtues of consolidation
versus radicalism.
</P>
<P>
   Gore essentially says that after eight years of growth, America
should now concentrate on consolidating its gains. That means
paying down the national debt by 2012, shoring up the finances of
Social Security and Medicare (rather than changing the programs
fundamentally), and spending more money on education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This week, Gore unveiled a plan to set aside $300 billion as a
contingency fund in case the forecast budget surpluses do not
materialize, and grouped all his various economic programs into a
prototype budget document, which he describes as ``specific,
detailed and _ above all _ prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   If the campaign were a military one, Gore would be the general
ringing conquered territory with solid defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush essentially argues that the eight years of growth provide a
chance for America to expand market mechanisms into new areas,
notably the big government entitlement programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Social Security he proposes to allow workers to set aside a
share of their payroll taxes for private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In Medicare he has proposed letting private companies offer a
range of competing services, rather than the single,
government-financed one. He proposes education vouchers for failing
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a military operation, he would be the admiral
saying ``Damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,350) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Looked at this way, the race seems too close to call. On the one
hand, America is friendlier to market solutions than almost any
other country; and this election is taking place at a time when
half of all households own shares, which may mean that people are
more willing to take risks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, consolidating your gains is a natural
reaction, especially among older people who vote in larger
numbers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,450) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the race is no longer Bush's to lose. Equally, it would
be too much to say it has become Gore's to lose. But the changes
mean it is now up to Bush to shift the momentum back in his favor. &QL;

   An Ethiopian touts goats, Somalis in Kenya sell henna and
incense, a censored Liberian radio station defies the government
and a Namibian invites offers for a taxi license. All do so on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Is Africa getting online? Not really: of some 360 million
Internet users around the world, only 3.1 million are thought to be
in Africa, and most of them are either in South Africa or north of
the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria probably has 100,000 users; Kenya, a relatively
prosperous country, has even fewer. But access is spreading fast,
perhaps even tripling over the course of last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, Somalia became the latest African country to offer
local access to the Internet, and for the first time surfers can
use the Net in Swahili.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has put its faith in the Internet as a means
for poor countries to leapfrog stages of development. The
secretary-general's millennium report, written for the summit in
New York, speaks of building ``digital bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nation's own plans for bridge-building include a
corps of volunteers to teach people in developing countries how to
use computers, and a health network to provide hospitals and
clinics with up-to-date medical information.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet could also be a way around one of Africa's greatest
weaknesses, its feeble infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Poor roads, uncertain power supplies, an unreliable postal
system and bad telephone lines (there are as many telephones in
Tokyo as in all of Africa, says the U.N. report), add to Africa's
economic and political woes.
</P>
<P>
   Without easy access to information, farmers cannot know what
price is fair for their goods, traders have no alternative to
buying imports from local sources, doctors rely on ancient
technology, voters can make no informed choices.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet could change things. Just as battery-powered and
windup radios brought much of Africa into contact with the outside
world, so can computers make that contact richer.
</P>
<P>
   And cheaper: e-mailing a 40-page document from Madagascar to
Cote d'Ivoire costs 20 cents, faxing it about $45, and sending it
by courier $75.
</P>
<P>
   More and more African newspapers now post online editions, and
use foreign news found on the Internet. Most of the initiative, and
investment, is expected to come from private companies and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   A new 32,000-km (20,000-mile) undersea fiber-optic cable system,
which will form a ring of connections around the continent, is due
to open in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Internet cafes have been springing up in African cities wherever
people have the money to use them.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of a cyber cafe in Zanzibar provides Web sites for
government officials, hotels and banks, and collects payments from
drop-in users. He also wants to change people's lives by putting
the Internet, free, in local schools.
</P>
<P>
   On a larger scale, an East African company, Africa Online, based
in Nairobi, works in eight countries. One of its aims is to provide
Internet connections for people without their own telephones or
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Using e-touch technology (a simple way to operate e-mail), it
wants to put terminals in post offices throughout the region. Last
month the company announced a deal with Barclays Africa to open a
string of Internet centers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet cannot help the truly poor, who look for
pencils, not computers, it may well speed the pace of change. &QL;

<P>
   ST. PAUL, MINN. _ Drive through Frogtown, a seedy bit of St
Paul, Minn., and the future of Laos is on display.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of University Avenue is Foodsmart, a supermarket
owned by a Hmong businessman. On the other is the office of the
Hmong Times, next door to the Asian-American press. Nearby are a
Hmong bookshop, a Hmong chemist and dozens of other Hmong-run
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Toua Xiong, who owns the supermarket, says he wants ``to turn
Frogtown into Hmongtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their relations in Communist-run Laos, the Hmong of
Minnesota, some 70,000 of them, are evidently flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Hmong fought with America's CIA against North Vietnam during
the Vietnam War. Hmong fighter pilots and troops attacked the Ho
Chi Minh Trail, part of which wound through Laos. When the
Americans withdrew, thousands of Hmong fled to Thailand, and then
on to America.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years on, the Hmong want to improve matters back home.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Hmong who remain in Laos, those in America are riven
between the militant-minded, who say the struggle against the
Communists should continue, and a larger group of moderates, who
would encourage trade, remittances and contact with their old
country.
</P>
<P>
   General Vang Pao, who once led the Hmong in battle, has stout
backing from the oldest support group for the Hmong in America, the
Lao Family of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Ying Vang, its boss, says he wants America to ``go and rescue
our people.'' He suggests that ``maybe we can do some economic
sanctions.'' He claims that agents sent by the Laotian government
have been creating splits among the Hmong in America.
</P>
<P>
   What of the recent bomb attacks in Laos, blamed on unnamed
dissidents? Vang does not support them. Nevertheless, he says,
something must be done to stop what he calls ethnic cleansing in
Laos.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate Hmong in St. Paul say that closer ties, not
sanctions, would improve the lot of their people.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Pao Xiong, a Hmong politician on a government committee for
Asian-American affairs, says that Hmong businessmen in St. Paul
would leap at the chance to invest back home.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to move some of Minnesota's wealth _ the state's
economy was worth $161 billion in 1998 _ to Laos, which earned $1.3
billion in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   As Laos's neighbor, Vietnam, has found, the diaspora can be a
major source of hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   A few former residents are now visiting Laos, says Fu Hang of
the Asian Development Corporation. His father has bought land
there. ``When Laos opens up, then we'll do business there,'' he
says. Others send money to build temples and to support families.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate Hmong seem to be winning the argument. The Laotian
royal family, which lives in France, visited Minnesota in June and
encouraged Lee's group. Members of the Laotian government have
visited the moderates in Minnesota, much to the outrage of the
militant Hmong.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the Hmong Times in June called the moderates reds
and collaborators. But Lee says, ``Everything depends on us. If we
succeed, we open up the door for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hmong's dollars, if not their bullets, could yet change life
in Laos for the better. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ On Wednesday, Sept. 6 Jac Nasser, chief executive of
Ford Motor Company, appeared before a congressional subcommittee
investigating the recall of at least 6.5 million Firestone tires
fitted to Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).
</P>
<P>
   Before he even took the stand, he was on the defensive.
Disintegration of the tires is already blamed for causing 89 deaths
in America and a further 46 in Venezuela, and both Firestone and
Ford have been accused of being, at the least, slow to react to
growing evidence that there was a dangerous problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser was up in front of the congressmen with Masatoshi Ono,
the boss of Firestone in America (Firestone is part of Japan's
Bridgestone Corporation).
</P>
<P>
   The contrast was sharp. Nasser was, as usual, the Australian
tough guy. Ono was all contrition. ``I come before you to apologize
to you, the American people, and especially to the families who
have lost loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Also giving evidence was Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen, a consumer group, and a former National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) official. She said that Ford and
Firestone officials should be charged with second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Nasser had tried to avoid giving evidence to Congress
at all, offering to send two technical people in his place, and
pleading that he needed to stay in Detroit to manage the company's
response to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ono, meanwhile, had agreed readily to the request to appear,
despite having poor English and a harder case to plead.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone also had a huge tire recall in the late 1970s and was
reprieved only when the Reagan administration relaxed safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   Either Nasser was cowardly, or he was arrogantly jockeying to
get a more favorable slot before the committee, avoiding being
sandwiched between his critics from consumer and safety groups.
</P>
<P>
   Since nobody could accuse the engaging but pugnacious Nasser of
ducking a fight on his battle through the ranks to the top of the
world's second-biggest car company, ill-judged arrogance seems the
more likely answer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the American press and broadcasters were on a
feeding frenzy over the recall of Firestone tires fitted to Ford
Explorers, Nasser appeared on prime-time television advertising
slots professing the company's commitment to customers and their
safety, and promising to do everything to replace suspect tires as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the great thing about going on TV ads is that nobody can
answer back _ unlike during a congressional hearing. Nasser must
have been made very quickly aware of what a mistake he had made in
at first refusing to appear.
</P>
<P>
   The tough-talking Australian is probably the most wired manager
in Detroit. His top-floor office has a dozen screens around its
high-tech walls, with CNBC murmuring in the background and
motor-industry Web sites flicking on and off all the time. He says
he needs all this to keep up-to-the-minute with information.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, his multi-screen office-cum-TV-studio must
have told him how far the value of his stock options had shrunk
when Ford's share price started diving as the crisis grew, and
management began to look like rabbits caught in the headlights of
an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the reaction to his planned no-show was coming across the
ether. The committee chairman, a Republican from Louisiana named
Billy Tauzin, promptly attacked Nasser's reluctance to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a man whose vision of Ford's future success is to get
close to customers to satisfy their needs and sell them not just
cars but all sorts of other services as well, shrinking from a
public discussion of the biggest customer and safety problem to hit
Ford since the early 1970s (when its little Pinto cars started
bursting into flames in accidents because of a badly placed fuel
tank).
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, was a man who wants to create lifelong customer
relationships, holding back from the eyeball-to-eyeball exposure
that is what any worried Ford customer wants right now.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was cowardice or arrogance does not much matter. It
looked simply awful.
</P>
<P>
   The car industry in Detroit has an old saw about getting down to
basics, ``where the rubber meets the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of Nasser's ambitious attempt to transform Ford
from a low-rated car-making stock into a glamorous service and
consumer company, with a higher share price, along comes the most
basic problem _ literally where the rubber meets the road.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries under way by the NHTSA and by Congress will attempt to
discover what went wrong with the tires and whether Ford and
Firestone were to blame for not responding more quickly. Some are
in no doubt already where the blame lies.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook of Public Citizen maintains that Ford and
Firestone knew about the tire problem with the Explorer (such
vehicles account for as much as 25 percent of Ford's profits) as
long ago as the early 1990s, as a result of lawsuits following
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   She alleges that there was a cover-up, with gagging orders
imposed as part of the settlements of these suits.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser is not responsible directly for what Ford was doing all
those years ago, but his initial response to the crisis brings
echoes of earlier complacency.
</P>
<P>
   If he continues to stumble, the most likely outcome is that his
chairman Bill Ford (an earnest environmentalist as well as a Ford
heir) will take over the front-line position of defending the
company, which is usually what chairmen of the board are for
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Unless somebody at Ford gets this consumer-safety issue under
control, it will not just be Firestone tires that are shredded _ it
could be Jac Nasser's career as well. &QL;

   SANTIAGO _ Earlier this year, MercadoLibre, a Miami-based online
auction company, found to its surprise that Santiago's underground
railway authority had vetoed part of its planned advertising
campaign in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run metro seems to have objected to a poster
proclaiming ``vendo mis pelotas,'' or ``I sell my balls.''
</P>
<P>
   The veto was predictable. When it comes to public morality,
Chile has long been more straitlaced than its neighbors. General
Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, with its curfews and press
censorship, helped to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   But though a Chilean judge is due to question General Pinochet
next month on criminal charges, in moral matters the center-left
governments that have ruled since 1990 have done little to
challenge his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce is still illegal, although polls show that most Chileans
think it should not be. The rich seek annulments, often paying
their lawyers to arrange false witnesses. Many poorer Chileans
simply avoid marriage: nearly half the country's children are born
out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Discotheque owners feel unable to install contraceptive
machines. Abortion is illegal, even when a mother's life is at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the government reckons that one in four pregnancies
ends in abortion. The true figure is probably higher. Some
abortions take place discreetly at private hospitals, others
dangerously in backstreet clinics. All are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Neither are Chileans especially faithful. In a recent survey of
sexual habits by Fundacion Futuro, a polling firm, the average
respondent guessed that two-thirds of men and almost half of women
would have at least one affair while married. But fewer than half
of the respondents admitted themselves to wanting to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Such hypocrisy may owe much to the influence of the Catholic
Church, stronger in Chile than in many other South American
countries. It runs many private schools and controls one of the two
main television channels.
</P>
<P>
   Many businessmen, including the owners of the main media groups,
are active Catholics. A locally-owned cable television firm
recently refused to carry the Playboy channel.
</P>
<P>
   The church also has influence with the government, especially
through Christian Democracy, the ruling coalition's largest party,
but also with the Socialists, who are grateful for its defense of
human rights during the dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Lagos, Chile's president since March, is a socialist
agnostic and in his second marriage. But as a candidate, he dodged
the issue of divorce as much as he could _ out of deference to
Christian Democracy, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   His government does plan to introduce a divorce law, though it
will face a struggle to gain congressional approval. Abortion,
though, is still taboo. Lagos says that legalising it, even for
mothers at risk, is not on his agenda. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Last Friday, when President Ernesto Zedillo gave
his final state-of-the-union address to Mexico's Congress, he had
much to be proud of. Back in 1994, he took over a country teetering
on the brink of economic crisis, and scarred by political violence
and guerrilla rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, he will hand over to Vicente Fox a country that
differs for the better, in two fundamental ways.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Zedillo overseen Mexico's peaceful transition to
democracy, with power passing to the opposition in the form of Fox
after seven decades of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   But Zedillo also passes on a booming economy: this year GDP is
set to grow by 7 percent, its highest rate since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Zedillo, a dry, bookish man devoid of charisma, will
bow out on a wave of popular esteem: his popularity rating stands
close to 70 percent, compared with just 30 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, too, that his speech was largely uninterrupted by the
angry protests that have punctuated these occasions over the past
decade, nor that it was cheered by the opposition, while the PRI's
congressmen sat stony-faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no applause, because he didn't deserve it,'' said
Senator Manuel Bartlett, a leader of the PRI's diehard faction.
That is a backhanded compliment to Zedillo's statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   He has done much to smooth what might have been a bumpy
transition to Fox. In particular, Zedillo has sought with almost
obsessive zeal to break the cycle of economic crises that have
accompanied the past four presidential handovers.
</P>
<P>
   In this, he appears likely to succeed: such is the confidence of
the financial markets that Mexico last week felt able to pay back
its outstanding loans to the IMF, totalling $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Zedillo is also bequeathing some problems to Fox.
One is that the economy looks too strong for its own good, yet
growth is only just starting to benefit the poor majority of
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Another set of difficulties has been dramatized by the
corruption scandals that are marring Zedillo's final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Take the economy first. After plunging in Zedillo's first year,
in the wake of a bungled devaluation, Mexico's GDP has grown at an
annual average rate of 5 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Behind that growth lie Mexico's close economic links with the
booming United States through NAFTA, free-market reforms enacted by
Zedillo's predecessors, and sound economic management: Zedillo has
often acted as if he were finance minister, rather than president.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that growth is underpinned by increased
investment, the current-account deficit is manageable at around 3
percent of GDP this year, and a floating exchange rate has worked
well as a shock-absorber.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately for Fox, who has promised still-higher growth,
the economy needs to be cooled. Recorded unemployment has fallen to
just 2 percent; skilled labor is in especially short supply, and
some of the export growth reflects high but volatile oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The (independent) central bank has nudged up interest rates; but
relying on a monetary squeeze alone risks strengthening the
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   As Alfredo Thorne of J.P. Morgan, an American bank, notes, to
sustain growth, Fox will have to tighten fiscal policy while
pushing through structural reforms to boost productivity. In doing
so, Fox will be handicapped by his legacy, and by his own seeming
reluctance to take unpopular stands.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants to increase public spending, while needing to cut the
fiscal deficit. Under Zedillo, Mexico's tax revenues have amounted
to no more than 11 percent of GDP; to attack poverty and improve
education, Fox has said he wants the figure to rise to 17 percent.
But he has also backed away from specific tax reforms, such as
introducing VAT on food.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo failed to persuade his own party to accept structural
reforms; lacking a congressional majority, Fox may struggle to gain
approval for his modest proposals to allow private investment in
electricity and oil.
</P>
<P>
   A second set of tasks for Fox is the reform of Mexico's
institutions. The depth of the rot under the PRI has been
highlighted by a string of setbacks and embarrassments that have
hit Zedillo's government since the presidential election in July. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   First, Oscar Espinosa, Zedillo's treasurer in the 1994
presidential campaign, resigned as tourism minister and disappeared
_ seemingly to escape prosecution on charges of embezzling $45
million while mayor of Mexico City from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a drama at Cancun airport, when police boarded an
aircraft to arrest Ricardo Cavallo, the head of Mexico's national
car registry, as a suspected Argentine war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Five former prisoners have identified him as Miguel Angel
Cavallo, a naval officer and torturer during Argentina's ``dirty
war'' of the 1970s. In Mexico, he had abused his position to
traffic in stolen cars.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, two army generals were last week arrested on
suspicion of helping drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Mexico's Supreme Court ruled last month that
Zedillo should hand over to congressional investigators documents
relating to Banco Union, a failed bank formerly run by Carlos Cabal
Peniche, a fugitive financier.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal lost an appeal on Aug. 30 against extradition from
Australia to face charges of fraudulently pocketing $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that he was pressed by aides, including Espinosa, to
make an illegal donation of $4 million from Banco Union's funds to
Zedillo's 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the cost of that alleged donation would
have been passed on to taxpayers, since Banco Union was one of
several banks that later collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the government's flawed bailout of the financial system
after the 1994 devaluation is costing $100 billion. It was the
first time that the normally supine court had ruled against a
Mexican president.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, too, the PRI has blocked attempts in Congress to
investigate Cabal's claims, citing banking secrecy laws. But now
the courts and the new Congress may dig more deeply into the bank
bailout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The end of the PRI's rule, and the emergence of a plural
democracy in Mexico, were always likely to prompt an outpouring of
revelations of corruption and other wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   That process, if well-directed by Fox, should lead to a salutary
cleansing of public institutions. But it could yet prove to be
politically explosive.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that such scandals will damage Zedillo's personal
reputation for scrupulous honesty, though they may blight his
administration's record.
</P>
<P>
   With more pesos in their pockets, many Mexicans will no doubt
forgive Zedillo, if not some of his officials, regardless of what
the investigators turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his government's shortcomings, Mexicans will have
grounds for satisfaction if their new president turns out to be as
successful as his predecessor. &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ On Sept. 7 they started knocking down the courtyard
house of Cao Xueqin, the 18th-century author of ``The Dream of the
Red Chamber,'' China's greatest novel and one that occupies a
bigger place in Chinese hearts than ``Madame Bovary'' or ``Anna
Karenina'' do in French or Russian ones.
</P>
<P>
   The house was in the way of yet another soulless road that
Beijing's municipal authorities want to drive through a
centuries-old neighborhood of narrow alleyways, called hutong in
the Beijing dialect, to the southeast of Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities argued, certainly disingenuously, that it was
not definitely Cao's house but that, if the scholars campaigning in
favor of its preservation could convince them otherwise, they would
put up a memorial to it after its destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Six-lane avenues impress the Communist Party authorities.
Developers from Hong Kong and elsewhere in China drool at the
commercial buildings that can be put up alongside the new roads.
</P>
<P>
   A stone's throw from Cao's house in Zhushikou is another old
neighborhood that suspects it is up for destruction in favor of a
blank expanse of grass that a Hong Kong tycoon thinks will afford a
better view of his new shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the residents will be given as little notice as
those in Zhushikou. They had first read posters proclaiming that
their area was designated for destruction on July 18, and were told
to move out before Sept. 15. They were each offered compensation of
100,000 yuan ($12,000), with an extra 20,000 yuan if they left
early.
</P>
<P>
   Now one more swathe of the city, 2 km (just over a mile) long,
is a sea of rubble, a community scattered.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, much of what remained to make China's
capital an extraordinary city has been systematically destroyed in
favor of characterless boulevards and brutalist, bathroom-tile-clad
architecture, all choked by a cloud of traffic pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Communists came to power in 1949, travellers reported
an eighth wonder of the world: a green if dusty city, largely
unaltered from the medieval plan laid out under Kublai Khan and
built upon by the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1912) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   China's most famous architect of the 20th century, Liang
Sicheng, suggested that Mao Zedong should preserve the ancient,
imposing city walls as precincts for people to stroll along, and
turn the massive gatehouses into theatres, cafes and suchlike.
</P>
<P>
   He also begged the Communists to build their administrative
center to the west of the Imperial City. Mao, the newly-installed
emperor, took offense.
</P>
<P>
   The walls were torn down, Tiananmen Square (the symbol of
political power in China) was expanded into an immense space of
Communist bleakness, in the center of which, after Mao's death (and
admittedly against his orders), the Great Helmsman's corpse was put
in its hideous mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
   What survived this blitz (as well as the anarchy and destruction
of the Cultural Revolution) was the resilient vernacular life of
Beijing, typified by the hutongs.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's planners say that the hutong neighborhoods are too
dilapidated to renew and too narrow to be modernized with gas,
water and sewerage systems. They get in the way of where cars want
to go.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, don't the residents happily take the big sweeteners
to live in grim new blocks on the edge of the city?
</P>
<P>
   As one middle-aged hutong resident put it this week, ``Stylish
new furniture doesn't sit well in these old-fashioned buildings.''
Better to get a new apartment than an old sofa.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to blame people for wanting to leave. Under
socialism, the hutongs are run down and overcrowded. Today, few
households have title to ownership, and frequently the several
households sharing one traditional courtyard bicker over their
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet equally, it is not hard to imagine that a clearer system of
property rights would render hutong houses valuable propositions
for private renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison Keillor was not quite right when he said that only
Americans pulled down old houses because they were too difficult to
clean.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party sees itself in the vanguard of what it calls
China's ``spiritual civilization'' and ``socialist culture.''
President Jiang Zemin is in America this week, where a charm
offensive in the form of exhibitions, concerts, theme parks and
circuses is designed to enlighten Americans about Chinese tradition
and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, desperate to win the contest to hold the Olympic Games
in 2008, boasts about the ``greening'' and ``modernizing'' of the
capital. In reality, China's quest for modernity destroys much of
the old in favor of the ugly.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Chinese who object to the destruction, led
by Liang Congjie, the architect's son, along with sentimental
foreigners, are usually branded as elitist.
</P>
<P>
   A more sophisticated response to the elite is to say that
China's cultural heritage is more in the mind _ in poetry and
imagined landscapes _ than in those old physical objects that
remind the Chinese of their backwardness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the nature of Communism seems to be a more credible
explanation for what is going on. Liang laments the lack of
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the destruction of Cao's house, ``Old Man'' Ma,
as he is known, whose family had lived there for six generations,
said in his courtyard: ``All it would take to stop this tragedy
would be one word from an official.'' &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Everybody seems to love the ``local loop'' nowadays.
That is what the firms now battling for control of it call the
wires that connect telecommunications networks with homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always thus, for the local loop has traditionally
been the low-margin bit of the business. But now, thanks chiefly to
the Internet, consumers everywhere are clamoring for ever-faster
ways to download ever-larger quantities of data, and are willing to
fork out tidy sums for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious beneficiaries of such windfalls should be the local
telecoms firms that already have customers in the grip of their
copper tentacles.
</P>
<P>
   The snag is that these old telephone wires lack the carrying
capacity to do the job. Hence the Interest in using a second set of
cables that enter most buildings _ power lines _ as reserve
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Power-line technology (PLT), as it is known, is not a new idea.
Electricity companies have been using a primitive form of it for
years to check faults and to read meters on their networks.
</P>
<P>
   But to sate the demands of Internet users means boosting the
signal from a few hundred kHz to more than 1MHz, and that is more
easily said than done.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, such as Siemens and Nortel, are experimenting with
``single-carrier'' technology, which transmits the signal on a
unique frequency using high power.
</P>
<P>
   This has the advantage of reaching distant consumers clearly.
However, it requires cranking up the juice so much that such
systems tend to emit a lot of radiation and thus create
interference with other telecommunications systems.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, ``multi-carrier'' approach has been adopted by
Endesa, a Spanish utility, and Newbridge, a Canadian one. Here, the
signal is divided up between several frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   A similar amount of power is used, but because it is dispersed
over more bandwidth the peak power-level at any given frequency
(and thus the potential for generating interference) is lower than
with the single-carrier method.
</P>
<P>
   The snag is that multi-carrier signals do not travel as far as
single-carrier ones, so they require the construction of expensive
repeater stations.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of these experiments, however, is that the technology
really does work _ at least according to a new report on the future
of PLT from the Smith Group, a technical consultancy, and UBS
Warburg, an investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Power companies should not celebrate quite yet, however. Neither
of their approaches complies with existing regulations in the EU _
the area where PLT might be expected to be used most, since a
relatively large number of American Internet users already have
broadband connections.
</P>
<P>
   And although officials at the European Commission, as well as
those in some member countries, are plodding along to develop
standards that might allow PLT to flourish, their ideas of the word
``haste'' may not be compatible with the speed of change in matters
to do with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to Nick Pink, one of the report's authors,
is that PLT is likely to be overtaken by other means of delivery,
such as cable modems and broadband wireless links, before it is
allowed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Boring old utility companies that had been hoping to be re-rated
by the stock market as exciting, new Internet firms may have their
hopes dashed after all.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually pointed title of the report sums up the prospects:
``Warning: This bird may not fly.''  &QL;

 &HT;    DIRECTOR NEIL LABUTE HOLDS BACK DARK SIDE IN `NURSE BETTY(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Neil LaBute admits he had to suppress his darker side
while making (beginitalic)Nurse Betty(enditalic), which stars Renee
Zellweger as a waitress who loses herself in a soap-opera fantasy
world.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute, who wrote and directed the unrepentantly malevolent
(beginitalic)In the Company of Men (enditalic)and (beginitalic)Your
Friends and Neighbors(enditalic), pulled his punches in
(beginitalic)Nurse Betty(enditalic), which leans more toward comedy
than drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tendency is always to go, `Oh, let's stick it to them a
little bit. Let's keep them on their toes,''' LaBute says.
</P>
<P>
   But in making (beginitalic)Nurse Betty(enditalic), LaBute
realized that ``the audience really wants to go on a roller coaster
ride, but not actually be thrown out of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't mind going upside down a little bit, but they
really don't want to hit the pavement,'' he says. ``I've applied
pavement, concrete, on other outings, so I thought this time I
would let them remain seated.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute even cut a graphic scene in which someone is shot in the
head, instead allowing the character to die offscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried it the other way and the audience literally just
turned off,'' LaBute says. ``They were like, `Omigod, I did not
just see that.''''
</P>
<P>
   The movie also stars Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, who play hit
men who trail Betty across the country after she inadvertently
makes off with their drug stash.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute says the movie successfully walks the line between a
light comic story, which centers on Betty's fantasy about being
engaged to a soap character, and the evil mission of her two
pursuers. That was especially tough, because the actors were doing
other projects at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to know if you're getting that tone, that
strange mix of humor and violence,'' LaBute says. ``Are you kind of
keeping that ball up in the air, where there's a continuity, it's
just not wildly veering from one side of the road to the other?''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman is the biggest star to cross LaBute's path so far, and
the director says the veteran actor really brought a presence to
the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fantastic from beginning to end,'' LaBute says. ``He's
just got such experience and such weight to him. There's a certain
dignity. You completely buy him as the president of the U.S. or a
hit man or whatever he is. And he brings a sort of grace to it.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute says Rock joined the cast because it gave him an
opportunity to act, not just do his nightclub routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the page, it's not the kind of guy who would be ideal for
him to play,'' LaBute says, ``because he was really the quiet one,
kind of sullen, the first to grab his weapon rather than talk to
somebody. And it was only by his frustration that you brought any
of the humor out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he adds, Rock had to be prepared to act with
the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a scary proposition, actually, to go into the
ring with Morgan Freeman,'' LaBute says. ``By doing what seems to
be nothing, by just being still and taking over the screen, he will
blow you away, you will disappear if you aren't up to the task. And
I think Chris really sort of took it as both an acting challenge
and an acting camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, LaBute says he was really attracted to the film because
it was a departure for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for something that would surprise people, and
have them say, `Gee, I didn't think he would go there,''' he says.
``While there is a certain darkness of character and tone splashed
throughout (beginitalic)Nurse Betty, (enditalic)I think the overall
sense of it is that it's a much lighter kind of picture.''

BOSTON TV CHANNEL DECIDES TO AIR `DR. LAURA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After completing what it called ``a very serious review of her
plans'' for the program, WCVB-TV (Channel 5) in Boston announced
Thursday that it will air controversial talk host Dr. Laura
Schlessinger's new syndicated TV show beginning Monday at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Although Channel 5 officials never received the full preview
tape they requested from the show's producer, Paramount, they
viewed excerpts they found reassuring. ``She steered far clear of
the subject matter that precipitated this controversy and I've been
assured by Paramount she'll remain far clear of it,'' said Channel
5 president and general manager Paul La Camera.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists _ who accuse Schlessinger of anti-gay bias
_ were critical of WCVB, which many parties believed was the only
station still debating whether to air the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Gay &AMP; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ``is deeply
disappointed that WCVB has decided to air this program,
particularly given the open dialogue we've had with the station and
their obvious concern with the community in Boston,'' said GLAAD
spokeswoman Cathy Renna. Eric Marion, an organizer of a Monday
protest against Schlessinger in Boston, said ``WCVB can no longer
be considered a friend of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Station officials says they will monitor the show carefully. And
director of programming Elizabeth Cheng asserted that the protest
campaign had already ``changed the way (Schlessinger) has talked
about'' homosexuality.

Hearst-Argyle buys Manchester's Ch. 9
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WMUR-TV (Channel 9), the Manchester, N.H. station that became
the dominant Granite State media outlet and a crucial player in the
quadrennial New Hampshire primary, has been purchased by
Hearst-Argyle Television Inc. in a $185 million cash transaction.
The sale, by the privately held Imes Communications company to the
same corporation that owns WCVB-TV (Channel 5) in Boston, was
announced Thursday. The deal is expected to be finalized early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   WMUR vice president and general manager Larry Gilpin called the
sale ``a personal triumph for all of us who have played a role in
the station's phenomenal growth.'' According to Nielsen statistics
cited by the station, its daily newscasts are seen by more than a
quarter million New Hamsphire viewers.
</P>
<P>
   While stating that ``we don't like to use the word `synergy,'
it's a forced word,'' Hearst-Argyle chief operating officer Tony
Vinciquerra said in an interview Thursday that the there were plans
to maximize the combined advertising clout of WMUR and WCVB. He
also indicated that WCVB president and general manager Paul La
Camera would help ``oversee the transfer of the station to
Hearst-Argyle.''
</P>
<P>
   WMUR ``has evolved in the past eight to 10 years in a very
positive way and is clearly the voice of New Hampshire,'' added
Vinciquerra. ``It is the station of record in New Hampshire.''

a Wednesday night ceremony in New York.
</P>

much impact as it has, as exemplified by this award.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In Israel, national pride comes wrapped in military
might and emblazoned on the T-shirts sold to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``America don't worry,'' quips one T-shirt with a drawing of an
F-16 fighter jet. ``Israel is behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, of course, it is the other way around. U.S. aid to
Israel has been the backbone of this country's defenses for at
least 15 years. More than one-fifth of Israel's approximately $9.3
billion defense budget, including expenditures for nearly half its
equipment each year, comes from America.
</P>
<P>
   But that aid is being criticized, just as Israelis may ask for
billions more. With the encouragement of President Clinton, they
seek money to beef up the army as they offer land in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Most favor the idea, but arms control experts deride the annual
$2 billion military aid package as fueling an arms race in an
already volatile region. And Israelis seem reluctant to pay for
large increases in defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Israeli executives say the reliance on American guns
and planes stunts the growth of their own arms industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders of defense industries say, 'Enough to U.S. aid,'''
cried a headline in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth last month(CQ).
``We don't need its favors.''
</P>
<P>
   They are angry because under terms of the aid agreements, most
of the money must be spent in the United States. The policy, they
say, will cost them thousands of jobs over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time you are trying to help us you are doing us
terrible harm,'' says Abraham Hatzor, chief executive of an Israeli
company that makes bulletproof vests, military tents and other
textiles.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the United States gave Israel more military aid than
usual, $3.12 billion. It was more than the rest of the world
combined received for military aid in the main U.S. aid budget,
according to figures from the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID).
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money, $1.2 billion, was a special grant to be given
over three years as Israel implements the 1998 Wye River peace
accords _ under which Israel agreed to give to the Palestinians
land it captured in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   The long-stated purpose of the military aid is to ensure that
Israel always maintains an edge over its potential enemies. Most
agree Israel has the best fighting force in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's shopping list for American equipment over the last two
years is long and varied. According to a tally kept by the
Federation of American Scientists' Arms Sales Monitoring Project,
Israel has spent billions on everything from F-16 fighters to
Apache helicopters to air-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Israeli officials contend that their military is woefully
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to modernize our air force, modernize the navy and
modernize our vehicles. Some of them, you won't believe this, are
from World War II,'' said Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim
Sneh. ``The point is that Israel faces tremendous military problems
given the environment we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Israelis say U.S. aid is crucial as they try to make
peace with the Palestinians, or Syria. As they give up land, they
need extra military might.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much cheaper to assist Israel to deter war than to assist
Israel when it is at war,'' Israeli Ret. Brig. Gen. Shlomo Brom
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Federation of American Scientists researchers say
increasing the military aid just fuels an arms race that makes the
region more dangerous. They say the aid antagonizes rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to a point where Israel's lead is significant enough
that you don't need to give them more,'' says Tamar Gabelnick,
director of the FAS's Arms Sales Monitoring Project. ``I don't
think it's really credible for them to say we need more weapons. I
see it as a way for them to get as much as possible from the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis themselves seem to show little enthusiasm for spending
more on defense.
</P>
<P>
   A February poll by the Israeli Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies showed just 28 percent of Israelis willing to pay higher
taxes for more security. (The poll surveyed 1,201 people, and had a
3.1 percent margin of error one way or the other.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, last year, U.S. officials warned Israeli leaders
that proposed defense cuts in Israel would make it harder to ask
for more U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   But, the army is still a popular and nearly omnipresent part of
Israeli life. Service is compulsory for most men and women.
Soldiers patrol the streets with their U.S.-made M-16s, and
casually take them to the malls and restaurants while off duty.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day affords a solemn moment each spring, when sirens
bring the nation to a halt and motorists pull over to stand by
their cars in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Given that sense of pride, it's hard to find detractors of the
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody asks the questions, 'Do you buy what you need, or do
you just buy because you have the money?''' said Reuven Pedatzur, a
military analyst and former pilot in the Israeli Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Pedatzur has been a lone critic of Israel's Arrow missile
defense project, which has received $820 million in U.S. aid
separate from the annual package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tells me, 'Why are you against it? It's American
money.''' he says. ``When you're talking about American money,
nobody wants to ask the questions.''

<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Three doors from the austere facade of the
U.S. Embassy is the ``Buzz Stop,'' a beachfront bar where the
American-Israeli relationship flows as smoothly as the draught on
tap.
</P>
<P>
   A miniature Statue of Liberty stands above the entrance and
Israeli owner Eli Barel holds court on the patio overlooking the
Mediterranean Sea. Behind him there's a booming city, where cranes
hover over new malls and skyscrapers, and sport utility vehicles
clog the highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the child of America. They have been with us from the
beginning. They raised us,'' Barel says in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   But even Barel is not aware that the United States usually gives
his small country some $3 billion a year _ equaling about $500 for
each of the 6 million Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give that much, then God bless America,'' says the
hefty 50-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   America's blessings are likely to increase. Israel is growing
wealthy and already draws one-fifth of all U.S. foreign aid, but it
will likely be getting more.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is the deadline for a peace agreement between the
Palestinians and Israel _ and the Palestinians have threatened to
declare a state with, or without Israel's approval. After the
failure of July's Camp David peace talks, American mediators are
pressing for an agreement, which could cost more than $17 billion
in aid to Israel for upgrading its military over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   With a country smaller than Vermont, Israelis say they can only
offer land for peace if their army is stronger. And they want
America to help pay the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In July, President Clinton promised to pitch in, but a few
congressional leaders have blanched. First, they were upset at
Israeli plans, over U.S. objections, to sell an advanced radar
plane to China. Israel eventually cancelled the deal. Then, some in
Congress didn't like the price Israel placed on peace.
</P>
<P>
   Their sentiments echo a minority both inside and outside Israel
who say it's time for the country to get by with less help from
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do consider Israel a strategic ally and I want it to
succeed, but at the same time I don't want Israeli citizens to
assume this is an entitlement, like food stamps in the Middle
East,'' says Alabama Republican Rep. Sonny Callahan, who heads the
House subcommittee that writes the foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
   Says Callahan, who favors eliminating economic, though not
military, aid to Israel: ``The more money we give to Israel, the
less money we have for starving children in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, however, say aid to Israel is an investment that reaps
strategic dividends for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (in the United States) know we can always rely on Israel in
any situation,'' says Ester Kurz, director of legislative strategy
for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). ``If
Israel weren't there, if Israel were weakened, if Israel couldn't
stay strong against its enemies, we wouldn't have much of an
ally.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an ally that receives uniquely special treatment:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  According to the Congressional Research Service, a branch of
Congress, Israel has received more than $66 billion in grants and
$15 billion more in loans from the United States since 1949 _ far
more than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The aid continues as Israel grows wealthier and better able to
stand on its own. It's economy is in a hi-tech boom and, this
summer Israeli officials cut $300 million in taxes on stereos,
refrigerators and other electric appliances, in expectation of
budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Aid to Israel is given on freer terms than aid to any other
country. Israel is the only country that gets the money up front
each year. It can then invest it, or lend some of it back to the
United States in bonds, earning interest until it can spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Totals for the interest were not available, but based on
estimates from Israeli and U.S. officials, it likely topped $750
million during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Long relationship
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of this year's regular U.S. assistance, $1.9
billion, is military aid . The other $949 million is economic aid.
It totals about $2.8 billion, more than what was given to Africa
and Latin America combined.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also authorized another $1.2 billion in
special military aid to be given over three years as Israel
implements the 1998 Wye River peace deal. Under the accords, Israel
agreed to hand over to the Palestinians land in the West Bank,
captured in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was one of the richest aid years in a solid
relationship that dates back more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   President Harry Truman took a risk when the United States became
the first country to recognize Israel's statehood in 1948. The
surrounding Arab countries, then beginning their war against the
Jewish state, would count America among their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. aid to Israel began slowly. It rarely cracked $100
million a year _ and mostly then in loans _ through the 1950s and
1960s, even while the nation fought three wars. In the early 1970s,
the aid pace increased, especially after the surprise Arab attack
that started the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rose Garden signing of an historic peace agreement
with Egypt in 1978, aid to Israel and Egypt rose sharply and
eventually settled to about $3 billion and $2 billion a year,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Israel's aid is required to go for purchasing military
equipment from American defense contractors. It makes for a $1.5
billion-a-year boon to federal lawmakers whose states _ including
Texas, Ohio, Florida and Georgia _ have factories with Israeli
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Israelis, there has been growing recognition that aid
to Israel should eventually come down. Following a landmark speech
to Congress in 1996 by then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israeli and American officials agreed to reduce the overall aid 20
percent over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It will drop gradually, but the reductions made so far in the
regular aid were offset this year when President Clinton and
Congress agreed to give the extra $1.2 billion for the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that what really makes the U.S. aid relationship
with Israel special is not only the volume of aid but the leeway
Israel has in spending it.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they cite the annual economic aid. Other
countries get such aid with spending overseen locally by the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID).
</P>
<P>
   While officials say the aid to Israel is meant to help the
country pay off old debts to the U.S., the money goes into the
general Israeli budget where it can be spent on everything from
welfare to roads.
</P>
<P>
   Accrued Interest
</P>
<P>
   Also, both the economic and military aid come in lump-sum
payments within 30 days after the passage of the U.S. budget.
Israel can then deposit the money in interest-bearing accounts. It
also buys U.S. bonds, in effect lending the money back to the
United States for interest, until the Israeli government needs it.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Brig. Gen. Moti Besser estimates that the interest on
just the military aid has totaled more than $500 million since it
started coming in a lump sum in 1991. It could be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Ministry of Finance says, for example, interest on
military aid reached $120 million last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The lump-sum payments for economic aid started in the early
1980s at Israel's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to members of Congress and said, 'There is a way you
can help us without increasing the level of aid,' `` said Daniel
Halperin, former economic minister in the Israeli embassy to the
United States. ``The advantage was that it didn't show in the
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But, economists and congressional staff contacted by Cox
Newspapers said the lump-sum payments cost American taxpayers
money. If the money stayed with the U.S. Treasury longer, under one
scenario, the U.S. government could use the money to pay off old
debt and save interest costs perhaps near what Israel earns.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, the Alabama congressman, calls the lump-sum practice
``stupid, or at least unusual, foreign policy,'' but he has not
been able to change it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress proposes letting Egypt earn interest on its
aid, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Aid reaps dividends
</P>
<P>
   Despite the perks in the U.S. aid package, Israel supporters say
it has been good for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, they say, the military aid has kept the tiny state
several steps ahead of the Arab rivals who surround it. Israel's
army is small, but is recognized as the best-equipped and strongest
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   It is from this position of strength that the Israelis seek to
make peace with the Palestinians, and other Arab neighbors. Israeli
officials say that if they must risk giving up land, they want
extra assurances that Israel will keep a military edge.
</P>
<P>
   During peace talks with Syria last year, Israeli officials
floated the figure of $17 billion as what they would need to hand
over the strategic Golan Heights, captured from Syria during the
1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   Israel supporters argue that such requests are not out of line
because U.S. aid has paid off for America. First, many Americans
feel a sentimental bond to Israel, which they still see as an
underdog democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There were strategic gains. As Arab countries saw they could not
defeat Israel, they sought to make peace, helping calm a region
that sits on 60 percent of the world's crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they sought better ties with the United
States. The result: Both Israelis and Arabs were turning to America
for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best investment and cheapest investment the United
States has ever made,'' said Israeli Dan Schueftan, an occasional
advisor to the Israeli ministries of defense and foreign affairs.
``You (in the U.S.) end up in a situation where both sides are
indebted to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's survival also provided a Cold War outpost for the
United States in a potentially explosive Middle East loaded with
Soviet clients. Israel did things, like destroy an Iraqi nuclear
reactor in 1981 that, in hindsight, also served American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also gave equipment to the United States in the Persian
Gulf War in 1990, and works closely with U.S. intelligence
services.
</P>
<P>
   Other needs exist
</P>
<P>
   But, critics say at least some of the aid to Israel could do
more good in other places. There are a host of needs, from an
HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa that activists say requires $3.3
billion-a-year to a $500 million shortfall in U.S. embassy staff
and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israel's economy and army are strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so vastly superior to any combination of Arab armies
it's ridiculous,'' said Stephen Zunes, a Middle East expert at the
University of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Israel's role as a Middle East outpost, the U.S. now
has other allies in the region _ including a Navy base in Bahrain
and troops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. On matters of peace, Zunes
says it's pressure, not aid, that leads Israel to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give money to where it is most needed, and Israel is
pretty far down the list,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of other types of aid, to Africa for example, note
that the U.S. devotes less than 1 percent of its budget to foreign
aid, low compared to other industrial nations. Many fear that it
would be even less if Israel, backed by AIPAC, was not the main
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   But even with overall increases, Colin Bradford, former chief
economist to USAID, thinks the Israel-Egypt share would be too big.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't doing enough in the broader global setting. We ought
to be doing more, but we also need to get the proportions right.
Israel and Egypt can both stand on their own feet more than they
used to,'' says Bradford, now at American University in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, meanwhile, is far richer than other U.S. aid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Once a hard-scrabble Zionist frontier, Israel is now a regional
economic powerhouse. Western franchises, from Blockbuster Video and
Office Depot are common. American firms like Intel Corp. and Lucent
Technologies are buying technology start-ups for billions.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was $18,300 in
1999, according to the on-line CIA World Factbook. By comparison,
Spain's was $17,300 and Greece's $13,900. The U.S. per capita GDP
was $33,900 and the United Kingdom's $21,800.
</P>
<P>
   The economy overall nearly doubled from $53 billion in 1990 to
$101 billion in 1999, according to the Israeli Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Jimmy Weinblatt has written that the Israeli economy
has developed an ``addiction'' to the U.S. aid and that it stunts
economic growth. Israel could handle a cut, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, it would cause some shortages but in the
long run it is the right thing to do,'' says Weinblatt, dean of
humanities and social studies at Israel's Ben Gurion University.
</P>
<P>
   Other Israelis offer different reasons for cutting the aid. Some
among Israel's political right-wing see it causing a political
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a psychological dependence,'' says Israeli
member of parliament Uzi Landau. ``There is a notion that Israel
receives so much help from the United States . . . that we have to
listen and do what we are told.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing aid despite unsure public
</P>
<P>
   Among the American public, says Steven Kull, director of the
Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of
Maryland, people tend to be skeptical of aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He cites a 1999 Gallup Poll of 1,021 people, with a plus or
minus 3.5 percent margin for error, showed a plurality of more than
40 percent favoring a decrease in aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Kull says, though, that general public opinion does not
influence Washington as much as organized groups.
</P>
<P>
   And pro-Israel groups are well organized. They frequently
arrange to bring American politicians _ from Austin, Texas, Mayor
Kirk Watson to would-be President George W. Bush and Florida Sen.
Connie Mack _ on trips where they meet with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan says there's a local pressure, too, because, ``the
Jewish community has been very generous with contributions'' to
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Lasensky, research fellow at the Brookings Institution
in Washington, says support for Israel is grass-roots and
broad-based. Especially active are evangelical Christian groups who
believe Israel must be strong before Jesus Christ can return.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wednesday's peace process deadline forces the region to
confront a potential new cycle of violence between Israelis and
Palestinians, even as they negotiate possible solutions that could
lead to an end to their 52-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   With a dramatic breakthrough for peace, Lasensky says, Israel's
request for billions in new aid will likely be received well by
both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum drives these aid packages,'' Lasensky said. ``It's
still Washington's best bipartisan consensus: Aid to Israel.''

 &HT;    IN A NEW ERA, MEXICANS EXAMINE THE ``DISAPPEARED'' AND OTHER
ABUSES
 &HT;    With Photos.

 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Rosario Ibarra applauded when Mexican police last
month arrested an Argentine here who is suspected of kidnapping and
``disappearing'' scores of dissidents during Argentina's military
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aug. 24 arrest also rekindled Ibarra's 25-year-old cry
for a serious investigation into Mexico's own prolonged repression
against dissidents - including Ibarra's 21-year-old son, Jesus, a
student who was kidnapped by armed men in Monterrey on April 18,
1975 and has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a key moment for us, for the family of the disappeared
here,'' said Ibarra, 73, one of Mexico's premier human rights
figures, who has relentlessly criticized Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, for years.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the PRI was finally defeated in an election that will
end its 71-year lock on this country's powerful presidency. On Dec.
1, when president-elect Vicente Fox takes over, many families of
the disappeared hope he will investigate successive PRI
governments' reported use of torture, killings, secret detentions
and disappearances of political foes.
</P>
<P>
   During a televised campaign debate, Fox paid tribute to Ibarra's
``perseverance'' and ``struggle for the disappeared'' and made an
emotional appeal to Mexicans to end ``PRI authoritarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibarra and others say some of those responsible or knowledgeable
about human rights abuses are still prominent figures in the PRI,
the government, private business or in the military. Two Army
generals arrested Aug. 31 on drug-trafficking charges have also
been implicated in human rights abuses by former detainees and
families of Mexico's disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything the system did here, it did because they thought
they were untouchable,'' Ibarra said. ``I hope there's justice in
this country, and that (Fox) will do what the PRI didn't do during
so many years of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fox takes office he is expected to recommend Congress set
up a ``transparency commission'' that could probe the fate of the
disappeared and other human rights abuses as well as corruption and
theft of public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If society has proof of abuses, then I think investigations
will happen,'' said Fox aide Adolfo Aguilar Zinser.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who'd like a probe is Victor Pineda, 23, who was
only one year old when his father, a teacher and community
organizer also named Victor, was detained by soldiers in Juchitan,
Oaxaca, on July 11, 1978. His family has never been able to find
out what happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine the trauma this causes children,'' Pineda
said, sitting by his mother during a recent gathering of relatives
of the disappeared at Ibarra's home. ``But now the dirty inner
workings of the government are being revealed. There are people who
know what happened and they continue to walk the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   During her long, frustrating quest to find her son, Ibarra
founded the Eureka Group, which contends there are at least 448
unlawfully detained people still missing. The group forced the
release of about 1,500 political prisoners in the 1980s, some of
whom had vanished for as long as nine years, Ibarra said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the disappeared were rounded up during a wave of violent
repression through the 1970s, following the infamous Oct. 2, 1968
massacre of hundreds of youths protesting for more democracy prior
to the Olympic Games in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, disappeared in the 1980s or 1990s. Army Lt.
Miguel Orlando Munoz was 25 when he disappeared in May 8, 1993 in
Juarez, a city steeped in corruption and collusion between the
Mexican military and powerful drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz's family claims they've been repeatedly lied to and
stonewalled by the military, which they believe is hiding
information about Munoz's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the PRI's defeat, two recent scandals here
sparked new demands to investigate the disappeared and other
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   In August Mexican police arrested a prominent Argentine
businessman who the government had hired to direct a
car-registration program here. Former Argentine military officer
Ricardo Cavallo is being held for possible extradition to Spain to
face charges of atrocities committed against Spanish citizens and
others during Argentina's 1976-1983 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s and 1980s, Mexico's PRI governments _ which
professed a leftist tradition _ welcomed refugees from Argentina
and Chile, where right-wing military regimes killed thousands. At
the same time, however, the PRI was violently cracking down on its
own mostly leftist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican dissidents armed themselves in response to
escalating repression. ``They didn't do that because of simple
adventurism. Remember what happened on Oct. 2,'' said Ibarra, who
still cries when she talks about her son, a medical student who,
unknown to her, was a sympathizer of a dissident organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they broke the law, then sentence them. That's what
justice is for,'' Ibarra said. ``What happened was the reverse. The
government broke its own laws and became a terrorist. It violated
the constitution, tortured, kidnapped and set up clandestine
jails.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Solomon of New York-based Human Rights Watch, agreed. His
organization, like Amnesty International, has compiled reports of
disappearances and unlawful detentions from the 1970s up to
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, Mexico legitimately laid claim to being a
refuge for the politically oppressed. But it's not an excuse for
its own excesses,'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico for a long time didn't get the scrutiny it deserved,''
he added, in contrast to South American regimes. ``The government
took advantage of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, according to a 1999 U.S. State Department report
recognizing a pattern of abuses, has had ``limited success'' in
improving its justice system: ``A culture of abuse continues to
pervade the security forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's long history of impunity was also spotlighted recently
with the arrest last month of two Army generals, one active duty
and the other recently retired, who are accused of protecting
Juarez-based drug traffickers. Ibarra and others believe these same
generals either participated in kidnapping dissidents or have
information about their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Octaviano Santiago, who is now a left-wing opposition legislator
in Guerrero state, said in April 1978 he was arrested and tortured
during a secret interrogation by one of the generals, Mario Acosta
Chaparro. At that time Acosta Chaparro held a lower rank, said
Santiago, who spoke by telephone from Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acosta Chaparro told me he had detained certain people,''
Santiago said, reciting six names. ``Those people never appeared
again. I'm willing to testify about this in any court of law that
calls me. This is the most important opportunity we have to find
out what happened to our people. (Acosta Chaparro) is a living
crime file. So among the sea of bitterness, this gives me a spark
of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Matilde Gonzalez, whose 23-year-old son, Jesus, disappeared in
1974, said the other general, Francisco Quiroz Hermosillo, had a
reputation as a military officer who offered to sell information
about disappeared people.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said that in 1976 a neighbor passed her a message from
Hermosillo, who was an acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbor said if I could pay 250,000 pesos (about
US$20,000) and buy a gold ring to give to his wife, Hermosillo
would provide some information. But I didn't have that kind of
money,'' said Gonzalez, 74, who has participated in hunger strikes,
marches, and visited prisons and filed multiple legal appeals in
vain over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico the Army has been untouchable,'' added Concepcion
Avila, Gonzalez's daughter. ``We've been waiting for a moment like
this, just like people in Argentina.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S SECURITY AGENCY NOW ALLOWED STEALTH MONITORING OF
INTERNET TRAFFIC
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Sept. 10 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ For Russian computer users, the message ``You've Got
Mail!'' might now well read, ``You've Got Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a far-reaching new law going into effect this month,
Russia's intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, or FSB,
is now allowed to snoop on all Internet traffic and eavesdrop on
cellular telephone and pager communications _ all without the
user's consent or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's flourishing Internet service providers, or ISPs, say
the government's demand that they install the eavesdropping
equipment and train intelligence officers to use it will put the
fledgling companies out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, civil rights groups say the surveillance measures,
known by their Russian acronym SORM, are yet another sign of a
return to Soviet-style political repression under current President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end to all E-mail privacy,'' said Anatoly
Levanchuk, an Internet and free-speech advocate. ``Wiretapping is
now only a click away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Draconian regulations were first issued by government decree
in 1995. At this time, they only covered wiretapping telephone
calls. SORM was updated in 1998 to include Internet technologies _
the venue where, Russian officials believe, most crime in the 21st
century will be committed. The Justice Ministry approved the
measures on July 25, effectively making them law.
</P>
<P>
   The amended directives require all Russian ISPs to equip their
networks with an FSB monitor and connect them with a high-speed
fiber-optic link to FSB headquarters. The link permits the agency
to keep an eye on electronic transmissions _ from private e-mails
to e-commerce purchases _ in real-time and in total privacy.
Failure to put in the bugging devices, which the Internet firms say
cost between US$15,000 and US$25,000, will mean the loss of the
service provider's operating license.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Rokotyan, a top official in Russia's Communications
Ministry, admits that the regulations _ the Orwellian-termed
``System of Operational and Investigative Measures'' _ give the
government access to all information transmitted via Russian ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security organs and special forces have the right, and now the
capability, to monitor private correspondence and telephone
conversations of individual citizens in the name of establishing
legal order,'' Rokotyan told Russian television in July. He
insisted, though, that SORM would be used only for ``monitoring
individual cases according to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet surveillance has come under fire in many countries,
including the United States. In 1994, U.S. lawmakers authorized the
FBI to wiretap and eavesdrop on criminals conducting or discussing
crimes over the Internet. The measure was vehemently opposed, with
only limited success, in 1998 by civil liberties groups and telecom
businesses who viewed it as a threat to both profits and personal
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates in Russia say these same issues that
aroused opposition in the United States are magnified here because
there are virtually no checks-and-balances to prevent the FSB from
using their expansive powers to cross from law enforcement into
political blackmail and commercial espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying that the FSB should not have access in the
course of a criminal investigation. There is a law that says
Internet (service) providers must render assistance in a criminal
case. But free access to the Internet gives the FSB great power
that would be easy to abuse,'' said Ina Zemskova, a lawyer with the
St. Petersburg-based Citizens' Watch, a human-rights group. ``In
our country, no one monitors the eavesdroppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the SORM regulations are fraught with
loopholes that allow the FSB to sidestep the required warrant
before conducting any electronic surveillance. That leaves
telecommunications firms in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know exactly what the FSB does in our network. We
cannot see what they are doing, when they are tapping in. We can
only trust that they are not working against our clients'
interests,'' said Mikhail Yakushev, the head of the legal
department at GlobalOne, a multinational telecommunications
company.
</P>
<P>
   About 7 million people, or 4.8 percent of Russia's 145 million
population, are connected to the Internet. That number is expected
to rise to 8 percent of the population in the next three years,
according to Avi Krel, the telecom analyst at UFG investment bank
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Although miniscule compared to the United States, this activity
has generated 2,000 Internet start-ups in the last two years. Just
over 300 businesses are licensed to provide Internet service here,
and some 20,000 Russian Websites offer search engines, chatrooms
and e-commerce outlets. Economists estimate Russia's dot-com
economy's annual turnover at around US$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Internet has offered Russians much more than
monetary gain. The information superhighway has spurred the growth
of environmental organizations, academics and a rising number of
government critics by connecting them across Russia's 11 time zones
that extend from the Pacific Ocean to the Polish border.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the most outspoken opponents of government policy
are chatroom monitors or network operators themselves. They were
among the first to sound the alarm about SORM, leaving the
traditional media in their wake as they posted up-to-the-minute
news about the progress of the proposed regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Syrov, the director of an ISP based in the northern Russian
town of Volgograd, has become one of SORM's most vocal critics.
After denying the FSB access to his Bayara-Slavia Communications
network in 1998, Syrov said he received anonymous death threats. He
said he has also fought off multiple attempts by the FSB to shut
down his business.
</P>
<P>
   An FSB spokesman contacted about the allegations raised refused
to comment for this story,
</P>
<P>
   But around the rest of the marketplace, opposition to the
regulations among ISPs has weakened as the government's
determination to institute the surveillance measures have
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   While the Communications Ministry said the vast majority of
Internet providers are complying with SORM, all but one of the six
Moscow-based ISPs contacted for this story refused to say whether
they had installed the eavesdropping equipment. The exception _
GlobalOne _ said all of its hardware and software contained the
equipment necessary for the FSB to dial in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resistance movement is as good as dead,'' said a grim
Alexander Levanchuk, the founder of www.libertarium.ru, a Russian
political Website and one of the people spearheading a legal
challenge to SORM. ``The FSB can outmuscle us, and it usually wins
these things.''

   BUYING IN BULK
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $2 billion in annual U.S. military aid to Israel has
to be spent in America, with the U.S. Defense Department overseeing

   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Three doors from the austere facade of the
U.S. Embassy is the ``Buzz Stop,'' a beachfront bar where the
American-Israeli relationship flows as smoothly as the draught on
tap.
</P>
<P>
   A miniature Statue of Liberty stands above the entrance and
Israeli owner Eli Barel holds court on the patio overlooking the
Mediterranean Sea. Behind him there's a booming city, where cranes
hover over new malls and skyscrapers, and sport utility vehicles
clog the highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the child of America. They have been with us from the
beginning. They raised us,'' Barel says in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   But even Barel is not aware that the United States usually gives
his small country some $3 billion a year _ equaling about $500 for
each of the 6 million Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give that much, then God bless America,'' says the
hefty 50-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   America's blessings are likely to increase. Israel is growing
wealthy and already draws one-fifth of all U.S. foreign aid, but it
will likely be getting more.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is the deadline for a peace agreement between the
Palestinians and Israel _ and the Palestinians have threatened to
declare a state with, or without Israel's approval. After the
failure of July's Camp David peace talks, American mediators are
pressing for an agreement, which could cost more than $17 billion
in aid to Israel for upgrading its military over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   With a country smaller than Vermont, Israelis say they can only
offer land for peace if their army is stronger. And they want
America to help pay the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In July, President Clinton promised to pitch in, but a few
congressional leaders have blanched. First, they were upset at
Israeli plans, over U.S. objections, to sell an advanced radar
plane to China. Israel eventually cancelled the deal. Then, some in
Congress didn't like the price Israel placed on peace.
</P>
<P>
   Their sentiments echo a minority both inside and outside Israel
who say it's time for the country to get by with less help from
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do consider Israel a strategic ally and I want it to
succeed, but at the same time I don't want Israeli citizens to
assume this is an entitlement, like food stamps in the Middle
East,'' says Alabama Republican Rep. Sonny Callahan, who heads the
House subcommittee that writes the foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
   Says Callahan, who favors eliminating economic, though not
military, aid to Israel: ``The more money we give to Israel, the
less money we have for starving children in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, however, say aid to Israel is an investment that reaps
strategic dividends for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (in the United States) know we can always rely on Israel in
any situation,'' says Ester Kurz, director of legislative strategy
for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). ``If
Israel weren't there, if Israel were weakened, if Israel couldn't
stay strong against its enemies, we wouldn't have much of an
ally.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an ally that receives uniquely special treatment:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  According to the Congressional Research Service, a branch of
Congress, Israel has received more than $66 billion in grants and
$15 billion more in loans from the United States since 1949 _ far
more than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The aid continues as Israel grows wealthier and better able to
stand on its own. It's economy is in a hi-tech boom and, this
summer Israeli officials cut $300 million in taxes on stereos,
refrigerators and other electric appliances, in expectation of
budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Aid to Israel is given on freer terms than aid to any other
country. Israel is the only country that gets the money up front
each year. It can then invest it, or lend some of it back to the
United States in bonds, earning interest until it can spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Totals for the interest were not available, but based on
estimates from Israeli and U.S. officials, it likely topped $750
million during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Long relationship
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of this year's regular U.S. assistance, $1.9
billion, is military aid . The other $949 million is economic aid.
It totals about $2.8 billion, more than what was given to Africa
and Latin America combined.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also authorized another $1.2 billion in
special military aid to be given over three years as Israel
implements the 1998 Wye River peace deal. Under the accords, Israel
agreed to hand over to the Palestinians land in the West Bank,
captured in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was one of the richest aid years in a solid
relationship that dates back more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   President Harry Truman took a risk when the United States became
the first country to recognize Israel's statehood in 1948. The
surrounding Arab countries, then beginning their war against the
Jewish state, would count America among their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. aid to Israel began slowly. It rarely cracked $100
million a year _ and mostly then in loans _ through the 1950s and
1960s, even while the nation fought three wars. In the early 1970s,
the aid pace increased, especially after the surprise Arab attack
that started the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rose Garden signing of an historic peace agreement
with Egypt in 1978, aid to Israel and Egypt rose sharply and
eventually settled to about $3 billion and $2 billion a year,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Israel's aid is required to go for purchasing military
equipment from American defense contractors. It makes for a $1.5
billion-a-year boon to federal lawmakers whose states _ including
Texas, Ohio, Florida and Georgia _ have factories with Israeli
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Israelis, there has been growing recognition that aid
to Israel should eventually come down. Following a landmark speech
to Congress in 1996 by then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israeli and American officials agreed to reduce the overall aid 20
percent over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It will drop gradually, but the reductions made so far in the
regular aid were offset this year when President Clinton and
Congress agreed to give the extra $1.2 billion for the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that what really makes the U.S. aid relationship
with Israel special is not only the volume of aid but the leeway
Israel has in spending it.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they cite the annual economic aid. Other
countries get such aid with spending overseen locally by the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID).
</P>
<P>
   While officials say the aid to Israel is meant to help the
country pay off old debts to the U.S., the money goes into the
general Israeli budget where it can be spent on everything from
welfare to roads.
</P>
<P>
   Accrued Interest
</P>
<P>
   Also, both the economic and military aid come in lump-sum
payments within 30 days after the passage of the U.S. budget.
Israel can then deposit the money in interest-bearing accounts. It
also buys U.S. bonds, in effect lending the money back to the
United States for interest, until the Israeli government needs it.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Brig. Gen. Moti Besser estimates that the interest on
just the military aid has totaled more than $500 million since it
started coming in a lump sum in 1991. It could be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Ministry of Finance says, for example, interest on
military aid reached $120 million last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The lump-sum payments for economic aid started in the early
1980s at Israel's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to members of Congress and said, 'There is a way you
can help us without increasing the level of aid,' `` said Daniel
Halperin, former economic minister in the Israeli embassy to the
United States. ``The advantage was that it didn't show in the
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But, economists and congressional staff contacted by Cox
Newspapers said the lump-sum payments cost American taxpayers
money. If the money stayed with the U.S. Treasury longer, under one
scenario, the U.S. government could use the money to pay off old
debt and save interest costs perhaps near what Israel earns.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, the Alabama congressman, calls the lump-sum practice
``stupid, or at least unusual, foreign policy,'' but he has not
been able to change it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress proposes letting Egypt earn interest on its
aid, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Aid reaps dividends
</P>
<P>
   Despite the perks in the U.S. aid package, Israel supporters say
it has been good for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, they say, the military aid has kept the tiny state
several steps ahead of the Arab rivals who surround it. Israel's
army is small, but is recognized as the best-equipped and strongest
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   It is from this position of strength that the Israelis seek to
make peace with the Palestinians, and other Arab neighbors. Israeli
officials say that if they must risk giving up land, they want
extra assurances that Israel will keep a military edge.
</P>
<P>
   During peace talks with Syria last year, Israeli officials
floated the figure of $17 billion as what they would need to hand
over the strategic Golan Heights, captured from Syria during the
1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   Israel supporters argue that such requests are not out of line
because U.S. aid has paid off for America. First, many Americans
feel a sentimental bond to Israel, which they still see as an
underdog democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There were strategic gains. As Arab countries saw they could not
defeat Israel, they sought to make peace, helping calm a region
that sits on 60 percent of the world's crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they sought better ties with the United
States. The result: Both Israelis and Arabs were turning to America
for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best investment and cheapest investment the United
States has ever made,'' said Israeli Dan Schueftan, an occasional
advisor to the Israeli ministries of defense and foreign affairs.
``You (in the U.S.) end up in a situation where both sides are
indebted to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's survival also provided a Cold War outpost for the
United States in a potentially explosive Middle East loaded with
Soviet clients. Israel did things, like destroy an Iraqi nuclear
reactor in 1981 that, in hindsight, also served American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also gave equipment to the United States in the Persian
Gulf War in 1990, and works closely with U.S. intelligence
services.
</P>
<P>
   Other needs exist
</P>
<P>
   But, critics say at least some of the aid to Israel could do
more good in other places. There are a host of needs, from an
HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa that activists say requires $3.3
billion-a-year to a $500 million shortfall in U.S. embassy staff
and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israel's economy and army are strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so vastly superior to any combination of Arab armies
it's ridiculous,'' said Stephen Zunes, a Middle East expert at the
University of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Israel's role as a Middle East outpost, the U.S. now
has other allies in the region _ including a Navy base in Bahrain
and troops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. On matters of peace, Zunes
says it's pressure, not aid, that leads Israel to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give money to where it is most needed, and Israel is
pretty far down the list,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of other types of aid, to Africa for example, note
that the U.S. devotes less than 1 percent of its budget to foreign
aid, low compared to other industrial nations. Many fear that it
would be even less if Israel, backed by AIPAC, was not the main
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   But even with overall increases, Colin Bradford, former chief
economist to USAID, thinks the Israel-Egypt share would be too big.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't doing enough in the broader global setting. We ought
to be doing more, but we also need to get the proportions right.
Israel and Egypt can both stand on their own feet more than they
used to,'' says Bradford, now at American University in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, meanwhile, is far richer than other U.S. aid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Once a hard-scrabble Zionist frontier, Israel is now a regional
economic powerhouse. Western franchises, from Blockbuster Video and
Office Depot are common. American firms like Intel Corp. and Lucent
Technologies are buying technology start-ups for billions.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was $18,300 in
1999, according to the on-line CIA World Factbook. By comparison,
Spain's was $17,300 and Greece's $13,900. The U.S. per capita GDP
was $33,900 and the United Kingdom's $21,800.
</P>
<P>
   The economy overall nearly doubled from $53 billion in 1990 to
$101 billion in 1999, according to the Israeli Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Jimmy Weinblatt has written that the Israeli economy
has developed an ``addiction'' to the U.S. aid and that it stunts
economic growth. Israel could handle a cut, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, it would cause some shortages but in the
long run it is the right thing to do,'' says Weinblatt, dean of
humanities and social studies at Israel's Ben Gurion University.
</P>
<P>
   Other Israelis offer different reasons for cutting the aid. Some
among Israel's political right-wing see it causing a political
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a psychological dependence,'' says Israeli
member of parliament Uzi Landau. ``There is a notion that Israel
receives so much help from the United States . . . that we have to
listen and do what we are told.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing aid despite unsure public
</P>
<P>
   Among the American public, says Steven Kull, director of the
Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of
Maryland, people tend to be skeptical of aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He cites a 1999 Gallup Poll of 1,021 people, with a plus or
minus 3.5 percent margin for error, showed a plurality of more than
40 percent favoring a decrease in aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Kull says, though, that general public opinion does not
influence Washington as much as organized groups.
</P>
<P>
   And pro-Israel groups are well organized. They frequently
arrange to bring American politicians _ from Austin, Texas, Mayor
Kirk Watson to would-be President George W. Bush and Florida Sen.
Connie Mack _ on trips where they meet with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan says there's a local pressure, too, because, ``the
Jewish community has been very generous with contributions'' to
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Lasensky, research fellow at the Brookings Institution
in Washington, says support for Israel is grass-roots and
broad-based. Especially active are evangelical Christian groups who
believe Israel must be strong before Jesus Christ can return.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wednesday's peace process deadline forces the region to
confront a potential new cycle of violence between Israelis and
Palestinians, even as they negotiate possible solutions that could
lead to an end to their 52-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   With a dramatic breakthrough for peace, Lasensky says, Israel's
request for billions in new aid will likely be received well by
both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum drives these aid packages,'' Lasensky said. ``It's
still Washington's best bipartisan consensus: Aid to Israel.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Hard to get a cool haircut in hot
Texas
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I had stopped by the barbershop, mainly to catch
up on the news. Not that I didn't already know what everybody's
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's talking about the weather.
</P>
<P>
   My little hometown was made mention of on national TV for having
a record-breaking high temperature of 110 degrees this week, with
hardly any regular rain for as long as most anybody can remember.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't even have to go into the barbershop to get the news. It
was being talked on the sidewalk out front.
</P>
<P>
   The nice lady from the hardware store next door was checking
with other businesses to see if anybody else had received the phone
call that had come into the hardware store, something to the
effect:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fire emergency center. There is an out-of-control
fire dangerously close to your location. Evacuate immediately. This
is a recorded message.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a couple of the other stores in the vicinity had gotten
the same call. Then again, most had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do think we ought to do?'' she asked, understandably
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   I told her straight off what I was going to do
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get a haircut,'' I said. ``But I'd appreciate it
if you'd come get me if it looks like I need to move my car.''
</P>
<P>
   You could see smoke in the far distance to the south, but no big
surprise in that. Here lately, the pineywoods of East Texas being
the tinderbox that they are, you're likely to see smoke in most any
direction most any time.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the barbershop had received the same recorded
message. No matter. The barbers were remaining at their post, good
barbers that they are. The customers weren't evacuating either, not
wanting to lose their seniority for the next vacant barber chair.
</P>
<P>
   When my time came, Nick the barber _ my barber for the past 40
years or so _ caught me up on the news.
</P>
<P>
   A customer earlier that day had been telling about his catfish
pond turning over, such was the heat. He lost some 100 fish, he
said, and nice-size ones at that, some as much as five pounds.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been worrying about the same problem, I told Nick. Not that
I have a catfish pond.
</P>
<P>
   What I have is a goldfish pond in the back yard, brick and
cement, about four feet across and maybe a foot deep. It's home for
six or eight koi, and nice-sized ones at that, some half as big as
a man's palm.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been doing what I could for them, most days bringing home a
bag or two of ice from the convenience store, dumping it in the
fish pond to help the koi to cool off.
</P>
<P>
   None has gone belly-up yet, though for a fact, I imagine they'd
like to evacuate if they could.
</P>
<P>
   While I was getting a haircut, the phone rang. One of the
barbers picked up the receiver, said hello and then after a moment
hung up without saying anything else.
</P>
<P>
   It had been another recorded message, he said, this one advising
that it was now safe to return to your place of business or
residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder how they knew we were still here to answer the phone,''
he said. Everybody thought about that for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. When I left the barbershop, I was relieved to see my car
hadn't been burned up in the parking lot after all. Not that the
seats didn't feel like they were on fire.

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S SECURITY AGENCY NOW ALLOWED STEALTH MONITORING OF
INTERNET TRAFFIC
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Sept. 10 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ For Russian computer users, the message ``You've Got
Mail!'' might now well read, ``You've Got Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a far-reaching new law going into effect this month,
Russia's intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, or FSB,
is now allowed to snoop on all Internet traffic and eavesdrop on
cellular telephone and pager communications _ all without the
user's consent or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's flourishing Internet service providers, or ISPs, say
the government's demand that they install the eavesdropping
equipment and train intelligence officers to use it will put the
fledgling companies out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, civil rights groups say the surveillance measures,
known by their Russian acronym SORM, are yet another sign of a
return to Soviet-style political repression under current President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end to all E-mail privacy,'' said Anatoly
Levanchuk, an Internet and free-speech advocate. ``Wiretapping is
now only a click away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Draconian regulations were first issued by government decree
in 1995. At this time, they only covered wiretapping telephone
calls. SORM was updated in 1998 to include Internet technologies _
the venue where, Russian officials believe, most crime in the 21st
century will be committed. The Justice Ministry approved the
measures on July 25, effectively making them law.
</P>
<P>
   The amended directives require all Russian ISPs to equip their
networks with an FSB monitor and connect them with a high-speed
fiber-optic link to FSB headquarters. The link permits the agency
to keep an eye on electronic transmissions _ from private e-mails
to e-commerce purchases _ in real-time and in total privacy.
Failure to put in the bugging devices, which the Internet firms say
cost between US$15,000 and US$25,000, will mean the loss of the
service provider's operating license.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Rokotyan, a top official in Russia's Communications
Ministry, admits that the regulations _ the Orwellian-termed
``System of Operational and Investigative Measures'' _ give the
government access to all information transmitted via Russian ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security organs and special forces have the right, and now the
capability, to monitor private correspondence and telephone
conversations of individual citizens in the name of establishing
legal order,'' Rokotyan told Russian television in July. He
insisted, though, that SORM would be used only for ``monitoring
individual cases according to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet surveillance has come under fire in many countries,
including the United States. In 1994, U.S. lawmakers authorized the
FBI to wiretap and eavesdrop on criminals conducting or discussing
crimes over the Internet. The measure was vehemently opposed, with
only limited success, in 1998 by civil liberties groups and telecom
businesses who viewed it as a threat to both profits and personal
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates in Russia say these same issues that
aroused opposition in the United States are magnified here because
there are virtually no checks-and-balances to prevent the FSB from
using their expansive powers to cross from law enforcement into
political blackmail and commercial espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying that the FSB should not have access in the
course of a criminal investigation. There is a law that says
Internet (service) providers must render assistance in a criminal
case. But free access to the Internet gives the FSB great power
that would be easy to abuse,'' said Ina Zemskova, a lawyer with the
St. Petersburg-based Citizens' Watch, a human-rights group. ``In
our country, no one monitors the eavesdroppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the SORM regulations are fraught with
loopholes that allow the FSB to sidestep the required warrant
before conducting any electronic surveillance. That leaves
telecommunications firms in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know exactly what the FSB does in our network. We
cannot see what they are doing, when they are tapping in. We can
only trust that they are not working against our clients'
interests,'' said Mikhail Yakushev, the head of the legal
department at GlobalOne, a multinational telecommunications
company.
</P>
<P>
   About 7 million people, or 4.8 percent of Russia's 145 million
population, are connected to the Internet. That number is expected
to rise to 8 percent of the population in the next three years,
according to Avi Krel, the telecom analyst at UFG investment bank
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Although miniscule compared to the United States, this activity
has generated 2,000 Internet start-ups in the last two years. Just
over 300 businesses are licensed to provide Internet service here,
and some 20,000 Russian Websites offer search engines, chatrooms
and e-commerce outlets. Economists estimate Russia's dot-com
economy's annual turnover at around US$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Internet has offered Russians much more than
monetary gain. The information superhighway has spurred the growth
of environmental organizations, academics and a rising number of
government critics by connecting them across Russia's 11 time zones
that extend from the Pacific Ocean to the Polish border.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the most outspoken opponents of government policy
are chatroom monitors or network operators themselves. They were
among the first to sound the alarm about SORM, leaving the
traditional media in their wake as they posted up-to-the-minute
news about the progress of the proposed regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Syrov, the director of an ISP based in the northern Russian
town of Volgograd, has become one of SORM's most vocal critics.
After denying the FSB access to his Bayara-Slavia Communications
network in 1998, Syrov said he received anonymous death threats. He
said he has also fought off multiple attempts by the FSB to shut
down his business.
</P>
<P>
   An FSB spokesman contacted about the allegations raised refused
to comment for this story,
</P>
<P>
   But around the rest of the marketplace, opposition to the
regulations among ISPs has weakened as the government's
determination to institute the surveillance measures have
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   While the Communications Ministry said the vast majority of
Internet providers are complying with SORM, all but one of the six
Moscow-based ISPs contacted for this story refused to say whether
they had installed the eavesdropping equipment. The exception _
GlobalOne _ said all of its hardware and software contained the
equipment necessary for the FSB to dial in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resistance movement is as good as dead,'' said a grim
Alexander Levanchuk, the founder of www.libertarium.ru, a Russian
political Website and one of the people spearheading a legal
challenge to SORM. ``The FSB can outmuscle us, and it usually wins
these things.''

   It had been another recorded message, he said, this one advising
that it was now safe to return to your place of business or

   ``Wonder how they knew we were still here to answer the phone,''
he said. Everybody thought about that for awhile.

   P.S. When I left the barbershop, I was relieved to see my car
hadn't been burned up in the parking lot after all. Not that the
seats didn't feel like they were on fire.

   WASHINGTON _ After 88 deaths and who knows how many serious
injuries, the temptation is almost irresistible to bring the boot
of government down more heavily on the neck of Firestone and, by
extension, other tire makers and auto-related industries. But the
current environment _ perhaps best characterized as near-hysteria _
is precisely the wrong one in which to be formulating new
regulations. We need to step back and take a dispassionate look at
both the pluses and minuses of granting the federal government yet
more authority in this area.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Firestone and Ford should escape
punishment if the evidence supports civil liability or even
criminal sanctions. The government regulations that are in place
must be enforced, along with common law and statutory remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The broader question, however, is what sort of regime should be
put in place for the next safety-related problem.
</P>
<P>
   Every year 40,000 Americans die in auto-related accidents. We
could eliminate that horrific cost overnight by banning
automobiles, or requiring every car to have the safety features of
a tank, or mandating that cars be designed to travel no faster than
five miles an hour. Of course, those remedies all sound silly. We
have decided that the benefits of driving today's cars at today's
speeds outweigh the costs _ enormous though they are _ of 40,000
annual deaths.
</P>
<P>
   That utilitarian calculus is applied every day in various
contexts. Sometimes we analyze the cost-benefit tradeoffs
explicitly; other times, as in the example of auto deaths, only
implicitly. Either way, there's nothing misguided or immoral about
it.
</P>
<P>
   In the Firestone case, there are two important guideposts.
</P>
<P>
   First, will any particular proposed new rule lead to unintended,
adverse consequences? Government regulation frequently imposes
hidden and substantial costs on industry and, indirectly, on
consumers. In part, that's because bureaucrats operate with
perverse incentives. If a product is not recalled and injuries
occur, government will inevitably be blamed. If there is a recall
when there was really little threat to safety, however, the
regulators are not likely to be criticized. The likely result is
more recalls and regulations than are justified by the facts _ and
greater costs in both higher prices and lost opportunities as good
products are kept off the market.
</P>
<P>
   Second, are there more cost-effective, less intrusive means of
attaining the desired objectives? Government regulation is not the
only safeguard for consumers against corporate negligence or
corruption. The market itself provides a protection: who will now
buy Firestone products, unless they can be proved safe? The courts
provide another. Not only Firestone, but its parent company and
Ford as well, can be sued for compensatory and maybe punitive
damages. Then there are private certifying organizations, like
Consumers Union and Underwriters Laboratory, which would
undoubtedly take on a greater role if government were not involved.
</P>
<P>
   In any situation where government is tempted to step in, there
is also the deeper question of whether federal intrusion is even
authorized by the Constitution. In the Firestone case, the answer
is clearly yes. Since tires are integrally related to maintaining
the free flow of commerce among the states, Congress can pass
appropriate legislation under the Commerce Clause _ though arguably
rules emanating from an administrative agency like the National
Highway Transportation Safety Administration are a usurpation of
Congress' legislative powers. Safety regulations applied to many
other products, however, like guns and drugs, are justified only by
a tortured reading of the Commerce Clause.
</P>
<P>
   In the Firestone case, as in every other, the reflexive lurch
toward more government as the solution might satisfy our desire to
do something, but we must also consider whether the action we
contemplate will be fair and will advance our larger goals.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the current argument about sponsorship of this
year's presidential debates, too little attention has been paid to
the cramped schedule imposed by the fall calendar of televised
sports events. Nobody wants to force Americans to choose between
these valuable debates, on the one hand, and ``Monday Night
Football,'' the World Series or the Olympic Games on the other.
</P>
<P>
   To schedule around these events, as well as avoiding the final
week of the campaign, the Commission on Presidential Debates chose
four dates within a narrow two-week window in early and
mid-October. These dates were not, to be sure, necessarily set in
stone. In the past, the major party presidential candidates have
routinely played fast and loose with the original dates chosen by
the commission, as well as most other details of the debates, and
negotiated changes between themselves.
</P>
<P>
   While the motivation, timing and political wisdom of the
sweeping proposal by George W. Bush has been soundly attacked with
reason, he does have a point in trying to schedule a debate before
the Olympics start next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The country is ready for debates now. The candidates should be,
too. For months, they have been talking past each other on the
stump and at their summer conventions, sending out unchallenged
promises and claims to a public that is for the most part
inattentive.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and Election Day, the candidates will hurl a couple
of hundred million dollars or so worth of 30-second spots at each
other. This will be harder for people to escape but won't be any
more enlightening. It would be good to have the candidates engage
each other directly and starting now, rather than three weeks from
now, so the country can watch and make some judgments.
</P>
<P>
   In his curt dismissal of Bush's proposal for a debate next week,
Al Gore (along with, naturally, the commission) has pointed out
that only NBC would carry it, while all the broadcast networks have
agreed to carry the prime-time debates proposed by the commission.
Those so-called prime-time ``roadblocks'' by the broadcast
networks, supposedly reserving uniform times for the commission's
debates, may turn out, however, to be a bit less than advertised.
Major League playoff games are scheduled on NBC during two of the
commission's debates, and on Fox on the other two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the commission's venue: confrontations in
public auditoriums at colleges. These schools (like convention
cities) have posted significant sums of money for the privilege of
playing host. The commission's commitments to them, and the
elaborate arrangements required for these live public events, were
set in place well before either nominee was picked. Now that there
are nominees who are entitled to a say in the matter, it is not
easy to make adjustments _ though, when pressed in the past, the
commission always has.
</P>
<P>
   NBC doesn't have these logistical problems. It can simply light
up a studio on Tuesday night, set up a table for the vice
president, the governor and Tim Russert _ and go. As it happens,
the commission itself did promise this sort of format (minus
Russert) for one of its own debates.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBC-sponsored debate, to be sure, the national television
audience in the many, many millions would not have the benefit of
two or three thousand on-site viewers supplied by the commission,
all of whom have to be shushed into behaving themselves, including
audience plants supplied by campaign tacticians. There would be
nothing to watch or listen to but the candidates and the moderator.
</P>
<P>
   The unadorned studio setting worked (with a few extra reporters)
for John Kennedy and Richard Nixon in what remains the gold
standard for presidential debates. Why not give it a try? It might
start a trend.

   TANGIER ISLAND, Va. _ On pleasant evenings, teenaged islanders
congregate on the steps of the weathered, wooden post office and
converse in a lilting parlance that traces to their Elizabethan
forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Ofttimes the talk is of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to do'' on the mainland, explains Sandy Dise, 15,
a 10th grader whose roots run generations deep in the scant island
soil. ``And you don't have to take a boat when you want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing the young people,'' laments Mayor Dewey Crockett,
who is also assistant principal of the school, music director and
organist at Swain Memorial United Methodist Church, and the
undertaker. ``With television and VCRs and the Internet, we're not
as isolated as we once were.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the remote island has changed more in recent decades
than it did during several centuries following its discovery in
1608 by Capt. John Smith, the founder of Jamestown.
</P>
<P>
   Homes that didn't have phones until 1966 now have cable TV and
computers. As its watermen suffer dwindling crab catches and
tightening environmental regulation, the Tangier economy is turning
toward tourism. But opportunity is still limited. The population
has fallen from about 3,000 in 1900 to about 650 today.
</P>
<P>
   A precious culture is endangered, many islanders fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other place like this,'' allows 94-year-old Ruth
Wallace Clark as she drives her golf cart down King Street. Her
voice confirms the claim. Centuries of isolation have left a
linguistic cadence and some pronunciations that are closer to
Shakespearean English than to a Virginia drawl. ``Tide,'' for
example, sounds more like ``toyed'' hereabouts. The beach on the
northern end of the island is located ``up'ards''.
</P>
<P>
   Tangier sits in the Chesapeake Bay, about 18 miles from the
western banks of Virginia and about 12 miles from Maryland's
eastern shore. The island is about five miles long and less than
two miles wide. Only a fourth of the 850 acres qualify as dry land.
Its 250 or so houses are squeezed onto three ridges separated by
marshes and tidal canals called ``cuts'' and connected by several
hump-backed bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The streets are not much wider than sidewalks and most travel is
by bicycle, electric golf cart, motor scooter or on foot. There are
a few compact pick-up trucks for hauling stuff. As the dead and
living vie for scarce space, tiny lawns are filling up with
gravestones. The family names in the epitaphs are largely the same
as those in the current phone directory: Crockett, Pruitt, Parks,
Dise, Thomas, Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The first documented settlers were Joseph Crockett, his sons,
and their wives and children. They came in 1778 to farm and to herd
sheep and cattle. The founding families were fruitful, though, and
there were few acres to cultivate. So islanders soon turned to the
bounty of the bay _ fish, oysters and crabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the waters have long provided sustenance, Methodism has
been the island's spiritual rock since Joshua Thomas converted
during a trip to the mainland in 1805. The husband of one of Joseph
Crockett's granddaughters, Thomas returned with enough fire and
brimstone to ignite a religious movement that still guides
practically every aspect of island life.
</P>
<P>
   No alcoholic beverages or lottery tickets are sold legally on
Tangier. In 1998, the town council rejected Hollywood offers to
film ``Message in a Bottle'' on the island. The movie starred Paul
Newman, Kevin Costner and Robin Penn Wright but the council read
the script and rejected it because it featured scenes of sex and
beer drinking.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, worship begins with a frank and open ``Class
Meeting'' in which the congregation shares personal and communal
joys and concerns. Led by lay members, the tradition was begun by a
denominational pioneer, John Wesley, but has long since been
dropped by most Methodist churches. This hour-long session is
followed by Sunday School, and by morning and evening services.
There is another sermon and more hymns on Wednesday nights.
Islanders wear T-shirts commemorating past revival meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strong family values, but this is not utopia,''
cautions Jean Crockett, the wife of the mayor, as well as one of
the island's two nurses and an upper-grades English teacher. There
are some illegal drugs, she said, and a couple of bootleggers who
sell booze and beer.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's a good place for kids to grow up,'' said Edward
Landon, the island policeman, basketball coach and church youth
director.

   ``Crabs are scarce. That's for sure. But it's not the watermen's
doing,'' declares Kim Parks. ``And we've been accused of raping the
bay. That's plain and simple not the truth. We're just out to make
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father and his father's father and his grandfather's
father and now like his son, Parks is a Tangier waterman. He is up
at 3 a.m. and out on the bay setting crab pots hours before dawn.
Evenings find him at the shedding tanks in his crab shanty, which
sits on pilings near the end of his dock. The island economy relies
heavily on soft-shelled blue crabs _ delicacies that can fetch $2
apiece, several times the price of the hard-shelled crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   As they mature, crabs shed their shells but quickly harden new
ones. Crabs that are about to molt are called peelers _ pronounced
``pailers'' on Tangier. Watermen catch peelers and keep them in
tanks until they reach their soft-shelled stage. Then they are iced
down and shipped live. Except on the Sabbath, the tasks are
continuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a waterman has always meant long hours, hard work and
uncertain results,'' said the 44-year-old Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a thriving Chesapeake oyster industry was destroyed
by shoreline run-off and other pollutants . Now environmental
officials in Virginia and Maryland are concerned about a declining
crab population. Strict catch limits are enforced and a huge
no-crabbing zone has been established in a part of the bay near
Tangier. There is a freeze on issuing crabbing licences.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, increases in imported crab meat from Asia keep
prices down for the watermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 95 percent of our living comes from the water,'' said
Mayor Crockett. So the island economy is being squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, wives and daughters of watermen are cultivating
tourism. From April through October, two cruise ships dock daily.
The ``Chesapeake Breeze'' makes a one and a half hour trip from
Buzzards Point, near Reedville, Va. The ``Steven Thomas'' takes 45
minutes to reach the island from Crisfield, Md. About 25,000 people
visited last year _ mostly on day trips.
</P>
<P>
   Local folk have opened several seafood restaurants, a couple of
gift shops and three bed and breakfasts. After living near
Philadelphia, Wallace and Shirley Pruitt returned to open Shirley's
Bayview Inn on West Ridge in a house built by his maternal
grandfather in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother spent her whole life here and I was born in this
house,'' said Pruitt, 60. When his siblings moved away, he couldn't
bear selling it. ``This house brought me back. I couldn't see
somebody outside the family living here.''
</P>
<P>
   Business has been so brisk that he has built guest cottages in
the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists wander the narrow streets, they see wooden boxes
nailed to power poles and containing recipes for crab cakes, corn
pudding and other island specialities. They can drop in a quarter
and take one home.
</P>
<P>
   When the cruise boats dock, the visitors are greeted by several
women who conduct 15-minute tours in golf carts. Charging $3 per
rider, Gina Crockett said she gets 20 or so customers per day in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of a waterman, Crockett, 35, said she loved growing up
on Tangier and visits the mainland only once or so a month. She
believes that the close-knit community, where every neighbor keeps
a caring and attentive eye on every child, is a blessed place to
rear her three offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But she doubts that her children will stay as she has.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably want to go to college,'' said Gina Crockett.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In recent years, enrollment has ranged from about 100 to 110 at
the Combined School, which goes from kindergarten through 12th
grade. There were nine graduates in June, recalled Jean Crockett,
50, the English teacher. Three are going to college. Three joined
the navy. Two girls stayed to marry islanders. One boy ``went on
the water'' with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who leave for college won't return. ``This is not
an easy place to make a living,'' said Jean Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Landon, the 16-year-old son of the island policeman,
figures he will join the air force after graduating from the
Combined School in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Like other teens, he likes the island but admits to occasional
boredom. For fun, they swim off the docks and at the beach; go
fishing, crabbing and cruising in small skiffs with outboard
motors; play video games, watch TV and videotaped movies; and play
basketball. And they drive around and around the island on motor
scooters or in golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about it,'' said Justin Landon.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, island families keep a car on the mainland for
activities there. For better or worse, horizons are broadening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still sheltered growing up here,'' said Edward Landon.
``So it's a shock'' for the kids ``when they leave at 18 for the
mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows from experience. After military service and living off
the island for several years, he returned to raise his family.
There's not as much for teenagers to do here, he says, ``and that's
a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of small groceries on Main Ridge and an air
strip for small planes. A doctor and dentist make regular visits.
Except when the bay freezes over, a mail boat comes every day _
taking passengers at $12 apiece for a round-trip to the Maryland
shore. So a family trip to the mainland can be an expensive outing.
</P>
<P>
   There is a rhythm to island life. The crab boats leave in
pre-dawn darkness and return in late afternoon. The cruise boats
arrive in late morning and tourists abound for a few hours and then
the boats depart and the populace returns to normal levels and
activities. The mail boat docks at 1:15 p.m. and the post office
closes while the mail is sorted. At 2:30 p.m., much of the town is
gathered and chatting when the post office reopens and mail is
picked up. Then folks ride off on their bikes and golf carts.
Teenagers gather in the evenings and the policeman makes his
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Crimes are rare. Indeed, islanders can recall only four
homicides in over two centuries. The most recent was the result of
an altercation between two watermen in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But now the population temporarily swells daily with outsiders
bringing notions as well as needed dollars. A new visitor's center
is in the works, said Mayor Crockett. ``But we don't want to get
too commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, islanders would like to keep things the way they
always have been.

</P>
<P>
   Homes that didn't have phones until 1966 now have cable TV and
computers. As its watermen suffer dwindling crab catches and
tightening environmental regulation, the Tangier economy is turning
toward tourism. But opportunity is still limited. The population
has fallen from about 3,000 in 1900 to about 650 today.
</P>
<P>
   A precious culture is endangered, many islanders fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other place like this,'' allows 94-year-old Ruth
Wallace Clark as she drives her golf cart down King Street. Her
voice confirms the claim. Centuries of isolation have left a
linguistic cadence and some pronunciations that are closer to
Shakespearean English than to a Virginia drawl. ``Tide,'' for
example, sounds more like ``toyed'' hereabouts. The beach on the
northern end of the island is located ``up'ards''.
</P>
<P>
   Tangier sits in the Chesapeake Bay, about 18 miles from the
western banks of Virginia and about 12 miles from Maryland's
eastern shore. The island is about five miles long and less than
two miles wide. Only a fourth of the 850 acres qualify as dry land.
Its 250 or so houses are squeezed onto three ridges separated by
marshes and tidal canals called ``cuts'' and connected by several
hump-backed bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The streets are not much wider than sidewalks and most travel is
by bicycle, electric golf cart, motor scooter or on foot. There are
a few compact pick-up trucks for hauling stuff. As the dead and
living vie for scarce space, tiny lawns are filling up with
gravestones. The family names in the epitaphs are largely the same
as those in the current phone directory: Crockett, Pruitt, Parks,
Dise, Thomas, Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The first documented settlers were Joseph Crockett, his sons,
and their wives and children. They came in 1778 to farm and to herd
sheep and cattle. The founding families were fruitful, though, and
there were few acres to cultivate. So islanders soon turned to the
bounty of the bay _ fish, oysters and crabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the waters have long provided sustenance, Methodism has
been the island's spiritual rock since Joshua Thomas converted
during a trip to the mainland in 1805. The husband of one of Joseph
Crockett's granddaughters, Thomas returned with enough fire and
brimstone to ignite a religious movement that still guides
practically every aspect of island life.
</P>
<P>
   No alcoholic beverages or lottery tickets are sold legally on
Tangier. In 1998, the town council rejected Hollywood offers to
film ``Message in a Bottle'' on the island. The movie starred Paul
Newman, Kevin Costner and Robin Penn Wright but the council read
the script and rejected it because it featured scenes of sex and
beer drinking.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, worship begins with a frank and open ``Class
Meeting'' in which the congregation shares personal and communal
joys and concerns. Led by lay members, the tradition was begun by a
denominational pioneer, John Wesley, but has long since been
dropped by most Methodist churches. This hour-long session is
followed by Sunday School, and by morning and evening services.
There is another sermon and more hymns on Wednesday nights.
Islanders wear T-shirts commemorating past revival meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strong family values, but this is not utopia,''
cautions Jean Crockett, the wife of the mayor, as well as one of
the island's two nurses and an upper-grades English teacher. There
are some illegal drugs, she said, and a couple of bootleggers who
sell booze and beer.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's a good place for kids to grow up,'' said Edward
Landon, the island policeman, basketball coach and church youth
director.

   ``Crabs are scarce. That's for sure. But it's not the watermen's
doing,'' declares Kim Parks. ``And we've been accused of raping the
bay. That's plain and simple not the truth. We're just out to make
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father and his father's father and his grandfather's
father and now like his son, Parks is a Tangier waterman. He is up
at 3 a.m. and out on the bay setting crab pots hours before dawn.
Evenings find him at the shedding tanks in his crab shanty, which
sits on pilings near the end of his dock. The island economy relies
heavily on soft-shelled blue crabs _ delicacies that can fetch $2
apiece, several times the price of the hard-shelled crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   As they mature, crabs shed their shells but quickly harden new
ones. Crabs that are about to molt are called peelers _ pronounced
``pailers'' on Tangier. Watermen catch peelers and keep them in
tanks until they reach their soft-shelled stage. Then they are iced
down and shipped live. Except on the Sabbath, the tasks are
continuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a waterman has always meant long hours, hard work and
uncertain results,'' said the 44-year-old Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a thriving Chesapeake oyster industry was destroyed
by shoreline run-off and other pollutants . Now environmental
officials in Virginia and Maryland are concerned about a declining
crab population. Strict catch limits are enforced and a huge
no-crabbing zone has been established in a part of the bay near
Tangier. There is a freeze on issuing crabbing licences.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, increases in imported crab meat from Asia keep
prices down for the watermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 95 percent of our living comes from the water,'' said
Mayor Crockett. So the island economy is being squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, wives and daughters of watermen are cultivating
tourism. From April through October, two cruise ships dock daily.
The ``Chesapeake Breeze'' makes a one and a half hour trip from
Buzzards Point, near Reedville, Va. The ``Steven Thomas'' takes 45
minutes to reach the island from Crisfield, Md. About 25,000 people
visited last year _ mostly on day trips.
</P>
<P>
   Local folk have opened several seafood restaurants, a couple of
gift shops and three bed and breakfasts. After living near
Philadelphia, Wallace and Shirley Pruitt returned to open Shirley's
Bayview Inn on West Ridge in a house built by his maternal
grandfather in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother spent her whole life here and I was born in this
house,'' said Pruitt, 60. When his siblings moved away, he couldn't
bear selling it. ``This house brought me back. I couldn't see
somebody outside the family living here.''
</P>
<P>
   Business has been so brisk that he has built guest cottages in
the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists wander the narrow streets, they see wooden boxes
nailed to power poles and containing recipes for crab cakes, corn
pudding and other island specialities. They can drop in a quarter
and take one home.
</P>
<P>
   When the cruise boats dock, the visitors are greeted by several
women who conduct 15-minute tours in golf carts. Charging $3 per
rider, Gina Crockett said she gets 20 or so customers per day in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of a waterman, Crockett, 35, said she loved growing up
on Tangier and visits the mainland only once or so a month. She
believes that the close-knit community, where every neighbor keeps
a caring and attentive eye on every child, is a blessed place to
rear her three offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But she doubts that her children will stay as she has.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably want to go to college,'' said Gina Crockett.

<P>
   In recent years, enrollment has ranged from about 100 to 110 at
the Combined School, which goes from kindergarten through 12th
grade. There were nine graduates in June, recalled Jean Crockett,
50, the English teacher. Three are going to college. Three joined
the navy. Two girls stayed to marry islanders. One boy ``went on
the water'' with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who leave for college won't return. ``This is not
an easy place to make a living,'' said Jean Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Landon, the 16-year-old son of the island policeman,
figures he will join the air force after graduating from the
Combined School in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Like other teens, he likes the island but admits to occasional
boredom. For fun, they swim off the docks and at the beach; go
fishing, crabbing and cruising in small skiffs with outboard
motors; play video games, watch TV and videotaped movies; and play
basketball. And they drive around and around the island on motor
scooters or in golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about it,'' said Justin Landon.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, island families keep a car on the mainland for
activities there. For better or worse, horizons are broadening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still sheltered growing up here,'' said Edward Landon.
``So it's a shock'' for the kids ``when they leave at 18 for the
mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows from experience. After military service and living off
the island for several years, he returned to raise his family.
There's not as much for teenagers to do here, he says, ``and that's
a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of small groceries on Main Ridge and an air
strip for small planes. A doctor and dentist make regular visits.
Except when the bay freezes over, a mail boat comes every day _
taking passengers at $12 apiece for a round-trip to the Maryland
shore. So a family trip to the mainland can be an expensive outing.
</P>
<P>
   There is a rhythm to island life. The crab boats leave in
pre-dawn darkness and return in late afternoon. The cruise boats
arrive in late morning and tourists abound for a few hours and then
the boats depart and the populace returns to normal levels and
activities. The mail boat docks at 1:15 p.m. and the post office
closes while the mail is sorted. At 2:30 p.m., much of the town is
gathered and chatting when the post office reopens and mail is
picked up. Then folks ride off on their bikes and golf carts.
Teenagers gather in the evenings and the policeman makes his
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Crimes are rare. Indeed, islanders can recall only four
homicides in over two centuries. The most recent was the result of
an altercation between two watermen in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But now the population temporarily swells daily with outsiders
bringing notions as well as needed dollars. A new visitor's center
is in the works, said Mayor Crockett. ``But we don't want to get
too commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, islanders would like to keep things the way they
always have been.

   GAY-SPEECH (San Francisco) _ Schoolteacher Robert Downs thinks
homosexuality is immoral, so he was unhappy when his district
declared a Gay and Lesbian Awareness Month each June, and even

materials on school bulletin boards. Downs put up his own bulletin
board in a hallway near his classroom and posted pictures of a
traditional family, the text of a federal law against same-sex
marriage and the Supreme Court ruling against sodomy _ and a
biblical passage calling homosexuality ``detestable.'' The
principal ordered him to stop, saying he was violating not only the
district's policy but also its curriculum that promoted tolerance

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Landmark birthdays add up
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my son turned nine this summer, it did not seem, at first
blush, like a landmark birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But one night, when he was shooting baskets on a Fisher-Price
hoop hiked to the highest notch, it struck me:
</P>
<P>
   He's halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway between crib and college.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway between Mom and Dad Are the Center of the Universe and
Mom and Dad Are a Pimple on my Social Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway between ``I love you past Pluto'' and ``Give me my
space.''
</P>
<P>
   It also strikes me that I don't want him to be halfway there.
I'd like him to stick around the house for another 20 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   This is why God created adolescence, or so the theory goes, to
make that inevitable separation less painful.
</P>
<P>
   And for many parents, that's the way it works. Some parents
count the days until their children move out of the house and into
their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   For others, the empty nest feels only ... empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bittersweet,'' said our neighbor Jerry Shultz, whose
second-eldest, Addie, our babysitter and honorary daughter, is
entering Wright State University next week. ``It seems as if I
should still be carrying her on my shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Shultz was 36 and ``completely undomesticated'' when he married,
only to become, in short order, the primary caretaker of four
children. ``They're my whole life now,'' Shultz marvels. ``I don't
know what I'd do without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he has been wondering what he'll do without Addie, who
graduated in June as valedictorian at Colonel White High School:
``She laughs at my jokes.'' He wonders what happened to the
4-year-old who begged to enter preschool and ``who soaked
everything up like a sponge.''
</P>
<P>
   Catch Roberta Longfellow on a good day, and she won't get the
least bit weepy about the fact that her daughter, Jessica Larson,
started Miami University this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the weekend after she dropped Jessie off in Oxford,
Longfellow confesses, ``I cried at the drop of a hat. Riding home
without her, I was sobbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Longfellow and her husband, David Larson, had raised Jessie, who
graduated as co-valedictorian at Stivers High School, to be a
``strong, independent female, able to make good decisions about her
life and to feel confident in her abilities,'' she said. ``Our
basic feeling is that we've done our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Longfellow will keep plenty busy with church, work, and raising
son Christian, a ninth-grader at Stivers. ``But I just miss her.
There's a big empty spot in our household. I hear cars driving down
our street, and I think it's Jessie coming home. Meals together are
important to us, and it's still very obvious she's missing.''
</P>
<P>
   As we rush our children out the door in the morning, we're
tempted to want to to rush them into young adulthood and
independence. What bliss to throw out the Rolodex file of
babysitters, to be able to watch a play without watching the clock.
What bliss, not to tell the tardy monitor why you're running late
this time.
</P>
<P>
   We find ourselves wishing our children were older, more
independent, without realizing that every day wished away brings us
closer to that inevitable day when they leave home.
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, we're halfway there.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Globetrotting has a lot going for it
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since becoming a reluctant but seasoned tourist, I'm often
called on to advise friends, and even a few strangers, on the ins
and outs of international travel.
</P>
<P>
   One question I get is, ``How much will it cost?'' Since airlines
cut out food and started packing people like sardines in
wide-bodied jets, you can visit London and Paris for less than
you'd spend in a day at Six Flags or a night watching the Braves in
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who has never met a destination she didn't like, is
always finding bargain trips she can't afford to pass up. I'm
hard-pressed to argue. Two weeks halfway around the world can
actually be cheaper than staying home. If we're stuck on a
riverboat on the Nile, she can't go shopping at Lenox or Phipps, or
have her hair done at a pricey salon in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't buy a lot of souvenirs, you can see a large part of
the world on a single Social Security check. Even souvenirs aren't
overly expensive unless you are married to a spouse who thinks you
can fit a large rug into an overhead bin that filled up 15 minutes
before your boarding call. In every country we've visited we've
found a good supply of reasonably priced native items made in
China.
</P>
<P>
   We meet interesting people. During a routine three-hour delay at
Kennedy Airport in New York when we were headed for China I got
into a conversation with a security officer from the Bronx. ``You
won't have a language problem in China,'' he informed me. ``They
all speak English over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact,'' he said, ``everybody in the world
speaks English, because that's what God speaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing of anyone, including Billy Graham, who has had a
face-to-face conversation with God in recent times, I asked the
officer how he knew that English is God's chosen language.
</P>
<P>
   ``If God doesn't speak English,'' he answered, ``why did he
write the Bible in English?''
</P>
<P>
   While we were floating down the Yangtze River the tour guide
explained details of the big dam the Chinese are building. When he
told us the water level would rise something like 200 feet behind
the dam, a gentleman from New Jersey raised his hand. ``How much
will it rise in front of the dam?'' he asked. (How did we lose the
war?)
</P>
<P>
   One of my biggest challenges in international travel is trying
to persuade my wife not to stuff enough into her suitcase to stock
the third floor at Rich's. She has left a trail of ruptured
bellhops and porters all over Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   With the quality of deodorants on the market today, I don't see
any need to carry more than a couple of changes. But I never win
that battle, despite a chronically strained back that requires
regular chiropractic adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   My job is lift, tote and fetch. Find the ice machine, watch the
bags while she goes to the restroom, find whatever plug she needs
to work the hair dryer, carry the souvenirs she takes home to store
in the attic, make Persian rugs fit into overhead bins on
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Except for all that, she says, I'd be welcome to stay home and
look after my garden. The only good news I have to pass on in this
area is a rumor that the Teamsters Union is seriously considering a
drive to organize elderly male tourists with chronically strained
backs.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning an overseas trip with a tour group, I advise
practicing dinner converstion before departure. For example, if you
are talking with table companions about London, and you have been
there only once, be sure to say: ``The last time we were in London
....'' Or, ``The first time we were in London ....''
</P>
<P>
   If you've been to Paris only two times, say: ``We've only been
to Paris twice.'' Be careful to emphasize ``only,'' as if you've
been everywhere else in the world 10 or 12 times. By carefully
phrasing, you can be truthful and still pass yourself off as a
prolific world traveler, even if your only previous trip was a
two-night cruise to Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   A few simple preparations make international travel more
enjoyable. I advise losing at least 10 pounds before leaving home;
otherwise you won't be able to squeeze into the child-size airplane
seat for the trip home. Enroll in a weightlifting program designed
to strengthen back muscles.

   Either buy more deodorant or get a bigger suitcase. Practice
water discipline in case you get caught on a bus with a 26-year-old
tour director who never needs a pit stop. Caution yourself not to
order wine with a screw cap when you're in France. Unless you don't
mind people thinking you're from either Newark or Cleveland, don't
wear black wing-tip shoes with white socks and chartreuse walking
shorts.

   Despite obvious hazards, international travel has advantages.
You don't have to trim shrubbery or carry out garbage, and it's a
great way to avoid estate taxes.

   END OF LIFE SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, the Dayton Daily News begins a five-part
series called ``Letting Go: Choices at the end of life.'' It's all
about end-of-life issues, from hospice care to talking to doctors
and families, support groups and health industry issues.
</P>
<P>
   The series is running in conjunction with a PBS Series by Bill
Moyers called ``On Our Terms'' that is running in most markets from
Sunday, Sept. 10 through Wednesday Sept. 13, but the stories can
stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   The stories will be available via the Budget Tool with a run
date that corresponds to the day the story is moving.
</P>
<P>
   Elements from the series will be used for the CoxNet HEALTHY
LIVING page for Tuesday, Sept, 19. That page will be available on
Friday, Sept. 15 at 2 p.m.

But Gross declined to be treated or even tested for metastatic
disease. He felt the time had come to leave this life gracefully,

expectancies, they both mislead patients and families and disable
the hospice concept. It's generally agreed that doctors need more
training in end-of life care, particularly the pain-relief and
psychological aspects, but aside from that, there is an honest
dispute as to where doctors belong on the spectrum from defying
death to embracing hospice care. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) 50

   END-MONEYSTRAIN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Doctors didn't discover Sandra
Lee Hughes' lung cancer until the disease had reached her brain and
paralyzed her legs. At 43, and with two young daughters in her
care, Hughes suddenly had no job and no family support system at a
time when she was facing a terminal disease. She called on her
estranged husband, an unemployed Fairborn resident from whom she
had been separated for six years. He moved her from Alabama to his
home in Fairborn, where family members, including Hughes'
14-year-old daughter, Jennifer, took turns caring for her in a
tiny, ramshackle house. For hours at a time, Jennifer found herself
alone with her mother and, at times, no food to eat. A family
doctor recommended Hospice of Dayton, and soon the agency's home
health aides were there not only to care for Hughes but to make
sure there was enough medical supplies and food in the home.
Hospice never charged the family a penny, but the agency must rely
on donations from the community to help families like Sandra's.
Once she saw that her daughters would be taken care of, Hughes
decided to let go, calling out to Jennifer one night to say
``goodbye.'' (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News) 25 inches

happened to him in Vietnam, and that he looks forward to ``meeting
the Lord.'' And he's also grateful to the hospice and palliative
care program at the Dayton VA, which has provided his end-of-life
care free of charge. The VA here wants to get the word out: it

   CHILDREN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION EDITORS: Atlanta Journal Constitution reporter John
Blake has interviewed several men and women about growing up in the
1950s and '60s as children of the civil rights movement. The people
at the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous, lives.
So, too, did their kids. The children of the movement _ the
offspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even
segregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many
roads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'
work. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled
nine of them.
</P>
<P>
   The story is embargoed until Sunday, Sept. 10, but will move by
Friday evening. PHOTOS have moved to NYT.

   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a
typical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police
shootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was
constantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the
neighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black
Panther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about
growing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where
students read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this
swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a
child it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about
growing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights
movement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,
often dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of
the movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The
Children of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.
Some continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to
forget their childhood. Here are the stories of eight of them.

   GLOBAL-WARMING _ Arctic sea ice has thinned by 40 percent in the
last 30 years. This summer, there was open water at the North Pole.
From the Andes to the Alps, mountain glaciers are retreating. And
across North America, from the fire-scorched West to the
drought-parched Southeast, the last year of the millenium has given
millions a summer of discontent. As the signs of a warmer world
grow more apparent, there are some nagging new questions about ways
to prevent it. A new analysis by NASA physicist James Hansen, one
of the first scientists to sound the alarm over global warming 20
years ago, suggests that industrialized nations struggling to
implement a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions called for under
the proposed 1997 Kyoto Protocol, may be pursuing the wrong
villains in the global greenhouse mystery. (Toner, Atlanta

crossed the sea of indulgence, they said. No way, I replied. Weigh,
they said. Weigh before you go. Weigh after you come back. You'll
be five pounds heavier. And I thought you were supposed to leave
your cares behind on a cruise. Would this be the diary of a
disaster at sea? (AMiller, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

   END OF LIFE SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, the Dayton Daily News begins a five-part
series called ``Letting Go: Choices at the end of life.'' It's all
about end-of-life issues, from hospice care to talking to doctors
and families, support groups and health industry issues.
</P>
<P>
   The series is running in conjunction with a PBS Series by Bill
Moyers called ``On Our Terms'' that is running in most markets from
Sunday, Sept. 10 through Wednesday Sept. 13, but the stories can
stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   The stories will be available via the Budget Tool with a run
date that corresponds to the day the story is moving.
</P>
<P>
   Elements from the series will be used for the CoxNet HEALTHY
LIVING page for Tuesday, Sept, 19. That page will be available on
Friday, Sept. 15 at 2 p.m.

But Gross declined to be treated or even tested for metastatic

death, not cooperate with it. The result is that they're at

expectancies, they both mislead patients and families and disable
the hospice concept. It's generally agreed that doctors need more
training in end-of life care, particularly the pain-relief and
psychological aspects, but aside from that, there is an honest
dispute as to where doctors belong on the spectrum from defying
death to embracing hospice care. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) 50

   END-MONEYSTRAIN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Doctors didn't discover Sandra
Lee Hughes' lung cancer until the disease had reached her brain and
paralyzed her legs. At 43, and with two young daughters in her
care, Hughes suddenly had no job and no family support system at a
time when she was facing a terminal disease. She called on her
estranged husband, an unemployed Fairborn resident from whom she
had been separated for six years. He moved her from Alabama to his
home in Fairborn, where family members, including Hughes'
14-year-old daughter, Jennifer, took turns caring for her in a
tiny, ramshackle house. For hours at a time, Jennifer found herself
alone with her mother and, at times, no food to eat. A family
doctor recommended Hospice of Dayton, and soon the agency's home
health aides were there not only to care for Hughes but to make
sure there was enough medical supplies and food in the home.
Hospice never charged the family a penny, but the agency must rely
on donations from the community to help families like Sandra's.
Once she saw that her daughters would be taken care of, Hughes
decided to let go, calling out to Jennifer one night to say
``goodbye.'' (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News) 25 inches

stages of that disease. He says he's no longer bitter about what
happened to him in Vietnam, and that he looks forward to ``meeting
the Lord.'' And he's also grateful to the hospice and palliative
care program at the Dayton VA, which has provided his end-of-life
care free of charge. The VA here wants to get the word out: it

   CHILDREN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION EDITORS: Atlanta Journal Constitution reporter John
Blake has interviewed several men and women about growing up in the
1950s and '60s as children of the civil rights movement. The people
at the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous, lives.
So, too, did their kids. The children of the movement _ the
offspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even
segregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many
roads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'
work. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled
nine of them.

   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a
typical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police
shootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was
constantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the
neighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black
Panther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about
growing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where
students read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this
swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a
child it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about
growing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights
movement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,
often dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of
the movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The
Children of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.
Some continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to
forget their childhood. Here are the stories of eight of them.

10-YEAR-OLD MACS AND OTHER ANTIQUES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have been using a Macintosh SE/30 for the
past 10 years. My wife uses a PC with Windows 95. There are
important documents I would like to transfer to her PC. You
recently suggested inserting a PC floppy into the Mac to copy the
files. I get two choices when I try: eject or initialize.
</P>
<P>
   _ MacStuck
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MACSTUCK: You know, you might be able to sell a Mac that
old to an Apple collector and make enough to buy a new one. Anybody
want to buy my IIe? I could use some cash, too.
</P>
<P>
   The original SEs _ tiny little Macs with tiny little monitors _
had 800-megabyte floppy drives. If that's what you've got, forget
about flipping floppies with a PC: the hardware just won't do the
job. The SE/30s were supposed to come with Apple's Superdrive,
which could read 1.44-megabyte Mac and PC disks as well as the
older Mac floppies. If you didn't get the Superdrive, you should
take your Mac right back to the store and get your money back.
That's assuming your time machine is still in working order.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your system files are too old to fully support the
Superdrive's capabilities. There's one other trick you might try,
though. Assuming you really are using high-density, 1.44MB disks on
the SE, you can get software that will let your PC read them. Just
go to some shareware site like www.hotfiles.com and search for
``Mac disk.''
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there any way I can have moving icons on my
desktop?
</P>
<P>
   _ Poetry in Motion
</P>
<P>
   DEAR POETRY: Yes. Drink heavily before using your computer.
You'd be surprised how much those little icons can move around.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I want to put my old PC up for sale. Microsoft
Word 97 shows my name as the licensee in the opening window. How
can I delete or change that? Also, is my name somewhere in Windows
95, and can I delete it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ANON: The Microsoft Office products are tricky. When first
installed, they stash your name deep in the Windows Registry in
hexadecimal code, the language of geeks. Even if you find the right
Registry key, you have to figure out how to spell the name in hex,
plus leave a null character after each letter. More trouble than
it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you uninstall the program, the Registry key doesn't
always get deleted, and your name still winds up on the program
after reinstalling. Try this: After uninstalling, run Regedit, the
Registry editor. Look for a folder called ``Office,'' which is
probably in
HKEY(underscore)CURRENT(underscore)USER/Software/Microsoft, and
delete it. Now reinstall Word with the new name.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to strip your name from Win95. While in Regedit, do
a search (Control-F) for your name, then edit any key where it
shows up.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am greatly relieved to finally discover
through your sleuthing and insightful reporting that the first 23
years of my life were indeed a myth, and that the state of ``Ohio''
is just an urban legend. I am heartened that I did not grow up in
``the mistake on the lake'' and that Crosby, Stills and Nash sang
about ``four dead'' in ``Idaho.'' Many thanks for placing my mind
at ease.

IS BUSH FEELING HEAT FROM GORE?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looked bad, I know. Just as George W. Bush's double-digit
leads in the public-opinion polls were going up in smoke, I went on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Was I bailing out on my presidential candidate? Was I struck
speechless by Al Gore's sudden surge? Was I searching the planet
for some island paradise where the natives never heard of the
Gallup Poll?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above, actually.
</P>
<P>
   My visit to the sidelines at a moment when the quadrennial
political game was finally getting itself cranked up was prompted
not by the Gore heat _ as a Democratic friend suggested _ but by
the suffocating heat wave that parched the Lone Star landscape and
turned summer-sensitive Texans into withering idiots.
</P>
<P>
   Having made it almost to the end of August without indulging
myself in a column that whined about the heat, I decided to lay low
until the moderating breezes of September worked their magic on the
summer of 2000. Imagine my dismay when the second-to-last day of my
vacation _ Labor Day, Sept. 4 _ delivered a brain-scorching
temperature of 111 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   I probably deserved it, to be perfectly honest. I'd spent the
previous few weeks bragging about how well I'd withstood my 14th
Texas summer, rarely complaining out loud and never once calling a
travel agent to inquire about airfares to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Which just goes to show: You don't want to get smug about
surviving a Texas summer until, oh, Thanksgiving or thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Overconfidence can be hazardous to your health.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Bush, Gore and the 2000 presidential
race that appears to be so close that most polls put the candidates
within a few percentage points of each other _ within the margin of
error, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   Most pundits _ and the candidates, for that matter _ had
cautioned all along that the race would tighten by Labor Day and
that summer polls showing Bush with a comfortable lead should be
viewed with considerable skepticism. Still, it was tempting for
Bush-backers to imagine their guy cruising to victory and maybe
even racking up landslide-like vote totals on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   It could still happen, of course. The Gore turnaround was so
abrupt, so startling; it seems reasonable to wonder if it's real.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's new-found momentum was produced in large part by a
51-minute speech and a three-second kiss at the Democratic National
Convention. Couldn't it ebb just as quickly?
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not the sort of candidate who is prone to
self-destruction, however. Bush must find a way to regain the
initiative. And he is entirely capable of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats _ and certain Republicans, come to think of it _ seem
to be laboring under the impression that Bush is a one-dimensional
front-runner who can't handle adversity. Have they already
forgotten his spectacular comeback in the Republican primaries
after early losses to John McCain?
</P>
<P>
   Have they forgotten _ or maybe they never knew _ about his 1994
underdog campaign for governor of Texas? Bush trailed the
incumbent, Ann Richards, from the beginning until darn near the end
of that race, but he won the election by a comfortable margin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can come from behind if he has to; he doesn't need the lead
to run his race.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Bush-haters who e-mails me incessantly compared this
presidential campaign to a horse race in which the front-runner
runs too fast, too early, and finds himself outfinished at the
wire.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But as aficionados of the sport of kings can tell
you, a resourceful thoroughbred can surrender the lead briefly,
then surge back to the front and win going away.
</P>
<P>
   A pollster friend of mine warned me to ignore those summer polls
showing Bush in front by daylight _ and he's warning me now to
ignore the polls showing Bush behind. The best bet at this stage of
the race: The polls will fluctuate wildly, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Bush will win. He's the best candidate. He
has the best vision for the nation's future. The voters are smart
enough to figure it out.

 &HT;    AOL MERGER SCRUTINY HERALDS A NEW APPROACH TO ANTITRUST
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 17.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This month, antitrust regulators in the United
States and Europe are grilling executives of Time Warner Inc. and
America Online Inc. about their proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   But the trust-busters' aggressive stance has left merger
supporters scratching their heads. They point out that AOL, an
online service provider, and Time Warner, a media company, aren't
even in the same business.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my view, I don't think there are any regulatory issues,''
Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin said at a conference last month.
``There are no business overlaps'' between the companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that regulators now routinely approve huge mergers among
nearly identical companies, such as Exxon and Mobil, why pick on
two corporations that operate in different industries?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this isn't a classic antitrust case _ it's really a
New Economy issue,'' said Bill Whyman, president of The Precursor
Group Inc., a Washington-based firm that does research on Internet
companies and strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and other merger opponents say that if
governments sit back now, large companies will rush forward to
seize control of both the Internet's content _ news, sports, music,
movies and the like _ and the means to deliver it, such as cable
wires.
</P>
<P>
   Their nightmare scenario: a decade from now, one or two global
behemoths will own the wires entering people's homes and use them
to shove proprietary content down consumers' throats at high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   It is these fears that have led regulators to focus on
preventing the ``leveraging'' of technologies that could inhibit
competition on the Internet, Whyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the European Commission, the regulatory body that
sets antitrust policy for 15 countries, took up the fight against
techno-leveraging when it summoned executives from AOL and Time
Warner to Brussels for closed-door hearings.
</P>
<P>
   A confidential report, written by the commission and leaked to
several U.S. reporters, was brutal in its assessment of the merger,
saying the companies would combine their strengths to harm
competition in the business of selling movies and music via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, that business does not exist on any significant
scale.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the commission is of the opinion that there is an emerging
market'' for selling movies and music digitally, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the commissioners believe that soon, consumers
won't go to video-rental stores to obtain movies, they will
``download'' them directly into their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner's vast array of video and film properties (e.g.,
CNN and Warner Bros. Film library) are ideally suited for
distribution via high-speed Internet connections.'' As a combined
company, AOL Time Warner ``could leverage Time Warner broadband
content ... to dominate the emerging high-speed Internet access
market in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Leverage, in this context, means the merged companies could
their technological advantages _ AOL's online service and Time

 &HT;    AOL MERGER SCRUTINY HERALDS A NEW APPROACH TO ANTITRUST
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 17.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This month, antitrust regulators in the United
States and Europe are grilling executives of Time Warner Inc. and
America Online Inc. about their proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   But the trust-busters' aggressive stance has left merger
supporters scratching their heads. They point out that AOL, an
online service provider, and Time Warner, a media company, aren't
even in the same business.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my view, I don't think there are any regulatory issues,''
Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin said at a conference last month.
``There are no business overlaps'' between the companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that regulators now routinely approve huge mergers among
nearly identical companies, such as Exxon and Mobil, why pick on
two corporations that operate in different industries?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this isn't a classic antitrust case _ it's really a
New Economy issue,'' said Bill Whyman, president of The Precursor
Group Inc., a Washington-based firm that does research on Internet
companies and strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and other merger opponents say that if
governments sit back now, large companies will rush forward to
seize control of both the Internet's content _ news, sports, music,
movies and the like _ and the means to deliver it, such as cable
wires.
</P>
<P>
   Their nightmare scenario: a decade from now, one or two global
behemoths will own the wires entering people's homes and use them
to shove proprietary content down consumers' throats at high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   It is these fears that have led regulators to focus on
preventing the ``leveraging'' of technologies that could inhibit
competition on the Internet, Whyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the European Commission, the regulatory body that
sets antitrust policy for 15 countries, took up the fight against
techno-leveraging when it summoned executives from AOL and Time
Warner to Brussels for closed-door hearings.
</P>
<P>
   A confidential report, written by the commission and leaked to
several U.S. reporters, was brutal in its assessment of the merger,
saying the companies would combine their strengths to harm
competition in the business of selling movies and music via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, that business does not exist on any significant
scale.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the commission is of the opinion that there is an emerging
market'' for selling movies and music digitally, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the commissioners believe that soon, consumers
won't go to video-rental stores to obtain movies, they will
``download'' them directly into their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner's vast array of video and film properties (e.g.,
CNN and Warner Bros. Film library) are ideally suited for
distribution via high-speed Internet connections.'' As a combined
company, AOL Time Warner ``could leverage Time Warner broadband
content ... to dominate the emerging high-speed Internet access
market in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Leverage, in this context, means the merged companies could
their technological advantages _ AOL's online service and Time
Warner's content _ to lift itself into a monopolistic position on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fair for regulators to engage in prophylactic
trust-busting in industries not yet launched?
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Levin suggested it wasn't, but consumer groups
applaud the idea of preventing possible monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulators' position is appropriate,'' said David Butler,
a Consumers Union spokesman in Washington. The new approach is

&HT;     `DR. LAURA' TO GO ON THE AIR AMID PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Conservative radio host Laura Schlessinger makes
her television debut Monday in what easily could prove a test of
the premise that there is no such thing as bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Groups opposed to the sharp-tongued, conservative counselor's
anti-gay rhetoric have been pressuring advertisers not to sponsor
the program, which is being distributed by Paramount Television,
and urging viewers to boycott the program.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount has declined to divulge its corporate sponsors.
Several, including heavyweights Procter &AMP; Gamble, Sears and
American Express, have pulled out in a glare of unwanted consumer
pressure pumped up by the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   Other advertisers reportedly dropped Schlessinger's hugely
popular radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the protest against the TV program is Stopdrlaura.com
(www.stopdrlaura.com). The site was started after the San
Francisco-based Horizons Foundation, which gives money to gay
causes, and allies launched a campaign to get Schlessinger to
moderate what she tells her 18 million listeners about
homosexuality and to try to press Paramount, TV stations and
corporate advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dr. Laura phenomenon is a milestone in terms of
publicizing disapproval of anti-gay bigotry,'' said Peter Teague,
executive director of the Horizons Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity has not stopped the show from being snapped up by
stations covering almost 98 percent of U.S. viewers, according to
Daniella Cracknell, the publicist for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are CBS affiliate KPIX-TV in San Francisco. Teague
and others plan to protest outside the station's studios on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to let KPIX know we are still really angry they
decided to run this show,'' said Ryan Clary, a protest organizer.
``We don't think they had to do it. We want to let them know we
intend to monitor the show.''
</P>
<P>
   KPIX station manager Jerry Eaton said he might not have chosen
the show if he had known beforehand about some of Schlessinger's
anti-gay comments.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger, 53, has called homosexuals ``biological errors''
and homosexuality a ``deviant sexual orientation,'' spoken
favorably of counseling that purports to ``cure'' gayness, and
inveighed against child-rearing and marriage by homosexuals and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Since her move into the TV realm has stirred up so much
controversy, Schlessinger has defended her views as moral
statements of her beliefs as a convert to Orthodox Judaism and said
she never intended to hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is not anti-gay or a bigot, and that opposing equal
status for homosexuals is not homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount has assured its critics that Schlessinger's show will
feature people of all viewpoints on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco protest is one of more than two dozen
scheduled to take place around the country over the weekend and
Monday. The biggest is expected to be Monday outside the Paramount
studios in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Mintz, the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in San Francisco,
said she would be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to speak out as a Jew and to say as a rabbi that she
doesn't represent what all Jews think about homosexuality,'' Mintz
said. ``It's not all right to be homophobic, and it's not all right
for corporate sponsors to put their money into something that's
homophobic. We are asking people to pull their sponsorship and
Paramount not to sponsor the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount has not released tapes of the show in advance, but
press materials show the first week's topics will cover classic Dr.
Laura ground: teens and drugs, affairs, working mothers,
pornography.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A bolt of lightning packs a powerful wallop. It
can explode brick and concrete and surge through electrical
systems, damaging computer equipment, communication lines and
robotics. It can cause a fire in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning causes billions of dollars in property damage each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning strikes somewhere on Earth every second, according to
the Lightning Protection Institute in Arlington Heights, Ill.
Although lightning is unpredictable, it can and does strike the
same place twice. It hits the Empire State Building at least 25
times a year.
</P>
<P>
   State-of-the-art lightning protection systems can help protect
lives and property.
</P>
<P>
   A lightning protection system is designed to control or redirect
a lightning strike on a specified path. Instead of attracting or
preventing a strike, it provides a path for the electrical current
to travel to the ground safely, and without returning up.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the size and construction of your home, lightning
protection installation costs approximately $1,200 to $6,000 or
more. A job may take one to two days.
</P>
<P>
   Systems should be installed by a lightning protection specialist
approved by the Lightning Protection Institute and Underwriters
Laboratories. Be sure to get a Master Label from your installer to
prove that the job meets code requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a one-time job,'' said Dennis Crowley, owner of
Crowley Lightning Protection in Auburn, N.Y. Air terminals (the
industry term for lightning rods) should be placed less than 20
feet apart and should be installed on the roof, chimneys and vents.
They should also be on dormers if they are not protected by a
higher ridge on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Cooper, owner of Associated Lightning Rod Co., in Millerton,
N.Y., said that the installation is also bonded to metallic objects
such as oil and gas lines, heating ducts, electric, water pipes,
steel I-beams in the basement, gutters and antennae.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have your lightning protection system inspected
every five years, especially if you've had any work done on the
house,'' Cooper said. ``The inspection service is usually free.''

   These fears have led regulators to focus on preventing the
``leveraging'' of technologies that could inhibit competition on
the Internet, Whyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the European Commission, the regulatory body that
sets antitrust policy for 15 countries, took up the fight against
techno-leveraging when it summoned executives from AOL and Time
Warner to Brussels for closed-door hearings.
</P>
<P>
   A confidential report, written by the commission and leaked to
several U.S. reporters, was brutal in its assessment of the merger,
saying the companies would combine their strengths to harm
competition in the business of selling movies and music via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, that business does not exist on any significant
scale.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the commission is of the opinion that there is an emerging
market'' for selling movies and music digitally, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the commissioners believe that soon, consumers
won't go to video-rental stores to obtain movies, they will
``download'' them directly into their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner's vast array of video and film properties (e.g.,
CNN and Warner Bros. Film library) are ideally suited for
distribution via high-speed Internet connections.'' As a combined
company, AOL Time Warner ``could leverage Time Warner broadband
content ... to dominate the emerging high-speed Internet access
market in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Leverage, in this context, means the merged companies could
their technological advantages _ AOL's online service and Time
Warner's content _ to lift itself into a monopolistic position on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fair for regulators to engage in prophylactic
trust-busting in industries not yet launched?
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Levin suggested it wasn't, but consumer groups
applaud the idea of preventing possible monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulators' position is appropriate,'' said David Butler,
a Consumers Union spokesman in Washington. The new approach is
necessary because ``new ground is being plowed here that may very
well result in consumers receiving fewer choices and potentially
higher prices.''
</P>
<P>
   This preventive trust-busting is very different from the
traditional ways of regulating against monopolies: measuring market
share in an existing industry and discouraging companies from
growing ``horizontally'' by absorbing similar businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the classic antitrust case, Producer A has 20 percent of
the market and Producer B has 30 percent, and the regulators don't
want them to merge to get 50 percent,'' Whyman said.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL Time Warner deal does not fit that pattern. AOL provides
online services for about 24 million subscribers. Time Warner owns
cable TV systems, film companies, record companies, magazines,
Turner Broadcasting and many other media operations.
</P>
<P>
   If AOL were stretching horizontally, it would be buying another
Internet service provider, such as EarthLink Inc. But by joining
with Time Warner, it is creating a new kind of conglomerate. Levin
calls it ``the first Internet-powered media-communications company
of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups call it scary. They want the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to
impose ``safeguards'' on it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Media
Education, a nonprofit group, said regulators should insist that
AOL Time Warner offer its cable customers an unlimited number
choices among Internet service providers, provide a full array of
content without bias for its own material, and end all joint
ventures with AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest cable operator, to
ensure tough competition.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced Jan. 10, executives of AOL and Time
Warner have been saying they will operate an ``open'' system that
allows competition, but consumer advocates say such assurances are
worthless without an enforceable consent decree that spells out the
three safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   European regulators are expected to issue their ruling in early
October, while U.S. regulators are not expected to rule until
November.

&HT;     GROUP TO REVIVE CANCELED SELENA MUSICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ ``Selena Forever,'' the Broadway-style musical
whose national tour was canceled in May for financial difficulties,
is coming back to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Producers say the musical will relaunch Nov. 15 at the Doolittle
Theater in Los Angeles for a six-week run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all excited about this because we really believe in this
project,'' said Robert Trevino, one of the producers and vice
president of Promotional Management Group, which is handling
publicity and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play tells a story that is really American. It is
wholesome, good, and it shows that hard work pays off,'' said Joe
Bradberry, chairman of the Coliseum Advisory Board. ```Selena' the
musical shows that someone who has a dream and follows that dream
can excel and achieve great things in life and can have a
tremendous influence on other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Quinn, one of the founding producers of the musical, also is
part of the new team that's relaunching the play.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Ricardo Montalban's Nosotros Foundation has
closed on the purchase of the historic Doolittle Theater, a complex
that foundation board Chairman Jerry Velasco valued at $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning a grand opening gala in conjunction with the
new `Selena' musical opening, which will help raise funds for the
foundation,'' Velasco said.
</P>
<P>
   Producers said they hope to take the play to Las Vegas, San
Diego and other cities after the six-week Los Angeles run.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino said most of the cast, including Veronica Vazquez from
New York, who played the adult Selena; Danny Valdez, who played
Abraham; and Liza Ybarra from San Antonio, who played Suzette, are
returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're negotiating with several of the other cast members and
we'll make an announcement on that soon,'' Trevino said.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which was developed and premiered at the San Antonio
Municipal Auditorium in March, toured Chicago and the Texas cities
of Corpus Christi, Dallas, El Paso and Houston before being
canceled in early May in Los Angeles. Universal Amphitheater
officials blamed sluggish ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Producers then canceled subsequent tour dates, citing financial
setbacks as a result of the lost revenue.

WILLIAMS SISTERS CHANGE THE PACE OF TENNIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Williams, one daughter down and the other
facing Martina Hingis, sat on the top bench of a set of aluminum
bleachers next to a US Open practice court and uttered a tennis
truism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play at the same level you were at before against
the Williams sisters,'' he said. ``It's not good enough to win. I
think Lindsay (Davenport) definitely changed her level.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport stepped it up to bump last year's champion, Serena
Williams, from the tournament Wednesday night. Serena's big sister,
Venus, plays Hingis in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, Richard Williams does not make himself the most
popular man in tennis with his predictions and proclamations
concerning his talented daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up a sign stating, ``It's Venus' party and no one was
invited,'' during her triumphant Wimbledon final didn't go over
that well. Neither does the talk of all-Williams finals. Nor did
the talk years ago of Venus and Serena _ or would it be Serena and
Venus? _ becoming Nos. 1 and 2 in the land well before they had
done much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have done plenty.
</P>
<P>
   And no one would argue that the sisters and their powerful,
court-covering games have done just what their proud papa and
confident coach says: They have changed the way women's tennis is
played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they raised the bar,'' said CBS analyst Mary Carillo.
``Athletically, they are such a physical presence on the court. In
order to combat that, you've got to get yourself fitter or try to
grow taller, which is hard to do. Or just understand how to break
down their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Carillo is far from alone in her assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Williamses are, especially in women's tennis, the
first players that are that aggressive, hit the ball hard, and are
such great movers,'' Davenport said. ``Everyone who is a big
hitter, like Mary (Pierce), myself, Monica, none of us can move
nearly as well as the Williamses.''
</P>
<P>
   So all have had to adjust their games. Martina Hingis is the No.
1 ranked player in the world, but she has not won a Grand Slam
event in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   She has to get past Venus Williams _ who took her out in three
sets in a Wimbledon quarterfinal _ to get a chance at a second US
Open title Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The power and aggressiveness of the Williams women have hurried
and harried their rivals, Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it was like everything was a little slower,'' Hingis
said. ``You had more time to prepare the shots, just mix it up
more, do this or that, slow it down, make it faster. Now you have
to hit every ball, you know, pretty hard as you can, and also in
practice you just always have to be aggressive. No more time to
play games. That's what changed the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition's gotten higher in all aspects of the game,''
Davenport said. ``A couple of years ago Martina won, I think, like
11 tournaments and forced everybody else to get better. Now Venus,
by winning all these matches in a row, is forcing everyone to try
and beat her here. And Serena, the same last fall when she won the
Open. I think everybody's just doing a lot for women's tennis,
trying to get it better and better. And the better all the top
players can play, the closer the matches and the more the fans like
it and the better it is for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean _ despite Davenport's success against Serena
Williams in the quarterfinals _ that it gets any easier when it's
time to go between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a number of levels, they've changed the face and the look
of women's tennis,'' Carillo said. ``You can't really compete with
them at their physical level, so somehow you have to drag them down
to your level or go up against them and what they have and figure
out a way to pick it apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Davenport as Exhibit A. ``Lindsay did a masterful job
against Serena,'' Carillo said. ``She took away Serena's running
game, which is exactly what you have to do. She centered the ball;
she kept hitting it right into the middle of the court and robbed
her of her running game. Serena and Venus are so dangerous on the
run. Don't let them run. You don't want to get into a track meet
with them, so make them hit and try to beat them from there.
Lindsay is capable of outhitting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key to Davenport's win was that she did it in two sets,
Carillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets to three sets, it becomes a physical battle
again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis is Exhibit B.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's playing much better,'' Carillo said. ``She looks
fitter and fresher mentally, I think. One year on, she understands
if she's going to beat back-to-back big babes, it's going to take
one big effort. She really has to try and husband her strength in
earlier rounds and really try to get things done in a quick and
very efficient manner, and she's done that here very quickly with a
minimum of fuss.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hingis also met Venus Williams in the semifinals and
beat her in three sets, but then did not have enough left in the
finals for Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best thing of all for women's tennis is that not only
have the Williams sisters brought out the best in Davenport,
Hingis, and others, but the rivalries at the top _ with any luck _
should last a while.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is 24, and Hingis turns 20 later this month. Venus is
20, and Serena's 19th birthday is this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many more years to come against the Williams
sisters,'' Hingis said after losing to Serena Williams last year at
the Open. ``It didn't happen today, but there are many more Grand
Slams and finals to come. Hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's match isn't a final. But it's the next best thing to
one. The winner of the Hingis-Williams match plays the winner of
the Davenport-Elena Dementieva semifinal for the title Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Carillo likes Hingis's chances against Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams, as might be expected, thinks otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Venus comes out and plays the way Venus can play, and Venus
wants to play, no one can stop her,'' the coach/father said. ``No
one.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been correct before.

&HT;     `NURSE BETTY' OFFERS FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Note cast box at end)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greg Kinnear has found a sub-specialty in playing unctuous
louts, and in ``Nurse Betty'' he plays a beaut: the suave star of a
popular daytime soap opera who finds himself the object of a fan's
psychotic fugue. His response to this news, comical at first,
heartrending in the main, yields one of the most finely drawn
portraits of haute-dirtbag egotism to grace the screen all year.
He's a skin-crawling charm to watch.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a prime reason to view and scratch your head over
``Nurse Betty,'' as subversive and eccentric a film as mainstream
comedy ever gets. Put it in quotes: ``mainstream'' and ``comedy.''
For all its sleek marketing and blurb-ready premise, the film is
likely to madden moviegoers who expect the chuckles and pacing of a
laff-riot blockbuster, and it's just as likely to sicken anyone who
doesn't want ``Pulp Fiction''-y blood-and-guts thrown in with the
punch lines. It is beyond question a funny, thought-provoking and
skillfully made film. It is also somewhat deranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' was directed by Neil LaBute, the maestro of
verbal savagery who made ``In the Company of Men'' (cruel corporate
wonks toy with deaf woman) and ``Your Friends and Neighbors''
(cruel urban yuppies toy with each other). Both are fables of
dysfunction, exaggerated fantasies that offer long, dark gazes into
the human urge to manipulate. At best they're virtuosic; at worst
they're infuriatingly false. In real life, no one's that awful.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Nurse Betty,'' no one is. Quite. Working from a
screenplay by short-story writer John C. Richards and music editor
James Flamberg, LaBute has made a film that treads a strange,
looping path between ruthlessness and hope: It's a fable, yes, but
it's a fable that invokes Doris Day while it's fixing to bump off a
couple of major characters. Innocence weds barbarity at one weird
altar.
</P>
<P>
   The bride in question is Betty Sizemore (played by a fittingly
ingenuous Renee Zellweger), a waitress with a boorish clod of a
husband (LaBute alumnus Aaron Eckhart, sporting a mullet) and a
serious crush on George McCord (Kinnear), who plays heart surgeon
Dr. David Ravell on a soupy daytime drama called ``A Reason to
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   When a pair of murderous reprobates scalp (yes, scalp) and
murder Betty's husband before Betty's startled eyes, she
disconnects from reality and retreats into the tidily plotted realm
of soapdom: She believes the show is real, and she believes she's
part of the action.
</P>
<P>
   To that end Betty writes a ``Dear Del'' letter to her dead
spouse (``You don't seem happy any more'') and resolves to cross
the country in search of her great soulmate, her ex-fiancee, her
one, true, virtuous and immortal love, Dr. David Ravell.
</P>
<P>
   The shady dealers, played by a never-more-elegant Morgan Freeman
and a never-more-lethal Chris Rock, track Betty in her deluded
quest and plan to kill her. What happens when they find her is less
interesting than what happens when she finds David (``Why did he
call you George?'') and even less interesting than the sly
observations on fiction, illusion and film that get spread like
bread crumbs along the way. Betty falls in love with a phantom; one
of her husband's killers falls in love with a phantom; the film
itself, a spectral medium, calls on ``Roman Holiday'' and a few
bars of ``Que Sera, Sera'' (sung not by Day but by Pink Martini) to
conjure figments of Hollywood's past.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Curtis once boasted that he knew Doris Day ``before she was
a virgin,'' and while Zellweger lacks Day's unfaltering pie-faced
perkiness, there's enough of the naif about her to give the climax
real pathos. You mourn for her loss of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   And while ``Nurse Betty'' fails to answer some of the very
questions it asks about myth and our ways of escape _ while a few
narrative gaps indicate overzealous editing _ the film does dish up
plentiful food for thought. It also dishes up Greg Kinnear as one
luscious skunk of an actor, a perfect reminder that sometimes,
reality just can't compete with our favorite mirage.

MARTIN HAS JETS UP AND RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ One thing Bill Belichick and Bill Parcells
can agree on is their respect for Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Once a star in New England, Martin has spent the last three
seasons with the Jets after the Patriots made what may turn out to
be one of the worst decisions in team history _ not matching
Parcells's free agent offer to Martin after the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Martin signed a 6-year, $36 million deal that included a
``poison pill'' that would have exploded the Patriots' salary cap.
He received a $7.5 million bonus: a signing bonus of $4.2 million
and a $3.3 million roster bonus (the poison pill) received seven
days after signing. Nevertheless, Martin should have been wrapped
up long before he received the Jets' offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have never really replaced him, coming close with
Robert Edwards, who gained 1,150 yards in 1998. But they've had
nothing to compare with Martin, who has established himself as one
of the great threats in the game. He's the ingredient the Patriots
do not have to complement Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis has 6,300 yards for his five-year career, so he has
averaged better than 1,200 yards per season,'' said Parcells, the
Jets director of football operations. ``I'm not saying he's the
best in the league, but I mean this with all my heart, I'll take
him over any back in the league, and you can have the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick shares that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis is a great back,'' said the Patriots coach. ``He's not
physically big but he's a strong player. Pound for pound he's
probably as strong a player as there was in '96 here and on the
Jets team the last three years. He's got great vision, good speed,
he's a very consistent player. You know he's going to give you his
absolute best every time he touches the ball. He's so tough to
bring down one on one. He can run with power and move the pile for
a couple of extra yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has given the Jets a complete offense. ``He was a leader
by the first week he got there,'' said Belichick. ``Curtis is a
much more powerful inside runner than what we had in '97 (Adrian
Murrell). Curtis has great leadership, too. Everyone who comes into
contact with Curtis, players, coaches, fans, that guy commands a
lot of respect.
</P>
<P>
   After Martin's departure, those sentiments were expressed
throughout the Patriots' locker room. He was an inspirational
person who harbored strong religious convictions. ``I came into the
locker room one time and I swore and I found myself going up to
Curtis and apologizing,'' said former Patriots wide receiver Shawn
Jefferson. ``That's how much guys respected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was part of the effort to take Martin away from the
Patriots. He feels the Jets were fortunate in taking advantage of a
salary cap maneuver that is no longer legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the collective bargaining rules were, the restricted
free agents could get a contract and the team they were on couldn't
match,'' said Belichick. ``At that point in time you could put a
poisin pill in there. The NFL Players' Association and the
management council got together and eliminated the poison pill. Am
I surprised the Patriots couldn't match it? No, not at all. If that
contract were presented today it would have been easy to match.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has seen both sides of Martin. He saw the Martin that
ran for 199 yards in Tuna Bowl I at Foxboro Stadium against the
Jets. His best effort against the Patriots came last Nov. 15 when
he ran for 149 yards on 31 carries. In three of his four games
against New England, he's carried for more than 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very creative in how they get him the ball,'' said
Patriots middle linebacker Ted Johnson, whose job it is to shut
Martin down. ``They do screens and draws. It's a conventional
offense, but they get creative with Curtis. We have to find a way
to shut him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is aware of the creative ways Charlie Weis _ the
former Jets offensive coordinator _ used Martin. And under Dan
Henning, the Jets probably aren't going to be too much different.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick knows the Jets system so well he's made a point to
warn his team about becoming complacent because of his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there's a lot of familiarity in this game _
knowing their schemes and plays _ that goes both ways,'' said
Belichick. ``It's important we don't take things for granted. There
are going to be some curveballs and changeups thrown and we'll be
trying to caution the team on a comfort level because we run a lot
of the same plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is worried about the volume of plays he has his team
preparing for. He says that if you prepare for 30 things, there are
still things left uncovered. ``And the volume is more than you can
cover during a week of practice,'' he said. ``The things we've run
with the Jets, you couldn't practice in a week. You have to ask
yourself, `What are you going to prepare for?' You have to select
the things you think they'll do against you. Inevitably, you're
going to miss something but hopefully you can recognize what it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense hopes to recognize what Martin will be
doing and try to stop a running back who never should have left New
England.

MTV ADS DULL THE EDGE BY SLOUCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, the MTV Video Music Awards ceremony is supposed to be all
loosey goosey. It's one of the few remaining places where we can
expect insults and curses and skin (oh my!) to slip by the censors.
But still: If you were going to host MTV's signature event, the
live extravaganza that was the top-rated entertainment program in
cable history last year, the pop-cultural hotbed whose classic
moments _ Pee-wee Herman's return, Michael and Lisa Marie's kiss _
have become etched in our collective memory, wouldn't you at least
try to come up with some sharp material?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Wayans brothers Marlon and Shawn were half-baked
hosts of the 17th annual Video Music Awards at Radio City Music
Hall. Their filmed skits were sloppy, their filler jokes were
awkward, and their introductory routine was very routine, from its
flat riffs on Firestone Tires and Juvenile's expensive teeth to the
melee at the Source Hip-Hop Music Awards, a subject they revisited
repeatedly despite the audience's indifference to it. And Marlon's
decision to take the baton from Prince and Howard Stern and become
a moon man _ and I'm not talking about MTV's astronaut statuettes _
was tragic.
</P>
<P>
   And so the evening evolved as a poorly hosted series of low
sparks and high-heeled fashion mistakes. Unexpectedly, MTV's Carson
Daly needed to step in midway to lend a firm hand and explain the
evening's most anarchic, rock 'n' roll moment: While Limp Bizkit
accepted the Best Rock Video award, the bass player for Rage
Against the Machine climbed onto a giant jungle-gym-like stage
ornament, rocked it back and forth, and refused to come down
despite urgent requests from the stage crew. It was spontaneous,
for sure, but not as cool and edgy as MTV and the Wayans wanted it
to seem.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of the telecast was not as edgy as MTV might have
wished, from Fred Durst's cameo onstage at the end of Christina
Aguilera's medley to what was going to be _ but then wasn't _
Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears presenting the Video of the
Year Award to their enemy, Eminem. (At the last minute, Whitney
Houston and Bobby Brown took the podium.)
</P>
<P>
   What moments helped make the show less of a bore?
</P>
<P>
   --Napster founder Sean Fanning nervously introduced Britney
Spears wearing a Metallica T-shit. Metallica, of course, is the
band leading the fight against Internet music ``pirates'' like
Napster. As Fanning spoke, the camera caught Metallica drummer Lars
Ulrich in the audience with his eyes closed, feigning sleep. Later,
a filmed Wayans sketch featured Ulrich pretending to borrow things
from the ``frat boy,'' noting, ``Sharing is only fun when its not
your stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   --The hyped GLAAD street protest of MTV's support of Eminem
exerted very little presence over the event. In fact, it was
Eminem's night, as he accepted a pair of awards, was the object of
many jokes about his hatred for teenybopper music, and delivered
the central musical performance. He began with ``The Real Slim
Shady'' on the street in front of the Radio City Music Hall with an
army of Eminem wannabes, and he ended on the stage rapping to his
critics, ``I am whatever you say I am.''
</P>
<P>
   --The lyrics to Britney Spears' hit ``Oops . . . I Did It
Again'' feature her adamently pronouncing ``I'm not that
innocent.'' thursday night, she underscored that point in a big way
during an ultra-flashy medley that found her stripping off a
pinstripe suit and dancing up a storm in a skimpy bikini top and
skin-tight peach pants.
</P>
<P>
   --Macy Gray added a new twist to her big little girl persona, as
she seemed to be a big little girl who stayed too long at the fair.
Her massive red 'fro couldn't hide the fact that she was stradling
another dimension, particularly as she presented best pop video
with LL Cool J and couldn't stop referring to a Wayans bit about
her private parts. ``I hate making videos,'' she said while
accepting Best New Artist in a Video. She's a trip.
</P>
<P>
   --Janet Jackson performed the show's opening number in a
feathery, blue-lit, ``Cats'' outfit that was as dated as her dance
moves. Jackson gets points, though, for looking head-scratchingly
and frighteningly like her brother Michael. Freakiness still rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone ask who won? When it comes to the Video Music
Awards, that's far from the lead. Eminem won Best Male Video and
Video of the Year; 'N Sync won Best Pop Video, Viewer's Choice
Award; Aaliyah won Best Female Video; Blink 182 won Best Group
Video; Destiny's Child won Best R&AMP;B Video; Jennifer Lopez won Best
Dance Video; and Sisqo won Best Hip-Hop Video.

AL AND GEORGE, HERE ARE SOME KILLER-ADS TO SMITE YOUR OPPONENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oil prices spiking, cable-bizness anchors doing the
heavy-breathing thing, heating oil stocks dreadfully low in the
oil-heat Northeast: People, we have a political issue peaking here.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the presidential election. We have a villain:
his name? Brent Crude. So which party gets to seize the advantage
in the oil price runaway? Which presidential candidate taps into
the boiling volcano of political emotion unleashed by the oil price
ignition? That depends upon the advertising crews at work in both
camps. Grasping an emerging hot issue and fashioning it into an
awesome political weapon is a job for the gang down at Vulcan
Associates, Un-Ltd., my mythical ad agency of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how a sample killer-ad might go, first for the Bush
crowd, then the Gore gang:
</P>
<P>
   A Bush commercial opens with video of Vice President Gore
embracing an obviously-Arab oil sheik, followed by national
newspaper headlines using words like ``Oil Shock'' and ``Crude Tops
$38 a barrel.'' Cut to old film of honking motorists lined up
outside gas stations during the Carter oil embargo: Announcer:
``Not since OPEC tried to bring America to its knees in the '70s
under another Democratic administration have American motorists
been hit this hard by foreign oil oligarchs. It's time we elect a
president who'll stand up to OPEC and put Americans first.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to more recent video of Hillary Clinton being bussed by
Yasser Arafat's wife, Suha, a subtle link of Gore to the
controversial First Lady, and her embrace of her Palestinian
equivalent. Announcer: ``George W. Bush will put America first.
Isn't it time we had a president who's more concerned for American
consumers than foreign producers?'' The ad ends with headlines of
Gore's family interest in Occidental Oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp's potential rejoinder? Video of
cowbody-booted-and-hatted George W. celebrating with his
oil-bidness buddies in West Texas. Announcer: ``The Republican
candidate for president says he's proud of his background in the
oil business. He says what's good for Big Oil is what's good for
America. Al Gore disagrees. Al Gore is fighting for working
families pinched by the runup in oil prices. Al Gore is taking on
Big Oil, and American's want him to win that battle this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to video of Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, in a hard-hat
on an oil rig, followed headlines of Cheney's $40 million golden
handshake from Halliburton, the oil supply outfit. Announcer:
``Both men on the Republican ticket stand to make money out of the
recent run-up in foreign oil prices. But Al Gore stands with
working families, against the oil barons.''
</P>
<P>
   Which would work better? You're the judge in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Negative ads are important weapons. They can sap the will of the
other side's base, and depress turnout by turning off
less-motivated and casual voters. If they are too risky, you can
always find a sympathetic lobbying outfit to pay for it and run it,
letting them take the heat so your guy doesn't get burned in the
reaction. The professionals who run campaigns _ like to control
turnout and discourage `amateurs,' voters who are only loosely
affiliated to party brand, who do not behave within safely
predictable demographically secure margins, and who represent the
dreaded ``wild card'' in the game of anticipating turnout.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain benefited mightily from these wild cards, a lot of
them Democratic crossovers, in his early primary victories. Now
stakes are higher. There's less time for a vulnerable candidacy to
recover from a body blow. So both camps screen the news digests
each day and flog the in-house pollsters and focus-group conductors
to come up with the killer ad.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it doesn't have to run more than two or three places
to win a place in the Political Advertising Industry Hall of Shame.
Lyndon Johnson's famous ``Daisy ad'' implying Barry Goldwater would
loose nuclear horror upon the little girls of this world was an
unnecessary dagger stuck into a barely twitching electoral corpse
in the 1964 Democratic landslide.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush the Elder turned loose black rapist/murderer Willie
Horton on the campaign of Michael Dukakis in 1988, with a
revolving-door from a purported prison showing dark-hued miscreants
ready to pillage the countryside if Dukakis got elected.
</P>
<P>
   Negative ads can be generic: the flip-flop, weathervane,
trampoline and diving board-cm-bellyflop offer handy metaphors for
the unwary pol who has in his career changed positions on anything
with barbed wire attached, like abortion, gun control, tobacco,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   They can employ the reverse-testimonial: You drag before your
hired vido crew a succession of elderly ladies, hard-hatted Joe
Sixpack types, or pitiable little kids, who can all attest with
apparent sincerity that candidate Joe Blow did them dirt. This year
there's been a minor eruption of scorned spouses who take out ads
to denounce their former mate and pledge their electoral troth to
his opponent, all the while denying that spite played any role in
their civic-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   Negative ads are to be taken with the customary dose of salt.
And as with any fried or fatty food, consume too many of them and
your political digestion goes awry.

`THE WATCHER' ISN'T EVEN WORTH A GLANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE WATCHER 
Directed by: Joe Charbanic 
Screenplay by: David Elliott &AMP; Clay Ayers 
Starring: James Spader, Keanu Reeves, Marisa Tomei, Ernie Hudson,
Chris Ellis 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another week, another dumb serial killer movie. This one, ``The
Watcher,'' identifies Keanu Reeves's character pretty early as a
sadist who tortures women and then cuts their throats with piano
wire, but not before needling James Spader's FBI man by first
express-mailing him a glossy 8x10 of each victim. On the whole,
Reeves was more appealing as a scab quarterback in ``The
Replacements.'' The killings are his character's way of
perpetuating a homoerotic mind game with Spader's burned-out agent,
who, after having unsuccessfully pursued the killer for several
years in Los Angeles, has retreated to Chicago. There he hopes to
get over the post-traumatic stress syndrome that has turned him
into a pill-popping wreck kept from collapse by twice-weekly
sessions with shrink Marisa Tomei.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a phrase from another Chicagoan, John Belushi, ``The
Watcher'' is a but nooooo movie. Spader's agent just wants to take
a much-needed break for a while, but nooooo. Reeves's psycho won't
leave him alone. When Spader comes out of his depression long
enough to notice that he's been sent photos of murdered Chicago
women, he realizes the killer has followed him and is up to his old
tricks. It's at this point that a merely gory and meretricious
movie turns stupid. Spader's lawman not only miraculously snaps out
of his depression once, but twice, as Tomei's therapist becomes
relegated to victim status.
</P>
<P>
   The cat-and-mouse turns into a personal duel, with stupid car
chases, an explosion, and Spader's character pointing a gun at
Reeves's killer, but behaving as if his trigger finger was
paralyzed and allowing the murderer to make a big speech. ``The
Watcher'' wastes some handsome night shots and views of Chicago.
The last time Reeves worked there, he had the great special effects
of ``The Matrix'' to fall back on. This time, the screenplay falls
on him. By the time his psycho fixes Spader's cop with his bright,
beady eyes and says, ``We're yin and yang,'' you're not at all
interested to learn who's which.

COFFEY PERKING UP FOR HIS 21ST SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Paul Coffey sat home in the summer of 1999, he
made up his mind the upcoming NHL season, his 20th, would be his
last.
</P>
<P>
   He had gone through a hellish 1998-99 campaign, playing 10 games
with Chicago before being traded to Carolina, and injuries had
taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   But Coffey's battered state took a big turn for the better last
season, and after finishing strong with the Hurricanes, the
defenseman decided to continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a two-year contract with the Bruins July 13, and the
club is hoping the 39-year-old can ignite an offensive spark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last July, I was going into that year as it being my last,''
said Coffey. ``I wasn't telling anybody, I was just going to play.
It had been too frustrating the previous year with injuries. I
wasn't able to play up to the level I like to play at. I knew
mentally what I wanted to do, what I could do. But I couldn't get
it done. My back was bugging me, I had weakness in my right leg.
But last year, when I did finally get a chance to play with
Carolina, it was a really enjoyable year.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of Coffey watchers in Boston before his
arrival. Coffey and former Bruins captain Ray Bourque have been
neck and neck in a number of career categories in the NHL record
book. Going into this year, Bourque is leading in goals scored by a
defenseman (403 to Coffey's 396). Coffey leads in most career
assists by a defenseman (1,131 to Bourque's 1,117) and most career
points by a defenseman (1,527 to Bourque's 1,520). In assists,
Coffey and Bourque are Nos. 2 and 3, respectively, in league
history.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Bourque closed the gap with 18 goals and 34 assists
for 52 points. Coffey, who wasn't playing at the start of the
season with the Hurricanes, ended with 11 goals and 29 assists for
40 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a reporter said to me, some time in November, `What
do you think of the race?' '' said Coffey. ``I said, `What race?'
and he said, `Between you and Ray.' And I said, `Well, Ray is
sprinting, and I'm stuck in the mud. I ain't moving.' I wasn't
playing. It was great to see him doing well, but I was just biding
my time and hoping to get a chance to play. It turned out I did. I
just made the most of it, got myself in good shape, and things went
well.''
</P>
<P>
   When Coffey entered unrestricted free agency July 1, he
initially set his sights on a contract with the Maple Leafs. But a
chance in his hometown didn't work out, so he continued the search.
In the end, his new team turned out to be Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total surprise,'' said Coffey. ``It threw me back in
a good way. All players say stuff, but I'm really honored to be a
member of the Bruins. An Original Six team _ Bobby Orr, Phil
Esposito _ I mean, c'mon, what do you need? It's incredible, and if
it doesn't make you feel a few years younger, nothing will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are his eighth organization (Coffey has played for
one franchise in two different incarnations _ Hartford and
Carolina), and he said the move was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tougher on my wife than it is me,'' he said. ``I come in
and all of a sudden, I've got 20 brand-new best friends. I promised
her when I was in Carolina, that was it. But she saw the fire in my
eye last year, the fun I had and the willingness to compete at the
top level and being able to do it. This opportunity came up, and I
just really enjoy the game.''
</P>
<P>
   President/general manager Harry Sinden said he wants the Bruins
to play a different style than they have in the past few years, and
he's hoping Coffey will help orchestrate a more uptempo game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much going to play the way I play as long as it
fits in with the way Pat Burns wants me to play,'' Coffey said
Thursday during practice in Wilmington. ``He's the coach, and he
makes the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffey does agree that the NHL hasn't been as exciting as it
could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game on the whole _ never mind the Boston Bruins, the last
few years _ lacks some entertainment,'' he said. ``I'm talking from
a fan's point of view. I know there is a lot of pressure on wins
and losses, but if you're going to charge $50 or $100 a seat,
you're obligated to go out and entertain. I'm speaking as a fan. I
think the game on the whole the last few years got a little too
much, `Wait and see and let's try to win or lose this thing in the
last five minutes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   New NHL director of officiating Andy Van Hellemond has promised
a tightening of the way games are called, and Coffey said he
welcomes that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame the officials; the officials are doing a great
job,'' said Coffey. ``It's a tough job to have to do, but I think
from the players' perspective, all they want is consistency. Night
in and night on, a hold is a hold. Obstruction is obstruction. All
of a sudden, because a game is 2-0 and there's five minutes to go,
you're allowed to get away with that stuff. I don't agree with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffey said he is raring to go and has as much fire as ever. If
he didn't, he said he wouldn't be out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money's not the motivation,'' said Coffey. ``It's just still
being able to compete, especially with the young guys, showing you
can still do it. I'm not good at anything else. You can't come off
the ice dead tired or get a punch in the head fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing better than being elbowed in the head. At
least you know you're alive, you feel it. Or an ice bag on your
knee because you got hit with a puck. That's the mentality of us, I
guess. I'm not going to miss it when it's over, but it's kind of
nice. It lets you know why you're doing it.''

`MNF' TALK IS MUSIC TO OHLMEYER'S EARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer, executive producer of ``Monday Night Football,''
has heard all the criticisms about the addition of Dennis Miller to
the booth. He has read all the stuff about production snafus and
on-air confusion.
</P>
<P>
   You know what? He loves it. Every single word. Oh, he doesn't
like mistakes and he readily admits his new show is still ``a work
in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is proud for one simple reason: ``When was the last time
you heard anyone talk about `Monday Night Football'? '' Ohlmeyer
asked. ``When was the last time anyone quoted something from
`Monday Night' the following day?''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the barometer _ and it surely is the one Ohlmeyer is
using _ then ``Monday Night Football'' is doing just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miller is a lightning rod,'' Ohlmeyer said, likening the
comedian to the legendary Howard Cosell. ``They both generate a
visceral response from viewers. Cosell was once voted the most
popular and hated in the same poll.''
</P>
<P>
   While most attention is focused on the commentating, Ohlmeyer
said the production still needs some tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's game between St. Louis and Denver provided several
examples. Talking over a referee's call on the field is
inexcusable. Having Melissa Stark's audio problem in the middle of
a report is one of those technical glitches that shouldn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   The replay of the Rams' Az-Zahir Hakim's punt return in the
first quarter should have been shown instantly, but wasn't. To his
credit, Ohlmeyer said that as a viewer, he wants replays of great
plays shown right away. He even admits screaming at his television
when they are not.
</P>
<P>
   But he explained that in addition to the game, he has five
commercials to air each quarter as well as network promos. Ohlmeyer
also had to make the choice of showing the home crowd going crazy
over the return or a replay, which could be shown later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in television for over 30 years,'' he said. ``There
are maybe three or four shows that I have done that I don't think
needed any improvement. I'm a very tough grader.''

</P>
<P>
   Cross fire
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CBS studio analyst Randy Cross has been following the escalating
hype generated by the Patriots-Jets game Monday night. ``If the
players get half as excited as the fans and the sportswriters, then
the game will be a struggle of Titanic proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow CBS analyst Phil Simms said the Patriots are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is not as talented as it was three years ago or even
last year,'' Simms said. ``They have Bruce Armstrong coming off
major surgery and Ben Coates is gone. They lost a lot of depth,
including wide receiver Shawn Jefferson, who had a great opening
week in Atlanta. And they still have no running back. It's a team
that missed their chance at a good run and now they have to
reshuffle and reload and see if they can do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's the ideal situation there but (Bill)
Belichick liked that he was in control of personnel and not in
trouble with the salary cap. He will have some freedom in the
future to make moves and get players.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Buck's take
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joe Buck calls Saturday's 1 p.m. Yankees-Red Sox game on Fox and
readily admits he doesn't know what to make of either team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get a handle on the Red Sox,'' Buck said.
``Outside of Pedro Martinez pitching every five days, everything
else is a crapshoot. They still have the ability to beat teams but
there has been no consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck did give credit to general manager Dan Duquette and manager
Jimy Williams. ``You can't blame all of the woes on Duquette,''
Buck said. ``He has tried to bring in players. Some of them just
haven't worked out. And give credit to Williams. I know he's taken
his hits but he is one those managers that is able to get the most
out of the talent that he has. He's done a fantastic job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are another story. ``They're beatable,'' Buck said.
``They are a much different team that bounced the Red Sox from the
playoffs last year. Who would have believed three months ago that
Roger Clemens would be their best pitcher?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sticky wickets
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a recent piece called ``Just Trying To Make A Buck-ner,'' Jim
Rome blasted Bill Buckner haters on Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some chowderheads are bitter that former Red Sox first baseman
Bill Buckner has a deal to sign pictures of himself letting that
ball go through his wickets in the 1986 World Series against the
Mets,'' Rome said. ``Bad enough that he cost you a World Series,
chowds. Even worse that he's going to profit from it, right? Wrong.
As if Buckner cares about you Red Sox fans. You're the ones who ran
him out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the ones who ruined his life. The guy had 2,715 base
hits, and all he is remembered for is not making that play. It's
his way of killing the pain and dealing with the hurt. Leave the
guy alone. Let him sign a few pics, make a few bucks.''

CMGI LOOKS TO BECOME GE OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are these guys management material?
</P>
<P>
   CMGI Inc., the Andover, Mass. company that became famous as a
nurturing investor of Net start-ups, took another step Thursday in
its transformation into a long-term manager of operating companies.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI unveiled plans to consolidate its 17 majority-owned
businesses around five segments of the Internet, eventually leaving
one or two companies in each of those areas, such as interactive
marketing, infrastructure, and e-business. Venture capital
investing, the company's original claim to fame, simply becomes a
sixth operating division.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes are expected to take a couple of years. The
process will involve merging businesses and selling off those that
don't mesh.
</P>
<P>
   The company's current group of 17 operating companies includes
some higher-profile names like search site AltaVista, hosting
company Navisite Inc., and Engage Inc., an online marketing
services company. It also includes many lesser-known companies like
SalesLink, AdForce, and 1stUp.com.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI has investments in dozens of other Internet companies,
which remain in the company's venture portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts universally applaud CMGI's focus on operating
companies, which it first discussed publicly in August. CMGI will
publish the financial details of each operating business line for
the first time when it announces the results of its fiscal fourth
quarter this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a logical progression,'' said Steven Frankel of Adams,
Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston. ``If you want to be perceived as an
operating company, you must have metrics investors can understand
and measure you by.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI executives describe the shift toward an operating mentality
as a corporate evolution that has been underway for some time. In
reality, it is a change of focus demanded by a stock market that
once drove CMGI shares to the stars and has since slammed them back
to earth with stunning force.
</P>
<P>
   The value of CMGI shares ballooned by an amazing 800-fold in
their first six years, by the end of 1999, but have lost 69 percent
so far this year. The stock slipped $3.50 to $43.19 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Making big money as an incubator of dozens of Net start-ups
requires a receptive market for new public stock offerings. Once
that door closed, there was no choice but to hunker down and focus
on running businesses for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive David Wetherell and his top managers may have
bottom-line religion today, but those same executives were playing
up their venture investing expertise as recently as early this
year.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that each time a hot new Net area captured the
attention of investors, CMGI announced a new $1 billion venture
firm targeted at it. Business to business? Start a $1 billion
venture fund. Infrastructure? Set up another.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI had a habit of putting its venture reputation behind the
Internet investment wave of the moment. Would those billions really
be put to work? It was hard to imagine, but since CMGI stood as the
sole limited partner, plans could eventually be scaled back.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually came Thursday. CMGI said both those new $1 billion
funds were being ``integrated'' with another outstanding venture
pool, CMGI (at)venture IV. Nobody was talking about billions. The
dollar targets are now ``open-ended.'' CMGI also said it would
forgo plans to start a big international venture fund with Hicks,
Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, a Dallas buyout firm, and Pacific Century
Cyberworks Ltd. of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Sound abrupt? Some analysts such as Ullas Naik of First Albany
Corp. think CMGI was just doing what a Net company has to do,
adapting its talents to a market that continues to change very
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a bad rap on the Street for being way too malleable
when it comes to their positioning, but I don't fault them at all
for that,'' said Naik. ``I can change my model as often as I want
as long as I'm doing the very best I can to maximize shareholder
value. They have to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Now CMGI executives will have to answer two basic questions:
What exactly do they have to manage and are they up for it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think overnight investors will become convinced this
is a successful operating company, but this was a necessary first
step,'' said analyst Safa Rashtchy of US Bancorp Piper Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was difficult to determine the rate of growth
and profitability of CMGI operating companies in any detail. This
will begin to change when deeper financial disclosure becomes the
new standard.
</P>
<P>
   The CMGI goal is to be thought of as the General Electric of the
Internet, managing many different business lines to their full
potential. CMGI will find that credibility as a manager of
operating companies comes one quarter at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Welch didn't become famous overnight.

IT'S RENEWAL TIME FOR THEIR UNIFORM RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ His childhood rivalry was Dodgers-Giants, and if you
knew him you never had to guess which side he was on. He hated the
Giants. He hated them so much that, as much as he dreamed of
playing in the majors, he was willing to be a selective dream
catcher: He wanted to be drafted, but he didn't want those bums
from northern California, the Giants, to draft him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they didn't,'' Rod Beck said Thursday. ``The A's did. But
after a couple of years, the A's traded me to the Giants. Then I
was thinking, ``Oh, (expletive).' ''
</P>
<P>
   Beck understands how you might be feeling this morning, even if
some of your friends don't. You feel this way because the Yankees
are in town. Yankees-Red Sox was here before both World Wars,
before the Depression, before baseball at night, and before
``Baseball Tonight.'' It was here before instant replays and
Instant Messenger. There have been nearly 2,000 of these games _
1,845 after the teams play their next four games _ and, in most
cases, the sentiments remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   That is, after so many games in so many weeks, months, and
decades, you still can't stand them. There can never be enough
``Yankees suck'' taunts from Sox fans. There can never be enough
1918 reminders from Yankees fans. On and on it goes. It is one of
the rare debates/rivalries that never gets old. You can still get a
rise out of a Beatles fan by mentioning Yoko Ono. A Police fan will
tell you that Sting should have never left. For some, Lionel
Ritchie was never the same after leaving the Commodores. And if you
are a Yankee lover who wants to open an argument with a verbal
haymaker, you mention the Babe who left the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who commute between New York and Boston daily.
There are Bostonians living in Manhattan and New Yorkers going to
school on Commonwealth Avenue. But there are thousands of fans who
aren't interested in crossing over. They don't want to know that
Bernie Williams is a thoughtful man, a jazz head (he plays guitar)
who once performed in Greenwich Village. They don't want to know
that Darren Lewis is a thoughtful man who has attended classes in
the offseason and loves reading and talking about books.
</P>
<P>
   They don't want to know because they might like them. You can't
have that in a series like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the fans are going to be rowdy and, as a player, you
love being in games like this,'' Beck said. ``But I hope people
understand that we don't actually hate the dudes on the other team
just because they are wearing uniforms with pinstripes. We don't
generally hate the guys; we just don't like their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think before, when you had the same guys on the same teams
every year, it was easier to develop a rivalry. Then, before free
agency, you really didn't like the other guys. It was personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox fans have no problem with that. They will take care of Luis
Polonia, Jose Canseco, and Roger Clemens. All they expect from Beck
and his teammates is a series split. Well, maybe three of four. OK,
let's be honest: Most folks are thinking sweep, even if the Yankees
have been playing spectacularly since July 1.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than two months since these teams last played.
That's a lot of time for one-liner lovers to come up with material.
You will hear New Yorkers heckling Manny Alexander, a light-hitting
utilityman whose alleged ownership of steroids has left many fans
confused. You will hear Bostonians heckling David Justice, whose
long-ago divorce from the stunning Halle Berry still confuses many
of her suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will practically cart the series history with them to
Fenway this weekend. Some of them will take it to New York on
Monday, when the Sox play the Yankees again in a makeup game.
Generally, Sox-Yankees would be enough entertainment for four days.
But Sox-Yankees in a pennant race is a bonus. At this time last
year, Pedro Martinez went to Yankee Stadium and threw a one-hitter,
which led to a weekend sweep of the Yankees. Now, realistically,
the Sox know they need a repeat if they want to win the American
League East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the numbers,'' Derek Lowe said. ``If we split with
them, we're back at square one. If we want to make a move, we're
going to have to take three out of four. I'm not saying we can't do
it, but being down six games with about 20 to play means you have
to go on a 16-4, 17-3 run to have a chance to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox haven't had that type of consistency since May, when
they took over first place on Mother's Day. For most of the summer,
they have been as fluid as Boston traffic. There have been lots of
stops and starts. And whenever there has been movement in the form
of a mild win streak, the Sox have found themselves sounding like
kids in the back seat, forever asking ``are we there yet?'' and
thinking that the next win will spark The Big One.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, they began to look like the Sox you loved in May. Jose
Offerman hit two home runs, and the team scored 11 runs against the
Twins. That means there were two double-digit-run games in the same
week, following a 40 games/40 nights plague in which the Sox
couldn't reach double figures.
</P>
<P>
   It's good that they were able to do it, but they did it against
the A's and Twins. If the playoffs began today, neither of those
teams would be participating. This weekend is different. They will
have to play well against the Yankees. The well-bankrolled,
well-covered, well-despised, in-first-place Yankees.

   ``Everywhere I've played, I've been part of some big
rivalries,'' Beck said. ``With the Giants it was the Dodgers. With
the Cubs it was the Cardinals. Now it's the Yankees. Baseball needs
these rivalries.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck, a former Giants closer, says he now roots for the team he
hated as a kid. In many ways the Us vs. Them games have similar
themes. But this is where Sox-Yankees is different: If Beck had
grown up as a Sox lover in Boston, pitched for the Yankees, and
then said he rooted for them, he would never be forgiven. It's been
like this since the days of FDR and JFK. In Sox-Yankees, you pick a
side and you keep it for life.

<P>
   CANTON, Mass. _ Reebok International Ltd. may have some snazzy
sneaker lines in the pipeline and an eye-popping new headquarters
here, but after five years of disappointment, is the company's long
overdue comeback finally for real?
</P>
<P>
   Executive vice president Angel R. Martinez thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   During a headquarters event Thursday at which reporters were
given a preview of upcoming Reebok fashions in both footwear and
apparel, Martinez said, ``2001 is going to be a breakthrough year
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some outside observers also see signs for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reebok is gaining momentum,'' said John J. Shanley, an analyst
at First Security Van Kasper.
</P>
<P>
   After downsizing and cost-cutting, after taking steps to unify
its management team and its marketing vision, there is evidence
that a company long stalled is at last moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Reebok reported that second-quarter earnings had more
than doubled. Its stock price hovers near a 52-week high, closing
Thursday at $20.75, up 19 cents. And a marketing tie-in with the
phenomenal TV show ``Survivor'' has targeted plenty of attention on
the Reebok brand the company wants to revitalize.
</P>
<P>
   According to Martinez, the latest effort to re-energize Reebok
started late last year, shortly after chairman Paul B. Fireman
stepped forward to take an expanded role at the company.
</P>
<P>
   The move came after Reebok's second-ranking executive, Carl
Yankowski, abruptly left in December to take a job elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the long lead times in the athletic footwear
industry, strategy changes decided upon today can take 12 months or
more to fully implement. So the jury is still out on Reebok's
latest turnaround effort.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting turnarounds is nothing new for Fireman, though
earlier efforts have yielded mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, Fireman vowed to right Reebok within two
years. But annual profits sagged, going from $135.1 million in 1997
to $11.04 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Annual sales also have been in a mostly downward trajectory,
sinking to $2.9 billion in 1999. At one point during this decline,
Adidas-Salomon AG eclipsed Reebok as the number two player in an
industry still dominated by Nike Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there are signs that negative trends at Reebok are
reversing. While recent second-quarter sales fell slightly,
footwear back orders from US retailers rose 6.2 percent, a good
omen for future sales. The numbers are encouraging, said Lehman
Brothers analyst Robert Drbul.
</P>
<P>
   There's more good news.
</P>
<P>
   After some doldrums, fashion cycles now seem to be breaking
again in the direction of the sneaker companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to editor Bob McGee of the trade publication Sporting
Goods Intelligence, khaki ruled youthful fashions for much of the
late 1990s. After young consumers outfitted themselves at stores
operated by Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch Co. and Gap Inc., they wanted brown
shoes _ industry lingo for hiking boots and other casual lines _ to
match their khaki duds.
</P>
<P>
   As these all-important young consumers opted for brown shoes,
many sneakers from Nike, Reebok, and Fila Holdings SpA languished
on store shelves, according to published reports. To clear out
slow-moving merchandise, retailers offered discounts, and such
promotions helped melt away Reebok's profits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the fashion cycle has turned again. With the Gap and
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch seemingly in less favor, there may be an
opportunity for sneaker companies to win back young customers.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok has sometimes been criticized for a less-than-sure
fashion sense. No one, however, can accuse some of next year's
lines of lacking boldness. Drawing inspiration from the Sydney
Opera House in Australia and the architecture of such cities as
Boston and Vienna, some new shoe lines feature a ``faceted'' look.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound strange _ shoes inspired by the curve, color, and
texture of buildings _ but retailers have responded positively, in
part, perhaps, because Reebok consults with them early in the
design process, something it hadn't done before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their quality and styling have improved dramatically,'' said
analyst Shanley of Reebok's new fashions.
</P>
<P>
   This new fashion sense expresses itself in collections that
incorporate a theme running through both shoes and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the footwear has a new exterior look, the inside
continues to build on Reebok's DMX cushioning technology, which
seems to have struck a chord with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of becoming overly dependent on Nike, many retailers may
be rooting for a Reebok comeback. Support from retailers can
translate into better displays for Reebok merchandise in stores,
and that in turn can help drive sales.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Reebok relied on legions of athletes to promote its brand,
and it was famous for changing ad agencies frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it uses only a handful of ``icon'' athletes, such as
basketball's Alan Iverson and tennis star Venus Williams. And its
presence at the upcoming Olympics will be far less than in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   On the ad agency front, Reebok has stayed with Berlin Cameron &AMP;
Partners of New York for three years.
</P>
<P>
   A consistent marketing campaign, new well-received styles,
fashion trends that look more kindly on athletic footwear _ all
could help propel Reebok back toward the profit levels it enjoyed
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there may be one potential obstacle on the comeback trail:
foreign currency issues. Reebok earns a big chunk of its sales
overseas, where results can be vulnerable to the declining euro and
the British pound.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Martinez was upbeat Thursday, comparing the
progress of Reebok's comeback to the midpoint of a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mile 13 in the marathon; you're feeling really good, and
you know you're going to finish the race,'' he said.

THE EYES HAVE IT _ BUT LINE JUDGE WON'T BUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Someday Russell Seeney can tell his grandchildren his
journey from Australia to the US Open in 2000 was worthwhile beyond
any man's most fantastic dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There I was, kids, just me and her _ Anna Kournikova _ the
most famous tennis player, possibly the most famous woman in the
world at the time,'' he will relate. ``Just peering into each
other's eyes. It was, uh, electrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   More like electrocuting, if you want the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Seeney, an Aussie from a tennis family, was sitting there in
Arthur Ashe Stadium minding his own business when this fabulous eye
contact occurred Thursday. His business, as it happens, was keeping
his eyes on the south baseline, a judicial role, during the mixed
doubles championship match.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova, standing at that white stripe, was serving at 3-4 in
the second set, and matters were getting tight. Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario and Jared Palmer were ahead of Kournikova and another
Russian, Max Mirnyi, two games from capturing the title, which they
eventually won, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   So the serve went to Sanchez Vicario, who slapped a forehand
return toward the baseline, a ball too well struck for Kournikova
to reach. The ball landed . . . where?
</P>
<P>
   ``Out! It's out!'' yipped Kournikova, who expected Judge Seeney
to utter ``Out!'' as well, and extend his right arm southward. He
was mute, possibly stunned, as so many men have been by her charms.
She heard the umpire intone, ``Love-15,'' meaning point to the
Spanish-American coalition of Sanchez Vicario and Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Kournikova sternly informed the umpire. ``The
ball was out. Our point.'' She began tapping her racket on the
alleged spot, an inch behind the line, but she got no help from the
hard-faced asphalt. No tell-tale mark appeared, as it might on
clay.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova pouted. Guys kind of like her pouty, sultry looks in
the photos that have graced every possible magazine but Field and
Stream and Soldier of Fortune. She pouted some more, then turned
her attention toward the culprit: Seeney.
</P>
<P>
   She began to stare at him, her hazel eyes blazing. He stared
back, transfixed. For a long minute, he was the envy of every male
in the congregation of 15,000. Eyeball to eyeball with Anna. What
man wouldn't melt? What hockey team wouldn't grovel and chorus,
``Out! A thousand times out! Anything you want, Anna.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Seeney deny her? Would he be so mean as to deprive her of
one teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy point in this hour of her need?
Everybody in the joint could sense this paltry point was pretty
big, and would probably lead to her and Mirnyi losing the title.
They didn't want her to vanish so soon, after only 73 minutes on
view. Why else were so many people watching a mixed doubles match
if not magnetized by Kournikova?
</P>
<P>
   The ball did seem out from where I was sitting, and people were
booing the umpire. But Judge Seeney had the best seat in the house
to rule in such matters. He was stonily silent. Only three little
letters (O-U-T), but he refused to utter them. As Tammy Wynette
stood by her man, Seeney stood by his call.
</P>
<P>
   That is pressure. Umpires may be assailed by such as Jimy
Williams of our Olde Towne Team, but how hard can it be to turn
down an appeal by craggy old Jimy? Here was Kournikova, the siren
in the kind of pistachio shift that drives men nuts, pleading for a
smidgen of kindness and consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Seeney didn't flinch. Brave, righteous man, or ogre? Take your
pick. Nevertheless, he wouldn't budge even for the lass who bends
men around her little finger as her countrywoman Catherine the
Great used to do.
</P>
<P>
   He undoubtedly will cherish the memory of their brief,
tantalizing encounter, perhaps dining out on it when he returns to
Australia. One simple word might have changed their relationship _
but maybe her gaze struck him dumb.
</P>
<P>
   At last Kournikova stopped tapping her racket disapprovingly.
She went back to work after losing that critical point and lost her
vital service game to 3-5. She and the gangling 6-foot-5-inch
Mirnyi lost the next game, and the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Poor little rich girl, who wins hearts and endorsements,
headlines and commercials _ but not titles. She might have won this
one if only Russell Seeney had seen it her way and muttered
``Out!'' Hers was a disappointing Open. She was upset by another
teenager, Justine Henin, in the third round, and collected merely
$74,000 ($31,500 alongside Mirnyi).
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova departed immediately with nothing to say. Mirnyi,
definitely a ladies man, who won the Wimbledon and US mixed doubles
two years ago with Serena Williams, is also in the men's doubles
final, accompanied by the Boy Bomb, Lleyton Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Mirnyi said, intending no slight to Hewitt, ``the best
part has been spending two weeks with Anna.'' Though it was no more
than cohabitating a tennis court, what guy wouldn't have wanted to
trade places with him?
</P>
<P>
   The teammates kissed after their last point.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova did not blow a kiss to the mesmerized but tongue-tied
Judge Seeney.

EARLY POLLS A SHOT IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble with preseason polls is that they are voted on in
the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   You can study all the magazines, depth charts, and scouting
reports you want and you don't really know how good a team really
is or can be.
</P>
<P>
   College football is not like the National Football League where
there is generally a reasonable amount of stability from season to
season.
</P>
<P>
   A top 5 team at the end of one year might not necessarily be one
at the start of the next. Some picks _ Florida State, Nebraska _
are safe in any season.
</P>
<P>
   Take this year, for example. Alabama, Virginia Tech, and Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama started the year third in the Associated Press preseason
poll, receiving three first-place votes. Virginia Tech was 11th.
Penn State was 22d.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Alabama began its season with a 35-24 loss to UCLA in a
game that was not a fluke. The Tide was outhit, outhustled, and
outplayed.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State has yet to hit anything other than the skids as it
has dropped back-to-back games to Southern California and Toledo.
The Lions play Louisiana Tech Saturday, attempting to avoid the
first 0-3 start since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech _ which was picked behind Miami in the Big East
preseason polls, although the Hokies have not lost to the
Hurricanes (who were fifth in the polls) since 1994 _ opened its
season with a romp over Akron.
</P>
<P>
   On a local level, go to the Big East opener between Boston
College and West Virginia. The Eagles were picked either third or
fourth, behind Miami, Virginia Tech, and Syracuse. West Virginia
was a spot back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, West Virginia romped to a 34-14 victory. Is West Virginia
better than people thought? Is BC worse?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point. No one really knows, yet we make judgments
and predictions that create rankings.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, this was no big deal. The polls were fun to
argue about, nothing more. The decisions about final rankings were
played out during the course of the season with the bowl
representatives making their own selections.
</P>
<P>
   The new-age technology is different. We have the Bowl
Championship Series rankings based on computer printouts that
determine strength of schedule and the value of margin of
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Those rankings determine who will play for the national
championship game _ which happens to be in the Orange Bowl this
season.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal world of college football, the teams would play a
month's worth of games before we would have the first poll of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not going to happen. We are obsessed with the Who's
No. 1 mentality from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   So be it. But when you look at the results each week in
September, be careful before you call any game an upset.
</P>
<P>
   A team like UCLA, or even Toledo, who almost no one had in any
Top 25 in the preseason, might emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are Florida State and Nebraska will be in their usual
top spots by the time October arrives and that will be fine. They
will have earned their spots.
</P>
<P>
   But until then, don't pay too much attention to the Top 10.
Everybody is just guessing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Raising the bar &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do you see a Notre Dame team as a decisive home underdog,
but that is the case for Saturday's game against No. 1 Nebraska.
``If we want to set our sights high, that's a good place to
start,'' said Notre Dame coach Bob Davie when asked about comparing
the Irish with the Huskers. ``If you want to raise the bar of your
footbal team, you raise that bar comparing yourself to Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about that for a minute. This is Notre Dame we're talking
about, not Virginia Tech or Marshall or some other rising program.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airing Lion laundry &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been an interesting week at Penn State as coach Joe
Paterno tries to recover from the 0-2 start and the public airing
of laundry that was created when running back Larry Johnson Jr.
took a verbal blast at the system. To make matters worse, Johnson
is the son of defensive line coach Larry Johnson Sr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we keep our dirty laundry to ourselves,'' said
Paterno. ``We're all frustrated. That's why I kept my mouth shut,
so I didn't say anything I'd be sorry about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lions' problem is not difficult to see. They can't score or
move the ball. They have gained 308 yards in total offense in two
games, which isn't even a good half for a team like Nebraska early
in the season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the shoe fits . . . &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez has had to do some major league
scrambling early in the season after the NCAA ruled 26 of his
players would face suspensions ranging from one to three games for
accepting extra benefits from a Madison-area discount shoe store.
Alvarez's only advantage? He can stagger the suspensions and
doesn't have to announce them until game time. The Badgers barely
survived with a 19-7 win over Western Michigan Saturday, but they
will be hard pressed to overcome a tougher Oregon team Saturday . .
. The heat wave that continues in the Southwest is becoming a
health concern. Usually, the spate of 100 degree days is gone by
Sept. 1, but SMU opened its season Saturday night and the game-time
temperature was 109 . . . Michigan got its season off to a nice
start with a 42-7 romp over Bowling Green last week, but the cost
was considerable. The Wolverines lost tight end Shawn Thompston
with a knee injury and defensive end Jake Frysinger with a foot
injury. And that's in addition to the injuries to quarterback Drew
Henson (foot), who will miss at least two more games, and safety
Cato June and wide receiver Tyrece Butler, who are out for the
season with knee injuries . . . Although Texas coach Mack Brown
said he will use both Major Applewhite and Chris Simms as his
quarterbacks this season, starting with Saturday's opener against
Louisiana-Lafayette, Simms doesn't think it will work on a
long-range basis. ``I can't see it throughout the season,'' he
said. ``I don't think it could work. It's too much turmoil for a
team. It just never works.'' . . . Toledo took care of one Big Ten
``power'' in Penn State last week. This week it could be Michigan
State's turn when it faces Marshall. Marshall comes into the game
with the longest winning streak in the country (17 games) and a
63-7 win over Southwest Missouri State. ``It's quite obvious from
the way they've dominated the Mid-American Conference the past
three years they have far superior talent than the rest of the
league,'' said Michigan State's Bobby Williams . . . The trouble
with polls is already obvious this season. In the Associated Press
writer's poll, Alabama remained ahead of UCLA, despite what
happened Saturday and in the coaches poll _ Penn State still
received votes despite its 0-2 start. Speculation is that Larry
Johnson Sr. voted for Penn State this week in an act of contrition
for what his son said . . . Call them the road warriors. Only five
Division 1A teams will open their seasons with three consecutive
road games. Southern Miss, Tulane, BYU, Miami (Ohio), and
Mississippi State are the hearty bunch. BYU has already made two
cross-country trips, losing to Florida State in Jacksonville, Fla.,
two weeks ago and coming back to beat Virginia in Charlottesville
last week. The Cougars have a relatively short trip Saturday with a
visit to the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. . . .
Boston College, which could use some good luck after last week's
embarrassing debut against West Virginia, catches a little break
when it travels to Army Saturday. The Cadets are coming off a short
workweek of preparation since they opened the season Monday
afternoon at Cincinnati with a 23-17 loss to the Bearcats . . . If
you want a sleeper team coming out of the Big East it could be
Temple. Don't laugh. The Owls have gotten more competitive each
year under coach Bobby Wallace _ they have a win over Virginia Tech
at Blacksburg, which is something Miami doesn't have.

&HT;     `GIRLFRIENDS' WE CAN ALL LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the burden of television history that unless you create
something stunningly original, a series will find itself
pigeonholed and compared to others that have come before it.
</P>
<P>
   And so it's safe to assume that UPN's surprisingly good new
comedy, ``Girlfriends'' (9:30 p.m. Monday, check local listings)
will be called ``the black 'Sex and the City.''' It's almost
impossible to ignore the similarities _ four women trying to get
their love lives in order while living in a big city, this time Los
Angeles. They are all perfectly diverse in their personal styles
and approaches to life, a la ``Sex and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Girlfriends'' will have a difficult time distancing
itself from the HBO hit, the series is markedly different on many
levels and deserves its own credit for being funny. In fact, what
separates this show from ``Sex and the City'' most glaringly is the
heavier emphasis on one-liners. Where ``Sex and the City'' tends to
dabble in drama and subtlety, ``Girlfriends'' _ while no stranger
to feelings _ prefers punch lines over angst.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly for an all-black comedy, Kelsey Grammer is
the executive producer. But the voice behind the series is Mara
Brock Akil, who helped shepherd ``Moesha'' and ``The Jamie Foxx
Show.'' Clearly this black-women-turning-30 thing is ripe material
for her, as she gives us four powerful personalities and one of
UPN's brightest shows in years.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way is Joan (Tracee Ellis Ross), the anchor of the
foursome. She's a successful attorney with her own house and
fabulous furniture, sparkling morals (no sex until three months
with a nice guy) and a bright personality. But she's lousy with
men. Much like Carrie in ``Sex and the City,'' she's the lead
voice, addressing the camera directly (instead of Carrie's
voice-overs) in a variety of funny revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Her secretary and good friend is Maya (Golden Brooks), who still
has a fighting amount of street left in her (which comes in handy
when she verbally defends Joan, which is regularly). Maya is
married with a kid and is working to succeed in the business world
with Joan as her lead.
</P>
<P>
   Toni (Jill Marie Jones) is a successful real estate agent but
makes no bones about looking for a very, very rich man with great
taste in clothes who will take care of her for the rest of her
life. She spars frequently with Maya as the two riff on social
class. She's one of Joan's closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn (Persia White) rounds out the group and also stands out the
most. She's part earthy-crunchy, part punk, part social activist.
She went to college with Joan but is now in her eighth year of
graduate school, preferring the mental approach to actually joining
the working world.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card here is William (Reggie Hayes), a kind of nerdy
but funny social loser who works with Joan at the law firm. His
dumb-droll asides are a nice change of pace from the sass of Maya
and Toni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlfriends'' does not break a lot of new ground. The women
have the same obsession with men and appearances that plague the
foursome on ``Sex and the City.'' But the jokes are funny, sharp
and consistent, making this _ easily _ UPN's best chance at a major
sitcom hit.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Girlfriends'' is another so-called ``urban comedy''
that UPN has found success with (``The Parkers'' is a big hit in
African-American households), this one has a better chance at
crossing over racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will have to survive the ``Sex and the City''
knock-off tag. And, more dangerously, survive the fate of UPN,
which remains unknown. The network is in danger of folding _
possibly in the middle of this season.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, ``Girlfriends'' is the first show of the new fall
season and, given that most of the offerings across the dial will
be dismal, is a nice way to start things off.

<P>
   BARTLETT, N.H. _ The 12-year-old from Florida showed off a
slightly bruised knee and deemed his latest endeavor and the newest
toy to hit New England's mountains ``pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a young Rhode Island teenager came by and asked if
she could take a picture to make a point: ``to prove to my son that
we do so have fun,'' she said. Seems he had opted for the nearest
skateboard park with his aunt and uncle and missed his chance to
try mountainboarding.
</P>
<P>
   It was a drizzly late Sunday afternoon, and a mountain bike race
was taking place at the other base lodge. There were more watchers
than doers on the dirt track Attitash/Bear Peak Ski Resort uses for
its mountainboarders.
</P>
<P>
   One father said he was sure mountainboarding was going to take
off, though. He longed to try it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the big boss said no,'' he lamented. ``I've had back
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   A young mountainboarder headed up the path. He carefully climbed
onto the board with the fat, inflatable tires _ almost a snowboard,
almost a skateboard. He pointed it down the hill and took off.
Bending his knees, he carved a couple of gentle turns, used the
hand brake to control his speed, and dipped and rolled over the
mounds of dirt in his path.
</P>
<P>
   Think road bike turned mountain bike.
</P>
<P>
   The mountainboard is ``like a big skateboard with pneumatic
wheels and inflatable tires holding you down with bindings,'' said
Paul Spacht of Sunday River, Maine. ``Like a skateboard where you
beef things up and make it stronger for off-road use. It basically
really is like a large skateboard with air tires and a rear
brake.''
</P>
<P>
   Think snowboarders looking for something to do in the summer.
Think skateboarders looking to take their wheels and tricks to new
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   And think ski and snowboard resorts looking for ways to make use
of their hills and mountains in the summer. It certainly won't hurt
if they can introduce new folks to their ski areas and mountain
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to eight years ago in Lake Tahoe. Snowboarding
buddies Paul McConnell and Jason Lee were sitting on a chairlift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were real hard-core into snowboarding,'' McConnell said.
``We were riding in the winter of 1992-93 and talking about what we
were going to be riding in the summertime. We thought someone must
be making this thing. We even thought it would be called a
mountainboard.''
</P>
<P>
   They looked around, but couldn't find any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first few we made out of necessity, for ourselves,''
McConnell said. ``Our friends saw them, and we thought of
modifications we could do with the next batch. We took their money
and made another batch and just kept going. We went through several
revisions and then it really started to get out of control, so many
of our friends wanted them.''
</P>
<P>
   A business _ and a sport _ were born.
</P>
<P>
   Mountainboard Sports _ a couple of its mottos are ``Some of Us
Can't Wait for Snow'' and ``After a Few Months Without Snow
Desperation Overrides Common Sense'' _ has its gear at several New
England ski areas this summer. Sunday River, Attitash/Bear Peak,
and Killington in Vermont, all American Skiing Company resorts,
offer mountainboarding, as does Gunstock in Gilford, N.H. Smugglers
Notch in Vermont has used mountainboards for five years as part of
its summer camp programs.
</P>
<P>
   The mountainboard business is booming. And it's only just begun,
McConnell figures.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have come on board, and all signs are good.
Mountainboard Sports has sold 16,000 boards since it started in
1996, and McConnell is looking to sell 16,000 more this year.
</P>
<P>
   He is living in Vermont this summer, pushing the sport and
trying to line up more ski areas for next summer. He has a couple
of commitments already, and he would love to get another 20 resorts
by next year and then keep doubling the total.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like snowboarding, I think it could take off in the Northeast
first and then hit the rest of the country,'' McConnell said.
``They're not ski resorts with huge rock mountains. Some of them
are midsized mountains, and their terrain is ideal. They have a lot
of grass and dirt. On Gunstock's downhill boarder-cross, all the
features are made out of dirt. It's like a golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Killington has a 3.6-mile trail serviced by a gondola. Sunday
River takes its beginners to a parking lot for some basic
instruction and then shows them how to get on and off a chairlift.
Then they hit the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   The ground can be unforgiving for falls, so speeds are slower
than they are for snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   ``A normal recreational speed is about 10 miles an hour,''
McConnell said. ``Fast enough to have fun, slow enough to be in
total control all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Renters are outfitted with helmets, and wrist, knee, and elbow
pads. Most riders he knows, Spacht said, stick with the hand
brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a lot simpler than it appears to be _
snowboarding, skateboarding with a little BMX thrown in,'' Spacht
said. ``It's easier than snowboarding. It's got the wheels and
tracks itself where a snowboard slips and slides. And skateboarding
is much harder than snowboarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Count Bryan Mahn, 29, of South Boston, as a believer.
</P>
<P>
   A chef in Cambridge, he saw a brochure for mountainboarding at
Sunday River in late April and, like McConnell and Lee before him,
wasn't ready to have his snowboarding season end.
</P>
<P>
   He called the toll-free number for Mountainboard Sports and
found the nearest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy at the store let me try it, so I was riding down a
hill in Fitchburg,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He bought one on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more of a risk, obviously. It's not snow you're
falling on, it's gravel and rock and dirt,'' Mahn said. ``But it's
exhilarating. You still feel the same carving, and you don't need
snow to do it, and you can do it anywhere. On the street, down a
hill in the park. You can go anywhere with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahn races, and he carries brochures in his backpack for anyone
who asks about mountainboarding. He's not even paid to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hand them out and figure the more people who get
involved, the easier it will be to get parts and stuff like that
and the more areas that will get involved,'' Mahn said.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what McConnell is hoping.

OSBORNE IS BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you wanna be a rock star? Good luck. One minute you're up,
the next minute you don't even have a record deal, as singer Joan
Osborne can tell you.
</P>
<P>
   Her debut album, ``Relish,'' in 1995, went multiplatinum and had
the megahit ``One of Us,'' a mildly provocative tune in which she
wondered if God might be ``just a slob like one of us, just a
stranger on the bus trying to make his way home.'' The song angered
a few far-right religious types, but helped her gain five Grammy
nominations and tour the world.
</P>
<P>
   Logic would suggest that she earned some artistic autonomy for
her next record, right? Well, wrong. She was dropped by Mercury
Records _ she still doesn't understand why _ but has landed on her
feet with the new ``Righteous Love,'' which comes out Tuesday on
Interscope Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird. Music is an even more precarious career than it
used to be, so I definitely feel lucky to put another album out and
go on another tour. You can't take it for granted,'' says Osborne,
a Kentucky native now based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think record companies have this idea that audiences are
very fickle, so there's not nearly as much emphasis any more on
building a lengthy career over several albums. They pretty much
only want to put out a record that they think is going to sell 10
million copies. That's the sort of corporate bind they've gotten
themselves into, after all these megamergers and stuff,'' Osborne
adds. ``I certainly was not part of the decision to drop me from
Mercury. I don't really know what went on in that room at that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's a memo to Mercury's short-sighted executives: you
blew it, because Osborne's new record is one of the finest of the
year. It furthers the erotic soul-rock of her first CD, while
broadening her horizon from Irma Thomas-like grit to
Pretenders-like heaviness, along with some shimmering, George
Harrison-sounding guitar and adding some mystical drone singing in
the qawwali tradition of Pakistan's Nusrat Ali Fateh Khan, with
whom Osborne studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a phase of listening to Harrison's `All Things
Must Pass' over and over,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's a deeper, more mature, but still rocking album that
reflects the growth that Osborne has made in recent years. She used
her success as a springboard to sing with Luciano Pavarotti in
Italy for a Bosnian relief benefit, to record a duet with Bob
Dylan, to record with the Chieftains, to write with Cuban artists
and play the Karl Marx Theater in Havana, and to make two trips to
India to study voice _ one of which resulted in her performing for
the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable drawing from a lot of disparate sources
this time,'' she says of her latest music. ``I don't sit down and
draw maps for myself or anything like that. I just try to spend
time with the music that I love and hopefully that forms what I
create myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her emotions run the gamut on the new songs, from the
romantically hopeful title track, to the breakup tune, ``Poisoned
Apples,'' to a stunning cover of Dylan's ``To Make You Feel My
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne sees the record as being ``more straightforward than the
last one _ and that had much to do with my state of mind when I was
in the studio. I didn't have a label at the time, and there
certainly was no guarantee that I was going to find another one, so
I guess I felt like I had to sort of fish or cut bait. It was time
to really just do it and be straightforward about my approaches to
singing and music.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne is now ready to go back on tour _ her Avalon show will
feature a new band, save for returning guitarist Jack Petruzelli.
She also is about to launch a new online publication, Heroine
Magazine (www.heroinemag.com), on Sept. 12. The focus is on ``women
who are doing inspiring and interesting things,'' she says, adding
that the first issue will include a discussion between Susan
Sarandon and the Indigo Girls about their political activism and
how they mix that with their creative work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming up with a lot of the article ideas and it's
definitely been fun,'' says Osborne. ``If it overwhelms me, then
I'll let it go, but it's been exciting so far.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New U2 single: The advance buzz had U2 going back to its rock
roots for its next album, but the new single, ``Beautiful Day,''
shoots down that theory. It's a fairly lame, synthetic-sounding
stab at the dance-lite market, complete with gooey lyrics about how
``it's a beautiful day . . . you got no destination.'' There's a
chiming guitar line from The Edge, but the rest of it is schmaltz.
Hopefully, U2's CD (``All That You Can't Leave Behind,'' due next
month) will be better.

`NURSE BETTY' IS WELCOME RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
NURSE BETTY 
Directed by: Neil LaBute 
Screenplay by: John C. Richards, James Flamburg 
Starring: Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, Greg
Kinnear, Aaron Eckhart, Tia Texada, Crispin Glover, Pruitt Taylor
Vince, Allison Janney, Kathleen Wilhoite 
Running time: 112 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violence, pervasive language and a scene of
sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neil LaBute's ``Nurse Betty'' is just what the new season needs
to momentarily outrun the soon-to-be-unleashed flow of fabricated
plastic. I'm not sure if it's a dark light comedy or a light dark
comedy. Either way, it's lively, edgy, full of zigs and zags, juicy
performances, and offbeat fun. It'll pop the careers of Renee
Zellweger, Chris Rock, and Greg Kinnear up a notch or two. The only
reason it won't do the same for Morgan Freeman is that he's already
at the top of the A-list. After the limited delights of his
misanthropic ``In the Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends &AMP;
Neighbors,'' it's also something of a breakout film for LaBute,
too. Working for the first time with a script by somebody else
(John C. Richards, James Flamburg) has opened him up. ``Nurse
Betty'' is never going to be confused with ``Mary Poppins,'' but as
of now, it's LaBute's crowd pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   It's launched when Betty, Zellweger's gentle heartland romantic
and abused Kansas wife, is traumatized after witnessing a brutal
murder, disassociates, and retreats into the fictional hospital
world of her favorite soap opera, ``A Reason to Love.'' She needed
only the smallest push to imagine that she's the love of its
superstar doc's life. Half-dazed, she leaves her sleazy husband
behind and sets out to make a love connection with the doctor
(Kinnear) she thinks is real and yearning for her. What she doesn't
know is that her getaway car has a load of stolen cocaine in its
trunk, which means the hit men from Detroit (Freeman and Rock) are
after her.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger's Betty is Dorothy hurtling out of Kansas in ``The
Wizard of Oz.'' She's Mia Farrow escaping an unbearable life in
``The Purple Rose of Cairo'' by slipping her moorings and taking
refuge in illusion. The hit men, inevitably, will recall the ones
of ``Pulp Fiction.'' And Betty's skewed odyssey detonates memories
of ``Desperately Seeking Susan.'' You won't have enough fingers and
toes to count the film references in ``Nurse Betty,'' but it
doesn't just rip off its sources; it regenerates them with bright
inventiveness, putting its own distinct spin on the characters,
especially Freeman's cool old pro and Rock's hotheaded protege.
Amusingly, the more trigger-happy Rock gets as they pursue Betty,
the more courtly Freeman becomes. Convinced that she's essentially
innocent (she is), he finds a protective instinct surfacing on
Betty's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   He's the charmer in the film, although Zellweger's confused but
softly persistent Betty keeps you wanting to see things work out
for her. One of her funniest detours occurs when she actually meets
Kinnear's George, who's as insecure off the set as he is suavely
commanding in front of the cameras. When she addresses him as his
doctor character, he assumes she's an actress launching a brilliant
improvisation in hopes of getting on the show. Another reason the
soap-opera element works as well as it does is the wry, dry
producer played by Allison Janney. It must be said that the film's
bullet-strewn ending doesn't live up to the level of the kicky
inventiveness that precedes it. Still, if you're in the cinematic
doldrums, take two hours of ``Nurse Betty'' and you won't have to
call a doctor in the morning.

HOW EIGHT WOMEN ROWING A BOAT TURNED THE TIDE

THE RED ROSE CREW 
A True Story of Women, Winning, and the Water 
By Daniel J. Boyne 
Hyperion, 206 pp., illustrated, $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, thousands of rowers will gather for the Boston's
Head of Charles Regatta, the 35-year-old tradition that is half
athletic contest and half beer garden. Any number of those boats
will be rowed by women. This fact seems unremarkable in an era when
the Williams sisters match up at Wimbledon and the WNBA stages
down-to-the-wire playoffs and television covers it all. But it
wasn't always so.
</P>
<P>
   Change came slowly in the world of rowing, one of the oldest and
most elite intercollegiate sports. Harvard and Yale have had an
annual race since 1857, but until rowers Chris Ernst and Anne
Warner launched a protest in 1976, women were not even allowed to
shower at the Yale boathouse. The Head of the Charles had no events
for women until Gail Pierson, an MIT professor, forced the issue in
1969 and became the first woman to race a single.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Red Rose Crew,'' these athletes get their due. Author
Daniel J. Boyne, director of recreational rowing at Harvard
University, looks at the wild passion and ragged strength that
stoked a winning boat and helped usher in a new era for women's
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The eight women rowers who won the silver medal in the 1975
World Rowing Championship weren't exactly a consciousness-raising
group. They were in it to play hard and whip some Russian butt.
``For most of the women in `The Red Rose Crew,' rowing was simply a
way to explore and express a part of themselves that had been
largely suppressed by American society, not to make a political
statement,'' Boyne writes. ``And yet in pursuing their passion in
the sport they indeed acted heroically, in the truest sense,
without any thought about fame or profit. Ironically, it is only
now, more than two decades later, that the full significance of
their actions can be truly appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyne's story is launched in 1972, the year that Congress passed
Title IX, the law requiring universities to give equal funding to
men's and women's sports teams. It was also the year that the
decision was made to include women's crew in the 1976 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, there were tryouts for US Women's Rowing Camp.
``Those who made the first cut would be invited to Boston, where
the appointed coach would make further selections. In the end,
eight rowers, a coxswain, and two spares would travel to
Nottingham, England, and row at the World Championships.''
</P>
<P>
   And here, finally, is where untamed drive meets legend. Harry
Parker, Harvard's taciturn, courtly rowing coach, agreed to take on
the women's crew. Parker has been the subject of elegiac
sportswriting before, of course, most notably in ``The Amateurs,''
by David Halberstam. And though Boyne prunes where Halberstam
inflates, Parker comes off none the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, Boyne writes, ``was a different kind of coach than most
sports fans were used to, as different as the sport he coached.
Behind the studied, silent air was an intelligent, piercing look
that the press, for lack of a better word, called patrician. His
coaching style was minimalist. He had no need to yell to get people
to do what he wished.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyne, author of a spare and useful rowing text called
``Essential Sculling,'' documents the emotionally wrought process
of picking an eight-woman crew. It eventually includes Carie
Graves, the intense ``stroke'' who sets the pace; Pierson, the
reformed single sculler who understands the politics of the rowing
world; and Lynn Silliman, the coxswain who steers the boat and the
psyches of her crew.
</P>
<P>
   With supple prose and pinpoint anecdotes, Boyne tells a story of
transformation. For the Red Rose crew, who found singular grace and
purpose on the water. And for those of us who watch rowing, or any
other sport, in hopes of adding a little loft to everyday life.

THE ULTIMATE `EXPERIENCE' OF JIMI HENDRIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the 30th anniversary of Jimi Hendrix's death, which means
an all-out campaign to memorialize him. Leading the way is a
four-CD box set, ``The Jimi Hendrix Experience,'' due in stores
Tuesday, the same day the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland
opens a major exhibit on him.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sept. 17 _ the day before the anniversary of his death _
the Showtime channel airs the biopic ``Hendrix,'' starring Wood
Harris of ``Remember the Titans'' fame. It retraces the
singer-guitarist's rise from a Seattle childhood to life in
Greenwich Village and London, and historic performances at the
Woodstock and Monterey Pop Festivals.
</P>
<P>
   For serious Hendrix fans, though, the show piece is the
spectacularly designed, no-expense-spared box set, with a cover of
purple velvet imported from France. It has a suggested retail price
of $69.99 for the CDs, or $59.99 for eight vinyl albums, and the
set boasts the most previously unreleased music ever bunched into a
Hendrix package.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, it was made under the auspices of Hendrix's family,
which won a court case not long ago to finally regain control of
Hendrix's archives. Thus, we can bid goodbye to some of the bogus
Hendrix packages of past years. Some were good, but many were
wretchedly inconsistent and even filled with intrusive,
uncalled-for overdubbing.
</P>
<P>
   The new set is ``not just a pretty box with a lot of the same
stuff that you've heard before,'' says John McDermott, a Newton
resident who coproduced it with Hendrix's family and with longtime
Hendrix engineer Eddie Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, nearly every track is an alternate take (Hendrix
sometimes made 20 to 30 takes of a single song), an alternate mix
(with a few new mixes by Kramer), or previously unreleased live
tracks from shows in Stockholm, London, Paris, the Isle of Wight,
Monterey, San Diego, Berkeley, and even Maui, where Hendrix did an
impromptu gig in a meadow on a mountainside, attended by just a few
hundred people who saw leaflets handed out that day.
</P>
<P>
   Great pains are taken to show Hendrix's incendiary live style _
long jams are recorded, as are blazing covers of the Beatles's
``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' Howling Wolf's ``Killing
Floor,'' Bob Dylan's ``Like a Rolling Stone,'' plus Chuck Berry's
``Johnny B. Goode'' and Carl Perkins's ``Blue Suede Shoes.''
Hendrix's fundamental blues root is also shown by a live version of
B.B. King's ``Rock Me Baby'' and by ``Catfish Blues,'' inspired by
Muddy Waters's ``Still a Fool.''
</P>
<P>
   The set is generally chronological, starting with a 1966 studio
take of ``Purple Haze,'' where the vocal is more prominent and the
guitar playing actually more psychedelic than the toned-down
version that came out on record. Other songs were slowed down, too,
as they progressed, notably ``Little Wing.'' The faster-tempoed
version is included here, before Hendrix producer Chas Chandler
(who was also bassist with the Animals) persuaded Hendrix to rein
it in.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for a listener to this box, however, is the rapid
jumping between studio and live cuts. For that reason, nothing
reaches the same incendiary level as the ``Live At Winterland''
album that Rykodisc put out during the '80s. There are only two or
three live cuts in succession here, before studio takes _ often
more careful and plodding _ are interspersed.
</P>
<P>
   Another key element is that this box set, as coproducer
McDermott says, is meant as a companion to the four records that
Hendrix made in his lifetime. To fully appreciate it, one needs to
have heard those records, thus this is not designed as a Hendrix
primer. If you're new to Hendrix, get those other records first
(especially ``Are You Experienced?'' and ``Axis: Bold as Love'')
before you delve into this set.
</P>
<P>
   But for connoisseurs, this box is a treasure. Hendrix's
improvisational nature is demonstrated throughout, whether it's a
previously unreleased stoned rap on ``Third Stone from the Sun,''
or when he starts recording the spacy ``Burning of the Midnight
Lamp'' on harpsicord in the studio, only to later play it on guitar
in a concert in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive written comments are provided on each song by
McDermott, who has penned two books on Hendrix (titled ``Hendrix:
Setting the Record Straight'' and ``The Jimi Hendrix Sessions''),
plus worked on box sets by Cream, Eric Clapton, and on an upcoming
double-CD by Blind Faith.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott also explains the growing tension between Hendrix and
bassist Noel Redding, who wanted more arranged music and less
jamming and eventually left the group and was replaced by Billy
Cox. Original drummer Mitch Mitchell was later replaced by Buddy
Miles (when Hendrix's group became known as the Band of Gypsys),
but Miles grew ``cocky,'' says McDermott, and Mitchell was invited
back, though Redding never returned.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining Hendrix family _ notably his sister, Janie _
formed a company, Experience Hendrix, which put out this box and
also an official bootleg, ``Live at Clark University,'' taped at
that Worcester college in 1968 and available only through
www.jimi-hendrix.com. Future projects may include a live Hendrix
album from Royal Albert Hall. For now, though, it's time to
celebrate his 30th anniversary and hopefully entice collectors to
this attractive, if sometimes unwieldy, new box. But, again, get
his original albums first if you're not already a diehard.

ANDREA BOCELLI'S LATEST CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrea Bocelli's new CD of Verdi arias arrives in the stores on
Tuesday, which is another way of saying it will start flying out of
the stores and straight to the top of the charts.
</P>
<P>
   The record is a little disappointing but it is still a very good
thing because it will introduce this music to thousands of people
who haven't heard it in performances that are genuinely musical and
stylistically authentic, even if the voice isn't invariably up to
every challenge Verdi sets.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian superstar recorded his new album in sessions with
Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic last December and January
in Tel Aviv. The ambitious program includes 15 arias or cabalettas
from 10 operas, some of which Bocelli would hardly dare to sing in
an unamplified live operatic performance _ but he is hardly the
first tenor to record arias from operas he couldn't sing onstage.
Fifty years ago some 78s by Ferruccio Tagliavini created a great
stir; it sounded as if a great new dramatic tenor had emerged. In
person, Tagliavini had a beautiful light, lyric voice, which he
proceeded to damage permanently by trying to sound in a live,
unamplified performance the way he sounded electronically. That
doesn't change the fact that some of Tagliavini's early recordings
sounded great, and still do.
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli did sing three of these arias during his heavily miked
concert at the Worcester Centrum Centre in April. All the work
preparing the recording benefited the audience: he sang these arias
considerably better in the Centrum than he does on the recording.
Also, during his spring American tour, Bocelli encountered a new
voice teacher; even in a few weeks of work, Bocelli made some
substantial technical advances _ one wishes the record had been
made after the tour rather than before.
</P>
<P>
   There's no getting around the bad news, which is that a
principal element of Bocelli's appeal is in short supply on this
album, and that is the intrinsic beauty of his timbre, which the
microphone adores. There has always been an element of strain in
his singing; like his predecessor Giuseppe di Stefano, Bocelli has
figured out how to use that effort for artistic effect _ strain
makes him sound earnest and sincere. But here he goes beyond sounds
distinctly stretched uncomfortable a good bit of the time, and the
consequence is that clouds pass over some of the sunlight in his
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Those who heard the unamplified Bocelli sing Massenet's
``Werther'' in Detroit know that nature has given him a very light
tenor voice. Verdi wrote several roles that can be effectively sung
by such an instrument. Bocelli sings arias from two of them, the
Duke in ``Rigoletto'' and Alfredo in ``La Traviata.'' He delivers
them attractively, with a good flourish in the cadenza in ``La
donna e mobile,'' and a vastly prolonged high D at the end of
``Possente amor.'' Is this the highest note Bocelli has recorded?
</P>
<P>
   One wishes he had sung more arias conceived for this weight of
voice. Most of his other choices from ``Ernani,'' ``Don Carlo,''
``Luisa Miller,'' and ``La Forza del Destino'' are associated with
greater heft; the microphone has to supply it rather than the
tenor. The results are only intermittently convincing, although
Bocelli's delivery of the sound and intent of his own language is
always remarkable. There are a few surprises _ ``Di quella pira''
has a fair amount of punch and panache, and it is very unsual to
hear it sung this accurately, and in the original key. (An
unidentified soprano supplies some phrases for Leonora that are
invariably cut from theater performances.) In a press kit
interview, Bocelli confesses that this piece was a challenge for
him from the start, ``an aria that requires `agilita' (agility) and
`forza' (force) and that I always carefully avoided singing, but
which was more or less a must for this album. Consequently I had to
study it, and I worked very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli must have worked very hard on ``Celeste Aida'' as well.
This aria rides over some rough patches in virtually every tenor's
voice. Bocelli sings the aria as a love song, not a showstopper,
and emerges honorably from the contest, crowning the final phrase
with a spectacular diminuendo on the final high B-flat _ an effect
favored by his teacher and mentor, Franco Corelli, and that others
seldom attempt. (On a Met broadcast, Carlo Bergonzi tried it and
cracked wide open). Bocelli does join the majority of tenordom by
skipping the trills in ``Ah si, ben mio'' from ``Il Trovatore,''
but otherwise he isn't a shirker _ he takes the big jumps in the
barcarolle from ``Un Ballo in Maschera'' that other tenors
sometimes rewrite, although one wishes he wouldn't sound so careful
about them. The purpose of those jumps is to bring out the
daredevil in the singer.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the arias are performed as complete scenes, with
introductory recitative, aria, and, where one exists, rousing
concluding cabaletta; if Verdi calls for the chorus, the forces of
the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino chime in. For some reason _ the
length of the CD? _ Bocelli does omit the dramatic recitative that
precedes Riccardo's last-act aria from ``Un Ballo in Maschera'' _
but that choice is better than singing the recitative and omitting
the aria, which is what Jussi Bjoerling used to do.
</P>
<P>
   One artistic flaw of the recording is that it is programmed like
a pop album; mood flow takes precedence over other musical and
historical considerations. Carlo Bergonzi made one of the great
Verdi albums when he sang all the principal arias from all of the
operas, in chronological order; most tenor recitals at least group
arias from the same opera together, and in the order in which they
appear. Not Bocelli, who leads off with the rousing ``Di quella
pira'' from ``Il Trovatore'' and follows it by ``Ah, si ben mio''
from the same opera that immediately precedes it _ directly
reversing the order Verdi intended. He sings an aria from the end
of ``Rigoletto,'' then two arias from ``Un Ballo in Maschera''
before returning for an aria and cabaletta from an earlier act of
``Rigoletto.''
</P>
<P>
   This album gives some reason for worry _ as does the
announcement that Bocelli plans to sing ``Aida'' on stage, which he
shouldn't try, along with ``Tosca'' and ``L'Amico Fritz,'' which
might work. A recording of ``La Boheme'' is scheduled for release
next month, and he is supposed to record the Verdi Requiem with
Renee Fleming, Olga Borodina, Ildebrando d'Archangelo, and
conductor Valery Gergiev this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli has assets he shouldn't squander the way di Stefano did;
Alfredo Kraus and Tito Schipa stayed within their voices and both
were still singing successfully at 70. Too often, Bocelli is
singing well beyond his voice, even with the help of the
microphone. He hasn't done himself permanent damage _ he sounded
better in Worcester and in Paris (where I heard him both
unamplified in the rehearsal room and in the amplified concert)
than he does on this new record. But there is still reason to
worry.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this writer stands firmly in Bocelli's corner. One
reason lies in conversations within the last couple of years with
Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, and Jose Carreras. The three
tenors really don't have that much in common, and the only thing
all three of them said is that they would never have pursued a
career in singing and in opera if it hadn't been for Mario Lanza _
who sang in only two operatic productions onstage, but whose films
and recordings reached people in a way that no mainstream opera
singer of his era ever did. Bocelli isn't like Lanza at all, but he
has the same kind of mass appeal. We can only hope that his
recordings, concerts, and videos will attract three tenor teenagers
as talented as Pavarotti, Domingo, and Carreras to the world of
opera.
</P>
<P>
   While Bocelli may not be in the class of the Big Three or
several others, he is nevertheless a more honest, pleasing,
stylish, and musical singer than many colleagues active on the
operatic stage and in the recording studio; last spring, in Paris,
even Seiji Ozawa was impressed with the elegance and style of
Bocelli's phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli is also living a fantasy of every opera lover, including
himself; against every expectation, he has awakened the tenor
within.

BUSH'S STRATEGY ON HEALTH CARE: LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Redbaiting is the Bush strategy on health care.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, President George Herbert Walker Bush was surrounded by
spiraling health care costs and 37 million uninsured families.
Beholden to health care industry PACs, Bush produced no plan other
than a miniscule tax cut and telling people not to drink, smoke and
wear your seat belts. He tried to turn any discussion about
controlling costs into hammers and sickles.
</P>
<P>
   When some Democrats in Congress talked about a more national
health care system, Bush railed, ``I am going to fight a
nationalized, socialized medicine approach for this country.'' Bush
added, ``They think socialized medicine _ everything provided by
the government, totally government-controlled medical care is just
the ticket . . . It's also the ticket for treatment waiting lines.
Anyone who has spent months checking the mail for that income tax
refund, or tried to track down a missing Social Security check, or
wasted a day in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles is going
to think long and hard before the let the government play doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Bush's son, George W., is running for
president. Now we have 44 million Americans without health
insurance (The senior Bush may have lost with his redbaiting, but
the health care industry did not).
</P>
<P>
   Democratic rival Al Gore has scored points with voters by
seizing upon health care. Gore has singled out some drug companies
for price gouging and promised health insurance for all children,
and a prescription drug benefit. Gore says America should move
``step by step'' toward universal coverage. That may be too
incremental for hard-core advocates of a national system, but it is
light years ahead of George W. George W. had no plan coming out of
his convention and his new, economy-sized prescription drug plan
was crafted as to not offend health care industries like
pharmaceuticals, which give three times more money to the
Republican Party than to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves George W. reaching into his daddy's tackle box to
pull out more red bait. His press aides call Gore's attack on
pharmaceuticals a ``nationalized drug plan,'' ``similar to Hillary
Clinton's attempt to nationalize health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Why George W. thinks he can fish with this bait better than his
father is a mystery, since Americans remain highly concerned about
health care. Yet, that is probably the only strategy George W. has.
He certainly cannot run on his record as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the nation were like Texas:
</P>
<P>
   --27 percent of people under 65 would be uninsured, according to
federal data, the second-worst percentage of any state in the
nation;
</P>
<P>
   --51 percent of low-income adults would be uninsured, worst in
the nation, according to federal figures.
</P>
<P>
   --12 percent of people with family income over the national
median income would be uninsured, worst in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   --One out of every four pregnant mothers would go without
prenatal care her first trimester, the fourth worst percentage in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   --14 percent of people would not visit a doctor because of cost,
the seventh-worst percentage in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   --Only 35 percent of low income people under 65 would have
Medicaid, the ninth-worst percentage in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   --The percentage of uninsured people would skyrocket. From 1998
to 1999, Texas had the nation's worst decline in parent enrollment
in Medicaid, a 30 percent drop. From 1996 to 1999, Texas had the
worst decline in enrollment of children in Medicaid, a 14 percent
drop. Texas has 600,000 children who are eligible for Medicaid
coverage but are not enrolled because Texas did not provide the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says ``I offer new ideas, ideas that are working.'' The
question is, ``Where?'' Certainly not in Texas. Last month a
federal judge, saying ``a poor and often-isolated population should
not be robbed of their right to services,'' ruled that Texas has
denied proper care to one million low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   The problems include a teenager with cerebral palsy who waited
more than a year for a wheelchair, jamming children into ``grossly
inadequate and incomplete'' checkups, and providing so little
information about services available under Medicaid that one
million children in the state did not see a dentist last year. That
resulted in emergency room cases of oral infections, dehydration,
fevers, and malnourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may not agree on to how to fix the health care system,
detesting the profiteering of private providers but conditioned to
be leery of a Canadian single-payer system. But no one wants to see
the health care system of Texas exported to America. It is a
measure of Bush's desperation on this issue that he has already
reached for a tactic that failed his dad.
</P>
<P>
   When the elder Bush insinuated that universal health care would
turn Mayo Clinics into Mao Centers, he was exposed as out of touch.
George W. is trying to do the same thing, with a Texas record no
one wants to touch. Bush will be waiting at the shore a long time.
The voters will not be biting.

JFK LIBRARY, UMASS STILL HOPE FOR PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The debate over the presidential debates was already
well engaged last spring when Paul G. Kirk Jr. realized no New
England institution had applied to host the quadrennial forums that
attract an average 75 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   An idea seized Kirk, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential
Debates and chairman of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation
board of directors: a presidential debate hosted by his library and
the University of Massachusetts at Boston would boost both out of
their relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just obvious to me that there was a void in the area,
and there was a natural nexus between the JFK Library and
UMass-Boston,'' said Kirk, who served as chairman of the Democratic
Party from 1985 to 1989. ``I thought I'd be shirking my
responsibilities if I didn't encourage a local university to send a
bid to the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, no one raised a conflict-of-interest flag about Kirk
lobbying for an institution of which he is a member nor was much
made about the possibility of the library memorializing a
Democratic president co-hosting a debate. Concerns didn't emerge
until the past few weeks when Texas Governor George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee, refused to accept the commission's
schedule _ explicitly casting doubt on his appearing at the Boston
debate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the city's campaign for the debate can be traced back
to 1992 when members of the commission, a bipartisan group formed
in 1987 to end squabbling over presidential debates, mentioned
interest in one of the nation's 10 presidential libraries
sponsoring a debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, a lot of our directors have an interest in certain
sites,'' said Janet Brown, the commission's executive director.
``But board members understand, regardless of their particular
preference, the single threshold is whether a site meets the
requirements to hold a first-rate debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, however, none of the non-partisan, federally
funded libraries made a serious bid. Of the 48 institutions who
sent the commission proposals by June 1999, the only one that
included a presidential library came from the University of
Southern California and the nearby Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library. But that proposal quickly fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a New England application spurred Kirk to call
Sherry Penney, the chancellor of UMass-Boston and an old friend,
who also serves on the library's board. Kirk knew the library
didn't have enough room to host the debate on its own. He also knew
that universities, neutral settings that have long been the venue
of choice for presidential debates, are more likely get the
commission's nod.
</P>
<P>
   When Penny received the call that day in late June, Kirk's idea
immediately appealed to her. She understood UMass-Boston, an
up-and-coming urban school of 13,000 working-class commuter
students, could benefit enormously from national exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a tremendous amount to us,'' Penney said in a phone
interview. ``It is so germane and important to our mission. And
it's a wonderful fit with the Kennedy Library.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, with staffs at both institutions impressed by
the promising publicity, UMass and the JFK Library sent in a formal
application. Within weeks, commission staff traveled to Boston to
assess the site: whether the school's gym had sufficient air
conditioning, which TV cameras require; if the debate area had the
right dimensions, at least 17,000 square feet; and whether there
would be enough space for the expected 2,000 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The staff approved the facilities and in October the commission
named the university one of 12 potential sites for the three
presidential debates and one vice presidential debate. Other sites
included Michigan State University, the University of Portland in
Oregon, and the St. Petersburg Times in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Mayor Thomas M. Menino and Senator Edward M.
Kennedy hosted a breakfast in which local residents and corporate
chiefs pledged $575,000 to cover the debate's production costs, the
minimum a site must raise to qualify as a host. More than 25 local
companies eventually pledged money, including the Globe, The Boston
Herald, the Boston Red Sox, Fleet Bank, and Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from Governor Paul Cellucci to Senator John F. Kerry
sent the commission letters promoting the Boston debate. Paul
Guzzi, president of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, helped
corral the cash.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments Boston officials put forth to the commission
included ``the new millennium's first debate should be in Boston
because it's the cradle of American democracy and it's the 40th
anniversary of the first televised debate between John F. Kennedy
and (Richard) Nixon,'' said Tom McNaught, the JFK Library's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The push paid off. In January, the commission announced that
UMass-Boston's Clark Athletic Center would be the first of the four
sites to host a debate.
</P>
<P>
   In a later Globe op-ed piece signed by Penney, Kirk, and
University of Massachusetts president William M. Bulger, the three
described how the city's first televised presidential debate would
be ``a unique opportunity for national and international attention,
commercial benefit, local pride, and most important, civic
education.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's decision set in motion a host of costly
preparations _ paving grassy areas to support candidates'
double-wide trailers and TV trucks, replacing ceiling tiles to
support light fixtures, rewiring portions of the athletic center to
accommodate reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It also prompted both the university and library to plan months
of related lectures and voter-education projects, including a
speech by former presidential adviser David Gergen called
``Eyewitness to Power,'' a talk by veteran White House reporter
Helen Thomas titled ``Thank You Mr. President,'' and a panel
discussion on the presidential candidates featuring, among others,
Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne.
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than a year's worth of planning and the more than
$1.6 million raised, the campaign to host a presidential debate in
Boston is now in jeopardy. George W. Bush continues to reject the
commission's plan, even though its 12 members, made up of
Republicans and Democrats, unanimously chose UMass-Boston for the
Oct. 3d debate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the four commission debates have been designed to
ensure a maximum TV audience, Bush has proposed an alternative
debate schedule, specifically excluding Boston. His plan promises
to steer clear of Democratic turf. ``At face value,'' a Bush
official told reporters, ``it seems difficult to argue that (the
UMass campus) is neutral territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of the key players in bringing the debate here are
holding out hope their work won't be for naught. After the city
lost out to Los Angeles as the host of this year's Democratic Party
convention, local officials don't want to lose another chance at,
at least briefly, capturing a place in the national political
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   And for now, UMass-Boston officials are going ahead with
preparations, signing a contract for electrical work that will cost
$120,000 to $165,000. Within two weeks, unless the commission
officially pulls the plug, UMass will complete production work
expected to cost between $250,000 to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not predicting it's going to be a loss,'' Penney said.
``We're pushing ahead and all the events will be held. At the
least, we hope this heightens awareness about the electoral
process.''

AFTER BURYING RWANDA DEAD, PEACEKEEPER COMFORTS KILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Her first job was to bury corpses, tens of
thousands of them.
</P>
<P>
   Her next job is to prepare Rwanda for the release of thousands
of the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Aloisea Inyumba, executive secretary of Rwanda's National Unity
and Reconciliation Commission, is at the vortex of a risky
experiment designed to help her nation move forward from its 100
days of genocide in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly anonymous in the swirl of activity at the United Nations
Millennium Summit this week, Inyumba is part of the small Rwandan
delegation. She is held up by the government as a bright light at a
time of persistent international criticism over Rwanda's part in
escalating the multi-nation war in the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Inyumba, 34, a Tutsi party loyalist, also belongs to a second,
more loosely formed group, both global and gender-specific: an
initiative called Women Waging Peace, launched last year at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government by Swanee Hunt, the
former US ambassador to Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``She,'' said Hunt, nodding to Inyumba over a table at the Four
Seasons Hotel in Manhattan, ``has a hell of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, director of the Kennedy School's Women and Public Policy
Program, founded Women Waging Peace to recognize and publicize the
roles of women engaged in preventing conflicts and sustaining
peace. But she also wanted to help women leaders find other women
like them around the world in order to build a support network and
exchange ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan woman, she believes, is one of her stars. ``Spend an
hour with Aloisea and you walk away a changed person,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Inyumba, who lived in exile in Uganda until the end of the
genocide, lost two brothers in the fighting, in which an estimated
800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus lost their lives in a spasm of
Hutu-led killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems I am selfish talking about my family, when other
people lost everybody,'' she said, adding that in her family, ``I
still have four people alive.''
</P>
<P>
   When she returned as part of the Tutsi government, she oversaw
much of the burials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just removed people from the hills and buried them with
some dignity. You know, we haven't yet finished burying the dead.
Some are in bad shape, in swamps. One of the issues we have now is
how do we ask these victims to forgive the killers when the bodies
haven't all been taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a system called the gacaca (pronounced GA-cha-cha), named
after traditional village courts, Rwanda's justice ministry and
Inyumba's commission hope to begin releasing almost all of the
estimated 150,000 prisoners to thousands of local _ and mostly
untrained _ judges. The prisoners, who have been held in what human
rights groups call inhumane conditions, will return to the sites of
their alleged crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan authorities, who hope to complete the details of the
judicial plan in two months, have devised a four-tier system of
punishment, dividing the groups into the masterminds; the people
who killed in the hundreds; those who slayed tens of people; and
those who told the killers where to find hiding Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   While the sentencing guidelines haven't been finalized, Inyumba
said that some people who killed a dozen or fewer people could be
sentenced to community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you say that someone who killed 10 people is not very
bad?'' Inyumba asked. ``You say, `Well, others killed 300.' At
least they will have served seven years in jail and we will put
them to work to do some good.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the previous regime, if you killed, you were glorified.
The culture of hate has been so institutionalized in our system.
That will end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt called the planned program a ``very imperfect system to
deal with an impossible situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This effort is as big as South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission. It's going to be terribly uneven. But
now you have all those thousands of people languishing in prison,''
Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Des Forges, a consultant to Human Rights Watch who has
studied the Great Lakes region of Africa for 30 years, agreed that
Rwanda had to act to end the prison logjam. At the time of the
genocide, Inyumba noted, Rwanda had only 50 lawyers in the country.
There was no way, she said, that enough lawyers could be trained to
deal with the backlog of cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Des Forges found fault in the lack of representation for the
accused. ``All the weight of the state is added to the prosection,
while the person accused is denied any help,'' she said. ``That
seems to us to possibly result in a whole series of unfair
judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   She also questioned the human rights commission's role in
setting up so-called solidarity camps, in which she said some
participants are given weapons training. And Des Forges, like many
others, criticized Rwanda's continued role in the Congo war.
</P>
<P>
   Inyumba said the government was fighting in the Congo to uproot
those who led the genocide campaign. ``What happens in the Congo
has a direct effect on us,'' she said. ``Those people moved just a
few miles from our border.''
</P>
<P>
   The continued militarization of Rwanda adds yet another
complication for someone preaching reconcilation in the years
following the worst episode of genocide since the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But Inyumba holds onto hope. She mentioned the closing of 70
orphanages after hundreds of families adopted children. ``We had
children who were Tutsi adopted by Hutu families,'' she said. ``I
said to myself, `Oh my God, am I doing the right thing?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine?'' said Hunt, leaning close to Inyumba. ``That
is like asking Jews to adopt German babies after the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Inyumba continued: ``When people talk about success, they
usually talk about political participation. But I talk about
children as a way of becoming successful. So look at the children
who were adopted. That is success.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, she said, she has heard of no problems with the Tutsi
children in the Hutu families.

 &HT;    LEGAL FIGHT OVER CENSUS DATA COULD SHAPE POLITICS FOR A DECADE
 &HT;    Eds: Updates 3rd and 11th grafs with court action Thursday.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Sunday, Sept. 10.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle brewing in a federal courthouse here
could shape America's political landscape for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court's review of a Virginia election law has emerged
as an all-important test case in the politically charged issue of
whether states should redraw their legislative districts next year
using raw census results or statistically adjusted data.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen major U.S. cities and counties, including Miami, Houston
and Los Angeles, are fighting the law, passed earlier this year by
the Republican-dominated legislature in the capital, Richmond. The
law mandates the use of raw population numbers on which to base
Virginia's political mapmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Urban areas, with large minority populations traditionally
undercounted by the census, fear the Virginia law will set a
national precedent as states prepare to redraw legislative
boundaries based on the results of the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Four other states with GOP-controlled legislatures _ Alaska,
Arizona, Colorado and Kansas _ have approved similar laws barring
the use of adjusted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that the method, known as sampling, is necessary
to correct the undercount and ensure that federal spending based on
the census reaches the poorer areas that need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say sampling is merely a means of boosting the
census numbers _ and political clout in urban Democratic
strongholds _ with people who may or may not be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sampling is really no more than educated guesswork,'' said
David Botkins, spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Mark Earley.
``Census means count, it does not mean guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Virginia law claim it will discriminate against
minorities, who are traditionally undercounted by the census and
thus will be underrepresented by skewed political boundaries based
on unadjusted population figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This undermines the principle of 'one person, one vote' by
virtually assuring us that voting districts will not be the same
size, and it practically guarantees an undercount of racial
minorities,'' said Kent Willis, executive director of the American
Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, which has joined the suit.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court in Washington
will hear preliminary arguments in the Virginia case on Sept. 21.
The court ruled Thursday that major cities, including Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Houston, Miami and Richmond, can join the lawsuit
against Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court last year upheld a Republican claim that
unadjusted census figures should be used in apportioning the 435
seats in the House of Representatives among the states. But the
ruling seemed to suggest that it was up to the states to determine
whether to use adjusted data or the actual count for redrawing
congressional, state and local district boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Census Bureau plans to release two sets of
numbers next year _ the raw count and the adjusted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia case is being widely viewed by state officials and
legal scholars as a legal fight that eventually will make its way
to the Supreme Court, giving the high court an opportunity to
clarify its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake. Control of redistricting can determine the
partisan balance in state legislatures and the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   And most experts believe the season of lawsuits regarding
redistricting and the census has only begun. Redistricting
following the 1990 census generated litigation in 41 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming there is no perfectly clear Supreme Court decision,
no booming voice telling states that this is the way to do it, all
the states are vulnerable, no matter what set of data they use,''
said Tim Storey, a redistricting specialist with the Denver-based
National Association of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question isn't if, but when _ will the decision come
early next year before states must do their redistricting, or will
it come afterward when everyone is stuck trying to decide if they
have done the wrong thing or the right thing?'' said Dale Oldham, a
lawyer and redistricting specialist for the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As part of the 2000 census of America's 120 million households,
the Census Bureau is gathering demographic statistics from 314,000
households to adjust population counts in areas as small as city
blocks. The method, known as sampling, is based on a mathematical
formula regarded by demographers as a reliable way to fine-tune the
census to account for millions of people missed in the traditional
count.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census failed to count about 4 million people, and was
more likely to miss minorities, the poor and children, according to
Census Bureau estimates. About 4.4 percent of all blacks were not
counted and nearly 5 percent of Hispanics were missed, according to
the post-census review.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, Census Bureau officials will hold a hearing at the
National Academy of Sciences to review the process their experts
will use to adjust the count. If the Census Bureau and the National
Academy of Sciences find no fault with the scientific methods being
used, the adjusted numbers will be released early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good numbers are critical to a good democracy,'' said Kenneth
Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau, which is not a party in the
Virginia lawsuit. ``It starts with the assumption that it is
impossible to count everyone. The census is an estimate of a true
count, and we believe we should do everything possible to make the
census a better estimate, a better count.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is one of 16 states which must submit changes in its
electoral laws to the Department of Justice for review under the
1965 Voting Rights Act. In effect, the state sued the Justice
Department seeking a federal review of the law barring adjusted
census numbers in an attempt to clarify the issue before the state
lawmakers must begin redrawing boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for Virginia and Virginians to have swift,
timely elections and that they not be delayed by litigation,''
Botkins said.

`GUN' DRAWS A BEAD ON TARANTINO AND SCORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE WAY OF THE GUN 
Written and directed by: Christopher McQuarrie 
Starring: Ryan Philippe, Benicio Del Toro, Juliette Lewis, Taye
Diggs, Nicky Katt, Scott Wilson, James Caan, Dylan Kussman, Kristin
Lehman 
Running time: 119 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violence/gore, language and some sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having written the screenplay for ``The Usual Suspects,''
Christopher McQuarrie takes his place behind the camera as well as
behind the word processor for ``The Way of the Gun'' and doesn't
quite out-Tarantino Quentin Tarantino, but does stay with him most
of the way. Despite an ending that gets away from him, McQuarrie's
``The Way of the Gun'' is the best Tarantino spinoff yet. The
reason is that no matter how violent things get _ and the air gets
pretty thick with bullets _ his thugs and grifters never lose sight
of the main thing, which is their exuberant delight in playing to
the most appreciative audiences they could have, namely one
another.
</P>
<P>
   For all its flying ammo, ``The Way of the Gun'' is the sum total
of its nonstop stylizations. Never deluding itself into thinking
it's naturalistic, the film is flamboyantly operatic, with big
arias and set pieces for its various lowlifes. It revels in its
written quality, with each character getting plenty of juicy
pronouncements as its outrageous crimes escalate. It's not so much
pulp fiction as it is pulp Verdi for the eyes, riding a highly
theatrical fatalism best embodied by Benicio Del Toro and Ryan
Philippe, as a pair of murderous drifters. Stumbling into a piece
of unanticipated information while visiting a sperm bank to earn
some quick money, they improvise a scheme to kidnap and hold for
ransom the pregnant mom-for-hire in the employ of an aging mobster
whose young blonde second wife wants a baby without the
inconvenience of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Punchy as a lot of the dialogue is, the film is at its best in
the glances of complicity exchanged by Del Toro and Philippe as
they move in on what they anticipate will be a big payoff. This
involves keeping Juliette Lewis's pregnant surrogate mom intact
until they can collect their money and live to spend it. They are
not naive about the risk. They're more unnerved than they care to
admit at the aplomb displayed by James Caan's bagman, who cuts
through his usual fatalistic-shrug-ridden gangster shtick to remind
them that while he may appear to be an old man, he obviously is a
survivor. Nor is Scott Wilson's boss mobster the kind of man to
hold still for a shakedown. He gives his own hired heavies a chance
to redeem themselves from the disgrace of allowing the pregnant
woman to have been snatched away from them in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   McQuarrie's feel for the diverting tangent keeps the film from
lapsing into dumb linearity. Part of the fun arises from the fact
that nobody's hands are clean here, and that all sorts of
deviousness are afoot. There's quirky humor, too, ranging from
running jokes about cell-phone reception along the Mexican border
to the moment when Caan gets on the phone to a hired gun and the
guy on the other end is prevented by the phone call from pulling
the trigger on his own suicide. Little things _ the throb of an
idling semi, Del Toro yanking Philippe back from a tender impulse
felt for the pregnant captive _ count for a lot here. ``The Way of
the Gun'' sometimes trips over its own contrivance, especially at
the ammo-ridden end. But most of the time McQuarrie and his cast _
especially Del Toro, Philippe, and Lewis delivering her best,
grittiest work in years _ make it crackle.

THE AUTUMN HEART

   The big thing that ``The Autumn Heart'' has going for it is the
raw urgency of its intense emotions. The big thing that ``The
Autumn Heart'' has working against it is the raw urgency of its
intense emotions _ or, rather, that the film finds no way to keep
them from seeming blatantly contrived. Too bad, because it's a
fundamentally sympathetic study of a split family trying to come
together 20 years after a bitter divorce and it has some affecting
performances, especially from its women. They're the ones left
behind in a blue-collar part of the North Shore and would have
remained walled off by their anger and hurt feelings. But when the
family's school bus-driving matriarch has a heart attack, she asks
her three grown daughters to find their father and the now-grown
son he took with him.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that while they're only several miles apart
geographically, they're a world or two apart on the socioeconomic
ladder. Pushing on, although they're taking a risk by venturing
beyond their longstanding enmity, they discover that their father
has prospered and is a computer millionaire, while their grown-up
little brother is going to Harvard and is engaged to a moneyed
fiancee. Let it be said that the acting is terrific, particularly
when Ally Sheedy makes us feel how hard she has to fight to keep
her sustaining anger intact, and how conflicted she feels when she
discovers that her father not only isn't a monster, but stayed away
in part because he was told to.
</P>
<P>
   If Sheedy does the job with cold fury and hot eruptiveness, Tyne
Daly skirts some awfully melodramatic writing as the mom in her bed
in the cardiac unit, reminding us how much emotion can be conveyed
by making us feel, behind her tight-lipped stolidity, the effort it
takes to keep it inside. As the well-intentioned brother,
scriptwriter Davidlee Willson is rather eclipsed by the trio of
sisters, played by Sheedy, Marceline Hugot, a pillar of
working-class endurance, and Marla Sucharetza, who won my sympathy
for her ability to cope with being the character most heavily laden
with blue-collar cliches.
</P>
<P>
   What ``The Autumn Heart'' desperately needs is some shadings and
nuances to leaven the simplistic dimensions of its primal
outpourings. Sucharetza makes the youngest sister, with her
conciliatory nature, much more interesting and faceted than the
writing and costuming. They relegate her to a stereotype who
guzzles beer at her natural habitat, a bowling alley, and shows up
at a shower for her brother's snooty fiancee wearing teased hair
and a faux leopard-skin-patterened miniskirt. It would have been
more believable if the rich people were the ones who behaved
crassly and the working-class women, made to feel out of place, had
been on their best and most muted behavior. In ``The Autumn
Heart,'' a crude delivery system isn't up to what it's asked to
deliver.

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO SEEKS ROLE IN POSSIBLE VIETNAM TRADE MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ILENE LELCHUK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton, who in July signed a sweeping
trade pact to normalize relations with Vietnam for the first time
since the fall of Saigon, has expressed interest in visiting the
communist country in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is not announcing any official travel plans but
San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, a Democrat who has been a strong
Clinton supporter, said he would like to be included on a trade
mission if the president goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a close working relationship with Vietnam,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 Vietnamese-American live in San Francisco and
its sister city is Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). Vietnam
selected San Francisco for its first American consulate in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton makes the trip, another symbol of good faith and
reconciliation, he would be the first president since Richard Nixon
to set foot in Vietnam since the war ended 25 years ago. Clinton's
own history with the country has been widely publicized and
debated. He opposed the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam conflict as
a youth and used student deferments to avoid the draft.
</P>
<P>
   This would be Brown's second trip to Vietnam on behalf of the
city. He first traveled there as part of an Asian goodwill visit in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco doesn't have California's largest
Vietnamese-American community _ about 300,000 live in Orange County
and 120,000 live in San Jose _ but San Francisco has been on the
forefront of forging a relationship with post-war Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Vietnamese-Americans here soared between 1975 and
1992 when refugees, the so-called boat people, fled the communist
regime. Many settled in the Tenderloin neighborhood of downtown San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees' ties to their homeland remain strong, because of
families and memories left behind, which makes the issue of
normalizing U.S-Vietnamese trade relations an emotional subject.
Not everyone is happy about the president's possible trip while
others welcome it.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Nguyen, executive director of the Southeast Asian
Community Center in San Francisco, said the trade accord is a vital
economic tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the development of trade between the two cities, this is
a necessary step toward democracy in Vietnam,'' Nguyen said.
``Otherwise, they would close their doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, 55, lived in Saigon until 1984, when he, his wife and
two sons escaped on a 30-foot-long boat with about 80 other people
seeking political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Yen Nguyenle, who works with Nguyen at the community center and
is a member of the Ho Chi Minh Sister City Committee, left the
country in 1979 when she was 15. Her father, who was held in a
re-education camp there until 1983, didn't join the family in the
United States until 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyenle, 36, said she is excited about Clinton's trade mission.
She hopes Brown and members of the sister city committee, which
takes annual trips there already, will be invited.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. businesses, a new trade agreement opens a market of
almost 80 million Vietnamese consumers who can buy U.S. goods and
services, especially in the telecommunication, banking and
high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam trade has been heavily taxed, with tariffs averaging 40
percent on goods exported to the United States. With normalized
trade relations, tariffs could drop as low as 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The trade pact signed by Clinton in July is still awaiting
congressional approval.

IN SPITE OF FLAMEOUTS, A GOOD DIGITAL YEAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a year has made in the digital entertainment
world. Just ask Jason McCabe Calcanis, the peripatetic
editor/founder of New York's Silicon Alley Reporter and its SoCal
sister publication, the Digital Coast Reporter. Calcanis has
watched some spectacular flameouts and the rise of promising new
entertainment sites as the Web, especially in Los Angeles' back
yard, starts to actually show people a good time.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the frenetic Calcanis will be even busier than usual,
presiding over the second Digital Coast Conference at the Directors
Guild of America headquarters in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the conference featured one of the more incendiary
moments of any such show in memory (which, admittedly, isn't saying
much). During a panel on online entertainment, then-Sony executive
Rob Tercek tartly wondered how DEN could make money given its small
audiences and high overhead. It would make more sense, he said, to
burn $100 bills on the street corner.
</P>
<P>
   DEN President David Newman, who was also on the panel, erupted
in anger. The resulting exchange made for better entertainment than
anything DEN ever put online before it shut down amid sex scandals
and massive overspending.
</P>
<P>
   ``That company caused more bad PR for digital entertainment than
anybody,'' said Calcanis. ``They caused a big part of the
reluctance'' shown by many investors in online entertainment in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Tercek left Sony, too, part of a remarkable recent hemorrhage of
top executive talent from that company. He's now president of
programming at Packet Video, and will be this year's opening day
keynote speaker, talking about putting entertainment and
information on mobile systems of all kinds. Tercek will be
hard-pressed to duplicate the pyrotechnics of last year's panel,
though other groups, talking about issues such as online music,
promise some sparks.
</P>
<P>
   DEN's problems to the contrary, the year since the last Digital
Coast conference has been ``fabulous'' for the region's online
entertainment business, said Calcanis. He points to the huge
success of animation online (with several online series being
optioned for films and TV series); the hard lessons learned about
how much to spend making online content (hint: less than DEN); and
the explosion of excellent short films created by all kinds of
people for online viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a renaissance that's just starting to bubble
up that will be the equivalent to the rock `n' roll era of
filmmaking, when Scorsese and Coppola and films like `All the
President's Men,' `The Conversation,' and `Easy Rider' came along
and re-created film and took it to another sort of level and forced
a generational switch. I think that's what's about to happen in
short film.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than see the huge online explosion as a threat to
Hollywood, the upbeat Calcanis said it should open up a stultified
business to new sources of talent, new kinds of stories, and new
ways to tell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Hollywood will reinvent themselves and capitalize on
this shift in consumer taste and shift in talent,'' Calcanis said.
``Hollywood has always done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference speakers include basketball player (and Dunk.net
part-owner) Shaquille O'Neal and his agent, Leonard Armato;
Recording Industry Association of America CEO Hilary Rosen; the
U.S. Copyright Office's general counsel; Electronic Frontier
Foundation founder John Perry Barlow; comic book king Stan Lee;
film directors Wayne Wang and Penelope Spheeris; digital gurus Bill
Gross of Idealab! and Mark Cuban of Yahoo Broadcast Services; and
the cofounder of Serbian opposition radio station B92, Gordan
Paunovic.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day conference will also feature, like seemingly every
other conference these days, an awards show on Thursday. The
Digital Coast Awards will honor top online entertainment sites. For

   -Wham-O.com: The light-as-air site for the company that makes
Frisbees, Hacky Sacks, Hula Hoops and more. In the land of Endless
Summer, these guys ought to be the official toymakers. &QL; 
-Where: www.wham-o.com &QL; 
-What's cool: Gotta love the trivia and history sections (the
company got its name from a slingshot that it made), and it's fun
to peruse the variations on a Frisbee theme. Even better, a quick
click links you to Shrednow, an all-things-extreme sports site with
a very cool, minimalist design that opens you up to dozens of
obscure sports and pastimes, some of which just happen to involve
Wham-O products, along with chat and discussion boards and much
else. &QL; 
Features: Some areas remain under construction, such as ``Where to
Buy,'' but they do provide some great photos of people at the
Ultimate Frisbee championships and other competitions. There's also
useful information for inventors who would want to sell products to
the company, and tips about a dizzying array of new kinds of games
using Wham-O products (anyone for a game of birdie golf?). &QL; 
You'll like this if: You like your sports ... different. &QL;

THE GIFT THAT KEEPS GIVING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You feel it. You know you do. You're a parent of a child under
the age of about 10, and school has just started.
</P>
<P>
   Face it: while you're glad they have classwork to occupy him or
her for the next nine months, you have this sneaking suspicion that
you've banished your baby to a lifetime as a washed-out, alcoholic
barback in a semi-successful biker bar in Sandusky, Ohio, all
because you haven't gone out and bought a) a computer for your
beloved and b) all the newest and coolest educational software to
make learning fun.
</P>
<P>
   As for computers, Moore's Law continues to work its magic,
blessing anxious parents with the ability to buy powerful, cheap
machines that can do most things a little one would want, short of
calculating nuclear- weapons blast effects (for that, you'll need
Deep Blue's latest supercomputing successor).
</P>
<P>
   But short of those particular needs, Apple Computers just
released the newest family of its iMac computers, which make
wonderful machines for students, while taking up relatively little
room on their no-doubt cluttered bedroom desks.
</P>
<P>
   At $799 for the cheapest current model, the iMacs are powerful,
easy to use and stylish machines that are hard to resist for those
who want to choose a machine for their child that is similar to
what they are most likely using at schools.
</P>
<P>
   As wonderful as are the iMacs and their more powerful and
expensive big brothers, the G4 line of Power Macs, there are good
reasons to buy Windows-based PCs instead, especially if you're
using the machine too.
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, the adults in the house want to run many
specialized kinds of business software (other than art and other
creative programs), they'll need a machine that runs some flavor of
Microsoft's Windows operating system. Despite the many excellent
qualities of the iMac and Apple's resurgent fortunes, many of those
programs just aren't available in Mac format.
</P>
<P>
   If that's what you need, Dell's Dimension L series of computers
offer a nice package of features and power that should be
sufficient for most family needs at an attractive $899 price.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to buy from a company that actually has a store you
can visit (Dell sells only online and over the phone), anything
with a 500-megahertz Intel Celeron processor (or the equivalent and
somewhat cheaper AMD K6-2 chip) should be more than enough
horsepower. Intel's Pentium III and AMD's Athlon computer brains
provide a step up in power and are increasingly showing up in
extremely affordable mid-range systems such as the Dell.
</P>
<P>
   With all PCs, make sure you get at least 64 megabytes of RAM, or
memory, and make sure that you have a good-sized hard drive to
store all your stuff (6 to 10 gigabytes should be ample if you're
not too much of a digital packrat). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what about software for the new machine? A raft of new
titles has just hit the market, in anticipation of the return to
school. Unlike other kinds of software, most children's titles are
hybrid discs, with versions that run on Windows-based PCs and on
Apple Power Macs and iMacs. Generally, they all come with
technologies that seamlessly modulate the difficulty of problems
with the child's progress, easing the problems where a child has
trouble and stepping up the challenge when he or she has mastered a
level.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend seems to be the inclusion of various throw-in
older educational titles or other goodies, such as videos, that are
included in the box as an added incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly as well, these titles come with Internet
components, like Scholastic's I Spy Online, or even entire for-pay
services, such as the Blaster's Virtual Classroom disc that comes
the Math Blaster and Reading Blaster titles of Knowledge Adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, these titles are designed to make sure children have
a good time playing what seem to be games, even as they are
learning about language, math, problem-solving skills or other
challenges. Here then, with some help from my own two Personal
Entertainment Testing System units, Morningstar and Dakota, are
some titles of recent vintage worth checking out:
</P>
<P>
   Mia 2: Romaine's New Hat is the newest, science-oriented title
from Kutoka Kids, whose first Mia was such a lovely charmer. Again,
we have terrific 3-D graphics far better than are seen in most
children's titles (or any other software, for that matter), with
the sweet-natured mouse Mia once again needing help from the player
to navigate her way home through a challenging world.
</P>
<P>
   Kutoka thoughtfully includes directions for ``big kids'' to make
sure the little ones don't get frustrated at certain key points,
and there's a nice array of activities that teach children in the
early grades of school about various science issues. My two love
it, and it's easy to see why. It's a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge Adventure has long put out well-regarded educational
software that focuses on either specific subjects or grade levels.
</P>
<P>
   Its Math Blaster and Reading Blaster titles continue to impress,
each loaded with 300 lessons covering a wide range of reading or
math issues, and targeted to age spreads of a couple of years each.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is behind the seemingly omnipresent JumpStart
educational series, which now features titles for children as young
as 18 months up to sixth graders. The two-disc JumpStart First
Grade Deluxe covers a wide array of subjects, including music and
art, and comes with a separate videotape.
</P>
<P>
   (Another word to tech-anxious parents: there's little evidence
that your child will be forever stunted if she isn't working the
computer by her 19th month. (Her 19th (BEGIN ITAL)year(END ITAL)
might be another situation, but hey, Luddites need love, too.)
Particularly for the youngest children, (BEGIN ITAL)any(END ITAL)
computer interaction should be when they get interested, not when
you get anxious. They'll get interested soon enough just watching
you use the machine.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the toddler titles from both JumpStart and Disney
Interactive are nicely done, with lots of brightly illustrated,
simple activities for children who don't yet read but are starting
to get familiar with their ABCs, numbers, music and more.
</P>
<P>
   Disney relies on its stable of beloved characters to enliven
titles such as Mickey Mouse Preschool and Buzz Lightyear's Second
Grade. The characters provide familiar faces as students work
through math, reading, art and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar characters also grace two new titles from Infogrames:
Blue's Art Time Activities and Blue's Reading Time Activities. Like
the hit Nickelodeon program ``Blue's Clues'' upon which they are
based, the titles are designed for children between the ages of 3
and 6. They feature Blue the cartoon dog and the genial human host,
Steve, gently walking players through graphically simple but
engaging activities.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic has updated its terrific but somewhat aging I Spy
title with I Spy School Days, which significantly expands the range
of problems children aged 5 to 9 must solve as they gather clues
that in turn can be used to solve other brain teasers. The puzzles
and other ``brain-building games'' are clever in their
construction, subtly teaching children surprisingly sophisticated
logic skills, among much else.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic also just released I Spy Junior Puppet Playhouse,
which targets children between the ages of 3 and 5 with on-screen
puppeteering activities and a variety of other rhyming, sorting and
math problems. A playfully primitive graphic look will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   One last note: while all these programs promise to improve a
child's learning and comfort with computers, the best thing you can
do to encourage both is practice ``shoulder-to-shoulder'' learning
with them. Sit down next to your children as they work through the
titles; you'll be amazed what a difference it can make.

each loaded with 300 lessons covering a wide range of reading or
math issues, and targeted to age spreads of a couple of years each.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is behind the seemingly omnipresent JumpStart
educational series, which now features titles for children as young
as 18 months up to sixth graders. The two-disc JumpStart First
Grade Deluxe covers a wide array of subjects, including music and
art, and comes with a separate videotape.
</P>
<P>
   (Another word to tech-anxious parents: there's little evidence
that your child will be forever stunted if she isn't working the
computer by her 19th month. (Her 19th (BEGIN ITAL)year(END ITAL)
might be another situation, but hey, Luddites need love, too.)
Particularly for the youngest children, (BEGIN ITAL)any(END ITAL)
computer interaction should be when they get interested, not when
you get anxious. They'll get interested soon enough just watching
you use the machine.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the toddler titles from both JumpStart and Disney
Interactive are nicely done, with lots of brightly illustrated,
simple activities for children who don't yet read but are starting
to get familiar with their ABCs, numbers, music and more.
</P>
<P>
   Disney relies on its stable of beloved characters to enliven
titles such as Mickey Mouse Preschool and Buzz Lightyear's Second
Grade. The characters provide familiar faces as students work
through math, reading, art and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar characters also grace two new titles from Infogrames:
Blue's Art Time Activities and Blue's Reading Time Activities. Like
the hit Nickelodeon program ``Blue's Clues'' upon which they are
based, the titles are designed for children between the ages of 3
and 6. They feature Blue the cartoon dog and the genial human host,
Steve, gently walking players through graphically simple but
engaging activities.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic has updated its terrific but somewhat aging I Spy
title with I Spy School Days, which significantly expands the range
of problems children aged 5 to 9 must solve as they gather clues
that in turn can be used to solve other brain teasers. The puzzles
and other ``brain-building games'' are clever in their
construction, subtly teaching children surprisingly sophisticated
logic skills, among much else.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic also just released I Spy Junior Puppet Playhouse,
which targets children between the ages of 3 and 5 with on-screen
puppeteering activities and a variety of other rhyming, sorting and
math problems. A playfully primitive graphic look will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   One last note: while all these programs promise to improve a
child's learning and comfort with computers, the best thing you can
do to encourage both is practice ``shoulder-to-shoulder'' learning
with them. Sit down next to your children as they work through the
titles; you'll be amazed what a difference it can make.

WILL `CAST AWAY' BE A SURVIVOR?

<P>
   Note to anyone running into director Robert Zemeckis in the next
couple of months: Don't ask him about ``Survivor.'' He's a little
touchy about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you would be, too, if you had spent two years of your life
on a movie project called ``Cast Away,'' a realistic drama about a
workaholic (Tom Hanks) who winds up marooned on a desert island and
must cope with problems that go beyond the trifling troubles that
Rich and Rudy and the other ``Survivor'' contestants faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie is about one man's spiritual and psychological
journey,'' Zemeckis says. ``There are no tiki torches here, no
radios made from coconut shells.''
</P>
<P>
   Zemeckis shut down production of the film for nearly a year so
Hanks could lose weight and add a beard. In the interim, Zemeckis
and the ``Cast Away'' crew made ``What Lies Beneath,'' a decision
that the director calls an ``exaggerated Roger Corman thing, making
two movies for the price of one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was damn hard,'' Zemeckis says.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks had difficulties of his own losing 50 pounds after beefing
up to the play a prison guard in ``The Green Mile.'' (``In all
honesty, I was as big as a house there for a while,'' Hanks says.)
But worse than the diet, worse than the bushy beard (``It horrifies
people,'' Hanks says, ``and everybody hates it, including me'') was
acting in so many scenes by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard and pretty lonely sometimes,'' Hanks says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is,'' he adds, laughing, ``is that you don't
have to memorize so many lines because you're not talking to
anybody.'' (Dec. 22) &QL;

 &HT;    One soldier's story
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a party for his Sunday school class, Jim McLaughlin decided
to play a trivia game, asking his two dozen guests to jot down
something the others didn't know about them.
</P>
<P>
   On his own slip of paper, McLaughlin wrote: ``I did what Gore
did in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Al Gore's campaign publicizing his Vietnam service,
the group would probably be able to guess what McLaughlin meant:
He, like Gore, served as an enlisted Army journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most people would probably not be able to come up with a
job description for a such a position. The Army had reporters in
Vietnam? What for?
</P>
<P>
   Was that some kind of special post for the privileged?
</P>
<P>
   Not so, McLaughlin says. His Vietnam job had its perks, he says,
but it was far from cushy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very fortunate to come back in good shape, in one
piece,'' says McLaughlin. ``I was around an awful lot of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true, he says, that he and the thousands of other military
reporters and photographers were more fortunate than combat
soldiers. Much of McLaughlin's work consisted of covering ``grip
and grin'' awards ceremonies, held in secure areas. He wrote a lot
of articles about generals pinning Purple Hearts on wounded GIs.
</P>
<P>
   He ate hot meals, enjoyed hot showers, clean
</P>
<P>
   sheets and cold beer. He had women and men who'd clean his
quarters, clothes, offices and shoes for $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But he adds that he spent a lot of time traveling around the
country. Many journalists encountered land mines, snipers, even
full-blown firefights. More than 70 civilian reporters and
photographers were killed; no one has a count of casualties among
military journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody over there, if you got off base, you were never
completely safe,'' McLaughlin says.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin rode in truck convoys that came under sniper fire
several times and often hitched rides on helicopters. ``And a lot
of helicopters got shot down,'' McLaughlin says.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin didn't know Al Gore, so he can't directly compare his
war stint with the vice president's. But McLaughlin's tour was
typical what many Army journalists experienced in Vietnam _ a lot
of montony interspersed with serious work, danger and occasional
horror. Their service won the admiration of other vets.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta businessman Duke Doubleday, 57, was a combat officer who
was in the thick of many firefights. He lauds the service of
military journalists, including _ even though he staunchly opposes
Gore politically _ the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reporters I knew, military and civilian, begged to jump on
a helicopter and go with us,'' he says. ``They too were under fire
in countless instances, just doing the jobs they were sent to do.
Rockets, mortars and sapper attacks were not exclusively designed
for designated combat-trained individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sherman, 58, an Atlanta commercial photographer who ran an
Army photo lab in Vietnam, recalls one journalism assignment, which
seemed safe at the outset. ``Once we went up with a general to
shoot some pictures,'' he says, ``and we found some snipers.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Sherman: ``Just being in-country could limit your life real
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin was drafted in June 1967, only weeks after earning an
advertising degree from Southern Illinois University. ``It was
pretty shocking, even though I'd expected it,'' he says. He was
engaged to his college girlfriend at the time. (The couple waited
until his return in 1969 to marry. He and his wife, Jane, now have
a college-age son.)
</P>
<P>
   He was sent to clerk-typist school, but the Army changed his
military-occupational speciality to ``information specialist''
after he arrived in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fluke ... I guess because I had a background in
journalism. Nobody ever said.'' But McLaughlin was delighted. ``I
was actually doing something of substance, as opposed to just
typing out orders or commendation awards.''
</P>
<P>
   The job involved filing stories, often about awards or the
heroism of individual soldiers, for use by hometown newspapers. So
military journalists were popular among grunts, even though they
were sometimes derided for being able to return to the safety of
their bases.
</P>
<P>
   They also kept tabs on the brass. ``If I was going to go out
with a general,'' McLaughlin recalls, ``we'd call his driver and
ask, where is he going today? We'd drive behind his jeep in a press
truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the Army reporters would get stories in the
official newspaper Stars &AMP; Stripes. ``Getting in Stars &AMP; Stripes
was like hitting a home run,'' says McLaughlin, showing off a few
clips at his upscale home near Walton High School.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing, Army journalists had to take regular
turns manning guard towers with M-16 carbines. One night, that duty
got McLaughlin caught in a firefight. About 1 a.m., the Viet Cong
attacked a nearby mountain, and McLaughlin, along with other
guards, was ordered aboard a chopper that took him to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get thrown into a situation like that, it gets really
kind of scary,'' he says. ``You're trying to think, but there's so
much going on around you. You've got our jets coming in shooting
tracers, and that lights up the sky. You can't see very well.
You're scrambling around to get someplace where you've got some
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The VC, as was their practice, fled at dawn. When the fight
ended, McLaughlin found that a fellow GI had faked his death so
well that an enemy soldier had stolen his wristwatch.
</P>
<P>
   That indicent proved to be an aberration for McLaughlin. Though
he pulled occasional guard duty, he was never in combat again.
``Let's say the firefight wasn't the highlight of my tour,'' he
says. ``But that's what you do if you're an enlisted guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the time, the journalists stayed in their compounds, as
depicted in the Stanley Kubrick movie ``Full Metal Jacket.'' The
days passed slowly, and were often monotonous.
</P>
<P>
   Days began with breakfast at 6 a.m., and journalists were on
duty from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. He lived in a barracks with about 10
other men, but was allowed to wall off his own bedroom. ``The
lifers, the career guys, stayed at one end. We stayed toward the
other. You put up your mosquito netting and that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days, nothing happened, but American headquarters in Saigon
demanded at least one story a day from his group, no matter how
trivial.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, life on base was ``pretty comfortable,'' McLaughlin
says. ``Most of the time I could go to the rec room and drink a
beer. We had an air-conditioned photo lab with a refrigerator for
cold beer, and basically since we had film to trade, we could get
things like fresh lobster, bread, clothing. The bathroom had
running water, showers, but no flush toilets.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a beach nearby, but it was too polluted to enjoy
very much. McLaughlin wrote to his fiancee in Illinois almost every
day. There was a Red Cross library at the base, and he read all he
could.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin says he often volunteered to jump on a truck or
chopper _ ``just to get out and see things so you wouldn't be wired
to a desk all day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out on the road more than some of the others, not
because I was out to earn some Silver Star or Purple Heart, but I
just enjoyed being out and about,'' McLaughlin says. ``I liked the
airplanes, the choppers, getting the human-interest stories, seeing
what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Military journalists carried .45-caliber pistols and, but toted
M-16 carbines like the grunts when pulling guard duty. McLaughlin
can't remember whether he fired his M-16 that dark morning on the
mountain, but adds: ``I don't think I ever fired my .45. Not
once.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he did experience the horrors of war, and not just during
his night in combat. Pointing out a photo taken by his partner of
dead enemy soldiers, McLaughlin says he remembers vividly being
sickened at the scene. The Viet Cong, he adds, had been ``gunned
down in cold blood'' by South Korean allies of the South
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression that's stayed with me was all of the Vietnamese
people surrounding the bodies, oohing and aahing.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses: ``It's funny that until you got close to coming home,
you didn't worry too much about the danger. However, essentially,
it was around you most every day if you went off post to do a
story.''

&HT;     TEXAS REMAINS RESILIENT ABOUT BREAKING RETURN RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK WANGRIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Each night Ivan Williams relaxes, closes his
eyes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it visualization, but when you're trying to visualize
what he is, maybe dreaming is more accurate. That or hallucinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play the game in my head,'' the University of Texas kickoff
returner says, momentarily putting himself in character. ``I see
the opening kickoff. I see the ball in the air. I see myself
catching it. Everything that can possibly happen.''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes pop open and he frowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately,'' he said sheepishly, ``I've been visualizing getting
tripped up by the kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the lot of a UT kick returner, burdened not just with
weaving his way through 10 kamikaze pilots in cleats but by the
nation's longest streak without a return score _ 254 games and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been too long,'' Williams said of the streak, which
measures 674 attempts. ``Now is the time. Twenty-two years is a
long time. Most of us weren't even born.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, only 12 scholarship Longhorns were alive when
Johnny ``Lam'' Jones went 99 yards for a score against Southern
Methodist on Oct. 23, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The Horns call their return team ``Quick Six,'' and they break
the pre-kickoff huddle with the chant, ``Take it to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quick six _ that's what it is,'' Williams said. ``It can
happen in 13 seconds, 15 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it can not happen in 693,792,000 seconds, give or take a
couple hundred thousand.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such abject frustration, the Horns are nothing if
not resilient.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, speedy Montrell Flowers vowed to take one back for a
touchdown on opening night against North Carolina State. He wound
up returning two all year _ for a total of 31 yards.
</P>
<P>
   This year, speedy Victor Ike will be the main returner. Asked if
he learned anything from Flowers' boasts a year ago, Ike said, ``If
we do what we can do, what ability is, we'll take one to the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ``We have a whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, returning kickoffs has rarely been easier.
Last year in NCAA Division I-A, 90.1 percent of all kickoffs were
returned, the highest figure since 1956. Of those 4,554 returns, 40
went for touchdowns. The average return was 20.3 yards,
fourth-highest since the NCAA began keeping the statistic in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tight ends coach Tim Brewster, who doubles as kickoff
return coach, is well aware of the streak. He doesn't emphasize it,
knowing that each failed attempt would only add to the pressure.
All he stresses is that his charges average the 30-yard-line per
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it's incredible at the University of Texas to
have a streak that long, with all the great returners we've had. ''
Brewster said. ``Everybody understands it doesn't happen often. If
you have one or two (a year), you've done real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two deep backs, the 240-pound Williams is supposed to
lead the 200-pound Ike into the wedge and, hopefully, a seam.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're looking for is a crease,'' Brewster said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brewster said the Horns have gone with bigger returners this
year because on every return they'll have to break at least one
tackle. ``In Ivan Williams and Victor Ike we've got two strong
backs,'' he said. ``You can't block everybody on a kickoff return,
so you've got to have guys who can run through an arm tackle and
then run away from everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Return teams have to be at once optimistic and prepared for
disappointment. Williams is perhaps better suited for it than most,
having returned five kickoffs for touchdowns in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Four of which were called back.
</P>
<P>
   Patience will, like glaciers, eventually prevail. Entering their
1987 game against Georgia Tech, the Clemson Tigers hadn't taken a
punt back for a score in 17 years; a kickoff return in 25.
</P>
<P>
   The streak stood at 999 combined returns when Joe Henderson took
a Tech kickoff 95 yards for a score. Minutes later, teammate
Donnell Woolford took a punt back 78 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he also visualizes the day the Horns take one back
(though it might not come this week _ Louisiana-Lafayette hasn't
allowed a TD return since 1989).
</P>
<P>
   When it does happen, the party on the sideline will be grand,
Williams promised. But on the field, it will be like any other
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hand the ball to the ref, let it be known I'd been there
before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, it's been a while,'' he said. ``But we HAVE been there
before.''

   SMITH-COLUMN _ My father's family leased land to sharecroppers _
ironic for a family that descended from chattel slaves to turn
other people into wage slaves. Sharecroppers worked the land, never
owning it and never getting out of debt. They made money for
someone else, but rarely knew what it was like to have money in
their pockets. Recalling those days when workers picked the cotton
on his daddy's land in Burleson County, my father said, ``It wasn't
fair.'' His words are a lesson for me about work, dignity and
fairness. Today, the custodians, clerks, librarians and others at
the University of Texas who keep the campus running receive few
benefits and low pay. That isn't fair, either, especially at one of
the largest universities in the nation. (Smith, Austin

   CoxNet HEALTHY LIVING 0909 --COLLEGE WEIGHT GAIN -- Freshmen at
the nation's universities may still be unpacking in their dorm
rooms, but if they're anything like freshmen of years past, they're
already packing on the pounds. That's because among other college
rituals and traditions learned early on is the introduction of
college-style eating _ all-you-can-eat cafeterias, late-night pizza
deliveries, vending machine runs before class, fast food and cheap
libations. By the time they take their first semester finals, many
freshmen will have eaten their way to the dreaded ``Freshman 15.''

CHECK OUT PLASTIC SURGERY CREDENTIALS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use after Mon., Sept. 11, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
 
 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good idea to check the professional and educational
background of any doctor you plan to consult or hire. Especially in
plastic surgery, where the person charging you thousands of dollars
to fix your appearance may have had the bulk of his or her training
in gynecology or even dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of California, any doctor licensed as a physician
and surgeon can legally perform any surgical procedure on an
outpatient basis, says Dr. Thomas R. Stevenson, president of the
California Society of Plastic Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real bellwether is if the doctor has hospital
privileges,'' says Stevenson, professor and chief of plastic
surgery at UC Davis. ``Hospitals have much more stringent criteria
for privileges. They wouldn't let me do neurosurgery at this or any
other hospital unless I proved I was qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   If a plastic surgeon claims to be board certified, patients
should ask his field of certification, say officials from the
American Society of Plastic Surgeons _ the educational branch of
the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS). The answer will
determine how much and what type of training the doctor has
received.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve to understand that there are
boards that are legitimate and real and others that are sort of
contrived,'' says Dr. C. Lin Puckett, president of the American
Board of Plastic Surgeons and professor of plastic surgery at the
University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``American people who are seeking cosmetic surgery or any other
kind of plastic surgery are probably sophisticated enough to ask if
someone is board certified. They are not necessarily sophisticated
enough to differentiate when that individual says, `Yes, I'm
certified by the Two-Step Board of Plastic Surgery.'''
</P>
<P>
   In order to receive certification in plastic surgery from the
ABPS, members must have graduated from an accredited medical school
and completed at least five years of additional training: three in
general surgery, two in plastic surgery. They have practiced
plastic surgery for an additional two years and passed
comprehensive written and oral exams. Certification must be renewed
every seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Both medical doctors (MDs) and doctors of osteopathy (DOs) can
earn board certification from the ABPS. Osteopathy is a system of
healing that emphasizes manipulation (as of joints) but does not
exclude other uses of medicine or surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Osteopaths can also gain certification in plastic surgery
through the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) by undergoing
two years of training in plastic and reconstructive surgery
following three years of training in surgery or an AOA-approved and
completed residency program in orthopedic surgery or an
AOA-approved and completed residency in otolaryngology/facial
plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In order to be certified through the American Board of Facial
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, a doctor has to have previous
certification from the ABPS or the American Board of
Otolaryngology. The doctor will have graduated from a residency
approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
Education (ACGME), been in private practice for two years in facial
plastic surgery, and have passed written and oral exams. &QL;

&HT;     ROMEO, JULIET WITH A WELSH TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Note cast box below)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Morrison's ``Solomon and Gaenor,'' set in a Welsh mining
town, has the look of a Dickensian bowl of cold gruel. But the film
is in the key of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' and it's a one-note tune.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd) is a door-to-door fabric salesman.
Gaenor (Nia Roberts) is the penniless girl on the other side of one
of those doors. He offers her a swatch, she declines, he shows up
the next day with a dress, which he pulled an all-nighter to
finish. Innocuously batted eyelashes give way to heavy petting
which turns into a roll in the hay which results in a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The skies are permanently gray so the forecast calls for
drizzles of tragedy. Wait _ Solomon hasn't told Gaenor he is the
son of an Orthodox Jew? Make that a downpour. He hasn't even told
her his name is Solomon, instead slipping her the gentile pseudonym
Sam Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Morrison has the broken hearts in the right
places and the secrets percolating on the stove. But the film,
while socially progressive (she is quick to give it up, while he
seems to have no intention of asking for her hand), is crippled by
us-against-the-world deck-stacking. Gruffudd, who played Horatio
Hornblower for the BBC, and Roberts, in her first film, spark
intensity and can usually be seen alluding to a third dimension for
their ill-drawn characters. However, the folks around Solomon and
Gaenor (parents, siblings, a reverend, etc.) are of brittle,
villainous stock. Their vocation is to tip the sympathy scales in
favor of our young sweethearts through their contempt.
</P>
<P>
   And it works. But is this really how we want to root for a pair
of lovers: in response to how much the people around them detest
their love?
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the affair is nicely, if not redeemingly, situated
around a miners' strike that results in anti-Semitic vandalism, one
of whose targets is Solomon's father's pawnshop. Of all the
occasions here to use a heavy hand (there are enough to leave us
feeling morally spanked), Morrison chooses to push the gloomy
romance. Mechanical storytelling and scandal-mongering are
preferred over intimacy, but you can see Morrison reaching beyond
Shakespeare for Thomas Hardy-caliber disaster.
</P>
<P>
   He is a traditionalist, though, with overly familiar ideas about
how to keep people apart, sexually, familially, geographically. He
even throws in an inexplicably dopey finale that barely fulfills
the portended doom. You wish the film had a trace of rebellion,
spontaneity or anger. Otherwise, it's not clear whether people
start dying out of love or obligation.

 &HT;    Grapevine: News, notes from wrestling industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The WWF completed an online auction on wwf.com in July that
raised over $50,000 for children's charities across the nation.
They continued the auction through August and will make a donation
to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In July these were the top-selling items:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jericho's autographed silver shirt $2,255
</P>
<P>
   Wrestlemania 2000 Autographed Banner $2,215
</P>
<P>
   HHH Autographed Outfit $2,055
</P>
<P>
   Wrestlemania 2000 WWF.com Ringskirt $2,030
</P>
<P>
   Chyna's Leather Outfit _ Autographed $2,005
</P>
<P>
   Steve Austin's autographed kneebrace $2,002
</P>
<P>
   Axxess Book signed by WWF Superstars $2,001
</P>
<P>
   Wrestlemania 2000 autographed tickets $1,750
</P>
<P>
   Chris Benoit's autographed tights $1,701
</P>
<P>
   Kat's autographed mud match bikini bottoms $1,557
</P>
<P>
   After months of speculation, the return of ``Stone Cold'' Steve
Austin appears to be set for Sept. 23 in Philadelphia for
``Unforgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin made the claim during Thursday's ``Smackdown'' show that
he would be there to find out who tried to run him over with a car
last year. Austin, who has been out of action for nearly a year
after having neck surgery, will not be in the ring, but his return
should spark sales of the pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   His return would also come just a week before the World
Wrestling Federation's Monday night show, ``Raw is War,'' moves
from the USA Network to The Nashville Network.
</P>
<P>
   It appears as though the new deal between USA and Extreme
Championship Wrestling has hit a snag. ECW, which is looking for a
deal now that WWF has kicked them off TNN, would like a 6-8 p.m.
spot on Saturdays to keep its teenage fan base. USA would like to
move it to 11 p.m.-1 a.m. on the Saturday overnight, so ECW
over-the-top antics can remain uncut. Expect a deal to be worked
out soon because ECW needs a television deal to continue.
</P>
<P>
   More television news... It looks as though we might not see the
rat get her revenge in the ring. ``Survivor'' castaways Kelly and
Susan reportly have been contacted by WCW about being part of a
future
</P>
<P>
   pay-per-view. CBS/Viacom, which owns ``Survivor'' and just
purchased the rights to air WWF's ``Raw is War'' show would
probably fight such a deal unless the girls appear on WWF.
</P>
<P>
   Chyna's Playboy pictorial will hit newsstands on Sept. 29. She
will also release a workout video on Sept. 19. According to
wwf.com, ``Chyna Fitness isn't about having the biggest guns or the
tightest buns. Learn how to execute her 40-minute head-to-toe
circuit training program. Perfect for anybody who can't get to the
gym as much as they would like.''

&HT;     REEVES CONTINUES HIS CAREER DESCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Cast box below)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hot off his stint as a quarterback in the dismal ``The
Replacements,'' Keanu Reeves suits up for the somehow worse ``The
Watcher,'' this time as a lady-killer let loose on the streets of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Reeves didn't want the part after it swelled
from a stint to a starring role, but legally his only choice was to
act.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are, with Reeves striking flamenco poses to Rob
Zombie songs as he contemplates polishing off Academy Award winner
Marisa Tomei. Meanwhile, James Spader is duct-taped to a chair
pondering a way to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Or is Spader mentally retracing the steps that brought him from
the toxic ``Supernova'' smack into this joy parade? Either way,
it's a depressing state of affairs, one we don't deserve.
First-time director and insta-hack Joe Charbanic happens to have
been a Canadian hockey buddy of Reeves. And his film is strictly
penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, Spader and Tomei form a trinity of second and third
chances, with careers that have done hard time on Hollywood milk
cartons. Throw in cinematographer Michael Chapman (``Taxi
Driver''), and the collection of errors in judgment just gets
sadder. But glory days don't pay the bills, friends. Crap does,
especially the kind it takes at least six producers to make. And
``The Watcher'' brings them all together for one dreary cesspool of
a blowout in which the psycho in Reeves needs (inexplicably, I
might add) the sleepy cop in Spader.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, ``The Watcher'' is a milestone for Spader,
whose somnambulant performance technique achieves a new low here.
See him doze off in scene after scene after scene. See him do it in
an apartment that's been made up to look eerily like the one where
he got freaky in ``Sex, Lies and Videotape.'' His distressed cop
even pays a visit to the shrink Tomei plays, and
borderline-narcoleptic urges overtake her, too.
</P>
<P>
   Having nailed the weirdo voyeur in ``Sex, Lies,'' Spader, tries
his hand at the law, which apparently bores him to no end. Not that
we see Reeves actually engaging in any kinky spying. He's barely
menacing, trying mightily to ``high stick'' (to use hockey
parlance) this project. Trolling the streets wearing a face that
speaks of sadness and hunger, he looks like someone just broke up
with him. Again, that someone must be Spader.
</P>
<P>
   The script appears to have been dunked in the same agitated
septic tank that the movie seems to be photographed in. I can't
believe the same person who shot ``Raging Bull'' is responsible for
this film's dank look. It answers questions I didn't know I had
about what ``Taxi Driver'' would have looked like filmed with a
grimy Web cam.

 &HT;    WHAT'S IN A NAME? FOR TEXAS LAW SCHOOL, IT'S $25 MILLION
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By BRUCE HIGHT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After being courted by his alma mater for three
years, Wayne Reaud, a wealthy Beaumont trial lawyer, agreed to give
Texas Tech University's law school $12.5 million, easily the
largest such gift ever to the young law school.
</P>
<P>
   However, the university board wouldn't take it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gift had been solicited and negotiated by the
university chancellor, John Montford, and law school dean, Frank
Newton, the board said that under the circumstances, $12.5 million
wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Reaud (pronounced REE-o) had understood that in return for the
large donation, the university would name its 30-year-old law
school after him and his wife, Dana. He's a 1974 graduate of the
law school.
</P>
<P>
   But the board said the price tag for naming a university school
after a donor was much higher _ $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech Chancellor John Montford said there was a simple,
though unfortunate, misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   What Tech was willing to do, Montford said, was rename its law
school building, not its law school. ``I'm sorry if that got lost
in the translation, and I'm not blaming it on him _ I'm blaming it
on me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaud thinks the real reason for the board's refusal was
political, that Gov. George W. Bush or his business and Republican
supporters couldn't stand the idea of the law school being named
after one of his ``enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it didn't work because I was a trial lawyer
that had been targeted by the Bush people, or by Bush and his
people, as a large Democratic contributor and an enemy of the
governor,'' Reaud said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly never considered myself an enemy of the governor,
but I was told he considers me such,'' Reaud said in a telephone
interview last week. He previously had declined to comment after
the Tech board failed to accept his proposed gift at its meeting in
May.
</P>
<P>
   All nine members of Texas Tech's board are Bush appointees, and
Reaud, 52, has not been a Bush supporter. He contributed $75,000 to
the Democratic candidate for governor, Garry Mauro, in his losing
1998 campaign against Bush, a Republican. His law firm, Reaud,
Morgan &AMP; Quinn of Beaumont, gave another $5,000 to Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office said it was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's office played no role in this action by the
Texas Tech board of regents,'' said a spokesman for Bush, Mike
Jones. The governor, he said, trusts the regents ``to make
decisions that are in the best interests of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sowell, chairman of Texas Tech's board, said the $12.5
million gift from the Reauds had been welcome but fell well short
of the $25 million threshold previously set for a university school
to be named after a donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very simple, cut and dried _ the gift was not large
enough for us to name the law school after him,'' Sowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Montford said that renaming the law school in honor of a $12.5
million donor could undercut efforts to persuade other wealthy
donors to give $25 million to get a university institution named
after them. Negotiations with at least four such potential donors
are under way now, he said last week.
</P>
<P>
   As for politics, Montford said he was not pressured by anybody
to reject the gift and noted that is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Sowell, a construction company owner, also denied that Reaud's
politics or status as a trial lawyer was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there are those who don't care for lawyers,'' Sowell
said, ``but shoot, we've got a law school, we're in the business of
training lawyers. So it was certainly no factor from my point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton, the law school dean, said he was ``embarrassed'' by what
had happened after he and Montford had worked hard _ Montford said
for three years _ to persuade Reaud to make a big contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Newton said most Tech alumni he had talked with favored the
``potential gift'' as a great opportunity for the law school. But,
he added, the gift was ``not well received locally.''
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers _ also known as personal injury or plaintiffs'
lawyers _ have become a favorite target of criticism from business
interests and Republicans, who say they manipulate the legal system
to force business, insurance and medical defendants to pay
settlements on questionable claims rather than risk even bigger
judgments from a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Reaud has been a highly successful trial lawyer, even before he
helped the state win a $17.3 billion settlement from the tobacco
industry. His Beaumont law firm is one of five Texas firms sharing
in $3.3 billion in legal fees to be paid over the next 25 years for
winning that case.
</P>
<P>
   He and the other tobacco trial lawyers also are the subject of a
probe by Attorney General John Cornyn, a Republican, who has
questioned how they got the contract to represent the state from
his predecessor, former Attorney General Dan Morales, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact I was a successful trial lawyer operated to my
disadvantage in this deal,'' Reaud said. (He also said that
Cornyn's probe is ``certainly'' motivated by political
considerations.)
</P>
<P>
   Newton said that what Reaud and the university had negotiated
was in two parts. The Reauds would put up $2.5 million, matched
with $2.5 million from the university, to update the law school
building technologically.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they were going to put up $10 million for a special
scholarship program that Dana Reaud had called a Peace Corps for
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarship program would have paid all of a student's
tuition and fees, plus $1,000 a month in living expenses. In
return, after graduation, the student would be required to spend
three years in some sort of public service ? pushing environmental
cases, for example, or representing battered women ? rather than
immediately sign up with a private law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Reaud said that he's looking elsewhere to make major
contributions, but not Texas Tech: ``They're not on my list ? which
is unfortunate, frankly, for them as well as me.''
</P>
<P>
   Montford, himself a lawyer, said the Reaud situation was ``my
only fumble'' in his hard-charging Horizon Campaign, which so far
has raised $450 million for Texas Tech. And he said he will try
again to get help from Reaud: ``I'm not going to give up that
easily.''

A YEAR AFTER TRAGEDY AT WEDGWOOD BAPTIST, THE PAIN REMAINS FRESH
FOR SOME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JIM JONES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It has been a painful and exciting year for
the Rev. Al Meredith and his congregation at Wedgwood Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith, his congregation and a nation have mourned the deaths
of eight people and the wounding of seven others in the Sept. 15,
1999, shooting at the Fort Worth church.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past year, the church has flourished, and Meredith
has taken the message of faith during life's darkest hours to
secular and religious groups nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   As compelled as Meredith is to extend that message, he also
looks forward to spending more time shepherding his flock after the
first anniversary of the shootings. Some Wedgwood members have
mixed feelings about the approaching anniversary and memorials
planned for next week, church administrator Mike Holton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a milestone we will be glad to get past,'' said Holton,
who survived because a bullet fired by gunman Larry Gene Ashbrook
hit a metal door facing during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of us,'' Meredith said, ``it is as fresh as the day
it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith's face and words of faith were flashed on TV screens
across America in the days after the shooting spree in a sanctuary
full of youth celebrating See You at the Pole, an annual observance
at schools during which young people publicly display their
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are broken but not crushed,'' Meredith declared at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Holton said, ``People have discovered Al all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In his message at conventions and other gatherings, Meredith has
emphasized that even horrific times can't quash the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has bowled me over is the requests I have to speak from
nonchurch organizations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith flew to Detroit recently and spoke to 240 salespeople
employed by a phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave them my sales pitch, too,'' he said. ``I share the
Gospel. A lot of those salespeople don't go to church anywhere. I
tell them about my faith. If they don't like that, I tell them
don't ask me to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith recently took a weeklong vacation at a friend's
oceanfront condo in Florida, where he played tennis and golf every
day. Even then, he made time to speak at two churches about the
lessons of Wedgwood.
</P>
<P>
   His many speaking engagements have stolen time from his church,
Meredith lamented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been as good a pastor to the folks here, and I hate
that,'' he said. ``I'm not here to go to hospitals, counsel with
individuals. Others have had to take up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to cut back on his speaking, but he doesn't regret the
opportunity to extend his message beyond Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to share the story of God's grace that we
experienced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Average attendance at Wedgwood's Sunday services has grown from
800 to more than 1,200. And, many new converts are now a part of
the 2,000-member church.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man came forward for conversion this month who had been
resisting faith, and his life had fallen apart,'' Meredith related.
``A week before the shootings he had been visited by Shawn Brown,
one of the people who were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of story he shares on the road and will impart
during anniversary appearances in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an example of good coming out of evil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wedgwood church members have had a variety of responses since
the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody grieves in their own way,'' Meredith said.
``Everybody's pain is unique. Some of our kids won't talk about it
at all. Others will talk about it with anyone who will listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Counselors have talked to the congregation, and members have
been encouraged to reach out to those who grieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is the body of Christ and the family of God,''
Meredith said. ``We minister to each other. You just love folks,
hold onto each other without trying to offer any words of advice or
counsel. We let them know we share their grief.''
</P>
<P>
   Some church members have recovered from the shock, but the
anniversary will trigger traumatic memories. Many want to put the
traumatic events behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some think we might be fixating on it,'' Meredith said. ``So
you try to find a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary ``can be a real opportunity for healing, or it
can be a real opportunity for opening an old wound and letting it
fester some more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a real tender, sensitive time for those whose
family members were killed,'' he said. ``And yet, the Lord can use
that as a real time of healing. If you stuff your grief, it festers
on you. If you can deal with it, embrace it, then God can make it
good grief.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said the tragedy has deepened the church's resolve to
take the message of Christian hope to more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thinking of a new senior adult ministry,'' he said.
``The neighborhood we live in has more people over 65 than just
about any area. The average age of our members is 27 or 28. We are
such a young church we could use some more gray heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, other Wedgwood members have ministered
beyond the church walls.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Galey, a Wedgwood counselor who was severely wounded, went
to Thailand to speak to a group of churches. Jay Fannin, the
church's youth minister, has spoken at rallies for young people
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five of our girls were invited to go to Australia to help
prepare churches to witness during the upcoming Olympics,''
Meredith said. ``On the way back, they stopped in Hawaii and led a
youth rally. That's positive. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If God can use your tragedy to help other people, it gives
some sense of purpose about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have called Wedgwood a ``miracle church'' because it
emerged so rapidly from its loss. Ashbrook fired hundreds of rounds
and had ammunition left when he took his own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the miracle is that we didn't have 50 funerals,''
Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, during the church's 40th anniversary celebration, the
congregation dedicated a $3.2 million building project that was
begun before the shooting. The expansion will include a community
life center with a full-size gymnasium, walking track, banquet area
and more classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said his wife, Kay, often says that he and church
members should guard against any impression that they are boasting
about Wedgwood Baptist's quick rise out of the catastrophic event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Wedgwood is such a great church,'' he said.
``It is that God is such a great God. God can give grace in the
midst of the darkest tragedy _ the most unthinkable things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of that awful evil, God is still doing much good. That's
the true miracle.''

&HT;     GAY RIGHTS OPPONENT LOSES CASE IN FEDERAL APPEALS COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Los Angeles schoolteacher Robert Downs thinks
homosexuality is immoral. So he was unhappy when his district
declared a Gay and Lesbian Awareness Month each June and even
unhappier when colleagues posted rainbow flags and gay pride
materials on school bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   Downs put up his own bulletin board in a hallway near his
classroom and posted pictures of a traditional family, texts of a
federal law against same-sex marriage and a Supreme Court ruling
against sodomy _ and, eventually, a biblical passage calling
homosexuality ``detestable.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal ordered him to stop, saying he was violating not
only the school district's policy but also its curriculum that
promoted tolerance and diversity. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said the school had not violated Downs' freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Downs can express his views ``on the sidewalks, in the parks,
through the chat-rooms, at his dinner table, and in countless other
locations'' _ but not on bulletin boards that are overseen by
school officials and are the official voice of the school, the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   A school district, like other government agencies, ``may decide
not only to talk about gay and lesbian awareness and tolerance in
general, but also to advocate such tolerance if it so desires, and
restrict the contrary speech of one of its representatives,'' said
Judge Stephen Trott in the 3-0 ruling that upheld a federal trial
judge's dismissal of the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Downs, who has taught in the Los Angeles Unified School District
for 20 years, said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government can step in and take sides on that issue,
and prohibit anything opposed to their view, then you have a
government that is totalitarian in nature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   School district lawyer Mary Kay Jackson said the ruling
reassured every school district, governed by a publicly elected
board, that ``it can set up a curriculum and teachers need to
comply with it. If they don't like it, they can urge the district
to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The same rule would hold true, she said, if a majority of the
school board opposed teaching evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling coincides with an upsurge of gay rights activity in
California public schools after last year's passage of a state law
prohibiting discrimination in schools based on sexual orientation.
About 125 Gay-Straight Alliance organizations have been formed in
Northern California schools, and on Tuesday an Orange County
district dropped its longstanding objections to such organizations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the courts have struggled with free speech
objections to school district policies on both ends of the
political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Cases discussed in Thursday's ruling included censorship of a
student newspaper and exclusion of Planned Parenthood ads from a
school yearbook. The appeals court said a school might have to
allow alternative viewpoints in such cases, which involve student
expression _ but not on bulletin boards that express the school's
official policy and curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles school board first designated June as Gay and
Lesbian Awareness Month in 1997 and distributed posters and other
materials to schools. At Downs' special education high school in
suburban Reseda, teachers put up a bulletin board and added their
own posters and banners on topics such as gays and lesbians in
history, domestic partner benefits and gay-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Downs said he was particularly offended by a religious statement
saying homosexuality was morally acceptable. He said he complained
to the principal, who told him he could put up his own material as
long as it wasn't discriminatory and didn't violate the separation
of church and state. But when other staff members complained, the
principal ordered him to take the material down.

&HT;     `LOVE &AMP; SEX' REVEALS SOME TRUTHS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Famke Janssen, who squeezed men to death with her legs as a
villain in the James Bond flick ``Goldeneye,'' merely talks them to
death in ``Love &AMP; Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Love is a minefield,'' Kate Welles (Janssen) tells us in the
opening narration of writer-director Valerie Breiman's sharply
written reverse-image of Woody Allen's ``Annie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a step, get blown to pieces, put yourself back
together again and stupidly take another step. I guess that's human
nature. It hurts so much to be alone we'd rather get blown up than
remain single.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, we need the eggs, and that's not the only
``Annie Hall'' reminder. Kate, like Alvy Singer, is a writer, and
relates her sexual history in a loose flashback structure.
``Nosferatu,'' the original German Expressionist silent, obsesses
her as ``The Sorrow and the Pity'' torments Alvy. There's even a
memorable scene in a yellow Volkswagen recalling Annie's bad
driving.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Love &AMP; Sex'' finds its own way to deliver some truths
about relationships. Kate is moody, brash and hilarious _ she
describes herself as knowing more about oral sex than
relationships. But she's not an over-the-top, in-your-face Angelina
Jolie-esque creation. She's a normal, young, single woman who
happens to be attractive, living in Los Angeles, and looking for
the right guy.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen, the talented Dutch-born actress, neurotically powers
her way through a performance that displays keen intelligence,
wicked wit and a weakness for kittens. In so doing, she has pulled
off a unique double: She's in the summer's best Hollywood action
film, ``X-Men,'' and now she charges ahead in one of the best
independent movies.
</P>
<P>
   Kate meets an artist, Adam (Jon Favreau), who is so struck by
her at his own exhibition that he literally wills her to be his
girlfriend. Soon, they cohabit, and his insecurities begin to wear
on Kate. In trading information, Adam says he has slept with two
girls previously, while Kate causes his jaw drop by admitting she
has slept with a baker's dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen!'' Adam exclaims. ``You're like a whore!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's how guys think.
</P>
<P>
   The on-again, off-again relationship allows Breiman (who
presumably didn't get the leeway to flesh out deep issues in her
fleshy first two films, ``Going Overboard'' _ Adam Sandler's first
film in 1989 _ and ``Bikini Squad,'' in 1993) to explore the
ever-present fear of being alone and her central theme: How do you
know when you're in the ``forever'' relationship?
</P>
<P>
   Favreau and Janssen don't look like a couple, but their precise
comic timing and enthusiasm are believable, and they develop real
chemistry (so much so that Favreau cast Janssen in his directorial
debut, ``Made,'' to be released in 2001). It helps that the
dialogue is hip, natural and observational, elements that allow
Favreau to excel.
</P>
<P>
   The plot conventions, which include an unwanted pregnancy, and
the initial cause of her flashbacks (some nonsense about Kate being
fired by her editor unless she writes a story about love that she
really believes, yeah right) _ are mere window dressing for what we
already know: These two belong together, and we want them to be
together.
</P>
<P>
   Relationships are indeed confusing, and ``Love &AMP; Sex'' does a
great job in showing how we tend to make them more complicated than
they really are. In simple truth, the right relationship is someone
you are able to ``feel normal around,'' as Adam says at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Question is, just what is normal?

   SMITH-COLUMN _ My father's family leased land to sharecroppers _
ironic for a family that descended from chattel slaves to turn
other people into wage slaves. Sharecroppers worked the land, never
owning it and never getting out of debt. They made money for
someone else, but rarely knew what it was like to have money in
their pockets. Recalling those days when workers picked the cotton
on his daddy's land in Burleson County, my father said, ``It wasn't
fair.'' His words are a lesson for me about work, dignity and

college-style eating _ all-you-can-eat cafeterias, late-night pizza

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's nobody at home at the White House these
days. Lame duckism is setting in. The White House, so often
described by former occupants as the loneliest place in the world,
has certainly taken on that aura.
</P>
<P>
   Except for their personal belongings, the Clintons seem to have
already moved out of the Executive Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has been AWOL for several months as she pursues
her campaign for a Senate seat from New York. She has established a
residence in posh Westchester County, north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   She drops in at the White House every once in a while, mainly to
be on hand for official state functions. She is expected to be
hostess at the Sept. 17 state dinner in honor of Indian President
Atal Vajpaya. It's payback time for the royal treatment she
received on two trips to the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, meantime, is keeping up his heavy fundraising
and travel schedule, making him an absentee chief executive much of
the time. He appears a bit forlorn to be on the bench while Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush are playing
starring roles in a high-stakes struggle to succeed him. He
wistfully told friends recently that this was the first Labor Day
in 26 years that he did not march in a parade.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea, daughter of the first couple, also is generally absent
from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, even though she took a sabbatical
from Stanford University this semester to savor the family's last
days in the White House, as press secretary Joe Lockhart put it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she is spending the fall helping her mother campaign or
she's sitting in as her father's guest at high-powered meetings
with foreign leaders both abroad and at home, more recently at the
millenium summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
   When told that Chelsea's presence at some of the private meeting
was annoying to some foreign delegations, Lockhart shrugged and
said: ``So what?''
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea's new boyfriend, Jeremy Kane, also a senior at Stanford,
has been traveling with the family as an intern with the
speechwriting staff.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is giving Clinton a wide berth. In fact, the Gore team
frankly wants the president to ``butt out'' and not become a
Republican target in the election campaign. Whenever Bush talks
about the need ``to restore honor'' to the White House, he is
hoping voters will remember that Gore was Clinton's enthusiastic
supporter during the impeachment controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still has some legislative clout in his final months in
office. He mustered enough Democratic votes to sustain his veto of
the repeal of the estate tax and is likely to win other veto
showdowns in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress will likely agree
on appropriations bills to avoid any government shutdown like that
of 1995-1996. And there are indications Congress may give in to the
president's appeal for an $1 increase in the minimum wage,
currently at $5.15, over two years. To that, I say: Better late
than never. Passage of ``hate crimes'' legislation still may be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   On the foreign policy front, Clinton seems to have struck out in
his drive for a final Middle East peace settlement. Time is running
out on all fronts for the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, who have lived most of their married lives in what
they facetiously call ``public housing,'' were fearful when they
moved into the White House that they would lose their privacy.
``I'm not going to live in a bubble,'' the president said as he
left Little Rock after his 1992 election. Well, he was sure wrong
about that.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Centre College in Danville, Ky. is still hoping to host a debate
between the vice presidential candidates, Democrat Joe Lieberman
and Republican Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The college is the site designated by the unofficial Commission
on Presidential Debates for an Oct. 5 faceoff between the two
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman as accepted but no word so far from Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Patsi Trollinger, spokesman for the college, said the small town
has spent $700,000 to prepare for the big event. Centre College's
great claim to fame is that its football team beat Harvard, 6 to 0,
in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lady Bird Johnson will be showing up in Virginia pretty soon to
help her son-in-law Sen. Charles Robb, who is married to her
daughter Lynda Bird, in his tough reelection campaign. The
87-year-old former first lady became a political pro in 1964 when
she undertook a 4-day whistlestop train tour through the South
during Lyndon B. Johnson's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The former first lady has created a wildflower center, just
outside of Austin. A group of schoolchildren recently visited the
center and were shown a portrait of Mrs. Johnson. ``That's Mother
Nature,'' piped up one little boy. It was a fitting tribute for the
woman who made national beautification her major project in the
White House.

<P>
   LIMONAR, Cuba _ The old men sit on chairs under the awning of
the gas station, swapping lies and looking for all the world like
characters straight off the ``Andy Griffith Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Except they're speaking Spanish, and they aren't talking about
fishing or hunting or the latest misadventures of the sheriff's
loopy sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, their main topic is the same thing that's dominating
Cuba's airwaves, not to mention the non-stop dialogue that hums on
street corners, under shade trees and any place else that a handful
of this talk-happy island's residents gather.
</P>
<P>
   The old men, in this small town about 100 miles east of Havana,
are talking about the upcoming Sydney Olympics. And like any
die-hard Georgia Bulldog or Texas Longhorns or Florida Gator
football fan, they are firmly convinced their team is going to win,
and win big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba has great athletes and the Olympics are our chance to
show the world,'' said Miguel Alvarez, who sees more customers come
to the gas station to air up bicycle tires than to buy gasoline.
``The world already knows that we love sports, and now we will get
to prove it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even for those Cubans who don't love sports, it appears
impossible to avoid the growing Olympic fever.
</P>
<P>
   The nightly news program on Cuban State television is filled
with long blocks of reporting on past Olympic glory and the status
of the current team. A banner hung outside the National Sports City
complex in Havana urges the team ``To Sydney for the glory of the
Motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubans have always been sports fanatics, with a near-legendary
love for baseball. But ever since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution,
they've had the active encouragement of their government, which
early on identified sports as a key element in its vision for an
egalitarian, socialist society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport is the right of the people,'' Castro declared shortly
after the revolution, a quotation that now graces the walls of many
of Cuba's local stadiums. ``We must inundate every corner of the
island with sports equipment. We should strive to improve our
athletes rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the performance of Cuban athletes has been
remarkable, especially in the Olympic Games. Despite being one of
the world's smaller countries, with a population of only 11
million, Cuban athletes took home 31 Olympic medals in 1992's
Barcelona games, placing fifth among all nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 in Atlanta, Cuba won 25 medals, placing eighth in the
world rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But like everything else in Cuba, sport is tinged with politics.
</P>
<P>
   Castro touts his teams' successes, partly out of rightful pride,
but also likely as a way to pump up his citizens _ and divert their
attention _ as the nation struggles toward recovering from the 1991
collapse of its long-time communist sponsor, the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the continuing saga of Cuban athletes who defect
to the U.S. or other nations, hoping to cash in their talents for
the big riches other Western athletes enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wary of the negative propaganda impact of such defections,
Cuban officials warned their departing 240-member Olympic team to
guard against the ``blackmail, bribery and harassment'' they might
face in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba will continue to battle to restore the true principles of
the Olympic spirit, will continue to denounce corruption and to
attack the mercantilism which is currently defiling and curtailing
the full development of sports as an expression of friendship and
relations between nations,'' Cuba's Foreign Minister Felipe Perez
Roque told the Olympic team at their send-off.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions that Cuban athletes make peanuts compared to
stars in many other nations. Top Cuban athletes are paid US$25 per
month. That's more than double the average Cuban's monthly wage of
US$10, but far short of the millions many professional American
athletes earn.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cubans train just as hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret of our success is that we start with the very young
and we work very hard,'' said Augustin Avila, a former player for
the Cuban national baseball team and now coach of a squad of 15- to
16-year-olds in Havana. ``We practice every day, two to three
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Cuban system of sports development is something akin
to the scouting and minor-league system employed by American Major
League Baseball teams. Perhaps that's because Castro himself was a
promising baseball pitcher who was voted ``Athlete of the Year'' in
1944 at his university.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the U.S., teams of scouts work the circuit throughout
Cuba, going to elementary schools to identify youngsters with
above-average potential. But not just in baseball. The most
talented kids in basketball, volleyball, track, gymnastics and
other sports are tapped to apply for a School for Sports
Initiation, where they attend regular academic classes but also get
advanced coaching.
</P>
<P>
   The best from that level graduate to one of the nation's Schools
of Higher Athletic Performance, another setting for intensive
training. From there, ambitious kids hope to catch the eye of a
coach or scout from one of the major city teams or a national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here wants to play for the Cuban Olympic team,'' said
14-year-old Antonio Ciscard of Havana, who plays on Avila's team.
``It's our dream _ that, and to beat the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm seems just as strong in Cuba's rural towns like
this one, where some people plan on crowding into the homes of
friends or neighbors who have televisions in order to watch the
games.
</P>
<P>
   In Limonar, the men at the gas station are certain that one of
the Cubans who will bring home a gold medal will be record-holding
high-jumper Javier Sotomayor, who grew up in their tiny town and
whose mother lives in a neat, two-story home across the street.
</P>
<P>
   They dismiss Sotomayor's alleged positive results on a drug test
last year, focussing instead on the fact that international
officials have cleared him to compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a regular guy,'' Miguel Alvarez said. ``We know him
here because he comes home all the time to visit his mother. We're
going to watch the Olympics on television, and we're sure he will
win again.''

   Castro touts his teams' successes, partly out of rightful pride,
but also likely as a way to pump up his citizens _ and divert their
attention _ as the nation struggles toward recovering from the 1991
collapse of its long-time communist sponsor, the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the continuing saga of Cuban athletes who defect
to the U.S. or other nations, hoping to cash in their talents for
the big riches other Western athletes enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wary of the negative propaganda impact of such defections,
Cuban officials warned their departing 240-member Olympic team to
guard against the ``blackmail, bribery and harassment'' they might
face in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba will continue to battle to restore the true principles of
the Olympic spirit, will continue to denounce corruption and to
attack the mercantilism which is currently defiling and curtailing
the full development of sports as an expression of friendship and
relations between nations,'' Cuba's Foreign Minister Felipe Perez
Roque told the Olympic team at their send-off.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions that Cuban athletes make peanuts compared to
stars in many other nations. Top Cuban athletes are paid US$25 per
month. That's more than double the average Cuban's monthly wage of
US$10, but far short of the millions many professional American
athletes earn.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cubans train just as hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret of our success is that we start with the very young
and we work very hard,'' said Augustin Avila, a former player for
the Cuban national baseball team and now coach of a squad of 15- to
16-year-olds in Havana. ``We practice every day, two to three
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Cuban system of sports development is something akin
to the scouting and minor-league system employed by American Major
League Baseball teams. Perhaps that's because Castro himself was a
promising baseball pitcher who was voted ``Athlete of the Year'' in
1944 at his university.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the U.S., teams of scouts work the circuit throughout
Cuba, going to elementary schools to identify youngsters with
above-average potential. But not just in baseball. The most
talented kids in basketball, volleyball, track, gymnastics and
other sports are tapped to apply for a School for Sports
Initiation, where they attend regular academic classes but also get
advanced coaching.
</P>
<P>
   The best from that level graduate to one of the nation's Schools
of Higher Athletic Performance, another setting for intensive
training. From there, ambitious kids hope to catch the eye of a
coach or scout from one of the major city teams or a national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here wants to play for the Cuban Olympic team,'' said
14-year-old Antonio Ciscard of Havana, who plays on Avila's team.
``It's our dream _ that, and to beat the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm seems just as strong in Cuba's rural towns like
this one, where some people plan on crowding into the homes of
friends or neighbors who have televisions in order to watch the
games.
</P>
<P>
   In Limonar, the men at the gas station are certain that one of
the Cubans who will bring home a gold medal will be record-holding
high-jumper Javier Sotomayor, who grew up in their tiny town and
whose mother lives in a neat, two-story home across the street.
</P>
<P>
   They dismiss Sotomayor's alleged positive results on a drug test
last year, focussing instead on the fact that international
officials have cleared him to compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a regular guy,'' Miguel Alvarez said. ``We know him
here because he comes home all the time to visit his mother. We're
going to watch the Olympics on television, and we're sure he will
win again.''

   Bugs that eat oil, breaking 150 miles per hour on a two-lane
road at night, and who was Rat Fink's daddy? More of your mail,
more of my answers:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 82-year-old father, who lives on Cape Cod, bought a brand
new 2000 Volkswagen Golf several months ago. It seems to be burning
an excessive amount of oil. The dealer says it is normal for these
modern cars with ``high tolerance'' engines. The car burned a quart
of oil in the first 1,000 miles. He was told this would continue
and he should put a quart in every 1,000 and at intervals of 6,000
and 20,000 miles it will improve. Does this sound right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Question for the dealer: Where's the oil going? The folks at
Volkswagen tell me the first oil that should go into a new VW is at
the 5,000-mile oil change. High tolerance engines are everywhere
and they don't burn oil like that. Is your father's car smoking?
And what was that dealer smoking? Call me and give me the dealer's
name.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You automotive journalists kill me. You'd think you perceive
yourselves as gods descended to Earth. You drive a Porsche at more
than 175 miles per hour (back in June) at a known speed trials test
site and you get a plaque for doing it. Big deal! Try going over
150 miles per hour in a stone-stock 1988 5.0 Mustang on a two-lane
road at night . . . I could have gone faster but my windows were
open.
</P>
<P>
   A. You, sir, are a doofus. You say I have a god-complex because
I drive fast on a desert where I endanger only myself, yet you take
into your hands not only your own life but the lives of anyone you
may encounter by driving probably three times the speed limit on a
back road. And why were your windows open? So you could toss the
empty long-neck beer bottles out as you whizzed along?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm on a hunt for information about a redesigned Ford
Explorer for model year 2002. They are keeping it all very
hush-hush. We aren't necessarily looking for a significantly larger
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not really all that hush-hush. The Explorer and Mercury
Mountaineer will share a larger platform, offer three rows of seats
and independent rear suspension. For smaller versions of the
Explorer, consider the Sport Trac and the Explorer Sport.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the prize for letting you know that the nickname ``Big
Daddy'' referred to the drag racer Don Garlits, not Ed Roth, the
artist and auto designer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Garlits gave us Swamp Rats, Roth gave us Rat Fink, a host of
other characters, and great, radical cars. Countless hours were
spent by countless young boys trying to recreate the drawings of Ed
``Big Daddy'' Roth as they whiled away time in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've ordered a Toyota Tundra V8 Access Cab 4WD but I can't
seem to get a commitment on having one delivered with ABS. I get
the feeling Toyota does not want to provide the ABS option. I am
moving to Vermont and my new home will be located three miles up a
dirt road and has a very steep driveway.
</P>
<P>
   A. Toyota says there should not be a problem getting ABS for
your Tundra. Let me know if this problem persists _ you may have a
dealer playing games with you. One question, though: You mention
tough sledding where you are going to live. ABS is a brake system
and is not going to help you with traction the way a traction
control system would help. It will help you stop, but won't help
you go. And the Tundra does not come with traction control.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think you transposed numbers in your story about the Dual
Ghia with the Chrysler hemi engine. The 1957-58 hemi was 392 cubic
inches, not 329.
</P>
<P>
   A. You, sir, are no doofus. You are correct and I'll try to type
better in the future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is wrong? Column after column dwells on pretensions . .
. trips by you to silly racing strips courtesy of advertisers . . .
absence of emphasis on autos with sound engineering and real
mechanical class. Have you ever heard of principles of parsimony
and minimalism?
</P>
<P>
   A. You, sir . . . . Ah yes, parsimony and minimalism. I found
those once _ in the Yugo. You've probably got one of those babies
parked in your yard in Maine right now and have time to write hate
mail to me because your car won't start. But to the point: I do not
travel anywhere on the tab of advertisers or auto manufacturers. If
I do, I get fired. And no emphasis on sound engineering? Buddy,
there are hundreds of models of great autos being built these days
and if I have failed to review the one you admire, then keep
watching _ I'll get to the Tucker yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It is my belief that if you encouraged a single driver to buy
a (more powerful, tuned suspension) Roush Ford Expedition by raving
about how nimble and free of dangerous pitch it is, you have done a
great disservice.
</P>
<P>
   A. The point of the Roush review, from the opening sentence, was
that all those folks who drive their SUVs as if they were in a
Roush are jerks. These are the people you need to watch out for _
not the handful who drive the Roush.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does Ford plan to offer power seats in the popular Focus?
</P>
<P>
   A. Ford says no. There just isn't enough demand for power seats
in a car in that price range and of that size. They looked at it,
but it ended up way down the list of potential improvements.
</P>

   BURNING-MAN (Black Rock Desert, Nev.) _ There aren't many rules
at Burning Man _ the weeklong cyberhippie carnival in the middle of
the Nevada desert that ended on Labor Day. Burning Man, as you may
or may not know, is devoted to ``radical self-expression.'' In 1986
its founder, Larry Harvey, burned a stick-man effigy on a Bay Area
beach after breaking up with his girlfriend. As the pyrocentric
event grew into an annual rite, authorities told Harvey to take his
followers elsewhere. Now, 25,000 of them make the pilgrimage to the
Black Rock Desert, a vast dry lake bed 120 miles north of Reno.
Artists. Performers. College kids. Partyers. Techno-geeks. Ravers.
Neo-paganists. Dot-com yuppies. Professional and amateur nudists.
The effigy has grown to a 40-foot neon skeleton stuffed with wood
and fireworks, whose spectacular torching is the event's
ritualistic climax. By Rick Marin.

   LA-CARAVELLE (New York) _ La Caravelle, which opened with a
$5.50 prix fixe lunch and $7.50 dinner, celebrates its 40th
anniversary this month. A New York institution, it has stood as a
marker of a bygone era of glamour. But rather than settling into
dinosaur status, it has actually hung around long enough to be back
in style again. By Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   UPSCALE-TEEN-FASHION (New York) _ Armed with unprecedented
personal incomes and a precocious knowledge of what women a decade
older consider chic, the upward-striving teen-ager is the newest
target of luxury marketers who once focused strictly on adults.
Chanel, Ralph Lauren, Lancome and Versace are all making a play for
the teen-age market, as is Bobbi Brown, the makeup artist behind an
upscale department store line, whose recent volume of makeup tips,
``Bobbi Brown Teen-age Beauty'' is on The New York Times list of
best-selling children's books. By Ruth LaFerla.

   GIRDLE-GIRLS (New York) _ As unlikely as it may seem, the

Girdle Girls, a club of women living it up in ladylike high style.

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ In September, the sunlit garden blazes
with strong colors: dark red dahlias, deep plum-colored gladioli,
brilliant yellow rudbeckias towering over orange canna flowers. But
the real star of autumn doesn't start shining until dusk, when the
nicotianas pick up their drooping heads, open their white throats
and pour perfume into the darkening air. By Leslie Land.

CORVETTE C5: SPEED, STABILITY WITHOUT THE SHAKE OR STIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The family names Ford, Harley, and Davidson are familiar to all
of us. After all, they are linked to enduring symbols of American
auto culture: the Model T (and the method of its production) and
the Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say Zora-Arkus Duntov? Designer of the Duntov? No. Try
performance-schooled engineer with a bent for racing. He gave us
none other than the Corvette, back in 1955 _ a true American sports
car with the fabled short-block engine.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Vette stands with the ``T'' and the Harley because of its
seamless lineage as a sports car. The Thunderbird might have made
this list had it not become long, bloated, and four-doored in ugly
times of transition. Ford is bringing back the Thunderbird, looking
much like it did in its glory days, and that is a wonderful and
anticipated event.
</P>
<P>
   But the Corvette needs no bringing back. It has rocked steady
down the decades.
</P>
<P>
   So with the promise of soon getting behind the wheel of the 2001
Z06 Corvette _ a beast of a coupe with nearly 400 horsepower _ we
took the latest generation, a 2000 C5 roadster out for a week of
testing for pre-comparison.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the shuddering, hold-on-in-the-corners Corvette of
old. Powered by a 5.7-liter V8 that cranks out 345 horsepower and a
whopping 350 lb.-ft. of torque, its got a rigid construction and a
suspension that withstands what all that power can do to a hurtling
automobile.
</P>
<P>
   But first you need to be securely anchored inside. The long,
low, narrow seats hold you like you are Velcroed to them. They are
so firm at the thigh, with great lateral support on the outside of
the legs and up from waist to shoulders, you feel as if you are
wearing your seat. You may feel as if you've worked a bit to crawl
into them, but once there, the whole inside of the car feels
spacious.
</P>
<P>
   It's got an airplane cockpit feel that is enhanced by the
electronic digital display that pops onto the windshield just above
the dashboard behind the wheel. Roaring straight ahead, it is easy
to keep track of RPMs, speed, and your fuel level.
</P>
<P>
   The C5, introduced in 1997, is the stiffest 'Vette yet. It's got
a strong perimeter frame but its key is a molded center spine
running cockpit to rear that is literally the car's backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Damping this stiffness so you don't get shaken and stirred on
bumps and in corners is a double wishbone suspension system mated
with really big stabilizer bars. The result is minimal lean in
corners, straight ahead acceleration stability, and a sense that
your spine is being pushed firmly back into the seat during hard
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you pay a bit of a price for stiff stability: there
is a slight corner-to-corner vibration noticeable when you
accelerate through sharp turns on less-than-smooth roads, and even
creased highways give the car a slight tremble. But it's also a
price worth paying for the overall stability in a car with this
much power.
</P>
<P>
   Aiding the suspension in keeping it all under control are ABS,
traction control, and an active handling system. In addition, the
power steering is a variable assist unit that changes touch as it
senses speed.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it's a very stable package (turn it off and you're on
your own in this rear-wheel-drive rocket and that's another
adventure), though I found the active handling system, which cuts
power to wheels when it senses trouble, a bit disconcerting at
first.
</P>
<P>
   Though I almost always prefer standard transmissions, especially
in performance cars, the 4-speed automatic in this test model did a
fine job of popping from gear to gear even as it let the engine do
what I wanted it to do.
</P>
<P>
   And the torque the C5 produces is something you feel from gas
pedal (when you depress it) to the back of your head (as it gets
pushed against the seat during acceleration).
</P>
<P>
   I got 20.7 miles per gallon _ a remarkable figure, I thought _
in a week of less-than-gentle driving.
</P>
<P>
   With its big engine, calculated rumble, and convertible top, the
Corvette is not a quiet car. You can't conduct cell phone business
in it while whisking down the road, but you shouldn't be on the
phone when you're driving this car anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The only ojectionable noise, and I found the body and
appointments to be remarkably squeak-free for a rigid convertible,
came from the hinges in the convertible top when the top was down.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of that top, it may be the easiest-to-use manual
convertible I've encountered. It takes seconds of easy effort to
lower and raise.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Corvette, with optional heads-up display, those great
power leather seats, dual-zone air conditioning, and other
performance goodies, breaks the $50,000 mark, but that puts it in a
unique niche. It's more powerful than almost any other car at that
price _ picking between the 'Vette and a Boxster S, say, is really
a choice of style rather than function.
</P>
<P>
   To match its oomph, you'd have to jump up into the $70,000
range, a jump that may send lots of folks scampering to their Chevy
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The slots behind the seats that extend all the way back into
the high-floored trunk. Great, accessible storage space.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --No one else is building an American competitor as yet, and I
love comparison shopping.

 &HT;    Skin, slams and protests: MTV
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It had more lip-synching than ``Solid Gold,'' more flesh-baring
than ``Sex and the City,'' more backstabbing than ``Survivor,'' and
enough Eminem to put the PTA on red-alert.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 MTV Music Video Awards _ shown live Thursday from New
York's Radio City Music Hall, and bound to rerun as often as the
Backstreet Boys'' Burger King commercials _ as usual met the cable
station's quota for fast, bleeped and out-of-control entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesome, the three-hour event was not. Aerosmith's Steven
Tyler explicitly addressed the sex life of MTV personality Carson
Daly; Sisqo performed his over-worn underwear hit ``Thong Song.''
Even teenyboppers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera showed
their wild sides in separate, feisty performances (Spears also
displayed her back-side).
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting, then, that shady rapper Eminem got the most
attention from the show. The real-life Marshall Mathers won for
video of the year and best male video for his dis-'em-all hit ``The
Real Slim Shady.'' He also provided the show's most entertaining
performance, coming in off the street with a fleet of a hundred or
so lookalikes following him.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred or so gay rights activists also followed Eminem to the
show in protest. His lyrics have been denounced by the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation as homophobic, and MTV made
concessions to the group by airing a commercial discouraging
violence against gays after Em's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper still got in the last word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a relative tries to sue me or a critic tries to
slam me ... I sell more records,'' he said when accepting his last
award, ``So, I gotta thank them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV tried to fly its rainbow colors by booking the world's most
famous gay man (for another 14 1/2 minutes, anyway). ``Survivor''
winner Richard Hatch was part of a forgettable skit with WWF star
Chyna _ something about finding out who was tougher. The audience
won, for sitting through the debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the show's first-time hosts, weren't
much funnier. Most of their monologue was met with meager laughs,
particularly a line about Firestone tires (``Some of you all aren't
laughing because you gotta drive home on them,'' they lamely tried
to cover up).
</P>
<P>
   Musically, other highlights included Rage Against the Machine's
straight-ahead blast through ``Testify,'' Blink-182's use of
high-flying midgets for its version of ``All The Small Things,''
and especially Nelly's live TV debut of ``Southern Grammar.''
Because Nelly recruited a half-dozen other rappers for his set,
though, the overnight chart-topper is still a faceless wonder.
</P>
<P>
   This MTV Awards had its own version of the ``Soy Bomb'' dancer,
from the 1998 Grammys: Someone climbed a giant, metallic prop 10
feet above the stage and sat there shaking it as the members of
Limp Bizkit were accepting the rock video award. That someone
turned out to be Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford,
who was arrested after the incident (and whose group lost the
award).
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy should be getting this award,'' Durst said watching
him, ``that's rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests, arrests, disses and cusses. The entire show turned out
to be quite rock 'n' roll.
</P>

   Most quotable
</P>
<P>
   O
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Wayans: ``We got Eve here ... oh, my bad, that's Sisqo'.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Wayans, on Britney Spears' risque performance: ``The girl
went from the Mickey Mouse Club to the strip club.''
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock, on Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford's
dare-devil protest: ``Is it for world peace? Is it for world
poverty? What are we fighting for?''
</P>
<P>
   Moby, presenting the rap video award (which Juvenile was up
for): ``Nothing is more exciting in a hip-hop artist's career than
when he gets his first platinum tooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem, on Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera: ``I don't have
any differences. I just don't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey, on Eminem: ``His lyrics are totally, socially
unacceptable, but I think we'll all be OK if we just spend more
time with our kids.''

 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing a soon-to-be-retired cavalry captain in the 1949 western
``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' John Wayne chides his young,
eager-to-please replacement: ``Never apologize, Cahill. It's a sign
of weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike today's captains of industry, Wayne's frontier Army
officer of the 1870s didn't have overnight groundswells of hostile
public opinion and plummeting stock prices to worry about. In the
age of instant mass communication and lawsuits, sackcloth and ashes
have become the uniform of the day for corporate officials trying
to live down a product safety or service fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   The trend was dramatically illustrated during a one-week period
last month when three of America's largest and proudest companies
aired network television ads begging pardon for various
transgressions _ United Airlines for a summer of flight foul-ups,
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. for its shredding tires and the Ford
Motor Co. for using the tires on its Explorer sport-utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apologies have become part of the cost of doing business,''
said the University of Florida's Jim Twitchwell in an interview.
``You make a faulty product, you know you are going to end up in
court, and you realize that you have to be seen as someone who just
made a mistake, not as someone who has made a calculated business
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But as perhaps the basic reason for the outbreak in corporate
repentance, Twitchwell cites an ethos that now pervades much of our
popular television entertainment, especially the confessional
variety. ``It's the era of Oprah Winfrey,'' said Twitchwell, an
English professor who is doing research for a book on what he views
as the modern obsession with apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no formal, scripted apology until the 20th
century,'' he said. ``I mean, Napoleon didn't apologize. ... Now we
have the culture of emotion, in which you want to feel good about
what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Business pundits prefer the hard-nosed explanation for the wave
of corporate atonement: Stonewalling just doesn't work anymore.
``You just can't hide things the way you used to,'' said Walter
Bennis of the University of California Business School. ``Consumers
find out about it on the Internet. ... And then it's breaking news
on CNN. You can't cover up anymore due to the cascade of
information.''
</P>
<P>
   As the main precursor and model for today's approach to crisis
management in the business world, Bennis and other experts point to
Johnson and Johnson CEO James Burke's tour-de-force handling of the
1982 Tylenol tampering episode. ``Right away, Jim Burke went on `60
Minutes' to say, `We screwed up,''' said Bennis, referring to
Burke's appearance on the CBS newsmagazine show.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate inspiration for the apologies from United,
Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford may have been the negative example
of former Coca-Cola CEO M. Douglas Ivester's stumbling performance
during last year's contamination scare in Belgium, according to
Bennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was slow getting over to Europe and getting on
television,'' said Bennis. ``That really backfired. ... I am
convinced that was what led to his being forced out.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have also been coming under pressure from within to
'fess up for alleged wrongdoing _ in the form of activist investors
who pool their money in mutual and pension funds that offer
``social screening'' information on the policies of various
companies toward the environment, racial and gender diversity and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for the rise of the movement in the 1970s when
institutional investors became dominant in the stock market, said
Ritchie Lowrey, a sociology professor at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the day of the individual investor, a Ford Moter Co. could
say to me, `You own 1,000 shares in Ford? We could care less,'''
said Lowrey, author of ``Good Money: A Guide to Profitable Social
Investing.'' ``But now if I get together with an institutional
investor and union pension fund and we threaten to pull our
holdings, it's not just 1,000 shares.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowrey said these investor groups will often reward companies
with a ``progressive'' posture by aggressively buying their stock.
``Or they will be pro-active,'' he explained. ``They will acquire a
company with a bad record ... and float shareholder proxies at
shareholder meetings to force change.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investor rebellions have been organized and coordinated
through outside groups like the Interfaith Center for Corporate
Responsibility in Manhattan, which was formed in the mid-1970s to
prod U.S. companies into pulling out of South Africa during the
days of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The center's membership now includes 275 religious groups and
commands holdings of over $100 billion in a broad range of
corporate portfolios, according to director Tim Smith. While
eschewing ``direct credit'' for the spate of corporate apologies in
recent years, he added in an interview, ``If the question is, `Are
we one of the groups that helped create a culture where companies
feel more accountable to the public?' the answer to that is
absolutely yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is convinced that while apologies make sense as a
damage-control strategy, they are sincere in many cases. ``There is
self-interest involved as well as very real remorse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked with the Ford Motor Co. over the years and I
know something like this is very worrisome to them,'' Smith said of
the tire problem. ``They really value their brand name and
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts see another motivation for corporate contrition:
terror. ``Companies have to handle their public relations
differently because they know they have an angry public out
there,'' said Nancy Snow, a political science professor at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with a debacle like the tire scandal, ``They
have to show they are doing something now, or they could be out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow argues that public antagonism toward big companies is being
fueled at least partially by the perception that they have used
loopholes in campaign finance laws to become the chief bankrollers
of a political system that favors the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, legal liability also contributes to the fright
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are facing strong liability and are trying to affect the
jury pool,'' charged Trial Lawyer Association leader Doug Sheff of
the recent apology blitz on the part of Firestone and Ford. ``The
idea is you get your message out before (the juries) even get in
the box.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Sheff, an attorney in Boston, said he believes corporate America
has been spooked by the multibillion-dollar damage awards voted by
juries against the tobacco companies in the past half-decade,
ending their long winning streak in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impenetrable wall of corporate silence has been broken,''
said Sheff. ``There are a lot more people, including ex-employees,
who are willing to speak up and talk about things like documents
that are embarrassing.''

during last year's contamination scare in Belgium, according to
Bennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was slow getting over to Europe and getting on
television,'' said Bennis. ``That really backfired. ... I am
convinced that was what led to his being forced out.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have also been coming under pressure from within to
'fess up for alleged wrongdoing _ in the form of activist investors
who pool their money in mutual and pension funds that offer
``social screening'' information on the policies of various
companies toward the environment, racial and gender diversity and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for the rise of the movement in the 1970s when
institutional investors became dominant in the stock market, said
Ritchie Lowrey, a sociology professor at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the day of the individual investor, a Ford Moter Co. could
say to me, `You own 1,000 shares in Ford? We could care less,'''
said Lowrey, author of ``Good Money: A Guide to Profitable Social
Investing.'' ``But now if I get together with an institutional
investor and union pension fund and we threaten to pull our
holdings, it's not just 1,000 shares.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowrey said these investor groups will often reward companies
with a ``progressive'' posture by aggressively buying their stock.
``Or they will be pro-active,'' he explained. ``They will acquire a
company with a bad record ... and float shareholder proxies at
shareholder meetings to force change.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investor rebellions have been organized and coordinated
through outside groups like the Interfaith Center for Corporate
Responsibility in Manhattan, which was formed in the mid-1970s to
prod U.S. companies into pulling out of South Africa during the
days of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The center's membership now includes 275 religious groups and
commands holdings of over $100 billion in a broad range of
corporate portfolios, according to director Tim Smith. While
eschewing ``direct credit'' for the spate of corporate apologies in
recent years, he added in an interview, ``If the question is, `Are
we one of the groups that helped create a culture where companies
feel more accountable to the public?' the answer to that is
absolutely yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is convinced that while apologies make sense as a
damage-control strategy, they are sincere in many cases. ``There is
self-interest involved as well as very real remorse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked with the Ford Motor Co. over the years and I
know something like this is very worrisome to them,'' Smith said of
the tire problem. ``They really value their brand name and
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts see another motivation for corporate contrition:
terror. ``Companies have to handle their public relations
differently because they know they have an angry public out
there,'' said Nancy Snow, a political science professor at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with a debacle like the tire scandal, ``They
have to show they are doing something now, or they could be out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow argues that public antagonism toward big companies is being
fueled at least partially by the perception that they have used
loopholes in campaign finance laws to become the chief bankrollers
of a political system that favors the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, legal liability also contributes to the fright
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are facing strong liability and are trying to affect the
jury pool,'' charged Trial Lawyer Association leader Doug Sheff of
the recent apology blitz on the part of Firestone and Ford. ``The
idea is you get your message out before (the juries) even get in
the box.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Sheff, an attorney in Boston, said he believes corporate America
has been spooked by the multibillion-dollar damage awards voted by
juries against the tobacco companies in the past half-decade,
ending their long winning streak in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impenetrable wall of corporate silence has been broken,''
said Sheff. ``There are a lot more people, including ex-employees,
who are willing to speak up and talk about things like documents
that are embarrassing.''

&HT;     RULING SHIELDS DOCTORS WHO DISCUSS MARIJUANA WITH PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge said the law that declares
marijuana a dangerous drug does not authorize the government to
punish doctors who tell seriously ill patients that marijuana might
ease their pain.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuff of federal drug policy chief Barry McCaffrey, who
sought to strip marijuana-recommending doctors of their authority
to prescribe legal medicines, was a setback for the Clinton
administration in its relentless battle against California's
medical marijuana law.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has had more success in going after local
organizations that supply pot to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Supreme Court stopped the Oakland Cannabis Buyers'
Cooperative from distributing marijuana to its members while the
courts ponder whether evidence of dire medical need justifies an
exemption from federal drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   In short, under the latest court decisions, a doctor can
recommend marijuana legally but a cooperative cannot supply it
legally.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup
``demonstrates the legal, medical and philosophical bankruptcy of
the government's position with respect to medical cannabis,'' said
Robert Raich, a lawyer for the Oakland cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Boyd, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer
representing doctors and patients who sued McCaffrey, was more
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this strong opinion signals that the war on
doctors has come to an end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Weiner, a spokesman for McCaffrey's Office of National Drug
Control Policy, said the agency had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 215, a ballot initiative approved by California
voters, lets patients use marijuana, based on a doctor's
recommendation, without risking prosecution under state drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say it often is the only effective medication to
combat nausea and other side effects of treatments for the acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cancer. Seven other states
have similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after voters approved the measure in
November 1996, McCaffrey announced that doctors who recommended
marijuana would lose their registration with the Drug Enforcement
Administration, which they need to prescribe legal drugs, and could
face criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The government issued a clarifying statement two months later,
saying doctors were free to discuss the pros and cons of marijuana
as long as they stopped short of recommending the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Fern Smith ruled that doctors still
faced an unacceptable risk of punishment for speaking freely, and
issued a preliminary injunction in April 1997 protecting
physicians, unless they did something to help patients get
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd argued that doctors remained fearful of even discussing
marijuana and sought a broader injunction from Alsup, who was
assigned the case when Smith moved to another job.
</P>
<P>
   Alsup refused Boyd's request to restrict criminal prosecutions
of doctors, saying it was speculative because the government had
not tried to prosecute anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But he went a step beyond Smith by ruling that doctors could
issue oral or written recommendations for marijuana _ short of a
formal prescription _ even if they knew a patient might obtain the
drug illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sincere recommendation alone is not a federal crime, even if
the doctor foresees it could be used to facilitate a federal
crime,'' Alsup wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He said doctors, if asked, must tell patients that marijuana is
illegal. But Alsup rejected the government's distinction between
discussing and recommending marijuana and said patients are
entitled to hear a doctor's opinion that marijuana is the best
available therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such recommendations could not be communicated, then the
physician-patient relationship would be seriously impaired,'' the
judge said.

TO ERR IS PRESIDENTIAL: WE SALUTE THE HIGH PRIESTS OF MALAPROP
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no secret. I know they curse. I know they say things they
don't mean and mean things they don't say. I know they blurt out
goofy comments in moments of unintended honesty or become so
tongue-tied that their comments make no sense at all. And their
jokes can have a cruel edge.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I was bugged for hours when a National Public Radio
reporter last weekend announced that Texas Gov. George W. Bush used
``earthy language'' in describing a New York Times reporter.
</P>
<P>
   What specifically was this ``earthy language''? I had to know.
</P>
<P>
   I listened to and watched news until I finally got the full
curse down. At first blush my thought was: ``A major-league what?
That's not presidential!''
</P>
<P>
   Then I recalled that this comment would pale compared to some of
those spewed by LBJ or Richard Nixon. It would falter alongside
more serious bloopers. And it reminded me of Sen. Eugene McCarthy,
who in his 1968 campaign announced: ``It is dangerous for a
national candidate to say things people might remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every blunder by politicians is like the George W. Bush
comment _ unintentionally picked up by a live mike, a comment for
which he, as of press time, has offered no apology.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, history is full of goofy remarks that fall into the
category of Things a Presidential-Type Person Said And May Later

 &HT;    Redhawks trying to avoid letdown
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   YPSILANTI, Mich. _ Geographically speaking, the road from
Nashville to Columbus does not run through Ypsilanti, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   But it does on the map that plots the season for Miami and the
RedHawks better keep that in mind today as they face Eastern
Michigan, a detour ominously sandwiched between last Saturday's
emotionally draining season-opening win at Vanderbilt and next
Saturday's historic visit to Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win a game the way we did at Vanderbilt,'' coach
Terry Hoeppner said in referring to the comeback that produced two
touchdowns in the final three minutes for a 33-30 victory, ``there
is a natural tendency to let down, to feel too good about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't see any signs of that this week. The players
worked hard and they were focused. And they were focused on Eastern
Michigan. We (the coaches) weren't thinking about Ohio State and we
weren't talking about Ohio State. And I don't think the players
were, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastern also launched the season in dramatic fashion, scoring
with 1:50 left to beat Connecticut, 32-25.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have had only one winning record in the last 10 years
and a win over Miami would trigger an emotional high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, we were the hunters,'' Hoeppner said. ``This week,
we're the hunted. Not to take anything away from Eastern, but
beating us would be a big boost for their program.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami has a 14-4 edge in the series and has won seven of the
last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have been hard to prepare for because of new head
coach Jeff Woodruff, a former assistant at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had only the Connecticut game to study,'' Hoeppner
said. ``We looked at Arizona (tapes during the offseason in an
effort to get a read on Woodruff) and he didn't bring anything with
him, offensively or defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Woodruff didn't have to bring was a quarterback. He
inherited three-year starter Walter Church, who is breaking all of
the school passing records set by Charlie Batch, now a starter in
the NFL with Detroit.

 &HT;    Don't you just love receiving an invitation?
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin's social season is in full swing. What
kicks it off for you? The Admiral's Ball? Back-to-school night? A
Longhorn tailgate party? The Woman's Symphony League's Jewel Ball?
The Austin Assembly brunch? Come autumn, mail boxes (e- and
otherwise) explode with invitations _ weddings, dinner parties,
birthdays, showers and anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   They arrive heart-felt and often hand-written. I open each one,
fingering the heft of the paper, noting the ingenuity of the host
and feeling slightly heady at having been included at all.
Sometimes I have made the cut because it's a phone book occasion
(everyone in it was invited), but even then I experience an almost
girlish response to have been chosen.
</P>
<P>
   As a tyke, my birthday parties were announced by a packet of
preprinted, fill-in-the-blank, simple invitations carefully
selected from the racks of the five-and-dime. OK, so Winn's is long
gone and so are most of these invitations. But the spirit lives.
Filling in those blanks made me feel like Caroline Astor (the Mrs.
Astor, creator of the first American social register, ``The 400'')
if only for a few minutes. While Austinites do not usually
entertain in locales as grand as The Astor's Rhode Island digs,
invitations announce all sorts of events.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder what to wear when the dress is Texas tux? Do
nonprofits spend a bankroll on invitations to lure you to an
occasion? Who is crazy enough to write out wedding invitations by
hand? Do e-mail addresses on response cards work? Is R.S.V.P. a
cognac? Is there a silver lining to traditional wording? Before you
open your next invitation or plan a soiree, peruse this edition of
the Greig Files. So it is not a guaranteed spot on every invitation
A-list invitation, but it is a fun, informative read.
</P>
<P>
   What's special about an invitation?
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets the tone of the party,'' says Claire Saunders of the
Party Cat. Always send the invitation that packs the biggest wallop
_ you won't regret it. After all, invitations are a small item on
party budgets. And remember, says Saunders, ``To invitees that
can't come to the party, the invitation is their only impression of
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Do people really mail invitations?
</P>
<P>
   More than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate events, anniversary parties, dinner parties, showers,
rehearsal dinners. Sending a printed invitation with all the
information _ dress to locale _ helps both the hostess and the
guest. Slap a colorful invitation on the bathroom mirrors or
refrigerator. Saves confusion. Saves time. With the quick
turnarounds from stationers and ability to print your own, the cost
of an invitation has plummeted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't they name it Zenas?
</P>
<P>
   Because they used the founder's last, not first, name _ Crane.
</P>
<P>
   The company founded in 1801 supplies currency paper, cotton
papers for business correspondence as well as stationery for
invitations. Zenas' father sold Paul Revere paper in 1775 for the
cColonies' paper currency. Crane supplies the paper for most
official state events as well as a few minor blips on the social
scene screen _ the dedication of the Statue of Liberty and the
opening of the Golden Gate Bridge to name two.
</P>
<P>
   What do custom invitations cost?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the customer wants to spend, says Paper Place's Molly
Smith. You can use printer compatible stock and do it yourself, or
have a calligrapher pen them on Crane's finest gold bevel-edged
stock.
</P>
<P>
   This veteran Austin stationer has fashioned custom labels as the
invitation affixed to a bottle of wine for a Napa Valley party
($2.50 per label plus wine) and tied layers of ribbon on nail
polish bottles nested in confetti and mailed to guests to a
teen-ager's day-of-beauty party ($5 each). Need a family crest
engraving die? No problem if you have $1,700 for the multi-layered
hand-cut copper die.
</P>
<P>
   Having helped pen everything from the invitations for a wedding
at Deep Eddy (``so and so take the plunge'') to a hHarlequin
romance-theme wedding, Smith is ready to word anything _
Thank-Goodness-I-am-divorced parties to Fido-turns-5 fetesparties.
</P>
<P>
   Her most unusual request? To print a single wedding invitation
to a mythical marriage in Cancun for a student to present as
``evidence'' to professor. Cutting class used to be easier.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely leave the keyboard but want to Friday night?
</P>
<P>
   Then Evite.com is the site for you _ create lists, discuss a
rendezvous with friends online, send and receive electronic
invitations. No muss. No fuss. No postage. Perfect for popular
techies who have no magnets, much less refrigerators, and a hard
time keeping IPO celebration dinner party dates straight. Millions
use this service and find it the Filofax of the century.
</P>
<P>
   What is the too-too and much-much of wedding invitations?
</P>
<P>
   Those created by the hand calligraphers at Pendragon Ink. The
entire invitation (not just the envelopes and reply cards) are
calligraphied and may be adorned with a hand-painted flower (how
about a bluebonnet?). Pendragon Ink creations are a hot item,
reports Nancy Owen of Alegra's Discount Bridal and Invitations. She
would know. Her shop handles the invitations for about 1,000
weddings a year.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes on the wedding invitation scene?
</P>
<P>
   Colored inks and a return to very traditional wedding
invitations. ``People are realizing a wedding is an adult event and
have ceased creating cutesy invitations that read like a pPrecious
mMoments card,'' says Owen. Many weddings are taking place abroad
with large receptions given in Austin after the honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   Maps and stamped reply cards are standard enclosures, although
Owen refuses to include registry information in wedding
invitations. Amen!
</P>
<P>
   What would Emily say?
</P>
<P>
   A good rhetorical to have ready when facing relatives (current
and soon-to-be) who question the phrasing on a wedding invitation.
If you stick with traditional wording, you always have a plausible
defense for not including your step-father'sstepfather's third wife
in the invitation text.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the traditional wording stangleholdstrangleholds on
wedding invitations has loosened in recent years. Couples who are
footfooting the tab want (and deserve) top billing, and often both
sets of parents issue the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   A note of caution. Think twice before going over-the-top cute
(``We were friends, We were lovers, Come to the Wedding, But bring
no others''). Consider how your grandchildren will react to it 40
years from now!
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line? An invitation reflects the sentiments of the couple
_ conventional or current.
</P>
<P>
   Received a ``Save the Date'' card?
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't yet, you will soon. In the hectic schedules of
working and travelling families, hostesses have begun sending such
notices (e.g. _ Save the date: March 17, Erin &AMP; Jake's wedding in
Maine) so an event can be placed on a calender calendar well in
advance. Four to six weeks notice for a wedding or family reunion
is not enough time to schedule vacations, day care, cash-in
frequent-fliyer miles or snag boffo prices on airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy, can you spare $2.50?
</P>
<P>
   That is what the average invitation to a non-profit fund-raiser
costs, estimates Junior League's ``A Christmas Affair'' chair Lisa
Rodman. Besides chairing this four-day event (Nov. 15-19) expected
to raise more than $800,000, Rodman has worked on other major
events such as the opening of the Austin Children's' Museum.: ``The
invitations to such events sends a message to those who may not
attend the event and honors sponsors,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Lleague will send these invitations to
approximately 9,000 on a carefully culled list. Overwhelmed by some
gala invitations? Remember, most costs are covered by in-kind
donations of service, and labor (assembly, addressing, bulk mail
preparation, etc.) is courtesy of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   What's with the buttons and bows?
</P>
<P>
   Embellishments, they are called embellishments _, are a very
popular addition to invitations, notes Smith. Vellum overlays
(those see-through sheets with a pattern or the party info) are
often added with a hand-tied ribbon or raffia bow.
</P>
<P>
   Inventive invitation types see possibilities everywhere. For
example, extra large playing cards hole-punched and tied to a
vellum overlay to announce a Cassinocasino party. Embellishments
can mean nights at the kitchen table or an extra fee for stationers
staff who are paid to create the look. Worth it to show a guest
your taste.

  More `average folks' using plastic surgery to carve a new image 
(For use after Mon., Sept. 11, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
(Eds: Has sidebar: Checking Surgery Credentials) 
 
 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are a city obsessed by appearances, usually somebody else's.
The customers who go into the Beverly Hills salons, beauty
magazines tucked under their arms with the page folded to an
actress or model, are seeking the celebrity's hair, body, face _ or
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who I want to be,'' they say.
</P>
<P>
   Some really mean it and head straight for a cosmetic surgeon who
can give them anyone's complete appearance.
</P>
<P>
   That's basically the path taken by a Newport Beach woman who
goes by the name Margarita. It wasn't that she didn't like her own
face. Yes, she wanted it to be less rounded and to lose the bump
from her nose. More importantly, Margarita says, she has been
bewitched since childhood by another woman's appearance and
behavior. That someone was Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was fascinated by her, and I suppose she read the
magazines, and then I would look at the magazines and think, 'What
a pretty lady,''' says Margarita. ``I just admired the woman, no
matter what anybody says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the song Elton John wrote. She's a 'candle in the
wind.' Her flame has flickered out but her legend lives on, and
this is how I wanted to immortalize her.''
</P>
<P>
   After having surgical alterations done to her eyes, cheeks,
nose, lips and forehead, Margarita had new employment
opportunities. She works as a look-alike at bachelor parties, on
cruise ships and at other engagements. If you've got the look and
enough acting ability to successfully mimic the chosen celeb's
style, you could make some serious money.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dan Gore, who has booked and managed celebrity
impersonators for 10 years, the successful faux ``Chers,''
``Madonnas'' and ``Rickys'' out there can pull in $1,500 for a
single evening at a corporate event or convention. Snagging a
commercial overseas will earn a look-alike three times that much.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of look-alikes are even hired by the person they're
impersonating to serve as a stand-in during a film or video shoot.
In addition to the $400 for a single day of work, you get the
benefit of saying you worked for Madonna or Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few of them are able to work full time,'' says Gore,
whose company, Incredible Creations on Stage, recently managed a
female impersonator show, Carnival Cabaret, in Lake Tahoe.
``There's one 'Cher' out there who looks a lot like her. Then there
are three or four others who have had lots of surgery to compete
with the one who looks most like her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. C. Lin Puckett, president of the American Society of Plastic
Surgeons, considers it both common and healthy for a patient
dissatisfied with a certain part of her appearance _ a nose for
example _ to use a celebrity's nose as a model for what she would
prefer.
</P>
<P>
   But a total transformation?
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that would be a phenomenon that is unique to
California and especially to the Los Angeles area,'' says Puckett,
a professor of plastic surgery at the University of Missouri. ``The
majority of us have not been confronted by someone saying she wants
to look like Kim Basinger, except in a joking manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's cosmetic surgeon Nikolas Chugay, who has not only
been confronted by such a person, he seeks them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your face is your fortune,'' trumpets a media release from the
Lee Solters Co., a Beverly Hills-based public relations firm
employed by Chugay. ``Life is too short to live it wishing for that
which genetics forgot to provide as standard issue, especially when
it means the difference between hefty paychecks and the
unemployment line,'' the release form continues. ``After all, one
can do a lot worse than making beaucoup bucks resembling one of the
Beautiful People.''
</P>
<P>
   Chugay insists he wasn't initially looking for the look-alike
enhancement niche. One day, a man came into his office wanting to
look like former Roseanne husband Tom Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   After studying pictures, Chugay determined the bone structure of
this man's face was close enough to Arnold's that Chugay could
enhance the look. The nose would need some work, and the chin. He
would also get liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people start that way,'' says Chugay. ``Somebody tells
them they look a little bit like Ricky Martin and the wheels start
turning.''
</P>
<P>
   Chugay has also done a Michael Jackson, a Marilyn Monroe and an
Elvis Presley. New clients include folks wanting to resemble
Leonardo DiCaprio and Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Performing a total transformation on a look-alike raises certain
red flags among cosmetic surgeons. Anybody who wants to look like
someone else that desperately needs to be treated with caution. If
you're going to take their money, doctors say, be careful how much
you raise their hopes.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-based cosmetic surgeon Dr. Michael McGuire says potential
customers should not be given false guarantees or made to think
that their lives will necessarily change just because, after
surgery, they might look more like a famous person than they did to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   And that's if they're lucky. More often than not, a person
hoping to look like someone else will simply look different,
McGuire says, and not necessarily better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient who comes in and truly wants to look like a
celebrity is a rarity, and most of those patients are
psychologically handicapped,'' says McGuire, immediate past
president of the California Society of Plastic Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have unrealistic expectations,'' he adds. ``They
think they're going to get the mate or the job of their choice or
the promotion they long sought. But the only thing holding them
back is that they don't look like Tom Cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   A doctor who encourages this line of thinking, McGuire claims,
is doing both himself and his patient a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient will experience failure both surgically and
psychologically,'' McGuire says. ``Then you're going to have an
unhappy patient after many stages and tremendous expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Margarita _ who was looking to celebrate Marilyn more than to
enhance her own job prospects _ said she spoke to a psychologist
before going under the knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any individual doing such drastic changes should speak to
somebody and know for sure that's what he wants,'' she says. ``I
did that, and it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she think Chugay is doing anything irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's a genius,'' she says. ``The man actually studied
the face like an artist. He created a totally different person.''
</P>
<P>
   Chugay, who estimates that a complete transformation will run
anywhere from $15,000-$30,000, says he has experienced little or no
criticism from colleagues over his celebrity look-alike
enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them say, 'Wow, that's kind of interesting,''' says
Chugay. ``I didn't really intend to do this, and I haven't
experienced that much negativity to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   He also says he talks with prospective patients thoroughly
before agreeing to perform any procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turn down more people than I (accept). They may look quite
different (from the celebrity). We discuss in pretty great detail
what's involved, and we decide together,'' says Chugay, a doctor of
osteopathy who studied at the Chicago College of Osteopathy and
Medicine and performed a plastic surgery fellowship in Rio de
Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   However, a three-year probation against Chugay's license from
the Osteopathic Medical Board of California based on a patient
accusation will be completed in April 2001. It will be the third
probationary period he has completed in the course of his career.
He is allowed to continue practicing as long as he complies with
the terms of his probation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet satisfied customers claim Chugay has both improved their
appearance and enhanced their professional career. They say they
went under Chugay's knife with clear head, and are more than
satisfied with the results.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Erhardt insists the changes he hired Chugay to perform,
which included a chin cleft and narrowing of the nostrils, weren't
substantial. The result, however, was that Erhardt ended up looking
like Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Which was fine with Erhardt who, with the use of clothing,
makeup and mimicry could pull off the rest of the illusion and get
``more work than I want'' as a Jackson look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have the same basic features as Michael,'' says Erhardt,
a trained makeup artist who lives in Los Angeles. ``Not only do I
look like him, I act like him. I sound exactly like him when I'm
working.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more than a little irony here, of course. It's a bit of
a challenge to make someone look like a person who is more than a
little bit famous for his own changing appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jackson is always in transformation himself,'' says
Chugay, with a laugh. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good idea to check the professional and educational
background of any doctor you plan to consult or hire. Especially in
plastic surgery, where the person charging you thousands of dollars
to fix your appearance may have had the bulk of his or her training
in gynecology or even dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of California, any doctor licensed as a physician
and surgeon can legally perform any surgical procedure on an
outpatient basis, says Dr. Thomas R. Stevenson, president of the
California Society of Plastic Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real bellwether is if the doctor has hospital
privileges,'' says Stevenson, professor and chief of plastic
surgery at UC Davis. ``Hospitals have much more stringent criteria
for privileges. They wouldn't let me do neurosurgery at this or any
other hospital unless I proved I was qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   If a plastic surgeon claims to be board certified, patients
should ask his field of certification, say officials from the
American Society of Plastic Surgeons _ the educational branch of
the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS). The answer will
determine how much and what type of training the doctor has
received.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve to understand that there are
boards that are legitimate and real and others that are sort of
contrived,'' says Dr. C. Lin Puckett, president of the American
Board of Plastic Surgeons and professor of plastic surgery at the
University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``American people who are seeking cosmetic surgery or any other
kind of plastic surgery are probably sophisticated enough to ask if
someone is board certified. They are not necessarily sophisticated
enough to differentiate when that individual says, `Yes, I'm
certified by the Two-Step Board of Plastic Surgery.'''
</P>
<P>
   In order to receive certification in plastic surgery from the
ABPS, members must have graduated from an accredited medical school
and completed at least five years of additional training: three in
general surgery, two in plastic surgery. They have practiced
plastic surgery for an additional two years and passed
comprehensive written and oral exams. Certification must be renewed
every seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Both medical doctors (MDs) and doctors of osteopathy (DOs) can
earn board certification from the ABPS. Osteopathy is a system of
healing that emphasizes manipulation (as of joints) but does not
exclude other uses of medicine or surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Osteopaths can also gain certification in plastic surgery
through the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) by undergoing
two years of training in plastic and reconstructive surgery
following three years of training in surgery or an AOA-approved and
completed residency program in orthopedic surgery or an
AOA-approved and completed residency in otolaryngology/facial
plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In order to be certified through the American Board of Facial
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, a doctor has to have previous
certification from the ABPS or the American Board of
Otolaryngology. The doctor will have graduated from a residency
approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
Education (ACGME), been in private practice for two years in facial
plastic surgery, and have passed written and oral exams. &QL;

 &HT;    VOTERS MAY PUNISH BUSH FOR DEBATE STANCE, HISTORY SUGGESTS
 &HT;    1030&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories
for release Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By rejecting the traditional presidential debates,
George W. Bush is making the same strategic error that doomed his
father's 1992 campaign, experts say: talking too much about his
opponent, and not enough about the voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the final months of a presidential campaign, ``the message
from voters is, 'I want to hear about me. I don't want to hear
about (the candidates) any more,' `` said Celinda Lake, a noted
Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   No event of the entire sprawling presidential campaign draws the
attention of voters like the face-to-face encounters sponsored by
the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Three times as many voters watch these nationally televised
debates as the party conventions. In 1992, the viewership
approached 100 million people. And about 35 percent of the voters
make their candidate choice based on the debates, according to exit
polls from the 1992 and 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who skips the debates, or who tries to negotiate
substitute formats that lengthen the distance between candidate and
voter, is likely to pay a stiff political price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debates are essentially the final job interview for
presidential candidates,'' said Diana Carlin, a University of
Kansas communications professor who serves on the debate
commission's advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only time you have the candidates in the same place,
the only time you can really compare them side by side,'' added
Carlin. ``And if all they do are shows like 'Meet the Press' and
'Larry King Live,' a lot of people are going to say, 'Wait a minute
_ this was totally candidate-controlled, and there was no chance
for the public to have input.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Carlin's conclusion is based on a dozen years of research for
the debate commission created in 1987 by a coalition of Democratic
and Republican luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Lake's assessment is cast in starker political terms: ``There's
no way someone is up to the job of president if he won't even
debate an opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not try to avoid debates altogether. But he proposed a
substitute plan that not only eliminated two of the three 90-minute
debates proposed by the commission, but also favored friendlier
formats with a smaller viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also omitted the format preferred the most by
voters: the town hall meeting, in which voters themselves, rather
than a moderator or panel of journalists, do the bulk of the
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush compounded his problem by promoting his plan in a way that
even his own campaign officials now acknowledge was a mistake.
Recalling Gore's vow to debate him ``any time, any place,'' Bush
argued that Gore's credibility was in tatters. He even taunted the
vice president in a TV interview: ``Let's get it on, Mr. Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a ludicrous argument,'' an unidentified Bush adviser
acknowledged to the New York Times on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore has long been regarded in political circles as a
gifted debater with a quick command of facts and a taste for the
jugular.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, despite his success in Republican primary debates
against the likes of Sen. John McCain of Arizona, has yet to bury
the doubts about his intellect that were triggered by his woeful
handling of a TV reporter's pop quiz on the names of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has given the people the feeling that he's afraid to meet
Gore,'' said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the
University of Virginia. ``Bush doesn't want to be followed by a guy
in a chicken costume, which will happen soon if this isn't
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hecklers dressed in chicken costumes and holding signs that read
``Chicken George'' started showing up at the rallies of President
Bush in 1992 in an effort to prod him into debates with Clinton,
the Democratic challenger, and Ross Perot, who ran as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor's father and namesake, eventually
agreed to meet Clinton and Perot in three debates. One of them
sheds light on his son's political problems this year.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush had built his general election strategy upon
questions about Clinton's patriotism and already tarnished
character, a tactic that had some success against the 1988
Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   But at the second presidential debate of 1992, a town hall
meeting in Richmond, Va., audience member Kimberly Usry challenged
Bush to stop ``trashing'' his opponent's character and start
discussing ``the genuine complexity'' of the issues, especially the
economic recession that had cost her a job in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded with a defense of his attacks on Clinton's
character, insisting, ``it's fair to put it in focus.'' But when it
came time for Clinton to respond, the challenger agreed with Usry
and took credit for insisting on the town hall format that allowed
her to raise issues directly with the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In Carlin's post-1992 election research, David Wilhelm, who had
managed the 1992 Clinton campaign, observed: ``Bush kept trying to
make the campaign about Clinton, and the American people wanted the
campaign to be about them _ their problems, their hopes, their
dreams, their economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since accepting the Democratic presidential
nomination, Gore has taken up where Clinton left off.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's populist appeals to ``working families'' have filled the
policy void left by Bush's emphasis on his own character as a
political antidote to the personal disgraces of Clinton and, by
extension, Gore, his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush seems to have gotten the message well before his father
did in losing to Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   After the worst three weeks of his candidacy, the governor is
retooling his campaign to include more intimate gatherings with
voters, talking more about issues and less about Gore's faults.
</P>
<P>
   The hasty restyling apparently includes a new willingness to
negotiate a compromise over the debate stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush was vowing to be in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday to
debate Gore in a prime-time edition of ``Meet the Press,'' even
though NBC officials said the show would not be broadcast without
both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   How far Bush will go toward a compromise is far from clear, even
though nearly everything in presidential debates is negotiable,
even under the plan already suggested by the commission: formats,
statement and rebuttal times, camera angles, set designs, lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Such negotiations are as old as the Lincoln-Douglas debates
about slavery before the Civil War. ``They had their own debate on
the debates,'' said Carlin, ``only it was by couriers on horseback
instead of on TV and in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlin said it was politically astute for Bush to stake out a
debate position rather than simply accepting the commission's
recommendations outright. ``Every candidate wants a comfort
level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she argued that the approach most favored by voters _ three
90-minute debates of varying formats, each devoted to four of the
top 12 issues, with longer response times _ gives candidates a
greater opportunity to find that comfort level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having just one debate raises the stakes, and it gives you no
opportunity to recover from a gaffe or to clarify something,'' she
said. ``Candidates are going to gain more if they're giving the
public something they want.''
</P>
<P>
   But too often, Carlin added, candidates are poorly served by
their more strategic-minded campaign handlers, who often
underestimate the candidate's abilities and inadvertently negotiate
away their comfort zones.
</P>
<P>
   She cited a 1996 town hall debate in San Diego. Dole strategists
worried about Clinton moving close to the audience, the way he did
in 1992 in Richmond. To prevent wandering, they demanded that the
area in front of the podiums be marked with tape.
</P>
<P>
   When Dole arrived to inspect the stage, he asked about the tape
in the shape of a baseball coaching box in front of the podium.
Informed that the candidates could not move beyond the tape, Dole
demanded, ``You mean I can't move around?'' He heatedly pointed out
that his political career began with town hall meetings in Russell,
Kansas. But his negotiators had, quite literally, boxed him in.

 &HT;    VOTERS MAY PUNISH BUSH FOR DEBATE STANCE, HISTORY SUGGESTS

for release Sunday, Sept. 10.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By rejecting the traditional presidential debates,
George W. Bush is making the same strategic error that doomed his
father's 1992 campaign, experts say: talking too much about his
opponent, and not enough about the voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the final months of a presidential campaign, ``the message
from voters is, 'I want to hear about me. I don't want to hear
about (the candidates) any more,' `` said Celinda Lake, a noted
Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   No event of the entire sprawling presidential campaign draws the
attention of voters like the face-to-face encounters sponsored by
the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Three times as many voters watch these nationally televised
debates as the party conventions. In 1992, the viewership
approached 100 million people. And about 35 percent of the voters
make their candidate choice based on the debates, according to exit
polls from the 1992 and 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who skips the debates, or who tries to negotiate
substitute formats that lengthen the distance between candidate and
voter, is likely to pay a stiff political price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debates are essentially the final job interview for
presidential candidates,'' said Diana Carlin, a University of
Kansas communications professor who serves on the debate
commission's advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only time you have the candidates in the same place,
the only time you can really compare them side by side,'' added
Carlin. ``And if all they do are shows like 'Meet the Press' and
'Larry King Live,' a lot of people are going to say, 'Wait a minute
_ this was totally candidate-controlled, and there was no chance
for the public to have input.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Carlin's conclusion is based on a dozen years of research for
the debate commission created in 1987 by a coalition of Democratic
and Republican luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Lake's assessment is cast in starker political terms: ``There's
no way someone is up to the job of president if he won't even
debate an opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not try to avoid debates altogether. But he proposed a
substitute plan that not only eliminated two of the three 90-minute
debates proposed by the commission, but also favored friendlier
formats with a smaller viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also omitted the format preferred the most by
voters: the town hall meeting, in which voters themselves, rather
than a moderator or panel of journalists, do the bulk of the
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush compounded his problem by promoting his plan in a way that
even his own campaign officials now acknowledge was a mistake.
Recalling Gore's vow to debate him ``any time, any place,'' Bush
argued that Gore's credibility was in tatters. He even taunted the
vice president in a TV interview: ``Let's get it on, Mr. Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a ludicrous argument,'' an unidentified Bush adviser
acknowledged to the New York Times on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore has long been regarded in political circles as a
gifted debater with a quick command of facts and a taste for the
jugular.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, despite his success in Republican primary debates
against the likes of Sen. John McCain of Arizona, has yet to bury
the doubts about his intellect that were triggered by his woeful
handling of a TV reporter's pop quiz on the names of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has given the people the feeling that he's afraid to meet
Gore,'' said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the
University of Virginia. ``Bush doesn't want to be followed by a guy
in a chicken costume, which will happen soon if this isn't
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hecklers dressed in chicken costumes and holding signs that read
``Chicken George'' started showing up at the rallies of President
Bush in 1992 in an effort to prod him into debates with Clinton,
the Democratic challenger, and Ross Perot, who ran as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor's father and namesake, eventually
agreed to meet Clinton and Perot in three debates. One of them
sheds light on his son's political problems this year.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush had built his general election strategy upon
questions about Clinton's patriotism and already tarnished
character, a tactic that had some success against the 1988
Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   But at the second presidential debate of 1992, a town hall
meeting in Richmond, Va., audience member Kimberly Usry challenged
Bush to stop ``trashing'' his opponent's character and start
discussing ``the genuine complexity'' of the issues, especially the
economic recession that had cost her a job in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded with a defense of his attacks on Clinton's
character, insisting, ``it's fair to put it in focus.'' But when it
came time for Clinton to respond, the challenger agreed with Usry
and took credit for insisting on the town hall format that allowed
her to raise issues directly with the candidates.

10-YEAR-OLD MACS AND OTHER ANTIQUES
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Corrects 800 megabytes to 800 kilobytes in first item) 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have been using a Macintosh SE/30 for the
past 10 years. My wife uses a PC with Windows 95. There are
important documents I would like to transfer to her PC. You
recently suggested inserting a PC floppy into the Mac to copy the
files. I get two choices when I try: eject or initialize.
</P>
<P>
   _ MacStuck
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MACSTUCK: You know, you might be able to sell a Mac that
old to an Apple collector and make enough to buy a new one. Anybody
want to buy my IIe? I could use some cash, too.
</P>
<P>
   The original SEs _ tiny little Macs with tiny little monitors _
had 800-kilobyte floppy drives. If that's what you've got, forget
about flipping floppies with a PC: the hardware just won't do the
job. The SE/30s were supposed to come with Apple's Superdrive,
which could read 1.44-megabyte Mac and PC disks as well as the
older Mac floppies. If you didn't get the Superdrive, you should
take your Mac right back to the store and get your money back.
That's assuming your time machine is still in working order.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your system files are too old to fully support the
Superdrive's capabilities. There's one other trick you might try,
though. Assuming you really are using high-density, 1.44MB disks on
the SE, you can get software that will let your PC read them. Just
go to some shareware site like www.hotfiles.com and search for
``Mac disk.''
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there any way I can have moving icons on my
desktop?
</P>
<P>
   _ Poetry in Motion
</P>
<P>
   DEAR POETRY: Yes. Drink heavily before using your computer.
You'd be surprised how much those little icons can move around.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I want to put my old PC up for sale. Microsoft
Word 97 shows my name as the licensee in the opening window. How
can I delete or change that? Also, is my name somewhere in Windows
95, and can I delete it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ANON: The Microsoft Office products are tricky. When first
installed, they stash your name deep in the Windows Registry in
hexadecimal code, the language of geeks. Even if you find the right
Registry key, you have to figure out how to spell the name in hex,
plus leave a null character after each letter. More trouble than
it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you uninstall the program, the Registry key doesn't
always get deleted, and your name still winds up on the program
after reinstalling. Try this: After uninstalling, run Regedit, the
Registry editor. Look for a folder called ``Office,'' which is
probably in
HKEY(underscore)CURRENT(underscore)USER/Software/Microsoft, and
delete it. Now reinstall Word with the new name.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to strip your name from Win95. While in Regedit, do
a search (Control-F) for your name, then edit any key where it
shows up.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am greatly relieved to finally discover
through your sleuthing and insightful reporting that the first 23

MAKE MORE WELLS TO DRAIN DRIVEWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September   10, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We have the mother of all driveways, 8,000 square feet, with
a well 7 feet deep and 3 feet in diameter, in the middle. When it
rains, the well fills up and water covers the lot. Is there any way
to make the water drain away?
</P>
<P>
   ALICE LEUNG, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I suggest you contact the driveway builder to see if he could
add more wells, or make the single well drain better. The single
well is not big enough to accommodate all the water, and the water
table may be too high for it to be effective in the first place.
Ask the public works department if there's a sewer to link into.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I tried your trick of injecting talcum powder between the
boards of my floor where I have squeaks. I also tried driving
tapered shingles between the floorboards and joists below; it
helped some but not completely. My fiberglass tub is still
squeaking when I stand or sit in it. Is there anything else I can
do? Could I put Great Stuff in the cavity under the tub?
</P>
<P>
   IRMINE FARMERIE, Shrewsbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Aha! And all this time we thought it was the floor that
squeaked. The tub is squeaking because its bottom is hollow, and
the fiberglass bottom is not strong enough to keep from flexing
under the weight of a bather or showerer. More modern fiberglass
tubs have a honeycombed bottom to prevent this.
</P>
<P>
   I gave the opinion that pumping Great Stuff, the expanding
urethane foam, into the cavity is not practicable, but thinking
twice about it, it might work, because in the cavity, the Great
Stuff is dense enough to prevent flexing. Drill holes in the floor
below and insert the Great Stuff through those holes. You will need
a good amount. You have to be very careful that you don't overfill
the cavity because the stuff doubles its volume as it sets, or at
least increases a lot. I have seen it distort window frames.
Overfilled, it could distort the fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   The same flexing happened to the handyman with his over-sized
fiberglass shower stall floor, and he took the precaution of
inserting wood supports under the stall floor before it was
installed. The supports must have shifted, or shrunk enough when
they dried out to allow the flexing to occur. He lives with it, and
considers the squeak an accompaniment to his shower tenor.
</P>
<P>
   How about inserting wood supports in the cavity from below?
That's unlikely because the floor (probably a double floor) would
have to be cut to receive the supports, which would be inserted
blindly. So if the Great Stuff doesn't work, the only recourse is a
new tub.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I thought I had a good roof when a second layer of asphalt
shingles was installed. Now the shingles show rust stains around
the metal chimney. The roofer said it was the chimney, and put in
new flashing. The shingles showed rust again around the pipe. What
can I do? There is a cap on top of the metal chimney.
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATED, Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It certainly is frustrating, especially since there may be
more than one cause. But don't be too quick to blame the roofer.
First, make sure the metal chimney is stainless steel or aluminum,
not galvanized, which could rust and cause the stains on the roof.
I can't imagine the chimney being anything but stainless or
aluminum, and insulated, to boot. An ordinary galvanized chimney
would rust out in months. If it is galvanized, I suggest installing
a stainless steel one from below the roofline to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the flashing is aluminum or copper. Lead flashing is
good, but it can rust.
</P>
<P>
   A final cause might be the chimney cap. If you burn oil or gas,
you are creating a lot of water vapor that goes up the chimney,
hits the cool cap, and condenses into water, which runs down the
chimney and stains the shingles. A different kind of cap might
reduce this condensation; a simple wire mesh secured to the top of
the chimney to keep out vermin and debris might be enough.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Overgrown plants shaded my house and the bottom of the
vertical T-1-11 plywood panel siding is rotting away. How can I fix
that? Can I patch it? The panels are quite high, with a sort of
trim at the top, separating them from the siding above.
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA JOHNSON, North Easton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, cut back the plants so the siding can get some air to
dry out. Take off each 4-by-8-foot panel and replace it with a new
one. If you try cutting off a couple of feet where it is rotted,
and put in short pieces, you will get horizontal joints where the
old meets the new. This would look funny and also be difficult to
prevent water from getting behind them. So, replace the entire
panel, where it will end at the top in a natural position. This
will not be much more expensive than if you tried patching with
short panels.

DAYTIME'S FOR DROWSING, SO BRING ON THE NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By LESLIE LAND    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In September, the sunlit garden blazes with strong colors: Dark
red dahlias, deep plum-colored gladioli, brilliant yellow
rudbeckias towering over orange canna flowers. But the real star of
autumn doesn't start shining until dusk, when the nicotianas pick
up their drooping heads, open their white throats and pour perfume
into the darkening air.
</P>
<P>
   Nicotiana alata, also known as N. affinis, gives no hint of
splendor during the day. The plants are rangy and tall, the
half-closed flowers a washed-out chartreuse, lightly veined in pale
maroon. Stems and leaves are covered with small, sticky hairs,
guaranteeing that by summer's end the plant will look as if it
needs dusting. (It does, but you can't: Nothing but a real downpour
really cleans it off.)
</P>
<P>
   When night falls, however, the flowers glow. Leaves and stems
fade into darkness. You know why N. alata used to be called jasmine
tobacco, and all its faults fall away.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the virtues list is a long one, including far more than
scent.
</P>
<P>
   Those hairs keep predators away, and as long as the plants
aren't overfed, they seldom become diseased. They thrive in full
sun or light shade, tolerate both drought and sog, and grow in
almost any soil but tightly packed clay.
</P>
<P>
   They are powerhouse flower-producers, too. Keep them deadheaded,
cut them back when they get leggy and they will keep producing
until killed by hard frost.
</P>
<P>
   Each flower makes buckets of seeds, which self-sow readily. As
long as you remember not to deadhead everything, one planting will
provide a lifetime supply of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny, gray-green seedlings don't appear until well after the
weather has warmed, but once they do show up, they're patient. You
can move them to new spots whenever you get around to it, even when
they are quite large, a trait that comes in handy as earlier
annuals fade away.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, for instance, the 30-foot swath of shirley poppies
that borders our central path gives up the ghost in late July. No
problem. I just shop around where I haven't weeded and before long
have a 30-foot swath of undernourished nicotianas. (Life is tough
under a squash plant.) With sunlight and a dose of fertilizer,
fill-out is swift. Two or three weeks later, we have a full sweep
of night fragrance that lasts well into fall.
</P>
<P>
   Nicotiana alata is a tender perennial, usually sold as an annual
because it's killed by strong frost. Gardeners in Zones 8 and
warmer can keep it going simply by cutting it back. (Cover with a
dry mulch if your climate is borderline.)
</P>
<P>
   You can also dig it up and put it in a pot. It will continue to
flower in a sunny window until Thanksgiving or so. Cut it back when
it quits and let it rest through the winter (no fertilizer). Feed
it in spring and it will start blossoming again.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to alata, there are about 70 other species of
nicotiana. Most are more or less scentless, but the statuesque
N.sylvestris is a happy exception. Though far larger than alata, it
has a more delicate scent, less heavily tropical, with shadings of
rose and lilac.
</P>
<P>
   Given room to grow, N. sylvestris makes a yard-wide rosette of
enormous leaves while sending up six-foot blooming stems, and its
starry clusters of narrow flowers erupt from their stalks like
fireworks. On the downside, the lower leaves start to look ratty
well before blooming ends. Clearly a case for Dr. Alata: Transplant
a few into sylvestris' skirts and the new growth will hide bare
spots while giving another layer to the fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   N. sylvestris is sometimes marketed as Only the Lonely, a
reminder that the whole group has severe nomenclature problems.
Other old-fashioned flowers have poetic common names: Cupid's dart
for Catanache, love-in-a-mist for Nigella, dame's violet for
Hesperis. But nicotianas can't seem to do any better than flowering
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's some justice involved. The flowering types do
contain nicotine, and Nicotiana glauca, or tree tobacco, a
perennial type with smooth, blue-green leaves and scentless but
charming small yellow flowers, is so toxic that eating even a
little will kill you.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't keep me from cherishing my N. glauca plant, which
has been going back and forth between basement and garden for eight
years. I just dig it up in the fall, whack it back so it will fit
under the beams and put the roots in a plastic bag. The following
spring, outside it goes. By fall it will be a 10-foot tree
festooned with narrow yellow bells.
</P>
<P>
   The nicotianas' rightful colors are yellow, white and, in N.
langsdorffii and N. Lime Green, a lovely though not particularly
limey green. To get reds and pinks you must plant one of the modern
hybrids, ideally either Daylight Sensation or Heaven Scent. Though
their colors are somewhat muddy, they still have strong fragrance
and blend well with other plants. That's more than can be said for
the Domino group, and much more than can be said for the ubiquitous
Nicki series.
</P>
<P>
   Squat, sticky, dull-colored, open all day, the utterly scentless
Nickis threw out the baby and kept the bath water, but because they
bloom while still very small, they are the only nicotiana plants
sold in most garden centers. If they're the only nicotianas you
know, a world of wonders awaits.

INDONESIAN LEADER APOLOGIZES FOR U.N. DEATHS IN WEST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Two days after three U.N. refugee workers were
murdered in their office in West Timor, Indonesia's president
Abdurrahman Wahid on Friday formally conveyed his nation's ``very
deep sorrow'' for their ``horrific death'' and promised to
prosecute the killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in disbelief and outraged that such unspeakable crimes
were committed against the good people of the UNHCR,'' Wahid said
in a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, using the acronym for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ``The people of Indonesia
mourn with the families of those who were brutally murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We condemn the perpetrators of this criminal act, who appear
to be disguising themselves as pro-integrationist East Timorese, ``
Wahid said, ``and we vow to bring them to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Friday, in a news conference on information
technology sponsored by the Economic and Social Council, Wahid
responded to questions about the killings. He suggested that
``criminals'' in one of the self-styled militia groups opposed to
East Timor's independence from Indonesia were responsible for the
deaths of Carlos Caceres, a 33-year-old American from Puerto Rico;
Samson Aregehegn, 44, an Ethiopian, and Pero Simundsa, 29, a Croat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many criminals join the integrationist forces, and we have to
look into that,'' Wahid said, referring to the self-styled militia
gangs that violently oppose independence for East Timor on the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian president insisted that calm had been restored in
Atambua, the town where rioters with firearms and machetes
ransacked an office run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
clubbing and hacking the three workers to death and slashing at
others as they escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that now everything is, in the military parlance,
under control,'' Wahid said. ``I think now the situation is very
good there. That is according to the full report I got this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   His assurance came as news agencies circulated reports of a
fresh killing by militiamen of 11 to 20 Timorese, including elderly
people and children, at Betun, a town about 40 miles from Atambua,
on Wednesday night and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid said that two military battalions had been sent to Atambua
and that Indonesian authorities had detained 19 people there in
connection with the ransacking of the U.N. office.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, he said, had been detained in connection with the
killing of a militia leader, Olivio Mendonca, also known as Moruk.
Wahid said initially that grief at the discovery of Mendonca's
decapitated corpse on Tuesday prompted supporters to attack the
office, though there was no apparent connection between his death
and the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee workers were killed on Indonesian soil while
Wahid was attending a summit meeting of world leaders here. When
his turn came on Friday to address the meeting, Wahid barely
referred to the incident beyond noting the minute of silence that
Annan arranged on Wednesday to honor the three dead workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, which was briefed on the killings on
Wednesday, scheduled consultations on the incident for later Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in Atambua, which followed other incidents of
intimidation and harassment by the criminal gangs, has forced the
United Nations to pull its staff members out of West Timor. They
had been helping to care for and repatriate refugees who a year ago
fled similar attacks in East Timor, after its residents voted for
independence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 100,000 refugees remain in camps in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The last of more than 400 employees of the United Nations and
other aid organizations in West Timor left on Friday, with no
immediate plans for their return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more a question of if rather than when,'' said Ron
Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
``We have been asking for assurances and guarantees for the overall
security of the humanitarian staff who have been trying to work
with the refugees for the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond said in a telephone interview from Geneva on Friday that
the Indonesian authorities had been asked repeatedly to separate
``these militia thugs'' from the population of the refugee camps.
Many refugees wanted to go home to East Timor, he said, but had
been terrorized for months, despite Indonesian assurance that
security would be provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far as we're concerned, the time for words has passed, and
we want to see some action on the ground,'' Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in Atambua took place on Wednesday when 30 to 50
armed men split off from a funeral procession for the slain militia
leader and stormed the refugee office.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. workers, concerned about the potentially incendiary
funeral, had contacted the Indonesian police and army officers at a
military base several hundred yards from the compound to ask for
protection beforehand. Indonesian authorities said the mourners
were not dangerous, there was no problem and the refugee workers
should remain where they were, Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously that was deadly wrong,'' he said.

   TANGIER ISLAND, Va. _ On pleasant evenings, teenaged islanders
congregate on the steps of the weathered post office and converse
in a lilting parlance that traces to their Elizabethan forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Ofttimes the talk is of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to do'' on the mainland, explains Sandy Dise, 15,
a 10th grader whose roots run generations deep in the scant island
soil. ``And you don't have to take a boat when you want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing the young people,'' laments Mayor Dewey Crockett,
who is also assistant principal of the school, music director and
organist at Swain Memorial United Methodist Church, and the
undertaker. ``With television and VCRs and the Internet, we're not
as isolated as we once were.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the remote island has changed more in recent decades
than it did during several centuries following its discovery in
1608 by Capt. John Smith, the leader of Jamestown.
</P>
<P>
   Homes that didn't have phones until 1966 now have cable TV and
computers. As its watermen suffer dwindling crab catches and
tightening environmental regulation, the Tangier economy is turning
toward tourism. But opportunity is still limited. Since 1950, the
population has fallen by more than half to about 650.

<P>
   A precious culture is endangered, many islanders fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other place like this,'' allows 94-year-old Ruth
Wallace Clark as she drives her golf cart down King Street. Her
voice confirms the claim. Centuries of isolation have left a
linguistic cadence and some pronunciations that are closer to
Shakespearean English than to a Virginia drawl. ``Tide,'' for
example, sounds more like ``toyed'' hereabouts. The beach on the
northern end of the island is located ``up'ards''.
</P>
<P>
   Tangier sits in the Chesapeake Bay, about 18 miles from the
western banks of Virginia and about 12 miles from Maryland's
eastern shore. The island is about five miles long and less than
two miles wide. Only a fourth of the 850 acres qualify as dry land.
Its 250 or so houses are squeezed onto three ridges separated by
marshes and tidal canals called ``guts'' and connected by several
hump-backed bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The streets are not much wider than sidewalks and most travel is
by bicycle, electric golf cart, motor scooter or on foot. There are
a few compact pick-up trucks for hauling stuff. As the dead and
living vie for scarce space, tiny lawns are filling up with
gravestones. The family names in the epitaphs are largely the same
as those in the current phone directory: Crockett, Pruitt, Parks,
Dise, Thomas, Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The first documented settlers were Joseph Crockett, his sons,
and their wives and children. They came in 1778 to farm and to herd
sheep and cattle. The founding families were fruitful, though, and
there were few acres to cultivate. So islanders soon turned to the
bounty of the bay _ fish, oysters and crabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the waters have long provided sustenance, Methodism has
been the island's spiritual rock since Joshua Thomas converted
during a trip to the mainland in 1805. The husband of one of Joseph
Crockett's granddaughters, Thomas returned with enough fire and
brimstone to ignite a religious movement that still guides
practically every aspect of island life.
</P>
<P>
   No alcoholic beverages or lottery tickets are sold legally on
Tangier. In 1998, the town council rejected Hollywood offers to
film ``Message in a Bottle'' on the island. The movie starred Paul
Newman, Kevin Costner and Robin Penn Wright but the council read
the script and rejected it because it featured scenes of sex and
beer drinking.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, worship begins with a frank and open ``Class
Meeting'' in which the congregation shares personal and communal
joys and concerns. Led by lay members, the tradition was begun by a
denominational pioneer, John Wesley, but has long since been
dropped by most Methodist churches. This hour-long session is
followed by Sunday School, and by morning and evening services.
There is another sermon and more hymns on Wednesday nights.
Islanders wear T-shirts commemorating past revival meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strong family values, but this is not utopia,''
cautions Jean Crockett, the wife of the mayor, as well as one of
the island's two nurses and an upper-grades English teacher. There
are some illegal drugs, she said, and a couple of bootleggers who
sell booze and beer.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's a good place for kids to grow up,'' said Edward
Landon, the island policeman, basketball coach and church youth
director.

   ``Crabs are scarce. That's for sure. But it's not the watermen's
doing,'' declares Kim Parks. ``And we've been accused of raping the
bay. That's plain and simple not the truth. We're just out to make
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father and his father's father and his grandfather's
father and now like his son, Parks is a Tangier waterman. He is up
at 3 a.m. and out on the bay setting crab pots hours before dawn.
Evenings find him at the shedding tanks in his crab shanty, which
sits on pilings near the end of his dock. The island economy relies
heavily on soft-shelled blue crabs _ delicacies that can fetch $2
apiece, several times the price of the hard-shelled crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   As they mature, crabs shed their shells but quickly harden new
ones. Crabs that are about to molt are called peelers _ pronounced
``pailers'' on Tangier. Watermen catch peelers and keep them in
tanks until they reach their soft-shelled stage. Then they are iced
down and shipped live. Except on the Sabbath, the tasks are
continuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a waterman has always meant long hours, hard work and
uncertain results,'' said the 44-year-old Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a thriving Chesapeake oyster industry was destroyed
by shoreline run-off and other pollutants . Now environmental
officials in Virginia and Maryland are concerned about a declining
crab population. Strict catch limits are enforced and a huge
no-crabbing zone has been established in a part of the bay near
Tangier. There is a freeze on issuing crabbing licences.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, increases in imported crab meat from Asia keep
prices down for the watermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 95 percent of our living comes from the water,'' said
Mayor Crockett. So the island economy is being squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, wives and daughters of watermen are cultivating
tourism. From April through October, two cruise ships dock daily.
The ``Chesapeake Breeze'' makes a one and a half hour trip from
Buzzards Point, near Reedville, Va. The ``Steven Thomas'' takes 45
minutes to reach the island from Crisfield, Md. About 25,000 people
visited last year _ mostly on day trips.
</P>
<P>
   Local folk have opened several seafood restaurants, a couple of
gift shops and three bed and breakfasts. After living near
Onancock, Va., Wallace and Shirley Pruitt returned to open
Shirley's Bayview Inn on West Ridge in a house built by his
maternal grandfather in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother spent her whole life here and I was born in this
house,'' said Pruitt, 60. When his siblings moved away, he couldn't
bear selling it. ``This house brought me back. I couldn't see
somebody outside the family living here.''
</P>
<P>
   Business has been so brisk that he has built guest cottages in
the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists wander the narrow streets, they see wooden boxes
nailed to power poles and containing recipes for crab cakes, corn
pudding and other island specialities. They can drop in a quarter
and take one home.
</P>
<P>
   When the cruise boats dock, the visitors are greeted by several
women who conduct 15-minute tours in golf carts. Charging $3 per
rider, Gina Crockett said she gets 20 or so customers per day in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of a waterman, Crockett, 35, said she loved growing up
on Tangier and visits the mainland only once or so a month. She
believes that the close-knit community, where every neighbor keeps
a caring and attentive eye on every child, is a blessed place to
rear her three offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But she doubts that her children will stay as she has.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably want to go to college,'' said Gina Crockett.

   In recent years, enrollment has ranged from about 100 to 110 at
the Combined School, which goes from kindergarten through 12th
grade. There were nine graduates in June, recalled Jean Crockett,
50, the English teacher. Three are going to college. Three joined
the navy. Two girls stayed to marry islanders. One boy ``went on
the water'' with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who leave for college won't return. ``This is not
an easy place to make a living,'' said Jean Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Landon, the 16-year-old son of the island policeman,
figures he will join the air force after graduating from the
Combined School in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Like other teens, he likes the island but admits to occasional
boredom. For fun, they swim off the docks and at the beach; go
fishing, crabbing and cruising in small skiffs with outboard
motors; play video games, watch TV and videotaped movies; and play
basketball. And they drive around and around the island on motor
scooters or in golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about it,'' said Justin Landon.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, island families keep a car on the mainland for
activities there. For better or worse, horizons are broadening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still sheltered growing up here,'' said Edward Landon.
``So it's a shock'' for the kids ``when they leave at 18 for the
mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows from experience. After military service and living off
the island for several years, he returned to raise his family.
There's not as much for teenagers to do here, he says, ``and that's
a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of small groceries on Main Ridge and an air
strip for small planes. A doctor and dentist make regular visits.
Except when the bay freezes over, a mail boat comes every day _
taking passengers at $12 apiece for a round-trip to the Maryland
shore. So a family trip to the mainland can be an expensive outing.
</P>
<P>
   There is a rhythm to island life. The crab boats leave in
pre-dawn darkness and return in late afternoon. The cruise boats
arrive in late morning and tourists abound for a few hours and then
the boats depart and the populace returns to normal levels and
activities. The mail boat docks at 1:15 p.m. and the post office
closes while the mail is sorted. At 2:30 p.m., much of the town is
gathered and chatting when the post office reopens and mail is
picked up. Then folks ride off on their bikes and golf carts.
Teenagers gather in the evenings and the policeman makes his
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Crimes are rare. Indeed, islanders can recall only four
homicides in over two centuries. The most recent was the result of
an altercation between two watermen in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But now the population temporarily swells daily with outsiders
bringing notions as well as needed dollars. A new visitor's center
is in the works, said Mayor Crockett. ``But we don't want to get
too commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, islanders would like to keep things the way they
always have been.

   TANGIER ISLAND, Va. _ On pleasant evenings, teenaged islanders
congregate on the steps of the weathered post office and converse
in a lilting parlance that traces to their Elizabethan forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Ofttimes the talk is of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to do'' on the mainland, explains Sandy Dise, 15,
a 10th grader whose roots run generations deep in the scant island
soil. ``And you don't have to take a boat when you want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing the young people,'' laments Mayor Dewey Crockett,
who is also assistant principal of the school, music director and
organist at Swain Memorial United Methodist Church, and the
undertaker. ``With television and VCRs and the Internet, we're not
as isolated as we once were.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the remote island has changed more in recent decades
than it did during several centuries following its discovery in
1608 by Capt. John Smith, the leader of Jamestown.
</P>
<P>
   Homes that didn't have phones until 1966 now have cable TV and
computers. As its watermen suffer dwindling crab catches and
tightening environmental regulation, the Tangier economy is turning
toward tourism. But opportunity is still limited. Since 1950, the
population has fallen by more than half to about 650.
</P>
<P>
   A precious culture is endangered, many islanders fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other place like this,'' allows 94-year-old Ruth

   NEW YORK _ Autumn Lucas was the picture of leisure, sitting in a
courtyard cafe under the spreading branches of a dogwood tree,
sipping a soy latte. Though it was midmorning on a Wednesday, when
most people are bustling about their offices, she was chatting with
a friend about Shu Uemura face cleanser and a play she had seen the
night before. The wind made the silk scarf on her head flutter
prettily behind her. Only the drumming of her manicured hand gave
away a strain of impatience, as she was expected in a few minutes
for a luncheon to plan a charity event.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, 29, is not a postdeb from Greenwich, nor even a junior
jet set wannabe. Her scarf is from the Salvation Army, and her
turquoise feather necklace, which made the saleswomen at Barneys
buzz, is from a Midtown vendor. Lucas, who makes her living as a
caterer, is a socialite of her own making. She is a member of the
Girdle Girls, a club of women living it up in ladylike high style
in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely as it may seem, the celebrated life of the Park Avenue
princess has infiltrated the bohemian enclave of Williamsburg. Its
ladies are even lunching, setting out to prove that free time,
beautiful clothes and the satisfaction of giving back to the
community are not the exclusive right of the Upper East Side. Of
course, adopting the swell life without the backing of big bucks or
family names takes creative finagling. So the Girdle Girls do their
own offbeat version of high society, Brooklyn style.
</P>
<P>
   The place to see and be seen if you are a bright young thing in
Williamsburg is the Girdle Factory. It isn't Swifty's or Chow's.
It's only a little shop for vintage clothes on Bedford Avenue, but
the parade of stylish women across its concrete floors would give
the buyers at Jeffrey pause. Artists, producers, editors, actors
and bartenders meander through during the day to try on Pucci
dresses and Tony &AMP; Tina eye liner. They wear parachute-fabric pants
from H&AMP;M, secondhand Agnes B., vintage Dior heels, maybe a Katayone
Adeli trench coat bought on a splurge. The store's manager, Lulu
Ramirez, founded the club last winter, inviting customers whose
style caught her eye to be members.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these women were coming into the store, and we'd have
these great rich conversations,'' explained Ramirez, who has smoky,
black-rimmed eyes and wears vintage dresses with knee-high black
boots. ``I wanted people to start meeting each other. The only
requirement is that you have an original style. It's cool girls
supporting cool girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, 37, called the first meeting in January, and more than
40 women showed up. Many drinks and a lot of bonding later, a
social club was born. Still invitation-only, the Girdle Girls meet
monthly at local bars, where they socialize and network, and the
local men tend to gawk. ``We have to keep our locations pretty
hush-hush,'' said Kettie North, 30, who owns the Girdle Factory,
``or else all the guys are already there when we come in, and it
ruins the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, following the example of their Silk Stocking District
sisters, they decided to give back to the community. A series of
bake sales ensued, with members dressed to the nines, vintage
aprons round their waists and trays of Rice Krispies treats in
their hands. They raised $260 for the Brooklyn Animal Resource
Coalition, which may not seem much compared with the take at the
Lenox Hill Hospital Winter Ball, but the Girdle Girls generally do
not have grandfathers who founded steel mills or cosmetics empires.
</P>
<P>
   Their meetings are part fashion support group, part postfeminist
rap session, with a dose of front-stoop gossip thrown in. At one
meeting held at Yabby, a former garage renovated into a slick
lounge on Bedford Avenue, local guys in tattoos and grungy T-shirts
lurked at the pool table as the Girdle Girls settled into the deep
red couches. Over chardonnay and single malt scotch, they discussed
topics like the feminist underpinnings of their all-women social
club and a spa in the unlikely environs of Greenpoint that gives
great facials and manicures.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about the Girdle Girls, I thought it would
be stupid,'' Ruthie Lee, 25, said at Yabby. She is an aspiring
fashion stylist with bee-stung red lips, wearing slinky black
mules. ``But then I broke up with my boyfriend, and all these girls
totally pulled me through it. I honestly don't know what I would
have done without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting nearby, Lisa Craegh, who immigrated to Williamsburg from
London about three years ago, balanced a cracker with Brie in one
hand and a glass of wine in the other. To a chorus of groans, she
announced that she had to leave the meeting early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her boyfriend is flying in tonight,'' a woman in a white
shirtdress offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time he was here, she lost 7 pounds in like a day,''
another woman whispered. ``They never left her apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Craegh, 28, leads the model Girdle Girl existence. She wakes up
around 11 a.m., goes to a yoga class or takes a swim, makes a pot
of tea at home, writes in her journal, paints or works at one of
her three jobs and visits friends in the evening. She wears Mario
Badescu skin care, blue tinted sun glasses and talks knowingly
about Fashion Week. Not bad, considering that Craegh is a painter
who earns about $20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other Girdle Girls, she has learned that the key to
self-pampering is resourcefulness. The skin products are from a
friend who works for Mario Badescu, and she is familiar with
Fashion Week because she helped an up-and-coming designer build a
set for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not have financial security right now, but my life is
based on a sense that I have what it takes to make it in the
future,'' Craegh said. ``The good life here is based on a sense of
self-worth, that we deserve it right now and don't have to wait for
it or be born into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Craegh acknowledges that this is not always the most pragmatic
or financially responsible approach to life. ``It's fairy talish,
it's magic,'' she said. ``It's a Cinderella thing. We believe in
our own inner princesses, or whatever.''

</P>
<P>
   The Girdle Girls are not the slackers of the early 1990s,
spending their days sipping beer and waxing ironic. They work, but
in jobs with flexible schedules that allow for lattes in the
afternoon and cosmopolitans at midnight. They want to be painters,
actresses, fashion designers and writers, but see no reason to
clump about in unfashionable clothes and bad haircuts along the
way. Artistic ideals are important, but so are good shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be an actor, and I want to make a good income doing
it,'' Lucas said. ``I want to travel and wear beautiful clothes and
not have to count my pennies. But the key is to have the confidence
it will come and not just wait until after it happens to live the
good life.''
</P>
<P>
   While these Williamsburg princesses may not yet share space with
the Lauder sisters in the party pages of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar,
around their own neighborhood the Girdle Girls are becoming social
stars. ``They're getting to be a known thing,'' said Lawrence
Elliott, 35, who owns the Read Cafe on Bedford Avenue, ``We see
crews of them going by the window. They're trouble, but in a good
way.''
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon at the Gray Parrot Cafe, Lee, wearing a skin-tight
denim skirt and red mohair cowl-neck tank, said: ``It's like being
a celebrity. I've heard us called the Williamsburg socialites.''
</P>
<P>
   But being a self-made socialite, often without means, does have
its awkward moments. Walking through the meatpacking district one
day last season, Lucas was mesmerized by a pair of azure suede Jil
Sander platform heels at Jeffrey. ``If they're less than $300,
they're mine,'' she promised herself. Though the shoes cost
$563.57, she left the store with an olive version of the shoe
charged to her credit card and a second pair, the azure ones, on
order. Panic struck on 14th Street.
</P>
<P>
   It's just this kind of dilemma that tests a Girdle Girl's
mettle, a particular brand of grace laced with chutzpah. Two days
later, Lucas headed back to the store with her best-looking guy
friend by her side for added confidence and requested a refund.
When the clerk skeptically asked why she was returning them, Lucas
waved her hand in the air. ``Oh, I'm just really over the whole
platform thing,'' she said.

 &HT;    LOCKHART LEAVING AS WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, the
pugnaciously partisan spokesman hired to defend President Clinton
during the height of his impeachment struggle, said Friday he would
leave the administration by Oct. 1 to seek a job in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was announced on Lockhart's successor, but he is
expected to be replaced by his deputy, Jake Siewert, who has been
with the Clinton administration since the president took office in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, who served as deputy to White House spokesman Michael
McCurry for two and a half years before taking over the spokesman's
slot in October 1998, has said quietly for months that he was ready
to leave to spend more time with his wife and their young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He said he plans to spend the fall giving speeches and looking
for a job that would build on his 20 years working in politics and
the media.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he had not discussed his departure with Clinton,
but has had conversations about it with White House chief of staff
John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, known for a barbed wit and an equally cutting partisan
edge, became Clinton's chief spokesman just before the House
impeachment of Clinton in December 1998 on charges stemming from
his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
and the president's subsequent acquittal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He dealt with aggressive press inquiries with a combative
combination of counterjabs, bristling sarcasm and a lightning
recall of domestic policy detail and specifics meant to cast
Clinton's political foes in a poor light.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert, 36, is a graduate of Yale University and the University
of California at Berkeley law school.
</P>
<P>
   He met Clinton in 1991, when the future president was governor
of Arkansas and Siewert was working for the Democratic Governors
Association in Washington. After Clinton took office, Siewert spent
nearly three years working in the White House communications
office.
</P>
<P>
   He directed press operations in New Hampshire for Clinton's
re-election campaign in 1996, and returned to the White House the
following year to run the press office for Clinton's National
Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
   He became deputy White House press secretary in January 1999.

   CAMPAIGN-ROUNDUP (Undated) _ The Republican Party rides to the

strengthen public education. On the campaign trail, Bush picks up
the endorsement of the National Fraternal Order of Police while
Gore touts a 10-year, $36 billion tax break for college tuition.

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, Ext. 218.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: ESTATE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday sustained the President's veto of a bill
to repeal the estate tax. Voting 274-157, the House failed to reach
the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto. Supporters of
the override said ending the tax on inherited properties would
reduce administrative costs for businesses and allow more Americans
to pass their estates to their children. Opponents said repealing
the tax would benefit only the wealthy and would prevent spending
down the debt and strengthening Social Security. A ``yes'' vote
supports the tax repeal.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CHILDREN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 405-18, a bill to provide more
child support to families leaving welfare. Supporters said the bill
would simplify child support payments and give mothers leaving
welfare all the child support collected for them, instead of
returning half to the state. Some opponents said the bill would
place state functions under federal control. Others objected to
provisions that could allow funding social service programs run by
religious institutions, saying the bill would sanction
discriminatory hiring practices. A ``yes'' supports the child
support bill.

BOB WRIGHT ON GETTING HIS $705 MILLION WORTH FROM THE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 10)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Wright, the president of NBC, is wrapping up a few
last-minute details stateside this week before he heads off with
about 800 of NBC's biggest advertising clients for Sydney,
Australia _ and his network's biggest production of 2000, the
Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   With agreements to broadcast the games in the U.S. for every
Olympiad through 2008 _ a total of five _ NBC has become the
network of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he will be spending a chunk of his time in Sydney
Harbor, aboard the same ocean liner the network took to Barcelona
in 1992 to wine and dine the biggest commercial spenders.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he is increasingly confident that the 2000 games,
even at a fee of $705 million for the American television rights,
will prove to be an unqualified success, at least in terms of
programming if not quite in profits. Following are excepts from a
telephone conversation on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did the advertising industry respond for this Olympics,
in light of the bribery scandals at the International Olympic
Committee?
</P>
<P>
   A. That was certainly a concern to us, but it does not seem to
have affected any business issues. The IOC handled it as best they
could. They made a conscientious effort to clean things up and get
the bad guys out. We hit our target in advertising sales of $900
million. This was a situation, when we went into those Olympic
deals, where we hoped to enhance NBC's reputation and not lose too
much money. We hit very good economic circumstances, which we were
counting on. So this is not a money-losing situation for us this
year. But it's not going to be much of a profit center.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will this year's coverage differ much from previous Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   A. The biggest programming difference is 279 hours of Olympic
programming on our cable networks CNBC and MSNBC. There will be a
total of 70 hours on the network. The cable exposure presents
opportunities for other sports, especially for a lot of team sports
that have never been seen, like soccer and softball. We're also
going to have a full program of boxing on CNBC, starting every
night at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You were able to use the Olympic coverage on cable in
negotiations to extend your agreements with cable operators for
your cable channels. How significant are these new deals?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have been very interested in extending our carriage
agreements with cable operators and the Olympics were certainly an
important part of that. We've used everything to gain the
extensions, including retransmission consent agreements and some
opportunities for improvements on the digital side when we reach
that stage. Many cable operators were interested in extending
through the end of our Olympic commitments in 2008 and some of them
even went beyond that to 2012. It means that CNBC and MSNBC are
guaranteed carriage in the U.S. to a point as far off as 2012.
That's enormously significant for us.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time we get to the Salt Lake City games in 2002, the
distribution for MSNBC will expand from 62 million homes to about
70 million, another very significant advance. The biggest
television stations we own have always taken great advantage of
Olympics years. Between the Olympics and the political advertising
this year, it will be the biggest financial year ever for the
stations we own.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have committed almost $3 billion more for the rights to
the games in 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. Given that, how crucial is
it that you perform well in terms of ratings from Sydney?
</P>
<P>
   A. Our performance in Sydney is very crucial. If some tragedy
were to strike and we put up terrible numbers it would certainly
impact up negatively. But having said that, the reality is that
Salt Lake City, as a domestic Olympics, stands on its own, has a
cachet all its own. The impact of whatever happens in Sydney will
be felt on Athens in 2004. But I'm confident we're going to do very
well.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Much has been made of how big events, like ``Survivor'' on
CBS, have helped bring viewers back to the networks. Does having
the guarantee of an Olympics every two years provide NBC with a
built-in advantage?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's important that we are able to say that we are the
Olympic network, and we can keep on displaying those rings as part
of our identity. Those rings have great recognition. That was a
really important factor in helping us decide to take on this
economic obligation. There is a debate about how valuable events
like this are as promotional vehicles for future programming. It is
hard to assess their promotional value, especially in the fall when
the baseball playoffs will cause a lot of disruption of schedules.
But the ability to have the most-watched programming to display
your new shows is clearly a benefit. And we're already setting up
for Salt Lake City. Those games start only 13 months after we leave
Sydney.

 &HT;    Stobart on the other side
 &HT;    By Doug Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Chuck Stobart knows that most college football
coaches travel more than a circus act. But he was certain the
vagabond life was over when he joined Arizona's staff 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to Arizona to retire,'' he said. ``We
re-did a house and six months later we moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Stobart followed head coach Larry Smith to Southern Cal, then
went to Memphis to be a head coach himself. He hooked on at Ohio
State in 1994 and was promoted to offensive coordinator this
season.
</P>
<P>
   His shining moment with the Wildcats came against current boss
John Cooper, Arizona State's coach then. Arizona pulled the upset,
but Cooper's team already had clinched the PAC-10 and had the last
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Pasadena,'' he said, ``and they went to El Paso or
someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Stobart is back in Arizona, but he will be on the other sideline
with the 18th-ranked Buckeyes tonight.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to contend with the Desert Swarm, the decade-old
nickname for the Wildcats' roving defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That name is very apropos,'' Stobart said. ``They bring people
from all over the place, and it looks like a storm coming across
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a defense like that, two things can happen _ the offense
can have bad plays, but you also give up big plays. You have to
have patience on offense and understand you might not block all
their people sometimes. What you don't want is to have a play where
you give the ball over to the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a job for a poised, veteran quarterback. And Stobart
is convinced the Buckeyes have one in Steve Bellisari, who had an
unspectacular but relatively mistake-free performance in the
opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than two quick passes (that were misfires), which can
happen to anybody, I thought he was very good,'' Stobart said. ``He
had no interceptions _ he wasn't even close to having one. We had
the one bad center-snap exchange, but other things he handled very,
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes and Wildcats have been on eerily similar paths.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State went 11-1 in '98, Arizona 12-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State went 6-6 in '99, Arizona 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State finished with three straight losses last season, same
as Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Each is eager to bounce back and has its defense to thank for
season-opening wins. The Buckeyes foiled Fresno State with four
defensive touchdowns, while the Wildcats scored one in a 17-3 win
at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Tomey's team has one of the country's better
quarterbacks in senior Ortege Jenkins, but he went a mere 3-of-15
passing for 11 yards against the Utes, who missed three field goals
inside 35 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just had a bad night,'' OSU defensive coordinator Jon
Tenuta said. ``He just wasn't on. He's been around since '97. He's
a good football player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got great skill,'' middle linebacker Matt Wilhelm
said. ``Their receivers can jump and catch the ball, and Ortege has
a gun. It's going to be rough. It will be like going against a Big
Ten team.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ortege &AMP; Co. shouldn't expect help from its defense this
week, according to the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Desert Swarm?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of it, but I'm not impressed,'' center LeCharles
Bentley said. ``We'll show 'em what the Buckeyes can do.''

 &HT;    Do-over time for A&AMP;M veterans
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Mark Farris expects to see some roles
reversed tonight.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas A&AMP;M plays host to Wyoming, the Aggies quarterback
doesn't anticipate seeing what he saw a week ago from certain
veteran players. Mostly, it's precisely because they are veterans.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's 24-10 loss last Saturday at Notre Dame was noteworthy
because several inexperienced Aggies played with poise and
confidence, while several elder statesmen stumbled and bumbled. But
Farris, who falls into the former category along with tailback
Richard Whitaker and wide receiver Robert Ferguson, said he
believes those in the latter category _ namely receiver Chris
Taylor, cornerback Jay Brooks and tight end RoDerrick Broughton _
should recuperate quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the same things would have happened to young guys that
happened to them, it might be hard for the young guys to bounce
back,'' Farris said. ``But these are older guys who know what it
takes to bounce back. They know how to put it behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   They might know, but that doesn't make it easy.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a steady senior and a team leader, was still in shock
this week after two major gaffes against the Irish. First, he
allowed a third-quarter punt to sail over his head, and the ball
rolled dead at the Aggies' 4-yard line. Then three plays later he
dropped a gorgeous pass from Farris that would have either gone for
a 92-yard touchdown to give A&AMP;M a 17-7 lead, or gotten the Ags out
of a deep hole.
</P>
<P>
   It was the drop Taylor found difficult to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to come back from it in a positive way,'' he said,
``but it's hard to deal with something of that magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has made some huge plays during his Aggies career. He
caught a school-record 96-yard pass against Tulsa last year and
snared an 81-yarder in a huge victory over Nebraska as a sophomore
in 1998. But that was of little solace in the aftermath of the
dropped pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I remember the big catches,'' Taylor said. ``But the
drop is more vivid in my mind. That play could have been one to add
to that list (of big catches).''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't escape the notice of any Aggie that in Sunday night's
NFL game between Tennessee and Buffalo, Titans Eddie George and
Frank Wycheck dropped passes in the open. But A&AMP;M receivers coach
Larry Kirksey said that didn't ease the pain for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He beat himself up so much that I didn't have to do it to
him,'' Kirksey said. ``He's human. Things are going to happen. But
I expect him to make that play and I expect him to make it the next
time the opportunity presents itself. He'll come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on offense, Broughton made a critical mistake. The senior
was penalized for moving early on a fourth-and-goal play inches
from the end zone on the opening drive of the second half. The
penalty forced A&AMP;M to settle for a field goal for a 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ball, Brooks is a full-time starter for
the first time. But the junior has played extensively and has a
history of making big plays _ in his career he's returned a fumble,
interception and blocked punt for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   At Notre Dame, however, he was victimized on both Irish
touchdown passes, which came in one-on-one coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my team down,'' Brooks said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   But free safety Michael Jameson said he expects his childhood
friend and former teammate at Killeen Ellison High to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough-minded guy,'' said Jameson, unlikely to play
tonight because of sprains to both ankles. ``You can't come back
and show a lack of confidence because that might rub off on the
younger guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay's hurt by what happened. People have been getting on him
and that doesn't make him feel good,'' Jameson added. ``But he's
got the short-term memory that you need to play defensive back.
You've got to put it behind you and make the next play.''
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected miscues by the veterans and the polished play of
the newcomers at Notre Dame are what have helped to turn R.C.
Slocum's a distinguished shade of gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistakes kill you as a coach,'' he said. ``They just drive
you nuts. But at least when older guys make them, they have an edge
in bouncing back quicker than the younger guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning, the Aggies hope, tonight.

<P>
   Sanjit Tamhane paved his road from India to Oregon with layers
of language.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Marathi he grew up speaking in Bombay, nor English in
and of itself. Those came before his fluency in ASP, C(plus)(plus),
Visual Basic, Java and HTML.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he is a software whiz in a world hungry for those
whose precisely ordered keystrokes push electrons through copper
and aluminum, squeezing big ideas past transistors smaller than
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   American industry lured him and thousands more to this country.
Stories like Tamhane's unfold each year as the high-tech economy
booms and firms search the globe for talent to feed their growth.
</P>
<P>
   But unprecedented demand for technically skilled labor is
bumping against questions of public policy. High-tech companies
must secure visas for foreign workers, but their numbers are
limited by law.
</P>
<P>
   Now, high-tech companies want to lift restrictions on the H-1B
visa program that already has brought a half-million people to this
country. The visas allow companies and institutions to hire skilled
foreign workers for as long as six years and can ultimately lead to
permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is pending in Washington, D.C., and the industry
hopes to get results before Congress adjourns Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is to get the bill passed,'' said Daven
Oswalt, a spokesman at the Semiconductor Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   An industry-backed measure that would nearly double the number
of H-1B visas available to people such as Tamhane is threatened by
election-year politics. Each party is blaming the other for delays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, high-tech employers say they can't thrive without a
larger immigrant pool. Computer engineers and others warn of
oversupply and worry about diluted salaries.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Tamhane makes more every month than he did in a year in India.
But coming to America is not solely following a dollar-strewn path;
it constitutes an intellectual challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``An engineer with two years' experience has to go to the
U.S.,'' said Tamhane, who lives in Corvallis, Ore. ``If he doesn't
go, it means there's something wrong with his skills. You're either
stuck or you're dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Being neither, Tamhane finds himself addicted to junk food, DVD
movies and negotiating Interstate 5 in his 1998 Toyota Avalon.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. history is full of cyclical lessons on the importation of
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Carnegie, who needed cheap steelworkers to combat unions
in the 1880s, called foreign immigration ``a golden stream which
flows into the country each year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has turned off the spigot every time the economy
ran cold and racial tensions turned hot. The Chinese Exclusion Act
was passed in 1882, and demands for a Japan Exclusion Act in the
early part of this century were dropped only after Japan agreed to
stop exporting male workers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress eliminated Asian immigration in 1924 except from the
Philippines, then a U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, when American farmers needed pickers in the job-rich
years after World War II, the Bracero Program was enacted. It
allowed 4.5 million Mexican laborers to legally pick U.S. crops
from 1942 to 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Now the high-tech industry, the newfound engine of the U.S.
economy, is before Congress arguing that foreign workers are the
oil that keeps that motor humming.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech won a big victory in Congress two years ago, achieving
a 77 percent increase in the number of H-1B visas processed each
year. But after peaking this year at 115,000, the number of visas
allowed is scheduled to decrease to 65,000 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has pinned its hopes to a bill that would raise the
cap to 200,000. Without some kind of legislative relief, industry
officials think the new year's allocation of visas likely will run
dry in January.
</P>
<P>
   This year's cap was reached in March, halfway through the
federal fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   While both parties are eager to help the industry, some
Republicans say the visa program limits opportunity for U.S.
citizens. Some Democrats, meanwhile, charge that imported labor,
even in the high-tech sector, depresses wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had to go into the free market and bid without the
advantage of H-1B, the price of high-tech workers would go up, and
I bet you six times more people would decide not to become gourmet
chefs, but they would learn to become chemists instead,'' said Rep.
Pete Stark, D-Calif. ``It's all supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies argue that they are unable to fill hundreds
of positions at a time because demand far exceeds supply.
</P>
<P>
   They sometimes point to a 1997 Commerce Department study
indicating that more than 1 million high-tech jobs would surface by
2005, but U.S. colleges and universities were producing only 25,000
graduates a year with degrees in computer-related fields.
</P>
<P>
   A General Accounting Office assessment of that study, however,
concluded that it was flawed by ``serious analytical and
methodological weaknesses that undermine the credibility of its
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO did not determine whether the high-tech shortage was
real.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman Matloff, a computer science professor at the
University of California at Davis, has concluded that the
programmer shortage is an industry fiction to depress wages by
continued hiring of cheap foreign help.
</P>
<P>
   His studies indicate that high-tech companies hire only 2
percent of the applicants they see.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations representing high-tech workers, such as the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, are urging
Congress to keep the visa cap where it stands until further study
establishes a need for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Koon, Intel's director of corporate affairs, said the
chip-maker, based in Santa Clara, Calif., in fiscal 1998-99
directly hired 455 employees, about 7 percent of all U.S. hires, on
H-1B visas.
</P>
<P>
   She said Intel views those workers as neither cheap nor
short-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to pay prevailing wage,'' she said. ``The people
we're looking at are people with all kinds of experience and
degrees where they can work almost anywhere.
</P>

   ``In some scenarios and clearly for some companies, they are

   Some companies, such as SEH America, a silicon wafer

we'd rather hire Americans if we can,'' said Julie Branford, an SEH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sanjit Tamhane paved his road from India to Oregon with layers
of language.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Marathi he grew up speaking in Bombay, nor English in
and of itself. Those came before his fluency in ASP, C(plus)(plus),
Visual Basic, Java and HTML.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he is a software whiz in a world hungry for those
whose precisely ordered keystrokes push electrons through copper
and aluminum, squeezing big ideas past transistors smaller than
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   American industry lured him and thousands more to this country.
Stories like Tamhane's unfold each year as the high-tech economy
booms and firms search the globe for talent to feed their growth.
</P>
<P>
   But unprecedented demand for technically skilled labor is
bumping against questions of public policy. High-tech companies
must secure visas for foreign workers, but their numbers are
limited by law.
</P>
<P>
   Now, high-tech companies want to lift restrictions on the H-1B
visa program that already has brought a half-million people to this
country. The visas allow companies and institutions to hire skilled
foreign workers for as long as six years and can ultimately lead to
permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is pending in Washington, D.C., and the industry
hopes to get results before Congress adjourns Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is to get the bill passed,'' said Daven
Oswalt, a spokesman at the Semiconductor Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   An industry-backed measure that would nearly double the number
of H-1B visas available to people such as Tamhane is threatened by
election-year politics. Each party is blaming the other for delays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, high-tech employers say they can't thrive without a
larger immigrant pool. Computer engineers and others warn of
oversupply and worry about diluted salaries.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Tamhane makes more every month than he did in a year in India.
But coming to America is not solely following a dollar-strewn path;
it constitutes an intellectual challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``An engineer with two years' experience has to go to the
U.S.,'' said Tamhane, who lives in Corvallis, Ore. ``If he doesn't
go, it means there's something wrong with his skills. You're either
stuck or you're dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Being neither, Tamhane finds himself addicted to junk food, DVD
movies and negotiating Interstate 5 in his 1998 Toyota Avalon.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. history is full of cyclical lessons on the importation of
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Carnegie, who needed cheap steelworkers to combat unions
in the 1880s, called foreign immigration ``a golden stream which
flows into the country each year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has turned off the spigot every time the economy
ran cold and racial tensions turned hot. The Chinese Exclusion Act
was passed in 1882, and demands for a Japan Exclusion Act in the
early part of this century were dropped only after Japan agreed to
stop exporting male workers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress eliminated Asian immigration in 1924 except from the
Philippines, then a U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, when American farmers needed pickers in the job-rich
years after World War II, the Bracero Program was enacted. It
allowed 4.5 million Mexican laborers to legally pick U.S. crops
from 1942 to 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Now the high-tech industry, the newfound engine of the U.S.
economy, is before Congress arguing that foreign workers are the
oil that keeps that motor humming.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech won a big victory in Congress two years ago, achieving
a 77 percent increase in the number of H-1B visas processed each
year. But after peaking this year at 115,000, the number of visas
allowed is scheduled to decrease to 65,000 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has pinned its hopes to a bill that would raise the
cap to 200,000. Without some kind of legislative relief, industry
officials think the new year's allocation of visas likely will run
dry in January.
</P>
<P>
   This year's cap was reached in March, halfway through the
federal fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   While both parties are eager to help the industry, some
Republicans say the visa program limits opportunity for U.S.
citizens. Some Democrats, meanwhile, charge that imported labor,
even in the high-tech sector, depresses wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had to go into the free market and bid without the
advantage of H-1B, the price of high-tech workers would go up, and
I bet you six times more people would decide not to become gourmet
chefs, but they would learn to become chemists instead,'' said Rep.
Pete Stark, D-Calif. ``It's all supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies argue that they are unable to fill hundreds
of positions at a time because demand far exceeds supply.
</P>
<P>
   They sometimes point to a 1997 Commerce Department study
indicating that more than 1 million high-tech jobs would surface by
2005, but U.S. colleges and universities were producing only 25,000
graduates a year with degrees in computer-related fields.
</P>
<P>
   A General Accounting Office assessment of that study, however,
concluded that it was flawed by ``serious analytical and
methodological weaknesses that undermine the credibility of its
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO did not determine whether the high-tech shortage was
real.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman Matloff, a computer science professor at the
University of California at Davis, has concluded that the
programmer shortage is an industry fiction to depress wages by
continued hiring of cheap foreign help.
</P>
<P>
   His studies indicate that high-tech companies hire only 2
percent of the applicants they see.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations representing high-tech workers, such as the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, are urging
Congress to keep the visa cap where it stands until further study
establishes a need for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Koon, Intel's director of corporate affairs, said the
chip-maker, based in Santa Clara, Calif., in fiscal 1998-99
directly hired 455 employees, about 7 percent of all U.S. hires, on
H-1B visas.
</P>
<P>
   She said Intel views those workers as neither cheap nor
short-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to pay prevailing wage,'' she said. ``The people
we're looking at are people with all kinds of experience and
degrees where they can work almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some scenarios and clearly for some companies, they are
temporary workers in a sense,'' she said. ``We intend when we hire
them that we'll eventually get them a green card.''
</P>
<P>
   For many workers that's the ultimate payoff of the H-1B visa,
which by itself is good for six years. Employers can petition the
government to grant permanent U.S. residency in place of the
temporary visa.

INDIAN AFFAIRS BUREAU DELIVERS APOLOGY TO NATIVE AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., N.M., Hawaii)   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bureau of Indian Affairs marked its 175th
anniversary Friday in a ceremony that blended sorrow, hope and a
remarkable apology from the bureau's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, this is no occasion for celebration,'' said Kevin
Gover, the assistant Interior Department secretary who heads the
bureau. Instead, he said, this is a time ``for sorrowful truths to
be spoken, a time for contrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Gover recounted the bureau's evolution from a War Department
office that dealt with what white Americans saw as the ``Indian
problem'' to an agency of the Department of the Interior entrusted
with promoting tribal autonomy and bettering the lives of American
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agency participated in the ethnic cleansing that befell
the Western tribes,'' he said. ``This agency set out to destroy all
things Indian. The legacy of these misdeeds haunts us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gover then offered a formal apology to American Indians on
behalf of the bureau. Even after its mission changed, he said, and
``despite the efforts of many good people with good hearts,'' the
agency made little headway for decades against alcoholism, drug
abuse, suicide and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us begin by expressing our profound sorrow for what the
agency has done in the past,'' Gover said. ``Our hearts break.''
</P>
<P>
   What made his apology all the more remarkable is that Gover
himself is a member of the Pawnee Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he stood Friday as a bridge between two societies. A
native of Lawton, Okla., he graduated from Princeton with a degree
in public and international affairs, then from the University of
New Mexico law school.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt spoke at the ceremony and
called the bureau ``a work in progress,'' an agency in transition
but one that now belongs to American Indians, who make up the great
majority of its 10,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``May you prosper, grow, advocate, get under people's skins,''
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who was praised by Gover as being
in the forefront of Indian-rights issues, said the Bureau of Indian
Affairs ``creates the potential for a brighter future.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lynn Cutler, a White House adviser on Indian issues,
delivered a congratulatory message from President Clinton, who paid
tribute to American Indians as ``our country's first people.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony reflected how Indian culture has endured and how it
has been assimilated. A number of tribal leaders were present, some
wearing traditional jewelry and headbands.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional music was piped into the auditorium in the
Department of Interior building, a vast structure in part of a
sprawling bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Gover himself is familiar with the corridors of Washington
power. From 1983 to 1986, he specialized in Indian and
environmental litigation for a Washington law firm. In 1986, he
formed his own firm in Albuquerque, N.M. Before becoming the bureau
director in 1997 he lobbied on behalf of the Tesuque Pueblo Tribe
to secure a gambling casino.
</P>
<P>
   But as he stood on stage Friday, his heart was clearly somewhere
else. His voice faltered as he spoke of ``the decimation of the
mighty bison herds, the use of the poison alcohol to destroy mind
and body, and the cowardly killing of women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sufferings inflicted on American Indians, he said, ``made
for tragedy on a scale so ghastly that it cannot be dismissed as
merely the inevitable consequence of the clash of competing ways of
life.''

 &HT;    Forget about global warming, it is global cooling that's changed
us all
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ You hear a great deal about global warming
these days. Some people say it threatens life on Earth, others say
it is nothing but a myth. Me, I don't know anything about that
either way.
</P>
<P>
   What I do know about is global cooling. Now there is something
that has really changed our lives over the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has warmed up a few degrees on the outside during that
time and, if so, that's a terrible thing. I know for sure, though,
that it has cooled down by 20 or 30 degrees on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   If anything has changed our lives more than air conditioning, I
don't know what it is. The term wasn't even invented when I was
born and now we cannot do without it.
</P>
<P>
   Most people my age remember not having it anywhere. We started
school around this time of year, which meant it was still blazing
hot for several weeks and we went until the beginning of June,
which gave us all of May during which to swelter.
</P>
<P>
   No air conditioning. No fans that I can remember. All we had
were open windows and the hope for a stiff breeze. What I remember
most about school in those days were the dozens of wasps that
buzzed along the ceiling and walls, just waiting for an
unsuspecting student.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, instead of learning multiplication, I was, like an
air traffic controller, dividing my time keeping track of all the
the wasps in the room. Forget plane geometry, I was plain scared.
Euclid never had to worry about this.
</P>
<P>
   The first air conditioner I remember at home was an oscillating
fan. I'm sure those fans were a remarkable invention but the most
remarkable feature about them is that they are blowing air
somewhere else almost all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   And I still recall the day my dad installed the evaporative
cooler in the living room of our house. These contraptions weighed
about two tons and then you put water in them so that the air that
blew into the house was cool. Except it almost never was that cool,
especially if the sun happened to be beating down on the cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Evaporative coolers, which should never be used in areas with
more than 15 percent humidity, had two other significant features:
They grew a great fungus and they smelled like four-day old fish.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing you could do about the fungus, but for the
smell we dumped a couple of gallons of Pine Sol a week into the
water tray. Everything smelled so strongly of pine in my house that
we really didn't have to take a bath for a week. It smelled like
Christmas in July.
</P>
<P>
   I was in high school before my family got its first window unit
that actually used Freon. My parents thought they were being smart
by installing it in their room, turned out they would always regret
it. Because from the instant the unit was installed, their bedroom
became the family room. They literally would have to drive us out
at night.
</P>
<P>
   And then a strange thing began to happen. After just a few weeks
of that wonderful air conditioning, it seemed to do nothing but get
hotter outside. Where once I could have worked or played outside
all day long, suddenly, the heat got to be too much for me.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior in high school I was lucky enough to get a class in
the newly renovated _ and air conditioned _ part of the building.
Going there just before noon made every class afterwards
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but it hadn't been that hot before, had it?
</P>
<P>
   Global warming may not be as big a danger as global spoiling.
We've all become so accustomed to being comfortable all the time
that we can't stand it when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Besides , the two things might be tied together anyway. I'm
thinking global warming comes from the exhaust from all those air
conditioners.

Spades, a Gucci belt and a Prada belt, and several pairs of Sisley
jeans. I have a lot of Clinique makeup, Bobbi Brown eyeliner, MAC
lip gloss and Angel perfume _ that's by Thierry Mugler.''
</P>
<P>
   Christina Shepp, 18, was reeling off her recent acquisitions
with the crisp precision of a schoolgirl reciting her catechism.
Purchased on the $600 a week she earned last year as a lifeguard on
Long Island, where she lives, those trophies throng her closet and
crowd her dressing table.
</P>
<P>
   Though she is lately inclined to save for college, Shepp still
dreams of buying a Prada nylon slicker. At $2,000, this might be,
she acknowledged with a sigh, a bit rich for her budget.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of her contemporaries across the country, Shepp is a
teen-ager besotted with fashion, and, not less, with fashion's most
opulent brands. Rarely content with a knockoff version, she and her
peers comb the malls and congregate on Madison Avenue, often with
their mothers in tow, intent on bagging the latest Gucci, Versace
or Helmut Lang, even if the object of their lust takes the form of
a token lip gloss or cosmetic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with unprecedented personal incomes and a precocious
knowledge of what women a decade older consider chic, the
upward-striving teen-ager is now more than ever the target of
luxury marketers who once focused strictly on adults. Chanel, Ralph
Lauren, Lancome and Versace are just a few of those making a play
for the teen-age market. So is Bobbi Brown, the makeup artist
behind an upscale department store line, whose recent volume of
makeup tips, ``Bobbi Brown Teen-age Beauty'' (HarperCollins), spent
six weeks recently on The New York Times list of best-selling
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astonished by these girls' level of sophistication,''
said Richard Beckman, publisher of the new Teen Vogue, recalling
focus groups convened when the magazine, a Vogue spinoff, was
planned. ``They have great taste and an enormous information
base,'' he added. ``They are so much more brand savvy than we ever
were at that age.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen Vogue, which is being mailed free to Vogue's 650,000
subscribers with the October issue and will be sold separately on
newsstands beginning next week, presents high school girls with
such timely and coveted grown-up looks as low-slung Katayone Adeli
pants and fur tippets tied around the neck, in the style of Miuccia
Prada's Milan catwalk show. The layouts are shot by top-of-the-line
photographers like Arthur Elgort and Herb Ritts. Designer apparel,
at $400 and up, is shown alongside less expensive look-alikes.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers in the first issue (a low-risk business venture for
Vogue's owner, Conde Nast, which will decide whether to make Teen
Vogue a stand-alone title depending on the response to it) include
prestige cosmetics brands such as Lancome and Chanel, along with
secondary lines of high-fashion designers _ Versus from Versace,
DKNY from Donna Karan and Ralph from Ralph Lauren. Clearly, those
luxury designers are cultivating the next wave of customers, many
of whom already indulge themselves with status handbags and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge lust for designer accessories among teen-age
girls,'' said Amy Astley, editor of Teen Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   More traditional girls' magazines are racing to exploit the new
generation's penchant for living large, a message imbibed
everywhere from music videos to style channels on television to
affluent parents. Seventeen magazine is mailing a 32-page
supplement with its October issue called On the Edge, which
highlights vanguard trends and merchandise rarely showcased in the
parent publication. Among them: A racy vinyl slicker and matching
skirt by D&AMP;G and hip-again Burberry plaids.
</P>
<P>
   YM magazine, whose coverage has conformed to the staples of
girls' magazines _ boys, hair, acne _ hired a new editor in chief,
Annemarie Iverson, formerly of Harper's Bazaar, to give a
sophisticated facelift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely planning an upscale position,'' said Laura
McEwan, YM's publisher. ``Beginning next year every page in the
magazine will reflect that in the photography, the writing and the
design.'' Of America's 30 million teen-age girls expected by 2010,
she said, ``you could assume that a third of that market would be
receptive to the messages of upscale marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion and beauty companies, like all marketers, know well that
the Census Bureau's expectation for the number of teen-age girls
will rise 5.4 million from 24.6 million in 1990 and will see its
most rapid growth over the next five years. It is a teen-age
generation with greater spending power than any before it. Lester
Rand, president of the Rand Youth Poll, reports that the average
income of girls 16 to 19 was $131 a week last year, up from $103 in
1997. Among those older teen-agers, 8 percent spent more than $200
a week on clothes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids today are so self-assured,'' said Jane Rinzler
Buckingham, who heads Youth Intelligence, a trend-spotting firm.
They also tend to make buying decisions on their own. ``It's no
longer a question of `Please, Mom, can I have this?' but `I really
want this and I'll earn the money to get it,''' she said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Fashion and cosmetics makers have grown increasingly inventive
in promoting products to the young. Ralph Lauren announced in press
material accompanying his first fragrance for teen-age girls,
Ralph, introduced this season, that he had been influenced by his
daughter, Dylan. The scent comes across as a sweet-saucy blend of
bubble gum and tea.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel invites teen-agers to create and name new nail lacquers,
and to enter the company's model-of-the-year contest, sponsored
with Seventeen magazine. Now in its fourth year, the contest draws
16,000 applicants. ``The Chanel strategy is truly an investment in
the future,'' said Jean Zimmerman, Chanel's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Teen Vogue, despite fashion layouts that seem scarcely different
from an adult magazine's, says it is targeting the youngest
teen-agers, 12 to 16. Its inspiration, said Anna Wintour, the
editor in chief of Vogue, was her own daughter, Bea, an eighth
grader at the Spence School.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge market, but having a daughter who's just
entered her teens brought it home to me in a very real way,''
Wintour said. ``Through her I see how interested girls are in
fashion, how they follow what the celebrities are wearing. These
things were a very huge wake-up call for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine might be in for a tough sell. According to
Rand, younger teen-age girls have less spending power than their
big sisters: Only $69 a week, about $19 of which they devote to
clothes. Wintour responded: ``That's pocket change. Their parents
are still obviously buying them clothes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the the magazine is trying to keep most items featured
editorially below $200, ``but we are trying to build an awareness
of upscale brands.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an axiom of fashion magazines that they are
``aspirational,'' encouraging readers to dream about products and a
life they cannot afford, but hope to one day. ``But they shouldn't
be so aspirational that they leave people out in the cold,'' warned
Irma Zandl, the president of the Zandl Group, a New York-based
youth-marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   Marina Albright, 17, a senior at Columbia Preparatory School on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, whose tastes long ago graduated from
Old Navy, would seem to be the ideal target of the new marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Prada Sport, Helmut Lang, Kenneth Cole and Katayone
Adeli,'' she said, rattling off the names like a fashion editor.
``Chanel sunglasses are nice, but the clothes are way too
sophisticated. What I really want this year this is a Prada bowling
bag. That bag is hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Such avid and guilt-free consumption comes in part as a reaction
to the piety of the early 1990s, when rampant spending was equated
with moral lassitude. And it is tacitly encouraged by affluent
parents, many of whom themselves are chasing fashion, never mind
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But high-end labels with stratospheric prices are by no means
everybody's grail. ``I'm concerned _ no, I'm really alarmed by the
way my daughters pursue style,'' said Cher Lewis, a Manhattan
mother of two teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was their age, there were only a couple of labels we
all had to have _ Pappagallo and Ladybug,'' Lewis, a fund-raiser
for nonprofit organizations, added. ``But my mother wouldn't think
of buying any of those things for us. They were just too
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomasin Shepp took pains to point out that her daughter,
Christina, buys her clothes mostly with her own earnings. ``My
daughter has three stacks of cashmere sweaters, each 12 inches
high,'' she said with a mix of pride and consternation. ``And
that's very modest compared with her friends.''

LARGE FRENCH UNION URGES END TO FUEL PROTESTS, BUT MANY IGNORE
CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A truckers' strike protesting the rising cost of fuel,
which had begun to cripple supplies around the country, seemed to
lose some of its momentum on Friday as the leader of France's
largest trucker's group urged its members to lift their blockades
at more than 90 of the country's major fuel depots.
</P>
<P>
   But many truckers _ perhaps encouraged by a poll that suggested
that more than 80 percent of the country supported them _ appeared
to defy their leader. And a smaller union said that its members
would continue the protest as well.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers want a 20 percent cut in diesel fuel taxes for
freight trucks and have been joined by workers from many other
sectors of the economy who have been squeezed by the spiraling cost
of fuel in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has presented Prime Minister Lionel Jospin with a
difficult political problem. On Wednesday he cut off negotiations
with the unions when his offer of a 15 percent cut in taxes was
rejected. Late Friday, he met with several of his Cabinet ministers
to discuss the next steps to take in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a booming economy, France has a huge budget surplus,
so Jospin may be able to reduce the high taxes on fuel. But
environmentalists who form part of the prime minister's ruling
coalition are fiercely opposed to any further concessions and have
already criticized the 15 percent cut he offered.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers began their protest in earnest on Monday as a
followup to a strike by fishermen, who had blocked the country's
ports last month to protest fuel costs and eventually won financial
concessions from the government. Soon after the truckers began
their blockades, they were joined by farmers, airline workers, bus
drivers, taxi drivers and even the owners of river barges and
sightseeing boats that cruise the Seine. They all found ways to
block traffic and disrupt train and air services in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   The country's largest farming union said on Friday that it, too,
would keep up the protests that have cause varying hardships
throughout the country and gas shortages at up to 80 percent of gas
stations.
</P>
<P>
   But some strikers were reported to be ending their protests,
especially in the northern regions of the country. And one
particular flash point, the Channel Tunnel in Calais, was clear of
protesters.

 &HT;    Neither candidate gets God's endorsement? Sorry, that's idolatry
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Enlisting God to hype a political candidate
is the worst kind of blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are good at it. Democrats are getting better. But
both parties are dabbling in idolatry.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidential candidate Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.,
often prays to God as part of his canned ``stump'' speech. His
prayer is appropriate at home or in synagogue but not while
publicly running for office.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, prayers appear to be addressed to an
audience other than God. And they seem designed more to impress the
electorate and win votes than be an act of worship.
</P>
<P>
   As an observant Orthodox Jew, Lieberman should rigorously avoid
even the appearance of that kind of blunder.
</P>
<P>
   His faith is, no doubt, genuine, but his public piety looks
suspiciously like he is using God to promote his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush does the same thing. Bush uses God as an
interchangeable campaign device to be bent to the needs of his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Bob Jones University this spring to speak to
conservative Protestant students and faculty who routinely spew
venom toward Catholics. Then he apologized profusely to the Roman
Catholic community for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   He insists Jesus is his favorite philosopher, as if the
Christian Messiah were a member of his campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
   Every candidate has the right to practice the faith of his
choosing. But both Christianity and Judaism condemn those who
manipulate God to conform to their will. That's idolatry.
</P>
<P>
   Putting something, anything _ money, sex, power, one's own will
or political office _ before God is idolatry.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars suggest that idolatry is the sad foundation of
absolutely every sin condemned in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   And the most prominent politicians of both parties wallow in it
daily. They try ludicrously to register God as a member of their
faithful followers.
</P>
<P>
   God is obviously not a Republican or a Democrat. He is a
reformer, but he would not be a member of the Reform party no
matter who heads that ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Televangelist Pat Robertson makes God appear to be a fascist.
But God is more likely to be a libertarian.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no label can contain the Father of Abraham, Jesus and
Mohammed. And even that image falls short of the glory of the God
politicians bandy about with such cavalier ease.
</P>
<P>
   God is both liberal and conservative, so neither side of that
debate can claim him. God's spirit blows where it will, making all
things new, according to the New Testament. No one can be more
liberal than the Holy Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, God is the same yesterday, today and forever, a rock of
unwavering stability with whom all can find solace, Scripture tells
us.
</P>
<P>
   Despite campaign rhetoric, God is quintessentially independent
and stands in judgment of the idolatry of all politicians.

   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The consensus of
politicians, economists and the public generally on health policy
has shifted since the 1992 election. Then, the prevailing view was
that the failure of many Americans to have medical insurance posed
a serious national problem. There was widespread disagreement over
how to solve the problem but not over whether it could and should
be addressed. Now, the politicians and economists have come to
believe _ and the public has become convinced _ that the problem is
simply too difficult to solve in one giant stroke. By David E.
Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-INSULT-REVIEW (Undated) _ I am used to being around big
news. But observing the story is different than being it. And last
week I seemed to be the story. Gov. George W. Bush spotted me at a
rally in Naperville, Ill. Not realizing the microphones were
working, he told his running mate, Dick Cheney, that I was a
``major league (expletive).'' This was hardly the first time I have
been attacked, though it was the first time the attack accorded me
``major league'' status. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside:
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-WARMING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Past climate ups and downs
mostly mesh well with simultaneous natural variations in the
brightness of the sun or the cooling effect of parasol-like plumes
of particles spewed by big volcanoes. But the recent warming,
according to several recent studies, only correlates well with one
thing: the buildup of carbon dioxide, methane, and the other
greenhouse gases. The lesson in all of this, according to many
climate scientists, is that no one should expect some alarm bell to
start ringing _ some disquieting image of a melted pole, say _ to
conveniently summon societies to take action to forestall a
hot-house future. By Andrea C. Revkin.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The disagreement over the
proper place of religion in politics summons us once again to the
works of those ever-useful observers of American life, Alexis de
Tocqueville of France and James Bryce of Britain. Both of their
classic studies, Tocqueville's ``Democracy in America'' (1835) and
Bryce's ``The American Commonwealth'' (1888), attend the matter in
a spirit that should elicit an amen from Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who
has rekindled the issue by saying that religion supports a moral
foundation for public policy. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   NAPSTER-MP3COM-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seems ironic that MP3.com
is being punished even though it was the online music service that
was trying to ensure that people have legitimate copies of the
works _ properly paid for _ before letting people listen to the
music, says Pamela Samuelson, co-director of the UC-Berkeley Center
for Law and Technology. By contrast, Napster, another high-profile
Internet music company being sued by the major record labels, has
so far eluded any legal backlash, though that it aims to help
people copy and share music without paying for it. Yet Samuelson
predicts ``Napster has a much better chance on appeal than
MP3.com.'' By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   BANNED-APPAREL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why do politicians focus on
certain types of clothing. And how does a brief bit of fabric cause
so much consternation? Several nations have banned or actively
discouraged miniskirts. France requires male bathers to wear
skintight Speedos rather than trunks, on the ground that trunks
could pass for shorts and be worn in potentially unsanitary areas.
And in America, Chief Justice William Rehnquist has suggested that
women in provocative clothing may be inadvertently inviting sexual
harassment. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   CIA-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The CIA has been struggling
for its footing since the end of the Cold War robbed it of a raison
d'etre. But under the Clinton administration, it has suffered from
two worsening trends: a skittishness about politically sensitive
intelligence and an aversion to risky espionage operations. This
spring CIA analysts were ordered that there were to be no surprises
and no intelligence fiascos that could cause headaches in November.
By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   DORMS-BELONGINGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The days when students would
show up at the end of summer with a trunk and a suitcase are long
gone, say college administrators. Today, students have become
hermit crabs and simply take everything with them when they move
into the dorms. The ideal seems to be as much stuff as it is
possible to cram into their rooms. By Jayson Blair.
</P>
<P>
   OLYMPIC-FORECAST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Two Yale business school
professors have developed a formula they say enables them to
predict exactly how many gold medals each country will win at the
Sydney Olympics. The formula posits that just two factors account
for 95 percent of a nation's predicted medal count: the number of
medals it won at a previous Olympics, and the size of its economy.
By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-ELECTION-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Democracy is about choice, but
in the Yugoslav version, now playing itself out with Slobodan
Milosevic's future at stake, there are likely to be more choices
than usual. But with a strong opposition candidate doing better
than Milosevic in the opinion polls, Milosevic also gets to make a
choice: whether to accept the choice of the people _ if it goes
against him _ or to manipulate the totals and declare victory
regardless. By Steven Erlanger. (Moving in `i' category)

intelligence and an aversion to risky espionage operations. This
spring CIA analysts were ordered that there were to be no surprises
and no intelligence fiascos that could cause headaches in November.

   DORMS-BELONGINGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The days when students would
show up at the end of summer with a trunk and a suitcase are long
gone, say college administrators. Today, students have become
hermit crabs and simply take everything with them when they move
into the dorms. The ideal seems to be as much stuff as it is
possible to cram into their rooms. By Jayson Blair.

   OLYMPIC-FORECAST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Two Yale business school
professors have developed a formula they say enables them to
predict exactly how many gold medals each country will win at the
Sydney Olympics. The formula posits that just two factors account
for 95 percent of a nation's predicted medal count: the number of
medals it won at a previous Olympics, and the size of its economy.

   YUGO-ELECTION-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Democracy is about choice, but
in the Yugoslav version, now playing itself out with Slobodan
Milosevic's future at stake, there are likely to be more choices
than usual. But with a strong opposition candidate doing better
than Milosevic in the opinion polls, Milosevic also gets to make a
choice: whether to accept the choice of the people _ if it goes
against him _ or to manipulate the totals and declare victory
regardless. By Steven Erlanger. (Moving in `i' category)

   Swimmers training for the upcoming Summer Olympics in Sydney
have been making as much news for what they are wearing as for what
records they may set. A bodysuit, including a long-sleeved design
that fits athletes from neck to ankle, has revolutionized the sport
by reducing drag as swimmers slice through the water.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bodysuits were approved for international competition
at the beginning of the year, almost all of the world's top
swimmers will be wearing them in Sydney.

 &HT;    CLessons about work, dignity and fairness.c. 2000 Cox News
<TEXT>
Service
<P>
   My father's family leased land to sharecroppers _ ironic for a
family that descended from chattel slaves to turn other people into
wage slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sharecroppers worked the land, never owning it and never getting
out of debt. They made money for someone else, but rarely knew what
it was like to have money in their pockets. Recalling those days
when workers picked the cotton on his daddy's land in Burleson
County, my father said, ``It wasn't fair.'' His words are a lesson
for me about work, dignity and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the custodians, clerks, librarians and others at the
University of Texas who keep the campus running receive few
benefits and low pay. That isn't fair, either, especially at one of
the largest universities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   This week's ``burnt orange flu,'' organized by members of the
University of Texas Staff Association, didn't become an epidemic.
But the issues behind the sickout are real to anyone who has worked
hard and never been able to make ends meet. They are real to people
who have had two jobs. They are real to child-care workers and
teachers, who are paid so little for shaping our future.
</P>
<P>
   They are real enough for a city commission to study how to
address Austin's growing wage divide. And they are real enough for
the Travis County commissioners to approve an $8.50 minimum wage
for county employees this week.
</P>
<P>
   A full-time job ought to pay for the basics of living. But
that's not the case in Texas, a right- to- work state with one of
the highest percentages of working poor people in the nation. We
don't bat an eye when people work 40 hours a week and still need
food stamps or government-subsidized healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is among the most expensive cities in the state. And the
wage gap on the UT campus mirrors the divide in Austin. The average
pay for support staff at UT has increased by 15 percent in three
years, but it still lags behind other local salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But university and staff association officials use conflicting
pay figures. The minimum wage at the university, effective this
month, is $7.61, university officials say. The staff association
says the minimum wage, according to a UT pay plan, is only $6.73 an
hour. The staff association is calling for a minimum wage of $9.16
an hour. Other demands include no increase in out-of-pocket health
insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Pay and benefits aren't the only problems, according to the
staff association. Working conditions for some custodians is
unsafe, the workers alleged in an unsigned letter. The custodians
say they are forced to work with hazardous chemicals, which cause
their eyes to burn, carry 20- pound vacuum cleaner bags, and get a
doctor's note if they're out sick for four hours. Some of the
complaints are being investigated, say university officials.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' flagship university needs to adjust its priorities. You
don't create a great university by breaking the backs of the
workers who run it.
</P>
<P>
   The staff issues at UT are not unlike those facing the
sharecroppers who worked for my grandfather: a decent wage, a
little dignity, fairness. That's not too much to ask for.

   CUBA-OLYMPICS _ HAVANA _ With the Sydney Olympics set to begin
in September, Cuba is gearing up for another bout of sports-mania.
The tiny island nation has produced staggering numbers of medal
winners in past Olympics, and the games provide a rallying point

<P>
   OLY-DRUG _ Edwin Moses, the hurdling icon, looks out on the
Olympic playing field with disgust, suspecting the drug problem in
sports hasn't changed a bit. All the clues are still there. Some
more so than ever. The sudden, drastic change in body shape. The
sculpted appearance. Out-of-this-world performances. Even the need
for braces at a ripe old age, which insiders link to skeletal
changes brought on by the use of drugs like human growth hormone
HGH. (Fish, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 35''

   OLY-DRUGBAR _ At first glance, Olympic officials appear to have
taken strides to clean up the Sydney Games by wheeling out a test
to detect the use of the banned synthetic hormone erythropoietin
(EPO), considered the drug of choice for endurance athletes. But
some medical experts suggest it's just the latest ploy by the
International Olympic Committee to cleanse its image and some
athletes have moved on to a new drug, anyway. (Fish, Atlanta

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Humid air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico will fuel
showers and thunderstorms across the Southeast and lower
Mississippi Valley on Saturday. A few storms will produce more than
an inch of rain. The precipitation will slightly reduce the
regional rainfall deficit, but the drought-plagued areas of Central
Texas and Oklahoma will stay dry.
</P>
<P>
   A weakening front will bring broken clouds and isolated showers
to the interior Northeast, though most of the region will stay dry
and warm with intervals of clouds and sun. Farther south, drier air
circulating around high pressure near the Carolina coast will bring
considerable sunshine to the Middle Atlantic and Southeast Coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The West will be mainly sunny, though onshore breezes will cause
cool, showery weather near the Northwest coast. Isolated strong
afternoon storms will erupt in the northern Plains as an
approaching jet stream disturbance intercepts humid air.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HURRICANE HUNTERS
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of thunderstorms over the Gulf of Mexico caught the
attention of forecasters at the National Hurricane Center on
Friday. So, Saturday, an Air Force hurricane-hunter aircraft is
scheduled to investigate the possibility that the thunderstorms
could organize into a tropical storm. Because tropical systems
often form over remote areas that have few weather observations,
forecasters must rely on aircraft reconnaissance to gauge the vital
signs of these potentially dangerous systems. &QL;

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore promotes tuition tax breaks
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore, at a community college in New Orleans, pushed a tuition
tax break to ease college expenses, as well as other efforts to
bolster worker training. A key element of Gore's spending package
is an effort to upgrade education and training programs that Gore
argues are key to worker survival in an economy increasingly
dominated by burgeoning information technology. He has proposed a
10-year, $36 billion package that would make college tuition
payments tax deductible. The package includes an option to make the
tuition expense deduction a tax credit as well, which would ensure
the same kind of tax break for people with lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN STYLE MAKEOVER FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush put his campaign's new closer-to-the-people style
into practice by sharing coffee and answering questions from
high-tech factory workers as he campaigned in Pennsylvania with a
new theme: ``Real Plans for Real People.'' He said he's ready to
talk to voters _ lots of them _ and visit in their homes. ``I've
got to get out and talk to people, and I'm going to do a lot of
it,'' he told workers at a Marconi Communications factory cafeteria
in Warrendale. Bush also said he would continue to speak plainly,
regardless of poll numbers: ``I'm going to tell you what I think
and let the political chips fall where they may.'' Bush told
reporters that the National Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed
him.
</P>
<P>
   SEPARATE BUT EQUAL WITH HALLIBURTON
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``cultural differences,'' the company that Dick Cheney
headed for the past five years maintains separate restrooms
overseas for its American and foreign employees. Halliburton Co.
said Cheney was unaware of the segregated restroom policy in effect
during his five years as chairman. The oil services giant, a major
federal contractor operating worldwide, said the policy was ``not
an attempt to demean any employee'' and was ``no different than
Eastern countries that often designate facilities for use by
Westerners.'' But a State Department official, Bill Wanlund, said
he had never seen a similar policy in trips and assignments to four
continents. And a leading public health professional, Richard
Levinson, said, absent evidence of unsanitary practices, he could
see no justification for the policy.
</P>
<P>
   NEW AD HITS GORE ON CREDIBILITY
</P>
<P>
   Trying to help George W. Bush regain his footing, the Republican
Party plans to air a new TV ad questioning Al Gore's credibility.
``Can I believe him?'' asks a female narrator in the ad that raises
the vice president's fund-raising troubles in 1996 and criticizes
his education proposals. GOP officials said today the new ad will
air in Michigan and Pennsylvania, two of the most competitive
states. Over the last week, the Republican National Committee has
aired an ad in 16 states that questions Gore's credibility on
campaign finance reform and claims of a key role in developing the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   WILLINGNESS TO MOVE ON DEBATE ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Amid Republican concerns that he needs to end the debate over
debates, George W. Bush and several of his advisers have sent
signals that they were willing to be flexible about the original
position that they had outlined and that Al Gore had rejected. Bush
had been seeking to cast that rejection as a referendum on Gore's
credibility, asserting that the vice president was breaking a
promise to debate anytime and anywhere. But a few of Bush's
advisers conceded that Bush had not made significant inroads with
that argument, which the campaign had made the centerpiece of a TV
spot.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATE REHEARSALS HAVE THEIR STAND-INS
</P>
<P>
   Even while largely rejecting a bipartisan commission's plan for
presidential debates, George W. Bush has been preparing privately
for months for his square-off with Al Gore. The Bush campaign early
on tapped wonkish Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire to play Gore in
practice sessions with Bush, and the two have been rehearsing since
at least June. Gregg also played Gore in 1996 for GOP vice
presidential nominee Jack Kemp. Asked by the Washington Post what
made Gregg a good Gore, GOP officials described Gregg as ``smart,''
``stiff'' and ``dour.'' Playing a similar role for Gore has been
lobbyist Tom Downey, a former congressman who played Kemp for
Gore's 1996 preps and Bill Bradley during the primaries this year.
</P>
<P>
   IN TEXAS, LIEBERMAN SPOTLIGHTS BUSH'S RECORD
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman, surrounded by families who have been unable to
get health care for sick children, said today in George W. Bush's
home state that the governor ``has just not made children's health
coverage and care a priority. In this campaign, Governor Bush may
say that he has a plan to improve children's health across America,
but I think we have a right to ask why hasn't he done it in
Texas,'' Lieberman said in Houston. Later today, Lieberman and his
wife, Hadassah, will rally supporters at an evening event in Miami
Beach and stay overnight.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY SKIPPED MOST TEXAS ELECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney skipped 14 of 16 elections since registering to vote
in Dallas County, Texas, in late 1995 after moving there as the new
head of Halliburton Co., an oil services company. The missed votes
included the Texas primary in March in which Cheney could have cast
his ballot for his future running mate, George W. Bush. That
2-for-16 voting history compares with the 5-for-6 election
participation rate of his Democratic counterpart, Joe Lieberman,
over the same period. Cheney, campaigning today in Vermont,
acknowledged that he didn't vote in this year's Texas primary, but
said he's voted ``in every federal primary and general election in
the last 20-some years.'' He said extensive travel has kept him
from becoming involved in state or local politics.
</P>
<P>
   JUST DO THE MATH, BUSH URGED
</P>
<P>
   Three prominent Social Security experts have asked George W.
Bush to explain how he would protect the system while diverting
huge sums of money into private investments. ``The arithmetic is
simple,'' they warned in a letter to Bush, arguing that his Bush's
proposal would drain $1 trillion from Social Security and threaten
benefits for millions nearing retirement. The three signatories:
Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; Bob
Ball, Social Security commissioner from 1962 to 1973 under three
different presidents of both parties; and Alicia Munnell, a
professor at the Boston College School of Management and a former
assistant secretary of the Treasury. A copy of the letter was
obtained by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   GORE TAX BREAKS CALLED TOO VAGUE
</P>
<P>
   A non-partisan congressional panel found that 19 of Al Gore's
proposed tax breaks are too vague for an official estimate, leading
to Republican charges that Gore isn't living up to his call for
specifics on campaign issues. The Joint Committee on Taxation,
which estimates all tax legislation on Capitol Hill for Democrats
and Republicans, released documents today showing that such Gore
proposals as a health insurance tax credit, cuts in the estate tax
and education tax breaks ``require additional specification'' in
order to be estimated.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN CLOSER TO SOME FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Federal elections officials have determined that Pat Buchanan is
eligible to receive at least some of the $12.6 million in federal
campaign funds earmarked for the Reform Party's presidential
candidate. Staff members have recommended to the Federal Election
Commission that Buchanan be preliminarily certified for the funds,
but at least one commissioner opposed the proposal, expressing a
desire to discuss the matter in public. Buchanan rival John Hagelin
also is seeking the federal funding. A public hearing on the issue
is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   OPRAH'S VOTE CLUB
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush have been engaged in a tug of war for
women voters, mostly middle- and lower-income white women, for much
of the year. And now they hope their pilgrimage for a sit-down with
Oprah Winfrey will do for their presidential campaigns what her
book club routinely does for writers: propel them to the top of the
best-seller list. Gore is scheduled to appear on Monday, with Bush
following up on Sept. 18. Both candidates will appear for the full
hour. The show's theme is ``Why should I vote for you?''
</P>
<P>
   BLACK BAPTISTS ADDRESSED FROM AFAR
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was warmly received and George W. Bush was met mostly
with silence as both courted the black vote in satellite television
speeches to the National Baptist Convention, USA Inc. in Los
Angeles. Both candidates, however, were sharply criticized by
convention leaders for failing to show up in person. Gore sent his
daughter Kristin to introduce him, and received frequent applause
during a 15-minute speech that stressed black issues and family
values. But there was mostly silence until polite applause at the
end of Bush's five-minute speech. ``He didn't say anything. He did
not explain anything. . . . It was a little five-minute, `Glad you
invited me. Sorry I can't be there. God bless you. That's it,' ``
said Geraldine Martin, a convention-goer from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS OF OIL SEEPS BACK INTO CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's most keenly contested states in the
presidential election are also wintry states, where voters could
well feel the double sting of high fuel prices at the pump and in
their homes. And as furnaces fire up against the chill winds of
autumn, the blaming started anew. Republicans, responding to the
10-year high in oil prices, accused the Clinton-Gore administration
of squandering U.S. influence with oil-producing nations and
standing helpless to protect consumers now. Al Gore's campaign shot
back that George W. Bush has no energy policy at all, other than
``to let his friends in the oil industry drill our wilderness
areas,'' as spokesman Doug Hattaway put it.
</P>
<P>
   VOTER PRESSES CHENEY TO GET TOUGHER
</P>
<P>
   The Republican campaign is too soft on Al Gore. That was the
assessment by a voter during Dick Cheney's campaign swing through
Maine and New Hampshire. ``I'd like to see you and Governor Bush be
more aggressive in challenging Al Gore,'' Steve Caminiti, a Bush
supporter, told Cheney in Portland, Maine. The 35-year-old
financial planner said he's frustrated that Cheney and George W.
Bush haven't taken on Gore more stridently on the issue of tax
cuts. The GOP ticket is letting Gore get away ``with lying on a
regular basis,'' Caminiti told Cheney during a question-and-answer
session after Cheney's speech.
</P>
<P>
   NO POLE FOR FIREMAN JOE
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman stopped by Fire Station No. 2 in Little Rock,
Ark., just as the firefighters were washing one of their big red
trucks. Lieberman talked with them for a while about the election,
then decided to help them wash the truck, taking a few swipes at it
from the side. Then one of the firefighters suggested he go down
the firepole, and while others urged him on, Lieberman's aides
immediately advised against it. The day before, while visiting a
Harley-Davidson factory in Kansas City, Mo., he got on the back of
a bike, also against the wishes of his aides.
</P>
<P>
   NO GIULIANI, MUCH CLINTON, AT LATE PARADE
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of this year's Labor Day parade up Fifth Avenue in
New York, to be held Saturday, are planning to turn the march into
a major platform for Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign. To
highlight her, the parade's organizers have taken the unusual step
of not inviting Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was briefly Clinton's
opponent. Nor have they invited the Republican who is running
against her, Rep. Rick Lazio. In recent years, the parade has been
scheduled for the Saturday after Labor Day, because many union
members don't want their three-day holiday weekends cut short for
the march. Union leaders also wanted to hold it on a day when more
people would be in Manhattan to see it.

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, Ext. 218.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: ESTATE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday sustained the President's veto of a bill
to repeal the estate tax. Voting 274-157, the House failed to reach
the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto. Supporters of
the override said ending the tax on inherited properties would
reduce administrative costs for businesses and allow more Americans
to pass their estates to their children. Opponents said repealing
the tax would benefit only the wealthy and would prevent spending
down the debt and strengthening Social Security. A ``yes'' vote
supports the tax repeal.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CHILDREN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 405-18, a bill to provide more
child support to families leaving welfare. Supporters said the bill
would simplify child support payments and give mothers leaving
welfare all the child support collected for them, instead of
returning half to the state. Some opponents said the bill would
place state functions under federal control. Others objected to
provisions that could allow funding social service programs run by
religious institutions, saying the bill would sanction
discriminatory hiring practices. A ``yes'' supports the child
support bill.

SHOULD FETUS'S WELL-BEING OVERRIDE MOTHER'S RIGHTS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The war on drugs arrived with a vengeance in the
obstetrics department of the Medical University of South Carolina
in the fall of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Distressed by evidence of increasing cocaine use by women
arriving for prenatal care at the university's public hospital in
Charleston, and fearing for the fate of abandoned or impaired crack
babies, the staff began testing the urine of patients who aroused
their suspicions. Positive test results were turned over to the
local prosecutor and the police, and women were arrested on the
spot, sometimes at the hospital just after giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   The acute concerns that led to such a punitive approach have
eased since then, as cocaine use has dwindled and the worst fears
for a generation of crack babies have proved unfounded. Challenged
in court and criticized by medical organizations for criminalizing
a public-health problem, the policy evolved into a statewide
program that emphasizes treatment rather than punishment for
pregnant drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues raised by the Charleston experience reverberate
still _ and far beyond the confines of a Supreme Court case, to be
argued on Oct. 4, on whether the warrantless drug tests amounted to
unconstitutional searches.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Ferguson v. City of Charleston, is one of the most
closely watched of the court's new term. But however the justices
rule, the Fourth Amendment, with its prohibition against
unreasonable searches, cannot provide an answer to the deeper
questions raised by what happened in Charleston and what is
happening in various contexts across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When does a pregnant woman _ or even a potentially pregnant
woman, given increasing medical knowledge about reproductive health
_ cross the line between autonomy and obligation? In an age of
reproductive freedom, when no woman can be forced to carry a
pregnancy to term, when if ever should society intervene to protect
the future interests of a child whom a woman has chosen to bear?
</P>
<P>
   If fetal health is the issue, what about a pregnant woman who
smokes two packs of cigarettes a day, or who abuses alcohol, given
that the American Medical Association has identified fetal alcohol
syndrome as ``the leading cause of mental retardation in the
Western world''? And fundamentally, whose interest is it, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 women in 30 states have been prosecuted on various
legal theories of ``fetal abuse.'' A woman in Georgia was charged
last year with capital murder for the death, moments after birth,
of one of a pair of premature twins; the mother, who tested
positive for cocaine and methamphetamine, had received no prenatal
care. Her lawyers are seeking dismissal of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The troubling scenarios are extremely diverse, extending far
beyond criminal law. Women have been forced to undergo Caesarean
sections when doctors have convinced judges or hospital committees
that the patient's refusal of surgical intervention was ill
advised, and medical ethicists are debating the implications of
fetal surgery that can correct some serious problems before birth
but that some women are likely to reject.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a state juvenile court judge in Massachusetts ordered
a pregnant member of a fundamentalist sect to be taken into custody
and held until she gives birth, probably several weeks from now.
The sect rejects modern medical care, and a baby born to the woman
last year died five minutes after birth.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, declaring that women ``may not be forced to choose
between having a child and having a job,'' the Supreme Court
invalidated the ``fetal protection'' policies that employers were
using to bar pregnant or potentially pregnant women from workplaces
with toxins or other known hazards to fetal development.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, one of the court's more important
sex-discrimination rulings of the 1990s, settled the legal
question. But it could hardly resolve the personal dilemma facing a
woman whose need to earn a living might risk the health of the
child she hopes to have.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Johnsen, a law professor at Indiana University who formerly
served as legal director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said that those cases needed to be seen in the ``broader
context of women's equality and liberty rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the law uses the fact that a woman is pregnant to
treat her differently, it's important to be suspicious,'' Johnsen
said, given the history of women's fertility being used as a reason
for excluding them from economic and civic life.
</P>
<P>
   While the language of rights in conflict _ ``maternal rights''
versus ``fetal rights'' _ pervades much of the discussion, this, in
the view of many people, is a misleading way to frame the question.
</P>
<P>
   It is a misperceived conflict and a ``false dichotomy,'' said
Rachel Roth, a political scientist at Washington University in St.
Louis and the author of ``Making Women Pay: The Hidden Costs of
Fetal Rights.'' The book argues that a result of emphasizing the
ways in which women fail their fetuses has been to take society off
the hook for providing better medical care, drug treatment and
safer workplaces, and to ``privatize responsibility for the next
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus on the fetus, Roth maintains in her book, ``reduces
women to incubators'' who are seen not as ``full-fledged human
beings, but merely better or worse vessels for fetuses,'' their
bodies no longer seen as nurturing sanctuaries but ``as a form of
solitary confinement for the fetus.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Roth said that the Charleston experience was an
example of ``the personification of the fetus at women's expense.''
She said that while the policy ``was supposed to be for the fetus's
benefit, arresting the woman after delivery doesn't improve life
for the baby or the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Any emphasis on the fetus as a focus of public policy makes
supporters of abortion rights nervous. Yet the question of harmful
behavior during pregnancy is logically quite separate from the
abortion debate, according to John Robertson, a professor of law
and bioethics at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While it is clear from the Supreme Court's precedents that
``fetuses don't have rights as such to be born,'' Robertson said in
an interview, that is hardly the end of the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The ``real party in interest,'' he said, is neither the woman
nor the fetus, but ``the child who will be born'' and who will be
affected, after birth, by the prenatal behavior. ``A pregnant
woman, if she chooses not to end the pregnancy, takes on a moral
and perhaps a legal obligation to refrain from clearly harmful
prenatal conduct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even someone whose ethical stance favors intervention sees
no clear answers when it comes to applying principle to policy.
Charleston ``went overboard'' in its original, punitive approach,
Robertson said: ``As a matter of principle, I don't see why the
state should be prevented from taking action. As a policy judgment,
it might be another matter.''

   &QL;  INS COMMISSIONER DORIS MEISSNER'S LEGACY
</P>
<P>
   By Alison Vekshin
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 -- In her first days as the head of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Doris Meissner was
surprised when someone passing in the hall surprised her by calling
her ``commissioner.'' She quickly turned to see who was being
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the significance of her position as head of the
country's largest federal law enforcement agency instantly set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner was always somebody else and suddenly it was
me,'' said Meissner, who had served in senior-level positions in
the agency. ``It sunk in that people were really looking to me to
set the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner, 58, was sworn in on October 18, 1993, after the U.S.
Senate unanimously confirmed her nomination. She has managed the
agency for almost the entire term of President Clinton's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   She came on at a time when the organization was largely
under-funded and looked upon as a backward bureaucracy. The
commissioner post was not exactly sought after.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been somewhat traditional in previous administrations
that the head of the INS is a political appointment for a supporter
-- a backwater for political appointees,'' said Frank Sharry,
executive director at the National Immigration Forum, a
pro-immigrant advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doris doesn't come from that school,'' Sharry said, adding
that President Clinton actively courted her for the post. ``She was
the best person for the job and was reluctantly recruited to sign
on. It's an impossible job.''
</P>
<P>
   A daughter of German immigrants, Meissner was born and raised in
Milwaukee and attended the University of Wisconsin at Madison. She
enrolled in the Integrated Liberal Studies program, where she met
fellow freshman Charles Meissner. They married in 1963, a few days
before graduating. She majored in history with a minor in French.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner postponed her post-graduate studies to work as
assistant director of student financial aid at the university while
Charles completed his doctorate. Then, in 1969, she got her
graduate degree at Madison in political science and education
policy.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the turbulence of the 1960s in Madison. As a
teaching assistant in graduate school, her classes were cancelled
for weeks at a time because of anti-war demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner did not get involved in the student activism on campus.
``I never was a take-to-the-streets person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience of seeing the protests and the violence led
her to become involved in politics. She wanted to effect change
constructively.
</P>
<P>
   She worked on the successful 1970 campaign to elect Democrat
Midge Miller as one of the first women to the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Meissners moved in 1971 to Washington D.C., where Doris
Meissner became the first executive director at the National
Women's Political Caucus, a bipartisan organization committed to
getting women elected to public office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, she became a special assistant to the U.S. attorney
general through the White House Fellows program. Under the highly
selective program created in 1964, 11 to 19 people work full time
for a year as a special assistant to a Cabinet member or a senior
presidential advisor.
</P>
<P>
   She remained at the Justice Department as an assistant director
of the Office of Policy and Planning, executive director of the
Cabinet Committee on Illegal Aliens and a deputy associate attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   While her German background gave her an inherent appreciation
for the immigrant experience, she admitted to getting into
immigration by happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   As a staff aide on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, her
husband was responsible for overseeing issues related to Vietnam.
After Saigon fell in 1975, the Meissners agreed to sponsor a
refugee family.
</P>
<P>
   When her colleagues learned that a Vietnamese family was living
wth her, they assumed that she was dedicated to the immigration
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it never left me from then on,'' she said. ``One thing or
another just kept arising and I became more and more deeply
involved in immigration issues in the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   She served as acting INS commissioner in 1981 and then as
executive associate commissioner until 1986. She left the Justice
Department to become a senior associate and director of the
Immigration Policy Project at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, a nonprofit organization that focuses on
international affairs and U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to the department in her current post at a
politically charged time. One of the biggest immigration surges in
U.S. history sparked an anti-immigrant sentiment during the 1990s.
More than 10 million people have immigrated to the United States
since 1990, up from 7,338,062 in the 1980s. Lawmakers pushed
legislation to limit the influx and some attempted to dismantle the
INS.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner led the agency through an overhaul. The INS budget has
grown from $1.6 billion in 1993 to $4.3 billion this year - with
$4.8 billion proposed for the 2001 fiscal year - to support
increased enforcement efforts and to modernize antiquated systems.
</P>
<P>
   The INS work force has gone from 17,000 to more than 32,000
employees. And the agency has developed a new system for handling a
backlog of citizenship applications. When she leaves office at the
end of the Clinton administration, her agency will have processed
more naturalization applications in the last five years than it had
in the last 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   But reforming the INS has not been easy. Meissner's Citizenship
USA program, designed to overcome a three-year backlog by quickly
approving naturalization applications for about 1.3 million people,
was met with Republican opposition. They accused the agency of a
politically motivated effort to pad voter rolls before the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   Also, under the hastily implemented program, about 300 people
with criminal backgrounds were naturalized, because FBI fingerprint
reports were not obtained in time.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Meissner also faced a personal tragedy. On April 3,
1996, Charles Meissner, a senior official at the Commerce
Department, died in the plane crash in Croatia that also killed
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. The Meissners have two grown
children.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Meissner faced perhaps the highest-profile
case of her tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The INS commissioner played a central role in the Elian Gonzalez
controversy, ruling in January that, since the Cuban boy's mother
died while trying to reach the United States, his father back in
Cuba should speak on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   To Meissner, the case was simple, with the bond between the
parent and child at the heart of it. The hardest part was reuniting
Elian with his father, against the wishes of the Miami relatives
who had taken in the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously what was hard about it was the emotion and
controversy surrounding it,'' Meissner said. ``It affected me in
that it took a tremendous amount of effort and perseverance.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian aside, she said the INS has faced a huge challenge in
trying to reduce illegal immigration from Mexico, citing several
Border Patrol successes in closing some major smuggling corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you tighten up the more aggressive and expensive the
smuggling becomes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol, one of INS' law enforcement units, has grown
from 3,900 in 1993 to more than 8,000 agents today. All but 700 are
at the Southwest border to combat the shift in illegal immigration
from urban to more remote regions. The agency apprehended 1,537,000
illegal aliens along the borderin fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   INS uses a combination of border patrol agents, camera systems
and air surveillance, and performs hundreds of rescues each year at
the border.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation of immigrants, Meissner said, a central concern for
INS today is the public's attitude toward immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very high levels of immigration,'' she said. ``But
there is not really a national consensus on how much immigration,
what kinds of immigrants ought to be coming into the country, what
numbers of immigrants ought to be coming and how best to integrate
the people from very far-flung parts of the world into the life of
our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
of 1996, a major piece of legislation, reflected a growing push in
Congress to reduce immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The law stiffened criminal penalties for immigration-related
offenses and imposed restrictions on the eligibility of aliens for
public benefits. It created new requirements on sponsors of alien
relatives for immigration and overhauled the removal process of
inadmissible and deportable aliens, including creating an
``expedited removal'' process.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with immigration issues has been a challenge, admitted
Meissner, who plans to take time off when her term ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many things that I have to deal with are really difficult and
it's hard to know what the best decision is,'' she said. ``An awful
lot of what I do falls into the areas of gray.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who have worked with Meissner consider her a firm and
fair commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is someone who doesn't get flustered,'' White House Deputy
Chief of Staff Maria Echaveste said. ``She just comes up with a
strategy to achieve her goals. Others who have gone through the
gauntlet like she has in the last eight years would have moved
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharry, who has known Meissner since 1984, sees her as firmly
committed to good government and professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in a number of meetings with her where a
politically expedient decision was right there for the taking, but
that's not what moves her,'' Sharry said. ``She brought in some
real top people and is credited for bringing a real enlightened
approach to the management of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``She inspires respect,'' he said. ``Whenever Doris walks into a
setting with immigration advocates, they treat her like a visiting
dignitary.''
</P>
<P>
   While her leadership has had a lasting impact on the INS,
Meissner said the agency ``is not yet where it needs to be in order
to be a service organization as well as a true professional law
enforcement organization.''
</P>
<P>
   And immigration will remain a touchy and divisive subject long
after she leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal with some of the most fundamental instincts that we as
human beings have: A desire to improve our lives, provide for our
families, allow our children have a better future, and live in a
system that respects rights and fundamental freedoms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the immigration issues really do go to the heart of
who we are as a nation,'' Meissner said. ``And I think I've been
able to play a part in preserving and strengthening our immigration
tradition.''

 &HT;    CLINTON LEAVES UN SUMMIT WITH UNFINISHED BUSINESS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton wrapped up three days of intensive
diplomacy here Friday amid an air of diminishing expectations, as
the weight of unfinished business began to settle on the shoulders
of a leader who's era is about to close.
</P>
<P>
   With four months left in office, Clinton used this week's
Millennium Summit at the United Nations to begin bidding farewell
to the community of global leaders he's engaged with and, in many
cases, befriended over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   At almost every turn, though, there were signs that key pieces
of the vast global agenda Clinton has crafted and pursued aren't
likely to fall into place before he leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin clashed publicly
over nuclear arms controls, in an unsettling reminder that, a
decade after the end of the Cold War, the transformation in
U.S.-Russian relations Clinton sought to forge remains dangerously
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   An awkward chance meeting between Clinton and Cuban dictator
Fidel Castro carried similar irony. Clinton had hoped, and sought
early on, to end four decades of estrangement between the two
neighbors, but the thaw was thwarted after Castro's MIGs shot down
two Miami-based Cessnas flying near Havana to protest his regime in
1996, killing four unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Friday meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin
underscored the continuing friction in Sino-American relations over
Beijing's enduring political repression and human rights abuses,
seven years after Clinton began pushing a policy of engagement,
saying increased U.S. trade and investment would help promote
reform in the world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Surely most disappointing of all, with no visible progress in
his meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, hopes were fading, though not completely
abandoned, for the Mideast peace accord Clinton has labored
tirelessly to secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to keep pressing here,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright told reporters Thursday. ``But the truth is,
just look at the calendar, and there is not a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Clinton can claim success on a host of his foreign
policy priorities. Returning democratic rule to Haiti, ending
ethnic bloodshed in Bosnia, winning Congressional passage of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and heading off a
financial debacle in Mexico are among the big games in his win
column. Critics may debate the effectiveness of each of those
initiatives, but Clinton, for better or worse, got each done.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to rule out additional victories, as well,
including the possibility, however remote, that Clinton might yet
be able to pull a rabbit out of the diplomatic hat and bring Arafat
and Barak to a Mideast peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   There comes a point in the life of an administration, however,
when the thrust shifts from generating lofty long-term objectives
to the more mundane exercise of plotting life after government.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Deputy National Security Adviser Jim Steinberg
left the White House to take a job at a philanthropic institution,
part of the normal shift from public to private sector as any
administration winds to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can read a calendar,'' said Walter Kansteiner, who
served as an NSC official under President George Bush. As the clock
winds down, he said, ``there is a realization that they're some
things you're just not going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   The crafting and pursuit of U.S. foreign policy is always a work
in progress. International diplomacy is as much a management
challenge as a set of tasks to be checked off when complete.
</P>
<P>
   Where domestic policy often revolves around specific benchmarks
_ legislation gets passed, programs get implemented, institutions
take on a life of their own _ foreign affairs is a bit more messy,
complicated as it is by the actions and motives of U.S. allies,
partners and foes abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some end marks, but more often than not it is a
process,'' said Kansteiner, a partner with The Scowcroft Group, a
Washington D.C. consulting firm. ``There's the peace process that
doesn't get finalized, or the bilateral relationship that gets over
one hurdle but then faces other problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Often an outgoing president's problems get kicked down the road
to its successor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton inherited from Bush, for example, difficulties in
Somalia _ where Bush sent 30,000 troops two weeks after losing to
Clinton in 1992 _ and in Iraq, where U.S. pilots continue to fly
combat air patrol missions almost daily, precisely as they did when
Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever replaces Clinton in January _ Democrat Al Gore or
Republican George W. Bush _ will doubtless inherit a range of
global challenges just as Clinton did.
</P>
<P>
   He will also inherit opportunities, however, to build on
progress Clinton has made.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have learned the lessons of the past,'' Clinton said in
his final address as president before the United Nations, ``we can
leave a very different legacy for our children.''

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, Ext. 218.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: ESTATE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday sustained the President's veto of a bill
to repeal the estate tax. Voting 274-157, the House failed to reach
the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto. Supporters of
the override said ending the tax on inherited properties would
reduce administrative costs for businesses and allow more Americans
to pass their estates to their children. Opponents said repealing
the tax would benefit only the wealthy and would prevent spending
down the debt and strengthening Social Security. A ``yes'' vote
supports the tax repeal.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CHILDREN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 405-18, a bill to provide more
child support to families leaving welfare. Supporters said the bill
would simplify child support payments and give mothers leaving
welfare all the child support collected for them, instead of
returning half to the state. Some opponents said the bill would
place state functions under federal control. Others objected to
provisions that could allow funding social service programs run by
religious institutions, saying the bill would sanction
discriminatory hiring practices. A ``yes'' supports the child
support bill.

WESTERN ROCKERS RAVE ABOUT RUSSIA'S HIGH-QUALITY, LOW-COST
MICROPHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULA, Russia _ A small Soviet-era factory called Oktava has a
well-known fan: the musician Sting. The reason is its microphones.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in this small city three hours south of
Moscow, was focused primarily on weapons production in Soviet
times. But since the 1950s, when Moscow ordered mass production for
everything from recording studios to telecommunications equipment,
it has been making a variety of microphones that lately have found
unlikely global success.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the company has
compensated for the lack of state purchases with unusual buyers:
American and British rock musicians. After it began exporting in
1994, revenues have more than doubled, mainly through the sale of
the microphones, which musicians say are cheap, high-quality and
some of the ugliest they've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We nicknamed it the electric razor,'' said Hugh Padgham, a
London-based recording engineer who has done albums for Sting and
The Police, and bought an older version of the microphones about 10
yearsago. ``Because it's so cheap and badly made, you're always
slightly suspicious why it should sound so good.''
</P>
<P>
   As creaky, Soviet-era enterprises struggle to shed outdated
equipment and oversized work forces, Oktava is thriving. It is a
rarity among Russian consumer goods companies, whose products
normally cannot compete internationally because of poor quality.
But Oktava has turned superb engineering from half a century ago
into profits today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tula is best known for its spice cookies, guns, and
samovars,'' said Gennady Ulyanov, Oktava's general-director. ``And
now for its microphones,'' he said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   The company is unusual because it has capitalized on its
Soviet-era expertise in an extremely competitive industry. Stepping
into the factory is like going back in time. Receptionists answer
clunky telephones that look much like the display models in the
company museum. An exhibit titled ``The First Stakhanovites''
proudly displays the factory's first labor heroes. (Stakhanov was
the name of an exceptionally productive miner, whom the Soviet
government held up as an heroic example in a publicity stunt in the
1930s.)
</P>
<P>
   Displayed prominently along another wall is a light pink radio
the factory made for Stalin on his 70th birthday. Company
management has remained virtually unchanged since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in particular has changed,'' said Ulyanov, a pleasant
man with a brilliant row of gold teeth, who was a Communist Party
member for years and who began working in the plant in 1963 as a
lathe operator.
</P>
<P>
   It was in exactly this state that two British brothers, who
would later become Oktava's exclusive distributors, found the
company in 1993. Fergus McKay and his brother, Andy, both studying
to be sound engineers, came across an Oktava microphone in their
college recording studio. They asked their father, who ran a food
import company in Moscow, to track down the factory. He returned to
England with a box full of them. But before the brothers could
return for more, the model was discontinued. They contacted the
factory, persuaded it to resume production, and signed a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Russian product _ something no one had ever seen
before,'' said Fergus McKay, of A&AMP;F McKay Audio Limited. ``The
interest was enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the name of the microphone sounded threatening _ the MK
219. Reviewers praised its sound quality but were astounded at the
lack of attention to its appearance. In 1994, when the microphones
were released, one trade magazine wrote, ``extremely nice sounding
mic, not likely to get stolen,'' while another wrote that it looked
as though it had been ``cast from an Aeroflot tea trolley.'' Its
homeliness, in fact, became one of its main selling points, Fergus
McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the microphones are known throughout the world. Musicians
and sound engineers were lured first by the price _ Padgham paid
about $140 for his microphones when a comparable one made by
Germany's Neuman cost about $1,700 _ and later by the appearance.
Sales at the McKays jumped from 20 microphones a month in 1994 to
about 2,000 now. Oktava's annual revenue doubled to 500 million
rubles ($18 million) since it began exporting.
</P>
<P>
   The quality, however, can be spotty and doesn't compare with the
more expensive German microphones. The Russian mikes are bought
mainly by younger and semi-professional musicians who are starting
recording studios at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that kept me from wanting to buy them as a consumer
is the variability from unit to unit,'' said Steven Albini, a
free-lance recording engineer based in Chicago who has used other
Russian microphones for about 10 years. ``But if I was just
starting out, I'd be buying handfuls of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Albini prefers the older Russian microphones because they were
built mostly with vacuum tubes instead of transistors. As a result,
they produce a warmer, better-recorded sound. Russia kept that
technology for years after American producers abandoned it. He
frequently uses microphones made in the 1950s by the St.
Petersburg-based company LOMO, and has recorded albums for P J
Harvey, Nirvana and Robert Plant and Jimmy Page with them. Oktava
plans to re-release an old-style microphone by yearend.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russian-made products are inexpensive, in part because labor and
local materials cost far less than in Western markets. Most of the
components Oktava uses are domestically produced. The average
salary at the plant is about 1,300 rubles, or about $50 a month.
Though the factory is still sprawling with a work force of about
2,000, that's down from 5,000 just after the collapse of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the success of its microphones abroad has not erased all
financial difficulties at home. The company is still paying off the
tax debt it racked up in the early 1990s, before it found new
buyers. Without any bank loans or outside investors it often runs
short of capital to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his long history as a plant worker, Ulyanov, 59, has
adapted to management well. The company opened a marketing
department in the early 1990s to compete better domestically. It
has also bought new equipment. It now exports about 30 percent of
what it produces, up from 6 percent just after the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government owns about 60 percent of the company, while
private shareholders, mostly workers, own the rest, said Ulyanov,
who himself owns 1 percent. It was founded in 1927 in the early
days of the Soviet regime, and produced mostly radios and
loudspeakers until the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Russian musicians most often find Oktava when flipping through
glossy Western music magazines, Ulyanov said. ``Made in Russia''
has meant poor quality for so long that most seek imported goods
when they want high technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call us and say, `It can't be you _ here, in Russia, in
Tula?''' he said.

 &HT;    BOOMER GRANDPARENTS ARE CHANGING THE STEREOTYPE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 10.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Remember gray-haired Grandma in her checkered
apron, baking perfect cookies? Today, Grandma's wearing a business
suit and behind the wheel of a sport utility vehicle, talking on a
cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   On this Sunday, as the nation celebrates National Grandparents
Day, ``grandparents are a new breed of people,'' said Dr. Arthur
Kornhaber, the founder and president of the Foundation for
Grandparenting and author of ``Contemporary Grandparenting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old stereotypes of aging _ being aged as a grandparent _
don't hold right now. The boomer generation are people who changed
the world. They're used to doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 74 percent of Americans over 50 are grandparents,
according to a study by Age Wave, LLC and Cologne Life
Reinsurance(cq).
</P>
<P>
   Steven Barsch, chief executive officer of igrandparents.com, a
Web site devoted to enhancing the lives of grandparents and their
grandchildren, agreed that baby boomers are creating a new image of
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's grandparent is younger, wealthier, has much more time
and is much more active,'' Barsch said. ``Today's grandparents are
not sitting back in a rocking chair waiting for death to take
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wilson, 57, of West Palm Beach, Fla., is a prime
example. An avid golfer and very active church member, Wilson _ a
grandfather of two _ travels all over the country to race cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself an average grandparent,'' Wilson said.
``I focus more on investments on my grandchildren's behalf, stocks
and bonds. I let their parents focus on their everyday
bringing-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson isn't the only one. Fifty-six percent of grandparents
agreed that contributions to a college fund are and easier choice
than traditional presents, according to a 1995 survey by Maturity
Mark Services.
</P>
<P>
   New image or not, today's grandparents face a difficult role,
according to Susan V. Bosak, author of ``How to Build the Grandma
Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern grandparents face many challenges,'' said Bosak.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce, physical distance and an age-segregated society are
reasons today's grandparents to feel hesitant about getting
involved in grandchildren's lives, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many boomer grandparents are turning to new methods such as the
Internet and e-mail to face these challenges. Adults 50 and over
are just as likely as young adults to use e-mail on a daily basis,
according to a 1996 study in American Demographics magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody spends more time or money on line than the 50-plus
demographic,'' Barsch said. ``It puts them on an even keel with
their grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornhaber who also founded the Web site grandparenting.org,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that every grandparent today has to be
computer-literate if they want to live in their child's world.''
</P>
<P>
   With more grandparents still actively involved with their
careers, relationships with grandchildren can suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have busy, hectic schedules,'' Bosak said. ``And the
key to bonding is frequent, consistent contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Howard, 53, of West Palm Beach, a grandmother of five,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a very busy person,'' says Howard. ``I
assist my husband in the office and cook three meals a day. I'm an
active person with no time at all, but I still manage to find time
for my grandkids.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosak and other authorities said that a strong
grandparent-grandchild relationship is important to both lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about how important parents are in children's lives,
even how important peers are in children's lives, and somehow
grandparents get forgotten,'' she said. ``Research shows that
children need as much as four to six active adults in their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents Day provides an opportunity for many grandparents
to be a part of their grandchildren's lives. The day began as the
idea of West Virginia housewife Marian McQuade in 1970, and was
officially declared National Grandparents Day by President Carter
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   While some grandparents may indeed mark the day by baking
cookies with their grandchildren, others may be sharing activities
such as hiking, sailing, traveling, or gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's grandparents are not grammies and grandpas whittling
around the house,'' Kornhaber said. ``Those days are gone. It's a
whole new ball game.''

WEAK KNEES FROM THE TEXAS GUNSLINGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September   10, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By clumsily bailing out of the Oct. 3 presidential debate still
listed for UMass-Boston's campus, George W. Bush hurts his own
Texas-tough-guy image, weakens his already feeble chances in the
Northeast, wastes several hundred grand in site preparation, and
ticks off Bill Forry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big loss for the neighborhood if it doesn't happen,''
said Forry, who with his dad and a small crew puts out the feisty
weekly Dorchester Reporter. Few motorists who stall-and-crawl past
Dorchester Bay know, for instance, that ``the first town meeting in
America was held here in Dorchester, on Oct. 8, 1633.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of local newsgathering, Forry relates that
``much of the discussion that day was the grazing of cows in the
Calf Pasture, which is now Columbia Point, where the UMass campus
stands.'' Perhaps the tax-phobic Bush clan was put off by the fact
that what may have been one of the first taxes in the New World was
levied upon cattle owners who grazed the common land. The money
went for what Forry claims was ``the first tax-supported public
school in America,'' also in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   The details are on his Web site, www.dotnews.com, if Bush wants
to see for himself. But he's apparently put off by the
neighborhood, i.e., the looming shadow of the Kennedy Library, a
Democratic party shrine. Dubbaya seems to be put off by the
Northeast. He got hammered by John McCain in five out of six New
England primaries. Now the only state in the Northeast where he
leads is New Hampshire, by single digits. Bush lags elsewhere in
New England, in New York and New Jersey, too. Not till he gets to
Pennsylvania do his poll numbers show some promise. His debate
dithering won't help, either.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the guy who's behind wants a lot of debates, starting
pronto. And if the guy who was ahead suddenly finds himself behind,
he does a fast 180 and becomes a born-again debate-demander.
Another fact of debates: The media exaggerate the outcome. If the
quickie overnight polls show that one fellow was judged the winner
by 53 percent of the viewers, and the other guy by only 47, after
three days of talking TV heads chewing over the results and
exaggerating the purported margin of victory, the pundit class will
treat it as a lopsided 60-40 wipeout.
</P>
<P>
   Since Al Gore is a better debater than George W. Bush, has much
more experience in those high-pressure situations, and has a
stronger grasp of the thousands of governmental details that can
trip up a candidate unfamiliar with the labyrynthian federal
establishment, Gore wanted lots of debates.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gore at mid-summer was 17 points behind, and Bush then had
more campaign cash to play with, it made sense for Gore to propose
both men scrap political ads and slug it out weekly on TV. That was
never going to happen, and Gore knew it. But posturing is part of
the game. At most the two rivals would never have more than the
three slotted by the national debate commission. And neither wanted
also-rans like Ralph Nader or Pat Buchanan gumming up the works.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his crew of Texas-centric insiders made the fundamental
mistake of believing that their scope to bob and weave and take
other evasive maneuvers would be as great in September as it was at
the beginning of August. Wrong, wrong, wrong. What changed? The
polls, reflecting shifts in voter attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's smooth-as-silk GOP convention week left the GOP ticket
overconfident and underprepared for a rugged fall ride. Like Mike
Dukakis in '88, Bush and his team underestimated the resilience of
a sitting vice president astride a great-guns economy and a period
of relative harmony abroad. Now Gore rises like Bush Sr. in '88,
peaking late.
</P>
<P>
   Off-stride and off-message since Gore's robust convention
success in Los Angeles four weeks ago, Bush Jr. mishandled the
debate scenario. He rejected the bipartisan three-debate plan
agreed upon months ago by the Republican and Democratic National
Committees. He pulled a lame high school stunt by proposing that he
and Gore go on Larry King and NBC for talk-show chats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sneered at that. Other TV networks said no way would they
broadcast shows that boosted CNN and NBC. Bush then launched some
goofy negative ads claiming Gore was ducking debates. This gambit
made Bush look even more wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, the Bush camp was in disarray. Insiders were
admitting their debate ploys had backfired. Bush's year-long
derision aimed at ``Washington insiders'' and ``the Beltway
mentality'' has sparked friction with his Republican support in
Congress and in the K-Street lobbyists' canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's jittery pirouettes in the debate debate make him look
like a spoiled rich kid threatening to take his bat and ball and go
home. He stuck stubbornly to his game plan Thursday, appearing with
military heroes of his father's era. Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf
and Colin Powell each took Bush Jr. by the elbow and tried to
bolster him at an Ohio rally. But there is something out-of-phase
at seeing the two Desert Storm chieftans prop up Junior and promise
us the kid will make a terrific president. Most Americans think
``Dynasty'' is a soap opera, not a formula for picking presidents.
</P>
<P>
   And if he's such a rough and ready leader who talks tough, how
come Junior is ducking all these debates? Mr. ``Don't mess with
Texas!'' has been messing around with the debate commitments, and
made a mess of it in the process.
</P>
<P>
   He might have won points with voters by taking the plunge and
coming across as more folksy and down-home than Gore, says one
expert on the subject. Alan Schroeder, an assistant professor of
journalism at Northeastern and former TV producer, is author of the
just-published ``Presidential Debates: Forty Years of High-Risk
TV,'' from Columbia University Press. Bush has had ten debates
against GOP presidential contenders, but always with at least two
other candidates present.
</P>
<P>
   In his reelection for Texas governor, he limited his
badly &UR;  &LR; utgunned Democratic rival to one debate, in a remote El Paso
TV studio on a Friday night, with most voters watching football
games. And had Bush agreed to the debate commission format, said
Schroeder, he always had the right to negotiate or veto the format
and the moderator and the panelists, if any. Right now, it looks as
if the Texas gunslinger is nervous about walking up to the bar in
the Debate Saloon and ordering up a real drink.

MICROCHIP REUNITES OWNERS WITH MISSING DOG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga.)   By JULIA FERRANTE   The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ A dog named Jack showed up at an animal shelter
here this week. He wasn't talking, but a microchip implanted under
his skin told a surprising story.
</P>
<P>
   Jack, a Labrador mix, traveled a long way to get to Central
Florida. His owners, Luann and Allen Lane of Marietta, Ga., hadn't
seen the pup since late March, when, at 8 weeks old, he followed
their beagle, Barney, under the fence in their yard and disappeared
from the Atlanta suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Barney returned that day, but Jack never came back, Allen Lane
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How he got here we can only imagine,'' said Debbie Taylor,
director of operations in Lakeland for the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
</P>
<P>
   A couple who live in Mulberry found Jack about two weeks ago and
searched for his owner, but brought him to the SPCA when they came
up dry, Taylor said. Taylor said she routinely scans pets brought
into the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've reunited pets with their owners before, but never across
state lines,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Luann Lane speculated that a truck driver or someone who was
moving to Florida picked up Jack and kept him.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that since Jack left the Lanes, he had been neutered
and gained about 45 pounds. She thought it likely someone took him
in, brought him to a veterinarian and drove him to Florida. He
probably escaped again and was lost until the Mulberry couple found
him two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Lanes paid $4.95 to have the identifying chip implanted in
Jack when they adopted him from an Atlanta area animal shelter,
Luann Lane said. Animals adopted from shelters there are required
to have the implants in case they are lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a good idea, and as it turns out, it was a
great idea,'' Allen Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   When Jack disappeared, she reported the loss to the animal
shelter and the information was put out on a national network.
</P>
<P>
   When Taylor scanned Jack, the Lanes' information came up.
Although Jack had apparently been to a vet to be neutered,
veterinarians don't routinely scan pets brought in for treatment,
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who lost him may still be looking for him, but he's
registered to this couple in Georgia, so that's where he's going,''
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack is traveling back to Georgia with Luann's ex-husband, Steve
Engstrom, a computer salesman who happened to be in Florida doing
business in Tampa and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``He travels quite a bit, and Florida is part of his
territory,'' Allen Lane said. ``We called him and said, `You're
never going to believe what happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barney the beagle died about two weeks ago. He dug out of the
yard again and was hit by a car, Allen Lane said. The Lanes adopted
another dog, a cocker spaniel mix named Buddy, during their search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they get along,'' Luann Allen said. ``I think they
will. Jack won't know us, of course, but I'm really excited.''

INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY COULD LEAD TO LAYOFFS IN NEXT ECONOMIC
DOWNTURN

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With economic data pointing to a slowdown, it seems more and
more evident the Federal Reserve Board is piloting the economy to
the soft landing everyone has hoped for. The economy seems to be
slowing, but not stopping cold.
</P>
<P>
   But even the softest economic landing may be harder on American
workers than many people think. This is the view of James Paulsen,
chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in
Minneapolis, who fears that even a slight decline in economic
growth could translate to more severe job losses than have been
typical in previous downturns.
</P>
<P>
   Why might a slowdown be tougher on the labor force this time?
Because of the marvel of U.S. productivity, the very thing that has
allowed the economy to go full steam without creating inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we now herald as a miracle because it holds inflation
down becomes a nasty thing in a slowdown,'' Paulsen said. ``If your
productivity is as good in an economic slowdown as it is in an
expansion, it accelerates job losses because you can produce more
with even less.''
</P>
<P>
   Job creation has been slowing since 1997, when annual payroll
growth peaked at 2.5 percent. Today payrolls are rising by 1.8
percent, yet gross domestic product growth is red hot. ``If it only
takes 1.8 percent job growth to produce 6 percent real GDP
growth,'' Paulsen asked, ``could we end up in a situation where a
soft landing of 2 percent to 2.5 percent growth means jobs falling
by one- half or one percent a year?''
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen has studied the relationship of job creation and
economic growth since 1950 and found that even in difficult
economic times, job growth was much higher than it is today. For
instance, from 1980 through 1984, a period that included two
recessions, each percentage point increase in gross domestic
product growth translated to a 0.61 percent rise in job growth. But
since 1995, every percentage point rise in growth has resulted in
just 0.10 percent more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A soft landing could be painful for job growth. But since 1995,
every percentage point rise in economic growth has resulted in just
0.10 percent more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A soft landing could be painful for workers for other reasons.
In recent years, corporations have become obsessed with efficiency
gains. This mindset could change management behavior in a downturn,
Paulsen argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, companies would cut capital spending in an
economic slowdown,'' he said. ``But capital spending has become
efficiency spending and companies may decide to maintain capital
expenditures this time and cut the labor force instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger mania of recent years may also contribute to greater
than usual job losses if the economy slows. From the mid-1970s to
the mid-1990s, Paulsen points out, there were an average of 2,000
mergers and acquisitions a year. At this year's pace, 10,000 deals
may be done in 2000. ``If you hit a slowdown, you're going to find
out that all these merged companies have excess labor forces,'' he
said. Case in point for his argument is Qwest Communications
International Inc., which acquired U S West last June. On Thursday,
the company said it would eliminate 12,800 jobs by the end of 2001
and increase its capital spending to improve service and invest in
its core business.
</P>
<P>
   If consumers were in sounder financial shape, the job losses
that a slowdown might bring would not be so worrisome. But
installment debt and stock market margin debt carried by consumers
now are an astounding 24.5 percent of disposable personal income.
Between 1965 and 1995, this figure averaged 18.4 percent. It is off
the charts thanks to margin debt, which accounts for more than 3.5
percent of disposable income today, up from an average of 0.78
percent for the 30-year period ended in 1995. This debt load also
means that consumer spending could contract significantly,
exacerbating the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a slowdown in the economy is not yet certain.
Although Paulsen expects growth to average around 2 percent in the
next twelve months, others don't agree. Nevertheless, as Paulsen
points out, the productivity story has been a hugely positive one
in an expanding economy. Its potential impact in a contraction has
been largely ignored.

 &HT;    AARP SAYS BUSH, GORE MEDICARE PLANS BOTH UNDERFUNDED
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Both presidential candidates will need to put more
money into their proposed Medicare prescription drug plans before
they will satisfy the nation's largest elderly association, its
director said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a National Press Club luncheon, Horace B. Deets,
executive director of AARP, said passage of a Medicare prescription
drug benefit will be the organization's top legislative priority
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be aggressive. We will be forceful. And we will not
rest until all Medicare beneficiaries have access to adequate and
affordable prescription drug coverage as part of Medicare,'' Deets
said.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, AARP has
34 million members aged 50 and older and is considered one of the
most powerful lobbying organizations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although the non-partisan association has not endorsed the
prescription drug plan or the Social Security reform plan of either
Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, its
principles are closer to those expressed by Gore on both key
issues.
</P>
<P>
   AARP wants a voluntary prescription drug benefit that is a part
of Medicare, similar to the Part B program covering doctor bills in
which more than 95 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan does that. He proposes to create a voluntary
Medicare program paid for with a separate drug premium. When fully
implemented in 2008, it would cover half the cost of prescription
drugs up to $5,000 and all out-of-pocket prescription expenses
above $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of his prescription premium are about $25 a month.
That would be in addition to the Part B premium which is now $45.50
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would provide Medicare subsidies to enable
individuals to purchase competing private insurance plans. The
amount of the government subsidy would vary according to a
beneficiary's income. Benefits and costs would vary according to
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans would provide free benefits to low-income elderly.
Gore's plan would cost about $253 billion over 10 years; Bush's
plan would cost about $158 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Deets said AARP has not determined how much more money would be
needed to meet its goals, but it would be more than the amount
proposed by Gore. He said AARP would like to see combined premiums
for Part B and the new drug benefit in the $30 to $50 range.
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, Deets said AARP has a set of six principles
it would like to see incorporated into any reform. Among them, the
association prefers that individual savings accounts be established
as an addition to _ rather than a replacement of _ benefits
generated by the current system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would earmark a portion of the 12.4 percent payroll
tax used to finance Social Security to create individual investment
accounts. Those benefits would replace a portion of the guaranteed
Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would use the projected federal surplus to reduce the
federal debt and pledge that money toward future Social Security
reserves after 2037.
</P>
<P>
   While AARP does not endorse candidates, it has launched a major
effort to inform voters about candidate positions and urge them to
vote. Deets said about 70 percent of the association's 34 million
members are expected to vote this fall.

IF POLITICS IS THEATER, YOU HAVE TO PLAY TO THE CHEAP SEATS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In order to clinch his election as a Roman consul, Coriolanus
has only to master a bit of political theater. Shakespeare's
warrior has the support of the patrician class and the military
leaders; he has proved himself fearless in battle, magnanimous in
victory and unimpressed by flattery. Now all he must do is perform
a pro forma ritual: don a ``gown of humility'' and stand before the
plebeian populace, responding to the questions of their delegates,
courting their approval, displaying the scars of his many war
wounds as testimony to his worth.
</P>
<P>
   This public encounter _ an early form of the political
convention _ involves far less theatrical posturing and far fewer
inflated balloons than its more recent counterparts. But Coriolanus
so scorns Rome's common people that he is powerless on the
political playing field. He doesn't just fail, he flails.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for that failure seem particularly resonant in the
current political season, which is why it may not be an accident
that Shakespeare's rarely produced tragedy is attracting some
unusual attention. Saturday night, the Almeida Theater Company of
London will present ``Coriolanus'' at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music, beginning a two-week run.
</P>
<P>
   It is still fresh in my mind from a strikingly focused staging
last month by Tina Packer, the artistic director of Shakespeare &AMP;
Co., in Lenox, Mass. Packer has, over the years, created an
extraordinary company of players (which will, in a few years, be
acting on the stage of a newly planned replica of Shakespeare's own
Rose Theater); she used only nine actors for this production (some
playing multiple parts), staging battles and crowd scenes in a
small room that was once Edith Wharton's stable.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of pomp and circumstance _ and with a sharply etched
performance by Dan McClearly in the title role _ the play became an
elegant Shakespearean demonstration of what happens when patrician
and plebeian collide, when a world based on breeding and heroism
must answer to a world based on equality and representation.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare may have been drawn to this subject in the early
years of the 17th century because this was precisely the situation
developing in England. More and more people were surpassing the
minimum income required to vote, while James I was trying to retain
the perquisites of royalty. Riots erupted over grain shortages and
high prices. A citizen in ``Coriolanus'' mocks the notion that the
patricians are concerned about the common people:
</P>
<P>
   ``They ne'er cared for us yet. Suffer us to famish, and their
storehouses crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to support
usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act established against the
rich, and provide more statues daily, to chain up and restrain the
poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a context, it becomes all too clear what an insufferable
prig Coriolanus is, scorning the citizenry, comparing plebeians to
crows pecking at patrician eagles. If the crowd does seem a bit
fickle at times, or goes too far in demanding Coriolanus' death, he
is, after all, a representation of nobility's perversions, a
heartless killing machine presuming to fight for honor and nation.
The tragedy is that he can't recognize the power of the people for
whom he fought.
</P>
<P>
   This interpretation of ``Coriolanus'' may be the most tempting
one for contemporary directors because it most suits our own
democratic sentiments. There were times when Packer, despite her
larger vision, italicized these messages, and it will be surprising
if the Almeida Theater wields a different political brush. But
there are also antidemocratic elements of the play, which so
endeared it to the Nazis that it was banned in postwar Germany by
American occupation forces. In this reading, the ``garlic eaters''
among the scabby rabble, easily swayed by petty concerns, bring
down a virtuous man who is a ``flower of warriors,'' whose nature
is, as a friend proclaims, ``too noble for the world.'' The tragedy
here is that the worst of the people topple the best of the
nobility.
</P>
<P>
   We may tend to recoil from this view, yet perhaps we should not
just bury this noble Caesar but also praise him. For both of these
visions of ``Coriolanus'' are true. The play is about tensions that
continue to exist between democratic taste and elite sensibility in
American culture. Coriolanus' bravery, his lack of selfishness, his
allegiance to an ideal of nobility are inseparable from his
contempt for the commonplace. The people's human needs and just
claims are inseparable from their wary distrust of higher
aspirations. This is one reason the issue of political theater
becomes so crucial in the play: in a democratic universe, it is a
way in which each pole grants recognition to the other.
</P>
<P>
   This is vastly different from the political imagery in
Shakespeare's greatest tragedies, written just a few years earlier:
``King Lear,'' ``Hamlet,'' ``Macbeth,'' even ``Anthony and
Cleopatra.'' In those plays, the characters are still nestled in
patrician worlds. The issues are not the nature of nobility in a
democratic world but the nature of political power in a patrician
one. How is authority to be wielded? How is succession to be
guaranteed? How can private desires be reconciled with public
responsibilities? But with ``Coriolanus,'' Shakespeare has moved
on. The populace here is not the crowd of ``Julius Caesar''; for
all its flaws, it possesses a powerful voice in the future state.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that this is also a reason Shakespeare's conception of
character changed. Harold Bloom, in his recent ``Shakespeare: The
Invention of the Human,'' points out that in the great tragedies
Shakespeare created the modern soul, wracked by internal debates
and mercurial sentiments. Yet the hero in ``Coriolanus'' seems to
have no inner life whatsoever. It is almost irrelevant what he
feels or thinks; the only issue is how he acts (and acts in all
senses). The conflict is no longer internal to the character but
external; the boundaries of the political universe have changed.
</P>
<P>
   For better and worse, that universe is also our own. We require
theater but expect sincerity, seek equality but long for nobility,
disdaining what we also demand.

HONG KONG ELECTIONS FOCUS ON CITY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Law Hing shifted restlessly from one foot to the
other as he listened to the candidates trade accusations in a
debate at a housing project here this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are without integrity,'' he said, shaking his head
at the litany of supposed wrongdoing and chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   Well over 1 million people are expected to turn out for
legislative elections on Sunday, the second since Hong Kong
reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Many, like Law, 73, regard
voting as a civic duty and a hard-won privilege. But even though
this is the largest exercise in multiparty politics under Chinese
rule, Beijing has barely a walk-on role.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seizing the election as an opportunity to stand up
to China, most people here regard it as a chance to register their
dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong establishment. Hong Kong
politics, which in previous years throbbed with debates about
freedom and law, now revolve around seamier issues, like a party
boss who failed to disclose his business interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beijing factor is no longer important,'' said Lau Siu-kai,
a professor at the Chinese University here. ``China is perceived as
having withdrawn from local politics. But there is still a lot of
voter discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   People here blame the government for failing to lift Hong Kong
out of the Asian economic crisis more quickly. They say it has
careened from scandal to scandal under the hapless leadership of
Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate installed by Beijing as Hong
Kong's chief executive. The Legislature is seen as an ineffectual
body that carps about Tung, but offers no solutions of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tung's ties to Beijing, dissatisfaction with him has not
translated into unhappiness with China. In a new survey by Hong
Kong Baptist University, 63 percent of those polled approved of the
performance of the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, while only 32
percent approved of Tung.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a decline in optimism,'' said Michael DeGolyer, who
conducted the survey. ``But it seems to have more to do with how
Hong Kong's leaders are performing than with any supposed
interference from Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ebbing of China as a hot issue has scrambled Hong Kong's
political landscape. In 1998, when fears about Beijing were still
running high, the Democratic Party scored a resounding victory,
winning nearly half the directly elected seats in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But in district elections last year, the Democrats lost ground
to the main pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong. Its emphasis on the economy was more
appealing to voters in recession-ravaged Hong Kong than appeals to
democracy or civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, analysts predict that the Democratic Party
will hold on to its position _ but only because the pro-Beijing
party has been tarred by a scandal involving one of its founders.
</P>
<P>
   The party may also be hurt because of its coziness with Tung's
government. This week, Tung was on the defensive again after an
investigation concluded that one of his advisers had met with
officials at Hong Kong University to suppress opinion surveys
critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say this aggressively local election is a sign of
Hong Kong's political maturity. Left alone by Beijing, the former
British colony is behaving like any big city during campaign season
_ consumed by local disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But other commentators say the nasty tone in campaigning
reflects Hong Kong's stunted political culture, where only 24 of
the 60 members of the Legislature are directly elected.

   SRI LANKA: CENSORSHIP EASED
</P>
<P>
   With a general election due next month, the government has
temporarily eased some of its restrictions on the news media and
the holding of public meetings. Only war news will still face the
heavy censorship put in place by President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
Under those rules, virtually any criticism of the government was
illegal.

   With oil prices at their highest levels in a decade, Ralph

has announced that his government will mail each taxpayer two
rebate checks for $100, one in November and one in April. Noting

NEW DEVICE MAY PUT BRAKES ON ACCIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER  
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nervous NASCAR drivers, contemplating their return to New
Hampshire next week, hope to have a new safety device in place when
they get back to the track where two competitors died this year.
</P>
<P>
   The device, developed by Roush Racing, is a sensor that monitors
heat given off by the brakes. When the brakes are applied hard, the
sensor automatically kills the engine.
</P>
<P>
   It was tested before Darlington's Southern 500 by Jeff Burton,
one of five Roush Winston Cup drivers, and has generated a lot of
enthusiasm among those concerned about lessening the impact of a
car going into a wall because of a stuck throttle.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck throttles were blamed for crashes at New Hampshire
International Speedway that killed Winston Cup driver Kenny Irwin
July 7, and Busch driver Adam Petty May 12.
</P>
<P>
   After Irwin's wreck, NASCAR mandated engine kill buttons on the
steering wheel, hoping drivers could manually shut off the engine
when needed, and throttle stops to prevent the metal piece that
opens to allow fuel out of the carburetor from sticking in that
position.
</P>
<P>
   Neither worked last week at Darlington, S.C., when Bobby
Labonte's throttle stuck during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin, another Roush driver who is a strong proponent of
the brake sensor, said drivers don't have time to push a kill
button when the car is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that the driver can't be responsible for
shutting it off when it sticks wide open,'' Martin said, referring
to the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, NASCAR's chief operating officer, said the
sanctioning body had no objection to teams using the Roush sensor
on their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may see some of them voluntarily used in some of the races
soon,'' Helton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't stop someone from putting it in the cars right
now,'' he said. ``What you have, though, is a new element that has
to be thought through. And a competitor generally doesn't want to
put something brand new in a race car in a points battle.''
</P>
<P>
   After his wreck at Darlington, Labonte said he might not have
walked away uninjured if the accident had happened at New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important ... that we make sure that we're as safe as we
can be and feel as safe as we can,'' Labonte said. ``I can honestly
say that if this would have happened at New Hampshire, I don't
believe it would have turned out as good, just the way the track is
configured.''
</P>
<P>
   While most drivers endorsed the brake sensor, Rusty Wallace had
some reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``For it to work, you have to apply a whole lot of pressure to
the brakes, you've got to lock up all four tires,'' Wallace said.
``You have to mash the brake so hard you might blow out a tire. I
don't know if I want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, though, seems to represent the thinking of most drivers
who, at the very least, feel the Roush brake sensor can't hurt
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a real answer to the stuck throttles,'' Martin said.
``It still doesn't mean you won't wreck, but at least you won't
have the rear wheels pushing you into the wreck.''

   CLINTON-UN _ NEW YORK _ President Clinton wrapped up three days
of intensive diplomacy here Friday amid an air of diminishing
expectations, as the weight of unfinished business began to settle
on the shoulders of a world leader who's era is about to close.
With four months left in office, Clinton used this week's Millenium
Summit at the United Nations to begin bidding farewell to the
community of global leaders he's engaged with and, in many cases,
befriended over the past eight years. At almost every turn, though,
there were signs that key pieces of the vast global agenda Clinton
has crafted and pursued aren't likely to fal into place before he
leaves office in January. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service).

fair.'' His words are a lesson for me about work, dignity and

ONE YEAR LATER, SEE YOU AT THE POLE HAS RENEWED MEANING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JIM JONES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Some might expect members of Wedgwood
Baptist Church to cancel a See You at the Pole rally at their
church this year.
</P>
<P>
   After all, last year's rally at the Fort Worth church _ attended
by teens from many churches who had prayed at their schools'
flagpoles earlier in the day _ turned into a ghoulish catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   While 400 young people were singing and praising God last Sept.
15, a gunman carrying numerous rounds of ammunition walked into the
church _ and no one knows why he chose that church on that day.
</P>
<P>
   He first shot people who greeted him. Then he went into the
sanctuary and began firing. Some said he cursed Christianity. He
hurled a pipe bomb that exploded without hurting anyone at the
front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen people were wounded, seven of them fatally, before the
gunman, Larry Gene Ashbrook, for reasons unexplained, ended his
attack. He sat down in a back pew and shot himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last year's tragedy and lingering memories, church
leaders never considered calling off this year's event to culminate
the See You at the Pole observances at schools. The gathering is
scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Sept. 20 in the church sanctuary, and it
will be bigger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid,'' said Wedgwood youth minister Jay Fannin,
who led the 1999 rally. ``We believe God was in control last year,
and we believe he still is in control. We are going to trust God.''
</P>
<P>
   The same band that played last year _ Forty Days _ will perform
Sept. 20, even though some band members have memories of bullets
whizzing past them at last year's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Extra security will be in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police have been very cooperative, and we've told them about
the rally,'' Fannin said. ``Also, we have four or five police
officers who are members of our church.''
</P>
<P>
   See You at the Pole is a student-led, before-school prayer begun
in 1990 in nearby Burleson, Texas. Youths in all 50 states and more
than 20 countries on six continents participated in the prayer
event last year.
</P>
<P>
   See You at the Pole is more popular than ever, national
organizers say, thanks in part to the shootings at Wedgwood last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Fannin has received inquiries about Wedgwood's rally from youth
ministers of many churches. Some plan to bring their entire youth
groups to the Wedgwood rally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids are very excited about coming,'' Fannin said. ``They
are anxious to get their friends here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors of the shootings will also attend, but the focus
will be on the young people who will talk about prayer experiences
at their schools.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Noland, the See You at the Pole coordinator for
Discipleship Ministries in Burleson, said more people than ever are
calling and asking for T-shirts and other items his company
provides to promote the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe the tragedy at Wedgwood has turned into a
positive impact for See You at the Pole,'' Noland said. ``It has
shown more evidence for the need for prayer in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling outlawing public prayers
at football games has caused some confusion this year, Noland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some principals call and say they cannot participate
because of the football prayer ruling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the before-school prayers are legal if they are
student-initiated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which
campaigns against prayer in public schools, also believes that See
You at the Pole is a legal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law protects students who want to go to school early and
pray,'' said Steve Benen, an Americans United spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of students around the nation gather around
flagpoles on Sept. 20 to pray for the country, many will also lift
up prayers for those young martyrs for the faith who were shot at
Wedgwood.
</P>
<P>
   And many of us far past school age with lingering memories of
that peaceful summer night that turned into a nightmare will join
in those same prayers.

   BENNINGTON, Vt. _ Old cars are an integral part of the landscape
at Hemmings Motor News.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings, a monthly magazine chock-full of advertisements for
collectible cars, parts and related services, also owns a
collection of 78 old cars and trucks, a handful of them quite rare.
Of these, about 45 are registered, insured and capable of being
used on public roads.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the pampered cars in many collections, the
Hemmings fleet is actually driven _ in parades, for movie shoots
and, each summer, by journalists who come here for a day of deja vu
on the roads around Hemmings offices in what was once a schoolhouse
west of town.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is the pride of Terry Ehrich, 59, the publisher
and editor in chief of Hemmings and a major shareholder in its
parent company, Watering Inc. He and his brother, Perez, the vice
president for business operations, publish Hemmings and two other
car-related magazines, Special Interest Autos and the new Hemmings
Rods &AMP; Performance, along with an almanac, a host of car calendars
and related books. The company is branching out into Internet and
television ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The circulation of Hemmings, which looks like an 800-page phone
book, is about 260,000 copies a month. Special Interest Autos,
published six times a year, has a circulation of about 30,000,
Terry Ehrich said, and some 50,000 copies of Rods &AMP; Performance,
just out with its second issue, are being distributed, many of them
at car shows.
</P>
<P>
   In building the collection over the last two decades, Ehrich
said he had sought two basic types of cars: ``icons'' and ``the
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Icons, he said, are ``cars that people are going to drive by and
say, `My mom had a car just like that.''' So the collection has its
Mustang, a dark blue '66 convertible, and its Malibu, a red '69
convertible with a 396-cubic-inch V-8. The other category, ``the
unusual,'' also includes the ``small and cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most unusual car in the collection is a
teardrop-shaped two-door sedan, a 1934 McQuay-Norris. It is one of
two survivors of the six that were made and is the only one in
running condition, Ehrich said. Using Ford engines and drivetrains,
the cars were made as publicity vehicles for the McQuay-Norris
Manufacturing Co., an automotive parts maker. Hemmings shows it off
with the collection's most recent acquisition, a similarly shaped
aluminum camping trailer from the late 1940s, unrestored but in
reasonable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting the ``small and cute'' bill are a 1938 American Bantam
roadster; a 1950 Crosley Gasporter, a tiny tanker built for use at
small airports; and two minicars, a 1960 BMW Isetta and a 1966 King
Midget.
</P>
<P>
   The collection has several purposes, including advertising and
public relations. ``The first use of these vehicles is
visibility,'' Ehrich said, ``here at home at the office and
especially at our filling station, on the road and at car shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cars are displayed at an old-time filling station
that the company operates next to its headquarters in town. Several
cars and trucks are always on display at the station, and the two
service bays have become a sales floor for Hemmings publications,
model cars and clothing items. Out front, young attendants actually
pump gas, clean windshields and check the oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a leader in so many areas of this American life, Vermont
has outlawed billboards since sometime back in the '50s,'' Ehrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vehicles make good billboards.''
</P>
<P>
   They also send a message that cuts to the heart of what Hemmings
is all about _ preserving pieces of auto history. ``One of my
favorites, just in terms of putting our name out in a visible way,
is the 1934 Ford wrecker,'' Ehrich said. ``I just love to drive
that in a parade towing a slightly ratty Model A Ford.''
</P>
<P>
   Another purpose of the collection, Ehrich said, ``is to show
that Hemmings is an active participant in the hobby, not just a
publishing company making a living on the hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection is cared for by two consultants to Hemmings,
Justus Taylor and Jim Howe. Taylor, a tall and trim 60, is a former
leather craftsman, cinematographer and motorcycle racer for BMW who
now flies a vintage sailplane. Howe, a young-looking 53, lives near
Bennington on 20 acres that he calls However Wild Farm. He once
worked in a machine shop in Bennington and for a while repaired and
restored Volkswagen Beetles for resale.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is the collection's troubleshooter. He said: ``The thing
that I do best is to be able to analyze a problem _ `What is that
noise? Where is it coming from?' _ and to come up with a solution.
Then Jim and I get together, and the two of us equal three.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Howe's specialties is scouting prospective additions for
the collection. ``Quite a few people approach Hemmings about buying
their vehicles,'' he said. ``Selling it to Hemmings is sort of like
sending it to heaven. And if it's something that Terry decides he's
interested in, then I check it out. What I look for is what was it
like before it was restored. The first thing I do is slide under
the vehicle. I don't really care what the top looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   To make repairs, he often hunts for parts by telephone or
computer, as was the case with an ailing starter on a '58 Volvo 445
wagon. ``Today I learned that the starter's Bendix gear doesn't
exist in the U.S.,'' he said. ``So I've got to get on the Internet
and wade through some Swedish.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the public-relations and advertising functions.
``I also spend a fair amount of time helping Hemmings decide where
and when to use their vehicles,'' Howe said. That comes to some 50
to 75 events a year, he estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when dealing with old cars and trucks, a little
detective work is called for, along with mechanical skills. ``One
night I got a call from the Hemmings filling station that the tow
truck wouldn't start,'' Howe said. ``I got them to describe the
problem, and it sounded to me like it was out of gas. They said,
`No, we filled it.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he got to the station, Howe checked the gas tank, which is
under the passenger seat, and it was empty. But again, the
attendants insisted that they had filled the tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, how much did it take?''' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they said, `Oh, not much _ a couple of quarts.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `Show me where you put it.' Know where they had
put it? In the radiator.''

WAL-MART ACCUSED OF UNFAIR TACTICS IN GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Competition regulators accused Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. on Friday of being too competitive, and ordered the
giant retailer to raise its prices for household staples like milk,
flour, butter, rice and cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   The decision marks Wal-Mart's latest and strangest setback in
Germany, where it arrived two years ago with big plans to overwhelm
competitors through lower prices, better selections and friendly
store clerks.
</P>
<P>
   After months of investigation, Germany's federal cartel office
accused Wal-Mart of inciting a price war in which it and two German
supermarket chains had illegally sold products at below their
wholesale cost. In accusing them, the regulators said they wanted
to prevent Wal-Mart and other big chains from using ``unfair''
tactics to devastate smaller stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, which has bought and converted two German chains with
95 stores, ignited an intense price war when it began touting
aggressive price ``rollbacks'' last January. Big German retailers
like Metro AG and the privately-held Aldi chain fought back with
their own price reductions, creating intense pressure at a time
when German consumers were being persistently stingy about spending
money.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wal-Mart has had a surprisingly difficult time building
up its own business. The German operations lost money last year,
partly because of start-up costs but also because of tough
competition. Analysts say its biggest problem has been its
inability to acquire enough stores to duplicate its legendary
efficiency in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer the company was widely reported to be in acquisition
talks with Metro, Germany's biggest retailer, but Metro's
controlling shareholders then announced their determination not to
sell out.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Germany's big retailers have been straining under
the twin pressures of intense price competition and a persistent
refusal by German consumers to spend freely. The result has been
flat sales and depressed profits for most of the big retailers.
Metro has been one of Germany's worst-performing blue-chip stocks
in the past year, and the pressure on smaller companies scattered
through hundreds of smaller towns has been even more severe.
</P>
<P>
   In its action Friday, the German cartel office accused Wal-Mart
along with Lidl Markets and Aldi Nord of what amounts to predatory
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefit to consumers is marginal and temporary, while the
damage to competition through illegal obstruction of small and
medium-sized companies is lasting and significant,'' said Ulf
Boege, director of the Federal Cartel Office.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were unsure whether Friday's action would severely
restrict Wal-Mart from competing aggressively on prices. They noted
that the cartel office raised objections against only 19 products,
six of them sold by Wal-Mart and the others by its rivals. Though
most of them are staple products that are important components of
most families' regular shopping, they are still a tiny share of the
thousands of products that each store sells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to say what the effect will be, because you
have to know what the percentage of total sales are involved,''
said Matthias Reschke, a retailing analyst at Salomon Smith Barney
in London.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the case highlights the sharp contrast between German and
U.S. notions of competition, at least when it comes to stores.
</P>
<P>
   German law is heavily tilted toward protecting small shopkeepers
in the thousands of small towns scattered across the country.
Despite widespread unhappiness among many shoppers, federal laws
still prohibit most stores from staying open past 8 p.m. on
weekdays or opening at all on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of popular complaints about the restrictions,
which have been championed by small shop-owners, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder dismissed proposals last week that would have liberalized
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, stores in most smaller towns do not even stay open as
long as they are allowed to under current rules. Instead, local
shopkeepers in scores of communities have gotten together and, like
minicartels, reached an agreement among themselves to close at 6
p.m. on weekdays and 2 p.m. on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   German competition laws also prohibit a wide variety of discount
and rebate plans. Though stores routinely post signs touting
``special offers'' and ``30 percent off,'' companies are prohibited
from offering discounts to people who sign up for ``frequent
flyer'' or other loyalty programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Wal-Mart and its rivals, government officials
charged that the price wars were little more than a trick to lure
customers from one store to another with temporary bargains that
would soon disappear.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time German authorities have actually
concluded that retailers were selling products at below their own
purchase costs. Given the complexity of bargains struck between big
retailers and their suppliers, such cases are usually difficult to
prove. The cartel office opened investigations of several other big
retailers earlier this year, but dropped the cases after deciding
that the reductions were justified.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart reacted cautiously to Friday's decision. In a brief
statement, the company said it would ``orient our pricing in the
line of these recommendations.'' But it also insisted that it would
``remain committed to lowering the cost of living in Germany'' and
would ``fully utilize the benefits of our merchandising system in
order to continue to pass on savings to customers.''

<P>
   OLY-RUN-JONES (Undated) _ As Marion Jones tells the story, she
was an 8-year-old in Southern California when the Olympics first
entered her head like a song that would not leave. Her family drove
to see the Olympic torch as the relay made its way to the 1984
Summer Games in Los Angeles. Back at home that same night, she went
into her room and wrote on a chalkboard, ``I want to be an Olympic
champion.'' Sixteen years later, at the 2000 Summer Games in
Sydney, Australia, Jones is attempting to become the first woman to
win five gold medals in track and field at the same Olympics. By

   OLY-VECSEY-COLUMN (Sydney, Australia) &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; This is an awesome
task for the athletes. They must save the Olympic movement. They
must also wrest the focus back from the sleaze merchants who
connived under the cover of the five rings. They must leap over
time zones, break down the artificiality of the taped television
broadcasts, get past the greed and the stuffiness of the
International Olympic Committee. The next weeks belong to the
athletes, now arriving in Australia from all over the world. By
George Vecsey. 1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SWM-THORPE (Sydney, Australia) &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; In a country where
swimming is the most popular Olympic sport, where important meets
draw prime-time television exposure and exorbitant ratings, it is a
17-year-old named Ian Thorpe who has Australia entranced. The very
first evening of the Sydney Olympics, the whole of Australia will
be captivated by this 6-foot-5 inch, 210-pound teen-ager with size
17 feet, who will swim the 400-meter freestyle to win a gold medal,
and perhaps to lower his own world record of 3 minutes 41.33
seconds. The Thorpedo, as he is known, is also favored in the 200
freestyle _ his world record is 1:45.41 _ and he will swim for a
third gold in the 800-meter freestyle relay. By Jere Longman. 1,700
words.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OLY-GYM-KAROLYI (Undated) _ Normally, the effusive Bela Karolyi
rambles on in glorious hyperbole but in such a thick Transylvanian
accent, a toy decoder ring is required to untangle his words. But
after watching Shannon Miller's comeback end at the Olympic Trials
last month with an inglorious fall, and witnessing three other top
gymnasts take spills on the balance beam, Karolyi was short on
words in Boston. The finish to the trials in mid-August seemed to
unnerve Karolyi. Once the national team coordinator announced the
Olympic team _ which included two former members of the 1996 gold
medal team, Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes _ he quickly discussed the
difficult subjective selection process and exited the room. ``We
can contend for a medal,'' said Karolyi as he departed. ``We have
to work.'' By Selena Roberts. 900 words.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BKW-EDWARDS (Undated) _ At age 36, Teresa Edwards, the
veteran point guard of Team USA, is tired. But Edwards is also
unbent. ``At this point, I can ride the boat or drive it,'' she
said. ``It doesn't matter. I just want to win.'' By Mike Wise.

</P>
<P>
   OLY-RUN-FREEMAN (Sydney, Australia) _ Cathy Freeman, Australia's
most prominent athlete and most prominent Aborigine has been
running fast enough to win medals and generate headlines since she
was 11 and newspaper reporters in her hometown of Mackay dubbed her
``wonder girl.'' On the evening of Sept. 25, the date of the 400
final in Sydney, she will be _ barring injury _ the favorite: both
on paper and in the hearts and minds of the Australian fans whose
interest in and connection with Freeman made this the first session
of track and field to sell out. By Christopher Clarey. 2,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-TV-COLUMN (Undated) _ NBC will tape every minute of the
Sydney Games and package the best for a five-hour prime-time show.
All of NBC's morning and late-night coverage will be taped, as will
everything on CNBC and MSNBC. In essence, NBC will show you what it
believes you want to see. NBC even has minute-by-minute surveys
that prove what you want and that you surf away when you're shown
what you don't want. So if you don't like what you see at 10:45
p.m., you must not be in the majority or maybe nobody surveyed you.

   CONCESSIONS FOR MERGER
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the European Commission said Friday that America
Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc. have proposed concessions in their
attempt to overcome European antitrust objections to their merger.
``There have been undertakings,'' said Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman
for Mario Monti, Europe's commissioner in charge of competition
affairs. European officials refused to say what the proposed
concessions were or whether they would be sufficient, but industry
executives think AOL may have offered to strengthen its earlier
proposal to limit its ties to Bertelsmann AG, the German media

   Canada's unemployment rate jumped to 7.1 percent in August from

that has raised concerns about the strength of the economy. An
estimated 27,000 jobs were added in August, but more than three
times as many people joined the workforce. The influx of
job-seekers is a sign of confidence, economists said. But they
noted that the number of new jobs in August did not make up for the
31,000 lost in June and July _ and that last month's additions were
mostly part-time positions. The gain in full-time work during the
past six months has been 0.2 percent.

   ANGLO AMERICAN PROFIT IS UP
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by increased platinum prices and growing demand for
diamonds, Anglo American PLC, the world's biggest mining company,
said its first-half profit rose by 77 percent to $951 million. The
increase outstripped both analysts' forecasts and the performance
of British-base rivals Billiton PLC and Rio Tinto PLC. Analysts
attributed the demand for Anglo's mining products and for the
diamonds mined by De Beers, in which Anglo holds about one-third of
the stock to booming economic conditions in the United States.
Anglo shares rose three percent to 4,117 pence. The company is in
the throes of an overhaul, selling off non-core businesses while
expanding its mining and forest products divisions.

   JAPANESE BOND DOWNGRADE
</P>
<P>
   Moody's downgraded yen-denominated Japanese government bond to
Aa2 from Aa1. The rating agency cited the government's highest
ratio of debt as a percentage of gross domestic product among the
leading economies and uncertainty over Japan's economic recovery.
The rating announcement caused a sell-off of stocks and bonds for a
brief period, but they recovered.

section on Monday, Sept. 11. Stories for that section will move
Friday thru Monday from The New York Times News Service, in the

</P>
<P>
   OLY-RUN-JONES (Undated) _ As Marion Jones tells the story, she
was an 8-year-old in Southern California when the Olympics first
entered her head like a song that would not leave. Her family drove
to see the Olympic torch as the relay made its way to the 1984
Summer Games in Los Angeles. Back at home that same night, she went
into her room and wrote on a chalkboard, ``I want to be an Olympic
champion.'' Sixteen years later, at the 2000 Summer Games in
Sydney, Australia, Jones is attempting to become the first woman to
win five gold medals in track and field at the same Olympics. By
Jere Longman. 3,000 words.

   OLY-VECSEY-COLUMN (Sydney, Australia) &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; This is an awesome
task for the athletes. They must save the Olympic movement. They
must also wrest the focus back from the sleaze merchants who
connived under the cover of the five rings. They must leap over
time zones, break down the artificiality of the taped television
broadcasts, get past the greed and the stuffiness of the
International Olympic Committee. The next weeks belong to the
athletes, now arriving in Australia from all over the world. By
George Vecsey. 1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SWM-THORPE (Sydney, Australia) &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; In a country where
swimming is the most popular Olympic sport, where important meets
draw prime-time television exposure and exorbitant ratings, it is a
17-year-old named Ian Thorpe who has Australia entranced. The very
first evening of the Sydney Olympics, the whole of Australia will
be captivated by this 6-foot-5 inch, 210-pound teen-ager with size
17 feet, who will swim the 400-meter freestyle to win a gold medal,
and perhaps to lower his own world record of 3 minutes 41.33
seconds. The Thorpedo, as he is known, is also favored in the 200
freestyle _ his world record is 1:45.41 _ and he will swim for a
third gold in the 800-meter freestyle relay. By Jere Longman. 1,700
words.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OLY-GYM-KAROLYI (Undated) _ Normally, the effusive Bela Karolyi
rambles on in glorious hyperbole but in such a thick Transylvanian
accent, a toy decoder ring is required to untangle his words. But
after watching Shannon Miller's comeback end at the Olympic Trials
last month with an inglorious fall, and witnessing three other top
gymnasts take spills on the balance beam, Karolyi was short on
words in Boston. The finish to the trials in mid-August seemed to
unnerve Karolyi. Once the national team coordinator announced the
Olympic team _ which included two former members of the 1996 gold
medal team, Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes _ he quickly discussed the
difficult subjective selection process and exited the room. ``We
can contend for a medal,'' said Karolyi as he departed. ``We have
to work.'' By Selena Roberts. 900 words.  &QL;

<P>
   OLY-BKW-EDWARDS (Undated) _ At age 36, Teresa Edwards, the
veteran point guard of Team USA, is tired. But Edwards is also
unbent. ``At this point, I can ride the boat or drive it,'' she
said. ``It doesn't matter. I just want to win.'' By Mike Wise.

</P>
<P>
   OLY-RUN-FREEMAN (Sydney, Australia) _ Cathy Freeman, Australia's
most prominent athlete and most prominent Aborigine has been
running fast enough to win medals and generate headlines since she
was 11 and newspaper reporters in her hometown of Mackay dubbed her
``wonder girl.'' On the evening of Sept. 25, the date of the 400
final in Sydney, she will be _ barring injury _ the favorite: both
on paper and in the hearts and minds of the Australian fans whose
interest in and connection with Freeman made this the first session
of track and field to sell out. By Christopher Clarey. 2,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-TV-COLUMN (Undated) _ NBC will tape every minute of the
Sydney Games and package the best for a five-hour prime-time show.
All of NBC's morning and late-night coverage will be taped, as will
everything on CNBC and MSNBC. In essence, NBC will show you what it
believes you want to see. NBC even has minute-by-minute surveys
that prove what you want and that you surf away when you're shown
what you don't want. So if you don't like what you see at 10:45
p.m., you must not be in the majority or maybe nobody surveyed you.

&HT;     GOP LAUNCHES TV ATTACK ON GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican Party rallied to help GOP nominee George W. Bush
on Friday with a blistering televised attack on Democrat Al Gore
that said the vice president cannot be trusted to strengthen public
schools because of his role in the Clinton-Gore fund raising
scandal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Republican chairman Jim Nicholson said the GOP advertisement _
to be broadcast in Pennsylvania and Michigan _ cites Gore's role in
a fund-raising scheme that led to the indictment of 22 people and
Gore's new emphasis on campaign finance reform. The combination is
evidence that the vice president can't be trusted when he talks
about education, according to Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For eight years now, Al Gore has shown that he's a man whose
words must be questioned _ no matter what the topic is,'' Nicholson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of the 30-second spot says: ``Now Al Gore's
promising more accountability in our schools. And that sounds good.
Until you find out he doesn't require any testing. And no testing
means no accountability. Just more politics from Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway said the GOP ad on behalf
of Bush was a ``desperate'' personal attack that showed that when
Bush has his back ``against the wall, he'll do anything to get
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore have offered plans to strengthen
locally-supervised public education with federal assistance and use
testing to hold local authorities' accountable for students'
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway challenged GOP efforts to raise questions about Gore's
fund-raising activities, insisting that the vice president had
``never been found to have done anything illegal'' during $50
million worth of taxpayer-financed investigations into the
Clinton-Gore fund-raising effort in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who now trails Gore in the latest national surveys, had
vetoed an earlier GOP ad that challenged Gore's ethics. The latest
ad is similar to another ad raising questions about Gore's
credibility; that ad is being broadcast in seven other states.
</P>
<P>
   The new GOP campaign ad hit the television airwaves as Bush
overhauled campaign tactics to allow greater direct contact with
voters in line with a new slogan, ``real plans for real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the prospects for Gore-Bush debates appeared brighter
after representatives of the two candidates announced plans to meet
with the unofficial Commission on Presidential Debates to work out
details for debates. The commission has proposed three presidential
debates in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turn on a dime,'' Bush boasted, adding that meeting with
voters was ``what I'm good at ... I like interfacing with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent more than an hour politicking face-to-face with
Marconi Communications workers at a factory cafeteria in
Warrendale, Pa. ``When you get in that (voting) booth, remember who
came by,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, flanked by several dozen motorcycle police officers who
had escorted his motorcade, thanked the 290,000-member Fraternal
Order of Police for endorsing his White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have a friend in the White House,'' Bush said of an
organization that backed Clinton-Gore re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the incumbent vice president, continued his efforts to
seize the role as the candidate of change. The 24-year veteran of
Washington told students at Delgado Community College in New
Orleans that his proposed 10-year, $36 billion tax break for
college tuition showed ``the right set of priorities'' to enable 75
percent of America's high school graduates to pursue higher
education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore left it to Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe
Lieberman to go after Bush with some of the harshest criticism of
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a 12-year veteran of the Senate, accused the two-term
governor of Texas of leaving 1.2 million children without health
insurance and fighting state legislation that would have extended
health coverage to 220,000 children last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``may say that he has a plan to improve children's health
across America,'' Lieberman said, adding: ``Why hasn't he done it
in Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said a Gore-Lieberman administration would fight to
guarantee access to health care coverage to all children by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said Lieberman was ``distorting and
misrepresenting'' Bush's record as the state's two-term governor,
adding: Lieberman had become ``the attack dog surrogate for Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said that Bush had expanded health care coverage for
children in Texas at a time when the Clinton-Gore administration
had allowed 2.4 million more children to join the ranks of the
uninsured since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   GOP vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney, campaigning in New
England in a bid to raise questions about the Gore-Lieberman team
in and around Lieberman's native Connecticut, got sidetracked into
answering questions about failing to vote in 14 of the 16 elections
that took place in Texas since he registered to vote in Dallas in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elections that Cheney missed was the Texas
presidential primary in March in which he could have voted for
Bush, his future running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former defense secretary and 10-year member of
Congress from Wyoming, said that extensive business travel as chief
executive of the oil services firm Halliburton Corp., had prevented
him from voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I traveled a great deal,'' Cheney explained. ``Dallas was my
base. That's where I lived or was headquartered, but I was not
involved in community affairs very extensively in Dallas. My focus
was on global concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic party spokeswoman Jennifer Backus seized upon the
revelation of Cheney's voting record that first appeared in the
Dallas Morning News to wonder: ``If Cheney didn't vote for Bush,
why should the rest of America?''

IT DOESN'T LOOK A DAY OVER 30 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 10)  
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I invited friends to dinner recently at La
Caravelle, one asked plaintively: Was she allowed to wear pants?
</P>
<P>
   I laughed, until I spent a morning with the scrapbooks the
restaurant's original owners, Robert L. Meyzen and Fred Decre, had
kept since its debut on Sept. 21, 1960. I realized then that my
friend has a long memory. An article in The New York Times dated
Oct. 7, 1968, titled ``Even the Restaurateurs Concede That Pants
Are Fashionable,'' read in part: ``Robert Meyzen of La Caravelle,
who has long frowned on pants `because very few women wear them
handsomely,' said with resignation: ``This is going to be the
fashion this winter. You can't avoid it. If the woman is young,
elegant and well-groomed, personally, I don't feel there's anything
wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later Meyzen officially surrendered on the issue of
pants, telling The Times, ``At first we didn't allow them, but we
are here to serve food, not to buck the trend of fashion.'' Though
he added sternly, ``We don't allow turtlenecks.''
</P>
<P>
   That contretemps was second only to another revolutionary
moment, in 1963, when The New York Journal-American published an
article called ``Missing Millinery,'' which recorded sightings of
Pauline Trigere and Elizabeth Arden daring to go hatless at
Pavillon, while at La Caravelle, ``the same hatlessness prevailed''
among editors from Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. Mon Dieu!
</P>
<P>
   La Caravelle, which opened with a $5.50 prix fixe lunch and
$7.50 dinner, celebrates its 40th anniversary this month. A New
York institution, it has stood as a marker of a bygone era of
glamour. But rather than settling into dinosaur status, it has
actually hung around long enough to be back in style again. While
the older crowd continues its patronage (Brooke Astor, Geoffrey
Beene and Oscar de la Renta among them), the next generations are
booking tables, too. In a fashion season smitten with the trappings
of uptown chic, the younger set is seeing La Caravelle not as stiff
but as Old World charming. They are happy to dress up and play
Paris for an evening out.
</P>
<P>
   Or an afternoon. Last week at lunch, I watched Alexandra Lind, a
30-year-old fashion designer whose cocktail dresses sell at Searle
and whose bridal gowns sell at Bergdorf Goodman's, with three other
women, bringing the median age in the room down by half. Honoring
the tradition of the fashionable women who have always frequented
La Caravelle _ Babe Paley and the Duchess of Windsor among them _
they were dressed to the teeth, complete with the new bowling-ball
bags, barely in stores yet. It was the first time Lind had been
back since she was 15. ``I was pleasantly surprised,'' she said.
``It was a really warm atmosphere and felt very youthful, not
overly formal at all. I liked the intimacy of it. You can really
talk to people. And hear them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Jammet, who with her husband, Andre, became owners of La
Caravelle in 1988, says they have attracted younger diners by
steering away from stuffiness with an attitude they call ``friendly
formality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out of favor at some point, but the pendulum swings
again and the next generation is attracted to us,'' Jammet
(pronounced jah-MAY) said. ``We are trying to bring back the idea
of hospitality, not give the feeling, `Are you good enough to come
in here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Though the phrase friendly formality sounds lifted from a
marketing textbook, I did see it in practice at two meals last
week. Women were stylishly dressed (even in pants), with the
exception of one who dashed in at lunch wearing khakis and a black
tank top, took one look around her and seemed sorry she did.
Jackets are required for men, though ties are optional, and also
required is a decorum that disqualifies the packs of marauding
traders who seem to frequent steakhouses _ at least every time I'm
eating at one. As Jammet put it, ``We try to maintain a civility
here. Yes, it's wonderful to be young and social and up-and-coming,
but you still have to maintain a certain gentleness with
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday night of Labor Day weekend, the restaurant was
surprisingly full, with a wine-tasting dinner under way in a
private room. The few cell phone users didn't shout; a man
escorting a Catherine Zeta-Jones look-alike looked askance at
something on his plate, and it was immediately whisked away; and if
I ever raised my glance, a waiter was instantly at my side. I admit
it. I liked being taken care of. My oysters came accompanied by
small pieces of bread that had already been buttered. I started to
feel my shoulders come down from around my ears and settle back
where they belong.
</P>
<P>
   That the restaurant looks good helps. It is lauded for its
pastoral murals, painted by Jean Pages, a student of Raoul Dufy;
the Jammets replaced the original red velvet banquettes with peach,
to highlight them further. This ensures that what Holiday magazine
wrote in 1964 still holds: La Caravelle ``is so flatteringly lit
that it turns aunts into nieces and sugar daddies into gigolos.''
Certainly, by the time our dinner ended, we felt as if we had been
on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that feeling comes from the sense of time travel. The
Jammets have divided the menu between classic (quenelles, Dover
sole) and contemporary (tuna carpaccio), and it's a flashback to
childhood (the good parts) watching someone carving a roast duck
tableside.
</P>
<P>
   The other lift is dining surrounded by history. For starters,
the bar, tucked away in the back, heralds the room's early days as
a speak-easy. Then there are the ghosts of diners past. For its
inaugural year alone, the restaurant's reservation book included
Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, Cecil Beaton, Mainbocher, Otto Preminger
and Harry Winston. When President Kennedy was elected, the White
House chef, Rene Verdon, was selected and trained by La Caravelle's
chef, Roger Fessaguet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there were bad times, too. The recession of the early 1970s
hurt the restaurant, as did the switch in Broadway curtain times
from 8:30 to 8:00, cutting into the traditional dinner hour. By
1978, Mimi Sheraton demoted La Caravelle to two stars in The New
York Times, down from Craig Claiborne's four.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period before Andre and Rita took over where you
didn't know if the restaurant would survive,'' said Tim Zagat,
publisher of the Zagat Surveys. ``Our survey has measured that the
demographic is younger than it used to be and the restaurant is
definitely more popular.'' (The chef, Cyril Renaud earned three
stars from The Times in 1998. He left in April; his sous-chef, Eric
Di Domenico, who trained at Taillevent, has taken over.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the food is still wonderful, customers, young and old,
rave about the Jammets' particular brand of hospitality. His father
founded the Bristol Hotel in Paris, and he worked here as an
assistant manager at the Regency; Jammet was at the French Embassy.
They bought La Caravelle just as a recession hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about our bubble bursting,'' Jammet said. They hired a
public relations firm that mandated modernization, designing a
(short-lived) corporate-looking logo. ``It took away all the
charm,'' Jammet said. The changes they did make included hiring the
Japanese chef Tadashi Ono. ``Even though he had French training,
that was considered revolutionary,'' Jammet said. He is now at Sono
on East 57th Street, which the Jammets own with Larry Goldenberg of
Gramercy Tavern.
</P>
<P>
   So, they know what modern is. But when it comes to La Caravelle,
they still will go only so far in forsaking anything that might be
considered old-fashioned. ``If we decide tomorrow to be hip and
downtown,'' Jammet said, ``the new people wouldn't know us. And the
older ones wouldn't want to.''

MORE DARK SECRET IN `ARROGANCE'
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   He's been dead for six years, but we still have Richard Nixon to
kick around. And no matter how bad we thought he was when he was
alive, new evidence keeps cropping up to suggest he was even worse.
</P>
<P>
   First came the release of a smattering of some of the metric
tons of Watergate tapes, collected exhaustively _ and sometimes
exhaustingly _ in Stanley Kutler's ``Abuse of Power.'' The book
basically underscored what we already knew _ the guy was paranoid
and venal _ and introduced a little anti-Semitism for bad measure.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard
Nixon,'' Anthony Summers' book redrafted into The History Channel's
``Time Machine'' documentary ``Nixon: The Arrogance of Power,''
which opens several new shocking cans of worms. The new
Nixon-bashing entries even provide an answer to that vexing
question _ with Nixon's re-election a lock, why did he need to send
goons to break into Democratic National Headquarters at the
Watergate?
</P>
<P>
   This may be a slag job, but it's a meticulously researched slag
job (a thousand interviews were conducted for Summers' book), and
tonight's special has many of Nixon's closest allies (Henry
Kissinger, James Schlesinger, John Sears (who was recently ID'd _
incorrectly, he claims _ as Deep Throat in yet another new Nixon
book), along with Jack Dreyfuss, Nixon's drug supplier, all
speaking ill of the dead. So one would have to reach pretty far to
question its credibility (which the Nixon Library has done).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the revelations are simply troubling: As vice president,
Nixon secretly consulted with a therapist, who later wrote a New
York Times op-ed piece recommending national leaders undergo
psychiatric scrutiny before being handed the reins to the country).
He later abused pills and alcohol in the Oval Office: Smashed one
night, he ordered Kissinger, apropos of nothing, to bomb Damascus;
Kissinger ignored him and nothing was said of it the next morning.
Others are chilling: Evidence strongly suggests he was physically
abusive to his wife, Pat.
</P>
<P>
   And one discovery is mind-boggling: In order to ensure his
ascendancy to the presidency, Nixon actually interfered with
Vietnam peace negotiations, then reneged on promises made to the
Vietnamese when his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, got wise to his
chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, of course, was devastating: Americans languished in
Vietnam for another four years; an additional 20,000 more young men
were killed and 111,000 wounded. The icy disdain with which the
filmmakers note his ironic epitaph _ ``The greatest honor history
can bestow is the title of peacemaker'' _ is as brutal as a
presidential biography can get.
</P>
<P>
   But the filmmakers go a step further, suggesting that Nixon
feared that the information Johnson had on him was in the files of
the Brookings Institute _ which he ordered broken into _ and,
ultimately, DNC's Watergate offices. His downfall is portrayed in a
painfully protracted fashion; Defense Secretary Schlesinger
actually feared Nixon might use the military to maintain his grip
on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrogance of Power'' suggests that Ronald Reagan's October
Surprise _ delaying the release of American hostages in Iran _ and
Contragate were simple indiscretions, and that Bill Clinton's
scandal was the equivalent of fibbing after a schoolboy prank. The
filmmakers unearthed some great archival footage, played in
slow-motion, of Nixon approaching and then towering over a camera,
a maniacal sneer pasted on his face. In this context, it's truly
enough to give you nightmares. &QL; 
---The show: ``Nixon: The Arrogance of Power.'' &QL; 
What: ``Time Machine'' documentary about the former president's
most venal tricks. &QL; 
Where: The History Channel. &QL; 
When: 9 tonight; also Sept. 16. &QL;

<P>
   With all due respect to Rudy Boesch, Sue Hawk and the other
``Survivors,'' you guys are wimps. ``Castaway 2000,'' an ongoing
series from the British Broadcasting Corp. debuting today on BBC
America, plunked 36 men, women and children on a remote, gorgeous
island off the coast of Scotland that, due to its severe
conditions, has been deserted since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   These intrepid souls (or crazies, depending on your point of
view) are spending a full year on Taransay. No one gets voted off.
Jeff Probst and his tiki torches are a hemisphere away (thank
heaven!). And, most shocking of all, !ital!no one's doing it for a
big cash prize or, to look at all but one of them, a potential
media career when it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Were it on a network, ``Castaway 2000'' would become as big a
sensation as ``Survivor.'' Even on BBC America, it has a chance of
winning more converts than ``Big Brother.'' These first four
episodes being unveiled this week scarcely make it to the official
beginning of the great experiment, and yet each of them has more
conflict and intrigue than ``Big Brother'' looks to muster in its
entire run. Think Leonardo Di Caprio's vehicle ``The Beach,'' only
with bad teeth and worse weather.
</P>
<P>
   This first week of episodes seems, in a way, more a tease than
actual programming, especially since there's very little material
based on the island, but the material still manages to impress.
We're shown the grueling, ``Survivor''-style auditions of some 50
or so finalists (out of more than 4,000 applicants) to pare the
cast down to a small society, filled with leaders and followers,
nice guys and arrogant jerks, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the claims aren't too earth-shattering: The castaways
will get very depressed, stressed and put out with one another,
we're told. (And that's different from regular real life in
!ital!what way?) But at least the sundry experts on hand here _ a
psychologist and a survival trainer named (no joke!) Lofty Wiseman
(he looks like the sort of guy sea chanteys are written about _
again, no joke) _ offer fairly honest and unflattering assessments
of those trying out, not the sort of timid, meaningless drivel that
Dr. Drew and that freaky Internet lady routinely disgorge on ``Big
Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the first three episodes is given over to the
competitions used to weed out the weaklings or the simply
unpalatable applicants _ obstacle courses, animal wrangling (and
neck-wringing), hut-building _ and the incessant bickering that
results when the alpha males throw their weight around.
</P>
<P>
   Here we see folks shoveling a mountain of excrement (no, not
``Big Brother'' episodes on tape) simply to see if they can stomach
it _ the rationale given is that the island's septic system is
likely to be faulty. Applicants are asked if they're squeamish
about killing animals. One seems to have bloodlust in his eyes;
another replies, ``Is that after I've had sex with it?''
</P>
<P>
   CBS this isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth episode offers different sorts of tensions, as
castaways gripe about their contracts, the deadline to complete
some of the living quarters on the island is blown and a few crates
of the participants' belongings are accidentally destroyed,
inspiring rebellion (including from the island's lone doctor)
before the show's premise even kicks off.
</P>
<P>
   But as opposed to ``Big Brother,'' whose decision-makers seem
shockingly resolute to keep anything of interest off the air _ for
one thing, those airplane banners tormenting houseguests, or the
participants' near mass-walkout after being forced to perform a
``roast'' _ ``Castaway'' almost relishes airing its dirty laundry,
and in wicked winds that reach up to 140 miles per hour on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a heartthrob has been born: Ben Fogle (who now receives
sacks full of fan mail while still residing on the island), a hunky
photo editor who is that rarity _ a sensitive yet heroic leader
with a kind sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   More favorites are sure to follow. Like other ``reality'' shows,
``Castaway 2000'' has a kitschy feel to it at times, and some of
the TV producers' bad luck streak has a ``Big Brother'' vibe to it.
But given the stakes _ many in England don't expect these survivors
to endure the entire stretch, even without goofy tribal banishment
ceremonies _ it'll be a microcosm of society worth keeping an eye
on. &QL;

<P>
   Amy Correia got a thumbs-up as one-fourth of the Girls Room
tour.
</P>
<P>
   A full U.S. tour, the free show was a way to introduce
up-and-coming artists such as Correia.
</P>
<P>
   Now the singer with the bittersweet voice and well-spun tunes to
match is setting out on her own with a tour in support of her debut
album, ``Carnival Love,'' set for release Sept. 26 on Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every song on the record reads like a brief moment taken
from Correia's experience as a small town girl living in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Born in a small town in southeastern Massachusetts, Correia
dreamed of living in New York like her cousins who came to visit
every summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started talking to me like, `God doesn't exist,' '' she
says. ``And I think they really sparked my interest in seeing what
was outside of my town.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Correia left for college in
New York City. But a back injury a couple of years later got her
sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Bedridden for two months, she used the time to write songs on a
guitar she bought her last year in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used a how-to-play-guitar book to remind myself how these
chords went and to learn things like `Leaving on a Jet Plane,' ''
she says with a laugh. ``You know, all the big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Correia is making her own hits.
</P>
<P>
   And she does it with a voice reminiscent of Rickie Lee Jones,
although she says she stumbled upon her sound by mimicking a number
of voices.
</P>
<P>
   Correia learned to sing by listening to records by singers such
as Ray Charles, Billie Holiday and Mick Jagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny because I don't think I write songs like the
Stones, but I love the Stones,'' she says. ``I love the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   And because she loved singing, Correia began writing songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think going to college, I didn't realize how it was going to
come in handy,'' Correia says. ``I didn't know until I was halfway
through it that I was going to do music and songwriting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing they teach you in a writing class is, you're
not supposed to tell, you're supposed to show something,'' she
says. ``And I think my songs do that, for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Chinatown,'' Correia's girlish voice sings about how all
there is to do is ``... watch the vegetables rot, the monkfish
flop.'' She goes ``sailing through the (New York) street on a sea
of faces'' in ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Correia even zooms across the city on ``The Bike'' left to her
by her late great-uncle Pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally I'm not that biographical,'' she says. ``I really go
out of my way to change details because I don't want to get in
trouble or hurt anybody's feelings or get sued. But with that song,
I just couldn't resist.''
</P>
<P>
   Correia brings these and other songs from her album to Luna
Park. She will be playing with Gerri Sutyak, a cellist who
accompanied Correia on the Girls Room tour. (Eventually she plans
to add a full band.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For now it's kind of nice because it's pretty raw, but there's
a sophistication about it, too,'' she says. ``Gerri really lends
the sophistication. I have to play the rawness. But it seems to be
going over pretty well.'' &QL; 
---The show: ``Amy Correia.'' &QL; 
Where: Luna Park, 665 N. Robertson Blvd., West Hollywood. &QL;

RUSSIA PROPOSES INTERNATIONAL AID PLAN FOR SUBMARINE DISASTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With the loss of the nuclear submarine Kursk and its
118-member crew, President Vladimir Putin has begun consultations
with other leaders on an international agreement in which nations
that operate warships under the sea would come to each other's aid
during disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals were drafted by a commission investigating the
causes of the sinking of the submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea on
Aug. 12. They were discussed by Putin this week during the meeting
of world leaders at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Putin confirmed in a meeting with news media executives on
Wednesday that he had carried the proposals to New York for
discussion with other leaders, but the Russian initiative has not
been elaborated on in public.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Moscow on Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya
Klebanov, who heads the investigating commission, said that a
decade after the end of the Cold War, a ``framework of relations''
is needed along with a ``general system of a provision of
assistance'' between submarine navies.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian initiative follows an outcry over Putin's delay in
requesting foreign assistance to help rescue the crew of the Kursk,
though Putin made clear in comments this week in New York that he
believed that most crew members had died immediately in a powerful
explosion that destroyed the forward compartments of the vessel as
the ship prepared to fire a torpedo during an exercise.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that tapping noises emanating from the sunken
vessel just after the accident were not, as initially thought, made
by crew members, but in fact came from unknown ``mechanical''
sources. Initially, the noises had energized the rescue effort and
riveted international attention on the plight of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   By recommending that well-defined protocols be established for
rescues during catastrophes, Putin may be seeking to blunt
political recriminations from his domestic critics. But his
proposals may also prompt an examination of how submarine
commanders, engaged in silent reconnaissance missions near each
other's fleets, conduct themselves when they detect disaster in
another fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. submarines, the Memphis and, according to some reports,
the Toledo, were monitoring the military maneuvers in which the
Kursk was participating last month when two explosions disabled and
sunk the 490-foot Russian attack submarine. Senior U.S. officials
have said that the U.S. vessels lingered in the area and monitored
Russian radio transmissions in the frantic early stages of the
search and rescue operation before leaving the area. A few U.S.
submarines on intelligence missions have been known to carry
deep-sea divers and small submersibles, but these officials have
said the U.S. boats on this occasion were not equipped to help.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has declined so far to publicly
discuss the mission of the U.S. submarines or how U.S. forces might
help a foreign submarine in distress. Earlier this week, Clinton's
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, turned over an
unclassified analysis of sonar data collected at the time of the
explosions that scuttled the Kursk to Sergei Ivanov, his Russian
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov, speaking in the interview, said that the U.S.
information turned over in New York was ``seismological'' in nature
and that it conformed with earlier information supplied by Norway.
However, he said, Russian sonar specialists differ in their
interpretation of the information, believing that the first of two
explosions recorded on Aug. 12 could have been the sound of a
collision or of a mine detonating. Russian specialists also believe
that any vessel that collided with the Kursk, disabling it and
sending it careering into the bottom, could have survived such a
collision and then slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy prime minister, an engineer by training who oversees
Russia's huge military industrial complex, also confirmed reports
that the force of the second explosion blew much of the bow and
torpedo compartment away. Klebanov said that one of the crucial
problems of the investigation is that the second explosion may have
obliterated some of the evidence of whether the Kursk was struck by
another vessel or mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second explosion greatly distorted the first cause,'' he
said. He added that ``We have elements of the inner hull bent
inside,'' indicating an external blow, ``and we have metal bent
outside,'' indicating an internal explosion breaking through the
hull.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why we cannot abandon the version that a collision
occurred,'' he said, ``because we have parts bent to the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   He also elaborated on Putin's remarks in New York about the
analysis of tapping noises. The navy's tapes of the tapping noises
on the hull revealed ``clear, rhythmic sounds,'' but when they were
subjected to ``multiple computer processing,'' he added, ``we can
say with a large degree of probability that it was mechanical
tapping, not by a man, but it was noise from a mechanism whose
nature we cannot establish, but almost for sure we defined that
those signals were not emitted by live crew members.'' He said the
noises stopped just before noon on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Russian officials denied a report in a German
newspaper suggesting that the Kursk was struck by a missile from
the cruiser Peter the Great. All weapons fired during Russian
military exercises carry dummy warheads, Klebanov said. He also
clarified that the Kursk was preparing to fire a standard torpedo
at the time of the accident that was equipped with a dummy warhead.
However, he added, the Kursk was equipped with a normal complement
of live torpedoes and other conventional missiles carrying
high-explosive warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The torpedo that the Kursk was preparing to fire was of the
Squall type that had been in the fleet for 20 years and was
equipped only with a new battery that had been subjected to earlier
testing, he said. U.S. Navy officers have said that handling errors
and flaws involving torpedoes have created dangerous situations on
other submarines. Some former Navy officials believe that the
explosion of a torpedo battery caused the loss of the U.S.S.
Scorpion and its 99-man crew in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov also disclosed that Russian rescue vessels actually
docked 18 times on the Kursk's rear outer hatch in vain attempts to
create an air-tight corridor that would have allowed them to open
the inner hatch to the submarine compartment below, but damage to
the seal around the hatch and flooding inside the submarine doomed
that final pathway into the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Crew recovery operations begin at the end of this month, with
large holes to be cut into the Kursk's hull. But Klebanov said that
a decision on whether to cut into the reactor compartment is still
under study. He said radiation levels remain normal on and around
the wrecked vessel.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: BADMINTON  
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, Sept. 11.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
  Major in Asia, minor throughout most of Europe and virtually
invisible in the United States, badminton is a fast-twitch indoor
feast of lunging gets and leaping smashes that bears only a vague
resemblance to the diletante's diversion.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The game was developed in England in the 1860s by daughters of
the Duke of Beaufort at his country seat, Badminton House, whence
it spread to the colonies, but it took well over a century for the
quickest of all racket sports to reach the Olympics in 1992.
Competition is single-elimination and held in men's and women's
singles, men's and women's doubles and, unlike in Olympic tennis,
mixed doubles, too. Avoid calling the fine, feathered object
hissing through the air a birdie. It is a shuttlecock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   Two of three games in all events. In men's singles and all
doubles events, games are played to 15 points. In women's singles,
games are played to 11. In all cases, points can be scored only
while serving. It gets tricky in the tiebreakers. If the score is
13-13 in a game (9-9 in women's singles), the player who reached
that total first can choose to extend the game by calling ``five,''
which means the first one to 18 or 14 wins. If the score is 14-14
(10-10 for those women's singles iconoclasts), the one who got
there first can extend the game by calling ``three,'' which means
exactly what you think it means.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Shuttlers spend much of their time airborne in order to improve
their hitting angles and generate leverage, but what makes
badminton intriguing and an aesthetic delight are the rapid rhythm
shifts: explosive smash and then silken drop shot.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The badminton strongholds are Indonesia, Malaysia, China, South
Korea and Denmark, which has produced the only two non-Asian
Olympic medalists. Denmark's Peter Gade Christensen is a slight
favorite in the men's singles in Sydney, but his countrywoman
Camilla Martin should have a harder time with the Chinese women,
led by Gong Zichao. Indonesia's Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan are
an exceptional men's doubles team, while China's Gu Jun and Ge Fei
are likely to defend their Olympic title in women's doubles.

COURT AGREES TO RULE ON ISSUE OF PRIOR CONVICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an early first act to its new term that begins
next month, the Supreme Court agreed Friday to resolve a growing
dispute over federal court review of state criminal convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether federal prisoners can seek federal court
review when the prior convictions are the reason the prisoner has
been sentenced to extra time as a repeat offender.
</P>
<P>
   Although the question seems technical and arcane, it has grown
in importance as federal sentencing has increasingly taken into
account an offender's criminal past. There has been a recent spate
of divergent federal appeals court rulings on whether the validity
of earlier state court convictions can be challenged in federal
court once the enhanced federal sentence has been imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals from two of those opposite rulings were awaiting Supreme
Court action, and the Justice Department told the justices that a
prompt resolution was ``important to the stability of federal
sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   The court on Friday accepted an appeal by a California man who
was convicted of violating a federal law that makes it a crime for
a felon to possess a gun. He was then sentenced under a separate
federal statute, the Armed Career Criminal Act, which imposes a
minimum 15-year sentence for the gun violation on anyone who has
three previous, serious felony convictions. The effect was a
doubling of the sentence for the defendant, Earthy D. Daniels Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels had four previous convictions in the California courts
that met the definition. After his federal sentencing, he filed a
motion in federal court to vacate his sentence on the ground that
two of the earlier convictions, both for robbery, were
constitutionally invalid because of improperly obtained guilty
pleas and inadequate legal advice. He made his motion under a
federal law, Section 2255, which authorizes federal inmates to seek
correction of erroneous sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The federal district court in Los Angeles denied the motion, as
did the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco. Both
acted on the basis of their interpretation of a 1994 Supreme Court
decision, Custis v. United States, which held that federal
defendants could not challenge the validity of prior state
convictions at their federal sentencing hearing. The 9th Circuit
went further and held that challenges also could not be brought
after the sentence was final.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Custis decision was limited to the sentencing
proceeding, or acted as a complete bar to later review of state
court convictions, is the issue that has divided the federal
circuits, because the Supreme Court in the 1994 case did not
address the further issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Almost simultaneously with the 9th Circuit's decision in
Daniels' case, Daniels v. United States, No. 99-9136, the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, read the earlier decision
differently to permit a challenge under Section 2255 of a federal
inmate's three 10-year-old drug convictions. The Justice Department
has appealed that ruling, United States v. Clark, No. 00-122.
</P>
<P>
   The court gave no indication on Friday of why it acted before
its usual starting date to add the Daniels case.
</P>
<P>
   There had been some speculation that the justices might act
Friday in the Microsoft antitrust case, in which the court must
decide whether to hear the company's appeal or let the case be
heard first by the federal appeals court here. But there was no
word Friday. Since all the initial briefs in the appeal have been
filed, the case is ready for the justices' action. The next
possible date for an order in the Microsoft case is Sept. 26.

THE SAME MEAL, WITH BIGGER PORTIONS, FOR LESS MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 10)  
 By BOB KNOLL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, the auto-buying public largely understands that few
makes and models are unique, but that they are assemblages of parts
shared with other products from the same manufacturer. What may be
surprising is the extent to which different cars use the same
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the car-designing process as a giant buffet. In
planning its LeSabre, Buick filled its plate with various General
Motors components, ultimately ending up with the same platform,
engine, transmission and brakes that Pontiac scooped up for its
Bonneville. The garnishes and side dishes were different, and the
LeSabre got some extra whipped topping for dessert, but the meals
were much the same.
</P>
<P>
   The platform _ the basic architecture of a car's unit-body
construction _ is the crucial ingredient. If an automaker has an
exceptional platform, it can mix and match components to create a
variety of cars that look different, have distinct images and
appeal to different buyers. This approach runs counter to
cookie-cutter lineups like Chrysler's K-cars, which looked and
performed much the same regardless of size or price.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen and Audi, both part of Volkswagen AG, have often
shared platforms successfully, enabling them to share the huge
costs of developing designs. When VW needed an attention-getter, it
looked no further than the platform of its Golf and Jetta. It added
a new body with a characteristic shape, and the New Beetle was
born. When Audi wanted to make a statement with a high-style sporty
car, the same platform was waiting. The TT coupe was born, followed
by a TT roadster.
</P>
<P>
   For 1996, Audi introduced the very successful A4 compact sedan.
As with other Audis, it had an engine mounted longitudinally _ that
is, from front to back, not from side to side as it is in the VW
Golf and Jetta _ and was available with Audi's highly regarded
quattro all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the VW Passat, which had been imported since 1990,
languished. Then in 1998, it was completely redesigned on a
slightly stretched version of the Audi A4 platform. The midsize VW
ended up with a wheelbase almost as long as the one on Audi's
upscale A6. This Passat cost less than the A4 but had slightly more
room inside and a better ride, too. Sales took off.
</P>
<P>
   Audi's big remaining edge was the fact that it could be ordered
with quattro all-wheel drive, a reassuring feature in bad-weather
driving. But now VW has leveled the field with the addition this
year of the Passat 4motion, its version of quattro.
</P>
<P>
   The 4motion system is a $1,650 option on GLS and GLX sedans and
wagons, but only in combination with a 2.8-liter V-6 engine _ the
same one used in Audis _ and an automatic transmission. Thus,
Volkswagen has upped the ante by offering Audi's main attractions
at VW prices. Some fraternal cannibalism seems unavoidable, with VW
taking a bite of Audi's market.
</P>
<P>
   I have just finished driving one of the most sought-after
Passats, the top-line GLX 4motion wagon. Although the A4 and Passat
wagons look similar and share engines, transmissions and
accessories, there are differences. One is that the Passat's longer
wheelbase adds almost 2 inches of rear-seat legroom to the wagon
and sedan, and several inches to the wagon's cargo area. VW's own
figures show the Passat wagon has 36 cubic feet behind the second
seat, compared with the A4's 31.3 cubic feet. With the rear seats
down, the VW has 74 cubic feet versus the Audi's 63.7. Among
all-wheel-drive station wagons, the Passat's cargo volume is
greater than all but the Mercedes E320 wagon, even beating the new
Volvo V70.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is price. The GLX wagon that I tested has a
list price of $31,705, including the destination, or delivery,
charge. Its only options were 4motion and the required automatic
transmission. An Audi A4 quattro 2.8 wagon, with the same engine
and similar equipment, is $34,420, a difference of $2,715.
Comparably equipped, a four-cylinder version of the Audi A4, the
1.8 Turbo, is $29,980 with quattro and automatic transmission. But
a Passat GLS 4motion is even less, starting at about $28,000, and
comes with a V-6.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of the 4motion system, the Passat has made
a giant step toward parity with the A4. In today's market, customer
preference seems to be for some sort of a sport utility, but not
one that's too trucklike, and an all-wheel or four-wheel-drive
system that is not cumbersome or awkward to use. Subaru has had
great success with its all-wheel-drive sedans and wagons, and
others are following. But Audi's quattro remains the gold standard
of road-going all-wheel-drive systems.
</P>
<P>
   The specifications make it clear that 4motion and quattro are
one and the same. Both are designed to work with a longitudinal
engine. Both have an automatic-locking center differential that
distributes engine torque to the front and rear axles in a 50/50
split so that all four wheels equally divide the torque. Under
conditions when slippage occurs with either a front or a rear
wheel, the differential can send up to two-thirds of the torque to
the wheels that have the best grip. Both have an electronic locking
differential in front and rear axles that limit how much each wheel
can spin, sending more torque to a wheel on the other side that has
traction.
</P>
<P>
   The quattro and 4motion systems operate seamlessly and
transparently. Other manufacturers claim seamless operation, but in
my experience only Subaru's system is equivalent to Audi's, and now
VW's. Most others operate either the front or rear wheels all the
time unless a loss of traction occurs, at which time the center
differential diverts power to the wheels with traction.
Unfortunately, this diversion of torque is often noticeable and
sometimes annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of the VW-Audi systems is that with the
combination of a locking center differential and torque-splitting
axle differentials, an Audi or VW can drive away even if only one
wheel has traction. Many four-wheel-drive systems do not have this
capability; in some, the vehicle cannot move if only one wheel
lacks traction.
</P>
<P>
   Will this updated Passat take sales from the Audi A4?
</P>
<P>
   That seems likely. There remain only a few reasons to choose the
Audi: Its name is more prestigious; its styling may be more
appealing to some, and it comes with a warranty and free service
for 3 years or 50,000 miles, compared with 2 years or 24,000 miles
for VW.

SPORTS CAPSULE: TAE KWON DO 
(FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  This sport originated as a self-defense art in Korea, where its
name means ``the way of kicking and punching.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike the non-Olympic sport of karate, which involves the hands
80 percent of the time, tae kwon do is 80 percent feet. This is its
first appearance as an Olympic medal sport after demonstration
status in 1988 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The 100 athletes from 48 nations will compete in four weight
classes for men and four for women (normally in world
championships, there are eight classes for each). A loss before the
finals eliminates chances for a gold or silver, but anyone who
loses to a finalist returns in a repechage, or second chance,
tournament for a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   Each match can last three rounds of three minutes each and ends
in a knockout or decision. Points are scored with a kick or a punch
to the colored portion of a padded chest protector or a kick to the
helmet. Three judges score the match electronically. If the judges
tie, the referee decides the winner.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   As in chess matches, many competitors think defense first and
pick moments to try to score. As a result, scores are often low,
like 2-1 or 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The only countries to qualify the maximum of two men and two
women are Korea, Chinese Taipei, the United States, the
Philippines, Spain and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest favorite is Victor Estrada Garibay of Mexico in
men's welterweight. Kay Poe, 18, of Houston is favored in women's
flyweight, and medals seem likely from Juan Moreno of Miami in
men's flyweight and Steven Lopez of Sugarland, Texas, in men's
featherweight.  &QL;

FROM CRUEL SUMMER TO KINDER FALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use after Sun., Sept. 10, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS AND GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, it's fall. The leaves are turning, the days are shortening,
and the movies are supposed to be getting better, right? Right?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. This is traditionally the time when studios roll out
their serious fare for Oscar consideration, but a cursory look at
the schedule seems to indicate that the majors are interested more
in box-office gold than Oscar gold. Just look at November: It
starts with a ``Charlie's Angels'' update and another Mars movie,
segues to Adam Sandler playing Satan's slacker son and goes out
barking with ``102 Dalmatians.'' It's not exactly a schedule that's
going to make anyone forget this summer's miserable movies.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope. We've already seen some of the movies and can
tell you that Cameron Crowe's sentimental rock `n' roll
remembrance, ``Almost Famous,'' and Ang Lee's gorgeous martial arts
drama, ``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' are among the year's
best. October brings a dozen different films each weekend, and
we're betting that there will be a surprise buried somewhere in
there. After all, who knew about ``Being John Malkovich'' this time
last year?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody did. And that's the beauty of the season. Somewhere
between Schwarzenegger and Stallone (don't these guys belong in the
summer?), there will be small pleasures like ``Shadow of the
Vampire'' and David Mamet's ``State and Main,'' movies that remind
us that intelligence and fun can indeed go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, of course, that this is a tentative list. Dates and
titles can and will change. (In fact, you can pretty much bet that
the ``Rugrats'' movie and Robert Redford's ``The Legend of Bagger
Vance'' will find a different opening weekend.)

   Here is what's in store: &QL;

 &QL; 
`HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS' &QL; 
The haps in Whoville &QL; 
By Glenn Whipp &QL; 
Turning Dr. Seuss' thinly sketched children's classic ``How the
Grinch Stole Christmas'' into a full-length feature turned out to
be less of a problem for Ron Howard than he thought it might.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened pretty organically,'' Howard says. ``You realize
early that the Whos are out of their mind for Christmas. And what
one of us grown-ups hasn't at one time or another shook their head
and said, 'Christmas is getting out of control'? Well in Whoville,
it's really out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   And the only person not included in the mania is the Mean One,
Mr. Grinch, the man with the brain full of spiders and the
garlic-filled soul. Makeup genius Rick Baker spent five hours each
day turning Jim Carrey into the Man Who Stole Christmas, and the
process drove Carrey so batty that Howard brought in a former Navy
SEAL to help him cope with the claustrophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more or less a mummy, but that's what he wanted,''
Howard says. ``He wanted to be the Grinch, not Jim Carrey in green
face paint.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Carrey's love for Seuss' tale and vision for the
character that convinced Howard to tackle the adaptation in the
first place. Because, to quote the song, originally he didn't think
he would touch it _ even with a 39-and-a-half-foot pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tremendous trepidation going into this because people
really love this story, and you don't want to do anything to screw
it up,'' Howard says. ``But after talking to Jim, I got caught up
in his enthusiasm and thought, 'Why not?' And it turned out to be
one of the coolest things I've ever done in my career.'' (Set for
release Nov. 17.)

`CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON' &QL; 
East meets East &QL; 
By Glenn Whipp &QL; 
When Taiwanese director Ang Lee (``The Ice Storm,'' ``Sense and
Sensibility'') was trying to raise $15 million to make his latest
film, he'd pitch it to investors as a ``Sense and Sensibility''
with martial arts. It proved to be an intriguing enough idea to
secure financing. Then Lee had to go out and actually make the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the hard part,'' Lee says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He more than succeeded. ``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon''
floored audiences at Cannes with its poetic mixture of romance,
Taoism and ballet-like martial arts action. It's Lee's dream movie,
the film he has wanted to make ever since watching martial arts
movies as a child.
</P>
<P>
   But with its strong emotionalism and prominent female
characters, ``Crouching Tiger'' differs strongly from traditional
martial arts films. The story: Chow Yun-Fat plays Li Mu Bai, a
weary warrior who turns in his ancient sword so he can lead a life
of contemplation. When an aristocratic young woman (amazing
newcomer Zhang Ziyi) steals the sword, Li Mu Bai joins with an old
friend, Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh from ``Tomorrow Never Dies''), to
retrieve it and settle an old score.
</P>
<P>
   That description only scratches the surface of the film's
abundant pleasures. Filmed throughout China, ``Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon'' is also an epic love story featuring some of the
most jaw-dropping martial arts choreography in film history. That
should come as no surprise, given the presence of the legendary
Yuen Wo-Ping, the man who made the fight scenes in ``The Matrix''
such a kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an almost impossible task we set before us, trying to
make an artistic, human drama along with a modern martial arts
film,'' Lee says. ``They're two different animals. We're asking the
audience to believe the real emotions we're presenting and then
accept people flying through the air, performing abstract feats of
skill. It will be new for most people.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be imitated by a lot of filmmakers. But it won't
likely ever be done quite as well. (Set for release Dec. 15) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`WHAT WOMEN WANT' &QL; 
A way with 'Women' &QL; 
By Glenn Whipp &QL; 
What do women want? Don't ask Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figure it this way,'' Gibson begins rather glumly. ``Freud
spent almost his entire working career trying to figure that out,
and he died without the answer. Not that I put much stock in Freud,
but at least he was trying to find the answer. And he didn't come
any closer than the rest of us. Well, he thought he did, but really
he was just chasing his tail around.''
</P>
<P>
   So ... that's it?
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Gibson says, ``here's what I really think. The answer
lies somewhere between chocolate and conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   See's Candies ought to like that. In ``What Women Want,'' Gibson
plays a self-absorbed ad executive who, after getting electrocuted
in the bathtub, discovers he has the ability to read women's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, he's appalled by it because there's a lot of stuff
he doesn't want to hear,'' Gibson says. ``And then he starts to use
it and becomes a complete pig. And then he discovers a whole side
of him that he never knew was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Nancy Meyers (``Parent Trap'') says Gibson
doesn't need much help when it comes to women, especially when it
concerns directors of the fairer sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to talk to women and be with women and he really
listens,'' Meyers says. ``He's about the furthest thing from macho
you could find.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Gibson. When asked what women would hear if
they could read men's thoughts, he says, ``The sound of crickets
chirping and a lot of knuckle-dragging. And maybe an episode or two
of the Three Stooges.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk. (Set for release Dec. 15) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`TRAFFIC' &QL; 
Soderbergh yearned to direct 'Traffic' &QL; 
By Glenn Whipp &QL; 
Director Steven Soderbergh was coming off two critical successes
(``Out of Sight'' and ``The Limey''), a flat-out hit (``Erin
Brockovich'') and a casting call for a remake of ``Ocean's 11''
that had every top-name actor in Hollywood clamoring for a part.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that seemed to matter for Soderbergh when it came to
getting his latest project, ``Traffic,'' off the ground. The movie
is a series of intertwined dramas revolving around the
international drug trade. People loved the screenplay, but the
enthusiasm was tempered by the bleakness of the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' Soderbergh says matter-of-factly, `'drug
movies don't have a storied history when it comes to making
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox put the film in turnaround last winter, only to pick it up
again when Harrison Ford expressed interest in playing the lead
character: a drug czar who most cope with his junkie daughter. Ford
ultimately passed (``Coming off of 'Random Hearts,' the material
was just too dark,'' he says) and Fox did, too. Soderbergh ended up
spending his own money to fund pre-production while he looked for
another studio. (USA Films stepped up.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an interesting, harrowing experience,'' Soderbergh
says. ``I wouldn't wish it on anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas ended up taking the lead, and his new wife,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, joined the cast as well, playing a drug
dealer's wife. Among the other featured players: Dennis Quaid,
Benjamin Bratt, Albert Finney, Benicio Del Toro and Don Cheadle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of stories, and hopefully we've found a thread
to make them work together,'' Soderbergh says. ``If it works, it
could play like 'The French Connection' crossed with 'Nashville.'
'' (Set for release Dec. 22.) &QL;

FINANCIAL COMMENTARY: OIL-FUELED INFLATION CATCHING UP WITH WAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hardly any description of the booming economy fails to include
this upbeat observation: Wages have been rising faster than
inflation for most workers since January 1996. The boom has lifted
all boats, and that is its great social gift.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, hardly noticed until now, the lifting stopped.
Wages are still rising, but no longer faster than inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That is a troubling development. Nothing has seemed more
important in the economic boom than the wage gains it has
conferred. High-end workers, those earning more than $80,000 a
year, always gain ground. But the pay of nearly everyone else went
nowhere for a quarter-century, until the rising prosperity of the
1990s _ and a falling unemployment rate _ finally brought relief.
</P>
<P>
   Wages have risen 3 percent to 5 percent a year since 1996, with
the precise figure depending on the measure used _ average wages,
median wages, hourly wages _ and the particular group of workers
measured. The $7-an-hour worker has done as well as those earning
$18 or $25. And even now, these ``nominal'' wages, unadjusted for
inflation, continue to rise at a fairly steady pace, according to
Labor Department data tabulated by the Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is inflation. A dollar's worth of nominal wages does
not buy as much when prices rise. Inflation must be subtracted to
know the ``real'' rate of wage growth. A 4 percent nominal raise
becomes no raise at all if inflation is also 4 percent. And that is
roughly what has happened. The Consumer Price Index, which rose
less than 2 percent a year in 1997 and 1998, is now climbing at an
annual rate of more than 3.5 percent, nullifying all or most of
this year's wage gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that you have had constant nominal wage
growth, yet slowing real wage growth, which over the last two
quarters has been just about flat,'' said Jared Bernstein, an
economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The oil shock is the culprit, and there is hope that it will end
soon, with OPEC increasing production enough to bring down the
prices of heating oil, gasoline and aviation fuel, and with them
the inflation rate. The decision to step up output could even come
this weekend at a conference in Vienna. But the oil crisis is in
its second year, and an earlier production increase didn't pull
prices down.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation keeps up at its present pace, American workers will
be in a bind. Either they must agitate for bigger nominal wage
increases _ making better use of the leverage they have from a very
low unemployment rate _ or they will have to accept that the
longest economic expansion in American history has lost its lifting
power for them. ``We are at a moment of testing,'' said Peter
Hooper, chief domestic economist for Deutsche Bank North America.
</P>
<P>
   Many forecasters and Wall Street economists argue that the
necessary bargaining power is still there. If the inflation rate
stays up, workers will indeed wake up and fight for raises large
enough to keep ahead of inflation or, failing that, jump to jobs
that pay more. That has not happened yet, this argument goes,
because most people believe that inflation in the longer run will
be less than 3 percent, and nominal wage gains will turn back into
real ones.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking ignores accumulating evidence that American
workers are more passive than in the past, and much less able, when
inflation erodes their wages, to take advantage of market demand
for their services. A host of reasons are cited: Globalization, job
insecurity, the decline in union membership, mass extinctions of
higher-paying factory jobs, an influx of low-wage immigrants,
companies that are quick to relocate to lower-wage regions, the
disappearance of cost-of-living adjustments. The list continues,
with two new observations.
</P>
<P>
   The 86,000 workers who struck Verizon so effectively last month
settled for a 12.5 percent wage increase over three years, plus
less tangible stock options and profit sharing. Many nonunion
workers have been getting similar wage increases since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And the old corporate practice of splitting productivity gains
with employees _ often at the insistence of unions _ is fading.
Labor productivity has been rising more rapidly over the last two
years, meaning that workers generate more revenue and income for
their companies. But the fruits have gone mainly into profits, not
wages. Corporate profits rose in the second quarter to 9.7 percent
of gross domestic product, from 9.34 percent in the fourth quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers have not yet recognized the extent to which their
rising productivity has not yet been matched by increases in
nominal wages,'' Hooper said.
</P>
<P>
   The great concern, in sum, is that the lift for wage earners
from the booming economy is fading, and in danger of disappearing
entirely if the oil shock lasts.

WHITEFLIES AND OTHER PESTS CAN BE CONTROLLED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
(c) 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
Q: What is the best way to stop a whitefly epidemic? We have had a
terrible problem with these pests this summer._ L.D.R., Spring,
Texas
<TEXT>
<P>
   A: Whiteflies drain the sap from foliage and, given a heavy
infestation, can weaken a plant and stunt growth. Damaged leaves
may be stippled yellow, and many curl and turn brown.
</P>
<P>
   Adults and nymphs excrete honeydew, a sticky substance that, in
turn, promotes sooty mold on the leaves, a fungus that turns the
leaves a sticky black. This mold, however, is not really harmful
and can be gently washed off the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The whiteflies, however, should be controlled. Persistent,
strong sprays of water from the garden hose, aimed at the
undersides and tops of the leaves, help break up the problem. This
may sound silly, but daily or every-other-day treatments will help
you rid the plants of the pests.
</P>
<P>
   You also could try an insecticidal soap. Yellow sticky traps and
pesticides containing pyrethrum, rotenone or neem also can help
fight these pests. Malathion can be used, too, but be sure to read
and follow the directions carefully. Do not use malathion on
hibiscus. Whatever your means of attack, persistence is the answer
until you get matters under control.
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe for combating whiteflies, spider mites,
scales, chinch bugs and other pests is from Mark Bowen, who owns
Living Art Landscapes and is president of the board of directors
for Urban Harvest, a Houstoncommunity garden organization:
</P>
<P>
   Place 1 cayenne pepper, 1 whole lemon (cut up), 1 garlic bulb, 3
tablespoons of soybean oil and 2 tablespoons of seaweed extract
(kelp) into a blender and mix. Strain through pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the concentrate into a pump sprayer, dilute with water to
make either a strong 1-gallon or a weaker 2-gallon solution.
</P>
<P>
   Water plants, wait a day or two, then apply the spray in the
morning. Bowen recommends the weaker solution for drought-stressed
plants. To be safe, test-treat a few leaves before spraying the
entire plant. Avoid spraying delicate plants such as African
violets and ferns.
</P>
<P>
   Toss strained solids into the compost.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently while visiting in Fredericksburg, Texas, I
discovered a tree in a residential area that was bearing fruit. The
homeowner said it was a type of apple. The fruit is red, 1 to 2
inches in size, and tastes like a sweet apple. Have you ever heard
of this type of apple? _ R.F.N., Bellaire, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Crabapples are 1 to 2 inches, and some types are red, but the
fruit not eaten by the birds is usually used for jellies since they
are not sweet. I don't know of a sweet apple that small, so I asked
fruit tree expert Bill Rohde for help. It's possible that the apple
you saw was one grown from seed, or the tree is not being thinned,
or both. Thinning young fruit enables a tree to put more energy
into fewer apples, and the result is larger fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a ground cover that will survive our heat
and seemingly constant drought. It would be planted in full sun.
Any suggestions? _ A.M.W., Bellaire, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Barring many repeats of record-shattering heat and severe
drought, there are plants that tolerate sun and drier conditions _
lantanas, for example. And rosemary has held up well this summer in
our garden. I have given it a little water, however, to avoid
dusty, bone-dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
   I would vote for ornamental grasses. You could mass one type,
mix those of varying heights or mix the grasses with lantana,
Rudbeckia `Goldsturm' and/or purple coneflowers.
</P>
<P>
   The wispy, pinkish plumes of the native ornamental grass Gulf
muhly (Muhlenbergia capilleris) are spectacular in late summer and
early fall. Height is 2{ to 3 feet. The maiden grass Miscanthus
sinensis `Gracillimus' has slender, weeping foliage with white
midribs and coppery plumes. Height is 5-6 feet. Dwarf selections
include Pennisetum alopecuriodes `Little Bunny,' a charmer that
produces creamy, puffed flowers in fall.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep in mind that any of these plants will take some water
until established.

   LOYALTY (Mesa, Ariz.) - Mesa Community College's student body
vice president, who said he's a member of the Communist Party, has
refused to sign a loyalty oath required of all community college
student officers and employees. Because of his refusal, college
officials won't let him take office and won't pay him his salary.
The oath, which makes it a felony to be a Communist, has been
illegal since 1966 when the Supreme Court declared such loyalty
oaths unconstitutional, after a Tucson teacher challenged them,
according to the ACLU. The ACLU has taken the student officer's
case and has preliminary assurances that the college district will
change its oath policy. (Arizona State University also requires a
loyalty oath, but it's generic and constitutional, according to the
ACLU). By EDYTHE JENSEN. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

HOW AN UNPRETENTIOUS FAMILY CAR, THE PASSAT, GOT SO HOT

 By MICHELINE MAYNARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Family sedans generate big sales, but seldom do they
create a buzz. The Volkswagen Passat, however, has gained
most-wanted status, thanks to glowing reviews from automotive
writers, high ratings from consumer publications and positive
word-of-mouth among owners.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Consumer Reports has given high ratings to the
Passat. In its July issue, the magazine rated the Passat GLS V-6
first among midsized sedans, over the Toyota Camry, Nissan Maxima
and Honda Accord. The magazine had previously ranked the
four-cylinder Passat above comparable models.
</P>
<P>
   A top ranking from Consumer Reports, or even its more common
``recommended'' rating, is coveted, given that many car shoppers
come to dealerships clutching copies of the magazine's reports,
which some regard as gospel; some auto marketing executives have
estimated that its recommendation can result in 25,000 added sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat has also received uniformly favorable notices in
enthusiast magazines and newspaper reviews, and it has won industry
awards. This summer, for instance, J.D. Power &AMP; Associates named it
the ``most appealing family car.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Passat sales are soaring, setting records for much
of the year. And if sales continue at the torrid first-half pace,
VW is likely to sell nearly 90,000 Passats in 2000, well above last
year's sales record of 68,151, said Tony Fouladpour, a spokesman
for VW. The Northeast is a particularly hot market, accounting for
15 percent of Passat sales nationwide, Fouladpour said.
</P>
<P>
   The car is attracting interest among consumers who might never
have considered VW's lineup before. In Grand Rapids, Mich., buyers
often arrive at Betten Imports with copies of Consumer Reports in
hand, said the sales manager, Jeff Leckta. Used to selling
Volkswagens to repeat customers, ``I'm seeing people in here that
I've never seen before,'' he said. Several recent buyers traded
Camrys for Passats.
</P>
<P>
   He and other salespeople complain about a lack of cars to sell.
As early as May, some dealers were telling customers that if they
wanted a Passat, they would have to order a 2001 model, due out in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The car's popularity means VW has not offered special lease
deals, discount financing or rebates, even though the Passat is
priced above its rivals. The base GLS is $21,200, compared with
$18,600 for a Honda Accord LX and $20,388 for a Toyota Camry LE.
The Passat GLS V-6 starts at $23,800 versus the Honda Accord LX V-6
at $21,950 and the Toyota Camry LE V-6 at $22,358.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Passat, a descendant of past VW models like
the Quantum and Dasher, is quite recent. The previous-generation
car suffered from quality problems and boxy styling. ``You had to
have a real appreciation for Teutonic German design,'' Fouladpour
said of the 1990-97 model. Sales slipped as low as 11,021 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed with the redesigned 1998 model, whose
roofline is a graceful arc that mimics the look of the New Beetle.
The restyled Passat won praise for its interior comfort, adept
handling and responsive engine. Many of its parts are shared with
the more expensive Audi A4 and A6.
</P>
<P>
   Fans include Ron Pinelli, the founder of Autodata Corp., a
statistics and marketing firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. This year, he
bought a silver Passat GLS with a turbocharged four-cylinder
engine. He promptly added another $3,000 in custom wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accord and Camry are wonderful products, but the Passat has
more passion behind it,'' Pinelli said. He said the Passat's
popularity was a symbol of VW's sales comeback in the United
States. ``It wasn't many years ago that VW was basically out of
business in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Passat has brought Volkswagen a sought-after group of buyers.
Their average age is 38, compared with 43 for the last Passat. More
are women: 43 percent, compared with 38 percent previously. And
their household income tops $83,000, up $13,000. Three-quarters are
college-educated, compared with two-thirds for the previous car.
</P>
<P>
   Many auto companies would put on a full press to attract
additional buyers, but VW's goal is to eventually sell 100,000
Passats a year in the United States. Fouladpour said VW could not
hope to steal more business from the Accord and Camry, which each
sell more than 350,000 cars a year, because of production
constraints and a relatively small network of dealers.
</P>
<P>
   And VW insists that the Passat, with its decidedly German ride
and handling characteristics, was never intended to appeal to the
mass American market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still not a car for everybody,'' Fouladpour said. ``It
has a personality that attracts a certain type of buyer. Toyota and
Honda do vanilla and bland better than everyone else. We intend to
be a wakeup call.''

OFF THE SHELF: `WHEN GENIUS FAILED' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1998, a little-known investment partnership in
Greenwich, Conn., lost $553 million. The loss on that single sunny
Friday left the behemoth fund with $2.9 billion in capital, down
from $4.67 billion just months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, of course, was Long-Term Capital Management, which was
born in the brain of an enigmatic Wall Street bond trader named
John Meriwether. By September 1998, with world markets already
roiled by a Russian bond default, the enormous fund was teetering
at the edge of failure, with many of the world's biggest banks and
brokerage houses shackled to it by countless links of leverage.
</P>
<P>
   If the hedge fund failed, who else would be pulled down with it?
And how would a market already nearing the thin edge of panic
react? Faced with those questions _ and with the impossibility of
receiving reliable answers in the time available _ the head of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York called the fund's top creditors,
the chieftains of Wall Street, to an emergency meeting at which
they ultimately agreed to bail out the fund with fresh capital.
</P>
<P>
   That dramatic and still controversial rescue, and the events
that let up to it, are the threads that Roger Lowenstein weaves
into ``When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital
Management'' (Random House, $26.95). This richly textured and lucid
account is not the first book to try to parse the secrecy that
shrouded those events. ``Inventing Money: The Story of Long-Term
Capital and the Legends Behind It,'' by Nicholas Dunbar (Wiley &AMP;
Sons), added a wealth of financial history and market theory to the
core story.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowenstein, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, has taken
a completely different path, examining the events primarily through
the prism of human nature. The results are a riveting account that
reaches beyond the market landscape to say something universal
about risk and triumph, about hubris and failure.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the story is Meriwether himself, an accountant's son
who grew up in a close-knit neighborhood in Chicago. An honor
student with a mathematical bent, he parlayed his passion for golf
into a college scholarship. Even as a teen-ager, he was an avid but
cautious gambler, holding his cards _ and his ambitions _ close to
his chest.
</P>
<P>
   After college, he taught high school mathematics for a year,
then enrolled in the University of Chicago's business school,
working his way through as an analyst for a large insurer. In 1974,
at 27, he was hired by Salomon Brothers, one of the leading
bond-trading houses on the Street. Three years later, after making
millions for the firm speculating on government and municipal
bonds, he formed the arbitrage group, which used Salomon's own
capital to exploit tiny disparities in bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   To help him find these opportunities, he recruited a band of
mathematical scholars, young academics whose awesome intelligence
gave Meriwether the edge he sought in the increasingly competitive
markets. The group was remarkably isolated from the rest of Salomon
Brothers, and Meriwether protected them from even the normal human
interaction of the workplace. ``The professors were brilliant at
reducing a trade to pluses and minuses; they could strip a ham
sandwich to its component risks; but they could barely carry on a
normal conversation,'' Lowenstein says.
</P>
<P>
   They were a remarkable band, and most of them became permanent
acolytes at Meriwether's altar, following him at every step of his
career: Eric Rosenfeld, an MIT-trained assistant professor at the
Harvard Business School; Victor Haghani, a graduate of the London
School of Economics; and the rigidly rational Lawrence Hilibrand,
who has two degrees from MIT. Meriwether left Salomon Brothers
after a brush with scandal _ he was the supervisor of a trader
caught manipulating Treasury securities. He then started his own
hedge-fund replica of the arbitrage group, adding three high
priests of finance: Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, Nobel
laureates for work relating to options pricing, and David W.
Mullins Jr., who had been vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   These men all possessed an unswerving faith in the notion that
markets are fundamentally rational and efficient, and that every
price generated in that marketplace is the correct one. Among
economists, this so-called efficient market theory is just that, a
theory, reflecting a Platonic ideal of the marketplace. Moreover,
the theory assumes that trading in any market is more or less
continuous and that prices move smoothly from one level to the next
nearest level, giving everyone a chance to adjust portfolios
rationally to reflect the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Through Lowenstein's compassionate eye, we watch as these
fascinating coddled geniuses discover what any dedicated
flea-market shopper already knows: In real life, people buy and
sell things for reasons entirely unconnected to rationality. As he
notes, the mathematical laws governing a coin toss rest on the fact
that ``the coin doesn't remember that it landed on tails three
times in a row; the odds on the fourth flip are still 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But markets have memories,'' he says. ``Sometimes a trend will
continue just because traders expect (or fear) that it will.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``After three bad `flips' in the market, the fourth
flip may no longer be completely random. Some traders may have
taken losses and be forced to sell; other investors, looking over
their shoulders, may panic and decide to beat them to it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is pretty much what happened in the galloping climax to
the Long-Term Capital story. ``The partners believed that, over
time, investors would become more rational, more steady, more
efficient _ more like  &UR; they &LR;  were,'' Lowenstein concludes. Instead,
as the story unfolds, Meriwether's brilliant followers became more
irrational, greedier, more oblivious to their own flaws _ in short,
more like the rest of us.

U.S. RETREATS FROM PLAN TO LOWER MEDICARE PAYMENTS FOR CANCER
DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under withering criticism from doctors, patients
and Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, the
Clinton administration backed away Friday from a plan to cut
Medicare payments for cancer drugs given to hundreds of thousands
of patients each year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the cuts, which were to
have taken effect on Oct. 1, had been deferred indefinitely.
Federal officials said they needed to study the whole process by
which Medicare pays for cancer chemotherapy, including not only
drugs, but also the services of doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, who supervises Medicare as administrator
of the federal Health Care Financing Administration, said she still
believed that Medicare paid too much for cancer drugs. But, she
said, the government will not make any immediate cuts in payments
for the drugs because officials now recognize that payments to
doctors for chemotherapy services are inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, doctors use the overpayments to help subsidize the
cost of delivering the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials said they would not lower payment for cancer
drugs until they increased payments for administering the drugs.
Next year, DeParle said, the government will propose regulations or
legislation to increase payments for the services.
</P>
<P>
   Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services,
announced the plan to reduce ``excessive Medicare payments'' in
May. Medicare officials said today that they did not realize the
cuts could have disrupted the nation's entire system of cancer
care.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, led by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said
they would have had to send many cancer patients to hospitals for
treatment, causing inconvenience to patients while increasing costs
to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare now pays for a very limited number of outpatient drugs,
including cancer drugs provided in doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they worried that the cuts would
become a political fiasco, undermining Democratic efforts to secure
broad Medicare coverage for all medically necessary prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush cited the planned cuts to support his argument
that the Medicare agency was ``rigid and sluggish and slow to
change'' and posed ``a hazard to your health.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New
York, said last month, ``In light of its oft-proclaimed intention
of saving Medicare, it's highly ironic that the Clinton
administration would propose a policy that would sabotage the
ability of seniors to obtain cancer therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., said that if the cuts had occurred,
many doctors would have found it ``financially impossible to
provide chemotherapy services in their offices.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At least 121 members of Congress _ 70 Republicans and 51
Democrats _ signed letters to Shalala expressing alarm at the
planned cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A 1987 law directed the Medicare agency to study the adequacy of
Medicare payments for chemotherapy services in doctors' offices.
The study, due on April 1, 1989, was never done.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Medicare officials said Friday, they will now do the
study that Congress ordered 13 years ago. The study could take many
months, and it will not be easy to change the Medicare payment
formula so it accurately reflects the special costs incurred in
outpatient cancer care.
</P>
<P>
   Terry S. Coleman, former chief counsel of the Medicare program,
said: ``The reimbursement methodology is so complicated, you can't
just go in and adjust a few billing codes. The same methodology is
used for all physician specialties, not just oncology.''
</P>
<P>
   While putting off cuts in payment for cancer drugs, Medicare
officials said they would cut payments for drugs used at kidney
dialysis centers and in the treatment of emphysema and other lung
diseases, starting Jan. 1.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   People with irreversible kidney failure typically go to a
dialysis center three times a week to have waste cleaned from the
blood. They receive drugs to treat bone disease and anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Dolph Chianchiano, director of public policy at the National
Kidney Foundation, said: ``As a result of the cuts being made by
the government, Medicare patients may be unable to obtain the drugs
they need, or they may have to make a special visit to a hospital
each week to get the drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   One example illustrates how the cuts could have affected cancer
care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dean H. Gesme, president of the National Coalition for
Cancer Survivorship, an advocacy group for patients, works with
four other doctors at a clinic with 4,000 to 5,000 patients in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Gesme said Friday that the cuts would have cost his clinic
$300,000 to $500,000 a year. Currently, he said, the clinic,
Oncology Associates, receives $2 million to $2.5 million a year in
payments from Medicare for drugs and $400,000 for the services of
doctors and nurses who administer the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gesme said the clinic did not make any money on its Medicare
chemotherapy business, but derived all its profits from privately
insured patients.
</P>
<P>
   The changes planned by the Clinton administration would have
directly affected only Medicare reimbursement. But Gesme said,
``When Medicare makes sweeping cuts, private insurers often follow
suit, assuming that the government must be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa T. Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health
and Human Services, said, ``The oncologists raised some legitimate
concerns.'' Skolfield said Shalala was not aware that Medicare was
underpaying for such services when she announced the cuts in May.
</P>
<P>
   However, Medicare officials have long been aware of the problem.
An official notice published in the Federal Register in 1988
acknowledged that Medicare ``may fail to compensate adequately for
the services'' of doctors and nurses providing chemotherapy.

AFRICAN LEADERS GET MESSAGE ACROSS AT UN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Amid a year that has seen intensive
international attention toward Africa and its daunting list of
troubles, dozens of angry African leaders fired back this week at
Western powers, saying concern alone is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   As the United Nations millenium summit finished three days of
deliberations and speeches Saturday, an overriding theme emerged
from African heads of state who charged that the forces of
globalization are enriching the West anew while sentencing them to
even more misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were slaves, then there was colonization, and we are saying
that even with globalization we will never become global slaves
again,'' said Gambian President Yahya Jammeh in an interview in his
hotel suite overlooking Central Park. ``It took African blood,
sweat and tears to build the West, and now the West, instead of
respecting us, is treating us like dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Several African leaders voiced solidarity with the grassroots
international movement against the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank, suggesting that an alliance was possible in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Seattle to Washington, D.C., from Davos to London and in
many other places, people have spoken and signaled in no uncertain
terms that the present world order, particularly in economic, trade
and development areas, is unsatisfactory and needs to be
reformed,'' said Anund Priyay Neewoor, UN ambassador from the tiny
island nation of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the people have said in the streets now, the developing
countries have been saying for many years in various international
fora with little success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment from Africa is not uncommon at world events, but this
time it came in a year in which the United Nations held extensive
hearings in January on the continent's needs. On Thursday, a
historic meeting of the UN Security Council focused on revamping
peacekeeping operations, with Africa very much in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, as well, has rhetorically elevated
African policy to a higher plane than any previous administration.
Clinton traveled twice to the continent, most recently last month
to Nigeria and Tanzania. And his administration has advocated debt
forgiveness, increased spending to fight HIV/AIDS and faster
deployment of better trained UN peacekeepers to defuse conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   But at the three-day summit, leader after leader from African
nations delivered withering attacks against the West, some
specifically mentioning the United States. They said the Western
powers talked a good game about extending the benefits of
globalization to Africa but then stood by as corporations plundered
riches from the continent.
</P>
<P>
   South African President Thabo Mbeki decried the day-to-day
misery of one-sixth of all people of earth who survive on less than
a $1 a day, saying it should be ``offensive'' to all leaders at the
summit. The General Assembly, as expected, passed a resolution
Saturday that including sweeping goals on behalf of the poor,
including lifting an astronomical 600 million people out of extreme
poverty in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor of the world stand at the gates of the comfortable
mansions occupied by each and every king and queen, president,
prime minister and minister privileged to attend this unique
meeting,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   And J.J. Rawlings, the president of Ghana, singled out
multinational corporations as nourishing and ``thrusting''
corruption on Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Rawlings, and other African leaders this week,
didn't turn the spotlight back on the role of the continent's
rulers in nurturing such systems of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they portrayed themselves as victims of globalization,
burdened by debt, forced to accept harmful economic terms to secure
World Bank loans and falling far behind the rest of the world in
technological advancement.
</P>
<P>
   All week, one of the most forceful voices was The Gambia's
Jammeh, who said it was time that African nations received far
better reimbursement for their natural wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Africa today _ we are one of the richest
continents in terms of raw materials _ because of the lack of
technology and lack of means of extracting oil and diamonds and
other materials, foreign companies come and exploit and set their
own terms and say `Take it or leave it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It is either accept what they offer or you will have no jobs
for people,'' he said. ``We have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He also singled out the World Bank's influence. In The Gambia,
the World Bank pushed for privatization of several state
industries. The first was the peanut industry, which had employed
14,000 people. After the industry was sold, a foreign company
closed the processing plant and shipped the peanuts abroad for
processing. Now the industry employs fewer than 700 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now importing peanut oil into the country,'' Jammeh
said. ``It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Jammeh, 36, is not on the Clinton administration's list of
promising African leaders.
</P>
<P>
   That is largely due to the way he came to power _ a bloodless
military coup in 1994, only six months after Jammeh completed
military police training in Port McClellan, Ala. Jammeh said he and
other young army officers overthrew the government of Dawda Jawara
because of widespread corruption and economic stagnation that
resulted in a 84 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup, the United States and the European Union
suspended much of their trade. In 1996, Jammeh won election as
president in a vote that was questioned by some international
groups, and since then his government has been criticized by human
rights groups for detaining its critics, including journalists and
politicians. But he has also built numerous schools and formed a
foundation to provide better health care.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his relationship with the US government remains frosty.
</P>
<P>
   One of his priorities this week was to meet with human rights
activists and encourage them to observe next year's elections.
Peter Takiram Budde, director of the Africa division of Human
Rights Watch, said he appreciated Jammeh's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised and intrigued by the fact that he didn't want
people to come merely for the elections, but that he wanted them to
come for the process leading up to them as well,'' Budde said after
spending two hours with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to hide,'' Jammeh said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, perhaps because of his country's human rights record,
or because of Jammeh's outspoken opposition to the forces of
globalization, his country is having trouble attracting new
businesses. One possibility arose this week, with the announcement
of a plan for a $5 million investment to build a flour mill. If
terms are finalized, the deal would create 140 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Gambia has 1.4 million people. Jammeh understands the terms
of battle. But he said that he, and others on his continent, would
continue to demand better deals for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid of any power, big or small,'' he said. ``We
want to make sure Africa is respected.''
</P>
<P>
   All week long, the president of Africa's smallest nation wore a
traditional white robe and pointy, white slip-on leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere he went, from lunches with the leaders of the
West to the podium at the General Assembly, Jammeh carried a sword
wrapped in prayer beads. It was a tipoff, if one were needed, that
he was ready for battle.

GORE WIDENING LEAD OVER BUSH AMONG WOMEN VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Married, working, and with young children at home,
the Pennsylvania woman who took part in a focus group earlier this
week seemed to sum up George W. Bush's problem with female voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so classic male,'' she told Democratic pollster Celinda
Lake, referring to the Texas governor's proposal to privatize a
portion of Social Security. ``He wants to take your savings and
risk it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning development in the latest, post-Labor Day
round of national polls is Al Gore's grip on women voters.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president not only has erased the advantage Bush held
earlier with women. But with an appeal centered on social and
economic security for working families, Gore also has opened up a
gender gap _ call it a chasm _ that appears to be the biggest since
pollsters first noted this Mars-and-Venus disparity in voting
behavior in the 1980 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Saturday shows Gore leading
Bush 57 to 33 percent among female voters, Bush ahead among men 55
to 37 percent, and Gore with a slim overall lead of 47 percent to
Bush's 44 percent. A Reuters/Zogby poll, out Thursday, had Gore
with a 53.6 to 33 percent advantage among women and leading Bush by
5.4 percent overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like it. You have to wonder if it
is going to continue,'' pollster John Zogby said. ``Bush was doing
well among women, even Democratic women, and we have watched that
support dissipate. Bush is not going to get it back unless he
starts talking about issues women care about _ education and health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Linda DiVall says her newest survey,
completed Thursday night, shows only a 5 percent Gore lead among
women. ``Bush's rating with women is fine,'' DiVall said. However,
she added that to regain the advantage, ``he needs to become more
aggressive and energetic and enthusiastic, and do a better job
contrasting his issues with Gore and exploiting his own ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree that Gore has gained the upper hand among women
with both image and issues. First, he largely has neutralized the
so-called character question by declaring his independence from
President Clinton, and indirectly the scandals of his
administration, by picking Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his
running mate and by dramatizing his strong family values and loving
relationships with his wife, daughters, and mother at the
Democratic National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Gore has made it a point to address women's anxieties
about the fragility of the nation's prosperity with detailed plans
to guard the budget surplus and target tax credits for college
tuition, child care, and long-term care for elderly parents. When
he is not touting his own fiscal prudence, Gore accuses Bush of
wanting to take risks privatizing Social Security and Medicare,
federal programs that disproportionately benefit women.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is the young, middle-class mother in Pennsylvania, or
the senior citizens she surveys, economist Heidi Hartmann says
women have reason to be risk-adverse: Over their lifetime they
typically earn less than men, have been the first to be laid off,
less likely to receive private pensions, and have not accumulated
savings to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Bush has to promise that nobody who is retired,
or near retirement, will have any reduction in Social Security
benefits under his plan creates the concern for many women that
maybe he won't be able to keep his promise,'' said Hartmann,
president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a nonprofit
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Lake says the presidential race could come down to the fight to
capture two key female groups: elderly women, who went Republican
in the 1998 congressional elections and were particularly disgusted
by Clinton's extramarital affair, and so-called ``waitress moms'' _
working mothers, married and single, with some or no college
education _ who now make up 60 percent of the undecided vote.
``Waitress moms are back in charge of the election,'' Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   They are one reason Gore refers so often to ``working families''
in his speeches and has made their concerns central to his
campaign. Gore's proposals for universal preschool, pay equity,
raising the minimum wage, expanding the federal Family and Medical
Leave Act, and giving a five-year Social Security credit to women
who leave jobs to raise children are aimed directly at middle-class
mothers juggling work and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy is booming, the demands of balancing work and
family gets a little more intense,'' said Dianne Bystrom, director
of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa
State University. ``And women, who tend to be the family
caretakers, turn to government programs when they need a life
preserver.''
</P>
<P>
   In focus groups, women say they expected the economic boom would
allow them to work fewer hours and spend more time with their
children. Instead, a tight labor market, global competition, and
mobile technology are making employers demand more of them and
their spouses. Two recent strikes _ by Verizon Communications
workers in the Northeast and nurses at St. Vincent Hospital in
Worcester _ were fought over the issue of mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   A report titled ``The State of Working America'' released on
Labor Day by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank,
showed that between 1979 and 1998, the average number of hours
worked by middle-income women, married and with children, increased
from 884 hours to 1,360 hours annually, up roughly 12 weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to spend money on polls to find out that women,
as well as men, feel they are stretched too thin,'' said Ellen
Bravo, co-director of 9to5, an Milwaukee-based advocacy group for
working women. ``I would be happy to hear what Gore and Bush say
they will do about it. It is a real issue, and it hasn't been taken
up enough, it hasn't been addressed enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Bush began fulfilling his promise to get closer to
``real people'' and their issues when he spent more than a hour
chatting and taking questions at a telecommunications-equipment
plant near Pittsburgh. ``This is what I am good at,'' he said.
Aides to the GOP candidate said they expect him to visit with
families and explain how his proposals would benefit them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also expected to put renewed emphasis on education, an
issue that won him support from women, and on some of the other
``compassionate conservative'' themes that he stressed at the GOP
convention in Philadelphia _ an event whose program and symbolism
were designed, in part, to broaden the party's appeal among women.
Whether he can regain the lead among women is uncertain. No
Republican presidential candidate has held the advantage with women
voters since 1988, when Bush's father got 50 percent of the female
vote to 49 percent for former Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both Bush and Gore have agreed to answer the
question, ``Why should I vote for you?'' when they make separate,
hourlong appearances on the Oprah Winfrey show. Gore will face the
TV show's largely female audience of 22 million on Monday. Bush is
scheduled to appear Sept. 18.

THE LEAST LIKELY BURNING MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 10)  
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACK ROCK DESERT, Nev. _ There aren't many rules at Burning Man
_ the weeklong cyberhippie carnival in the middle of the Nevada
desert that ended on Labor Day. But one of them is ``No logos.'' I
was warned about this before I went. Unfortunately, I don't own any
clothing without logos. Who does? So as an anti-anticommercial
statement on my first morning there, I wore an old Creative Artists
Agency T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``CAA!'' a female voice shouted as I biked past her encampment.
``Burn in hell!''
</P>
<P>
   I turned the shirt inside out. After four days in this
brand-free zone, I would come to see her point.
</P>
<P>
   Burning Man, as you may or may not know, is devoted to ``radical
self-expression.'' In 1986 its founder, Larry Harvey, burned a
stick-man effigy on a Bay Area beach after breaking up with his
girlfriend. As the pyrocentric event grew into an annual rite,
authorities told Harvey to take his followers elsewhere. Now,
25,000 of them make the pilgrimage to the Black Rock Desert, a vast
dry lake bed 120 miles north of Reno. Artists. Performers. College
kids. Partyers. Techno-geeks. Ravers. Neo-paganists. Dot-com
yuppies. Professional and amateur nudists. The effigy has grown to
a 40-foot neon skeleton stuffed with wood and fireworks, whose
spectacular torching is the event's ritualistic climax.
</P>
<P>
   A small temporary city springs up on this lifeless playa, so
flat and desolate it can be used only for land speed tests and
fashion shoots. Imagine a hallucinogenic state fair that combines
elements of Woodstock, Mardi Gras, ``Alice in Wonderland'' and
Cirque du Soleil. In short: not my scene, in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Years of professionally mandated cynicism have shut off whatever
synapses are required to participate in a drum circle. I'm not a
hugger. I hate camping. But a couple of San Francisco friends who
had gone last year persuaded me I could enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, I figured. As long as I got the big bed in a
state-of-the-art recreational vehicle and would never be forced to
use a Porta-John.
</P>
<P>
   I was curious. Another friend was so affected by his Burning Man
experience last year that it inspired him to take an unscheduled
sabbatical from his New York television production business and
embark on a three-month ``tour of the planet.'' And elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   So I found myself way out of cell phone range, spending almost
12 hours setting up a Moroccan tent. I had never set up a tent,
much less an 18-by-30-foot canvas Ali Baba number. My friends John
and Ted (who made a quiet killing as an Internet entrepreneur) sent
a woman to Morocco to buy it for the occasion _ an order that
included pillows, ottomans and a few caftans. These guys, along
with John's brother, David, and I were the core team, as they say
in Silicon Valley, of a group that would swell to two more RVs and
a Chevy Suburban. It was a sprawling frat party free of the
civilizing influences of wives or girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   We camped on Anal Avenue. I hasten to explain that Black Rock
City is laid out like a clock face, with some streets fanning
straight out from 2 to 10 o'clock, at half-hour intervals, and
other curved concentric ones named for parts of the body. We were
between Knee Lane and Sex Drive. Look, it was the best parking spot
we could find in the middle of the night. Last year, the street
theme was the solar system, and my friends wound up on Uranus.
</P>
<P>
   John, who works for a health care start-up, and his brother, a
composer, filled our pseudo-souk with world-music instruments.
There were Indian and African drums, flutes, a zither, not one but
two didgeridoos, which by some standards is two didgeridoos too
many.
</P>
<P>
   Once the logistical nightmare of erecting the tent was over, it
was a hit. People kept stopping to admire it. A young woman on a
bicycle promised to come back later to belly-dance. The people
across the street _ who spent their entire time drinking, grilling
and shouting obscenities _ hated us for it. When one of our
happy-face pinatas went missing, they offered unconvincing denials.
</P>
<P>
   That night, we started our wanderings with a round of minigolf
on a clothing-optional course at the bottom of our street. Our day
had already featured a conversation with the owner of a pair of
pierced nipples. So we were becoming inured to all the female
nudity, partial and full. (Not really, but we were getting better
at not staring.)
</P>
<P>
   Spectators are the only kind of people Burning Man doesn't want
_ yahoos and squares like me in jeans and black windbreakers and
orange ``Lake Tahoe'' baseball caps. I could see that I was seen as
a nonparticipant who didn't contribute to the madness, but only
gawked at it. Twice I was described as ``funny looking.'' It was
getting to me.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone had a gimmick, some bit of personal performance
art _ a pope costume, a fur-covered bicycle, a tricked-out ``Mad
Max'' car. At night, they turned themselves into walking light
installations, festooned with fluorescent glow sticks, neon
headgear sculptured into a fish shape (there was a whole school of
them swimming around), or flashing red LED displays tracing
arteries and a beating heart.
</P>
<P>
   The more ambitious revelers ran moving sideshows. A perennial
favorite was a physicist who calls himself Megavolt. This mad
scientist stands on top of a truck rigged with two huge tesla coils
shooting deafening bolts of man-made lightning through his metal
suit. Perfectly safe, he says. But you couldn't help wondering if
the doc's brain hadn't accidentally been switched,
Frankenstein-style, with some stoner in the crowd gaping slackjawed
at his act.
</P>
<P>
   The air was cold and clear, but bad weather was coming. The next
day, Ted and I rode bikes out to ``the Man'' himself, the towering
effigy at the end of a promenade of monumental sculptures.
Suddenly, a dust storm rolled over us, filling the air with choking
white dust loaded with alkali from the lake bed. With no more than
five feet of visibility, we pedaled in the general direction of our
camp. I felt like T.E. Lawrence, my CAA T-shirt tied over my mouth
and nose to keep out the cancer dust.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Others who have seen the pictures thought it looked more like a
scene out of ``Ishtar.''
</P>
<P>
   At least now I'd participated. I'd have a tale to tell at the
Center Camp cafe, a tented 24-hour freak show that made the bar in
``Star Wars'' look like a TGI Fridays. An image from the cafe that
will haunt my dreams is the old man I saw walking out of it one
afternoon, shaking and stark naked, like somebody's lost
grandfather or the ghost of Timothy Leary back for one last crazy
trip.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The drug component of Burning Man cannot be denied. A bulletin
board in Center Camp posted results of a survey taken at last
year's festival. About half the respondents said they had indulged
in illicit substances. Half of them cited marijuana, and 20 percent
Ecstasy. The Pershing County Police patrolled the streets, always
in cars and trucks, some marked ``K-9 Unit.'' Drug-taking appeared
to be clandestine, not brazen. Black Rock Rangers, volunteers in
overalls with no official authority or status, ran interference
between the ``citizens'' and the law, discouraging blatant drug
consumption or other illegal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One Black Rock Ranger told us he had stopped a bout of domestic
violence in a tent and been punched by a drunk the night before. We
asked if either he or the police ever stopped any public nudity.
``Are you kidding?'' he said. ``If ain't too cold and I ain't
working, I'm naked.'' The Ranger then informed us that his nickname
was Nude Marty.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't about to get naked, but by the second and third nights,
I did have a nighttime get-up that I hoped would at least shield me
from public ridicule. I took an orange-and-black wool poncho that
John had brought and tied red glow sticks to the fringe. A
half-baked effort compared with the simple but powerful dreadlock
effect Ted's younger brother Mark (a sculptor) created by
safety-pinning dozens of glow sticks to his fishing hat. The fuzzy
yellow bunny suit and happy-face head that Roland, one of our other
camp mates, had on outdid us all. I looked like a chili-pepper
promotion at Taco Bell. Still, the poncho got me my first hug, from
a slightly plump young woman outside one of the miniraves on the
playa. She must have been on drugs.

GORE CHALLENGES BUSH ON SOCIAL SECURITY INVESTMENT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ George W. Bush should explain to the American
people before the election how he would pay up to $1 trillion in
transition costs for his plan to let workers invest some of their
Social Security taxes in the stock market, Al Gore said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Pivoting off a planned speech about education and job training,
the Democratic presidential contender focused on his rival's
repeated unwillingness to provide such details. Bush has said the
details will be worked out in negotiations with Congress after he
is elected.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said the specifics are especially important
considering the $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut that Bush wants to
provide. Gore contends the tax cut would crowd out other uses for
projected budget surpluses, including improving education and
retraining workers for the high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have to make hard choices, we don't pretend that we
can have our surplus and eat it, too,'' Gore told students and
administrators at Delgado Community College. ``We face up to the
hard choices and just make 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It does matter if the numbers add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling Gore's statement was a letter sent to Bush by a longtime
Social Security commissioner and two other academics. They wrote:
``We do not understand how you are going to keep your promise not
to cut Social Security benefits for those at or near retirement
while diverting substantial payroll tax revenues into private
accounts. . . . The question is, where will that $1 trillion come
from?''
</P>
<P>
   The letter's authors _ Robert Ball, Social Security commissioner
from 1962 to 1973; Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution; and Alicia Munnell, a Boston College economics
professor _ said the only options are to cut benefits for existing
retirees; pay the costs with the surplus; pay them from the
existing Social Security trust fund, accelerating its insolvency;
or borrow the money.
</P>
<P>
   All three authors are not formally affiliated with the Gore
campaign, but have been advising the vice president and offering
analysis to reporters on the campaign's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign criticized the trio, offering excerpts of
interviews in which all three expressed support for having the
government _ not individuals _ invest Social Security money in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that Al Gore would unleash his own partisan
advisers to attack Governor Bush on Social Security, since all
three advocate making the federal government the largest investor
in the stock market and increasing taxes to shore up Social
Security,'' said Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett. ``Governor Bush's
plan locks away $2.4 trillion to save and strengthen Social
Security and provides younger workers more control over their
retirement savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential contenders acknowledge that the Social
Security system must be reformed to maintain its solvency. While
the system currently takes in more money than it pays out in
benefits, that will change with the retirement of the Baby Boom
generation and increasing life expectancies.
</P>
<P>
   By 2015, the Social Security Administration will start paying
out more in benefits that it takes in from payroll taxes. By 2037,
the system is projected to be insolvent. Gore wants to extend it to
2054 by paying down the national debt and plowing the interest
savings back into the Social Security trust fund. Bush contends
that Gore would do so with IOUs that would ultimately cost $67
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush hasn't directly addressed the solvency issue, he has
proposed allowing younger workers to invest some of their 12.4
percent Social Security tax in the stock market to achieve greater
retirement savings. The Texas governor hasn't defined a percentage,
but most discussion centers on 2 percentage points, or about 16
percent of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   A ``transition cost'' would be incurred as younger workers
shifted over to the private accounts, reducing the amount of money
flowing into the trust fund even as it is being drawn upon to pay
benefits for existing retirees. Experts say it could create a cash
shortfall of up to $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced his proposal in April, Bush said he wanted to
avoid details to leave negotiating room with Congress and avoid the
gridlock that doomed President Clinton's proposal to provide
universal health insurance.

BLACK ROCK DESERT, Nev.: been on drugs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   To escape a flash rainstorm, we ducked into Space Cowboy, a
tented theme rave populated almost entirely by men and women in
Western gear. Until then, I'd never really understood the appeal of
raves and the poundingly repetitive techno beat that drives them. I
remember my niece telling me she felt old at raves when she was 23.
How in tarnation do these kids move like that? I used to think I
had rhythm. At 150 beats a minute, all I could do was try to blind
people with my flashing red New York Taxi Wand (a gift!) to
distract them from the geezer in their midst. At Space Cowboy, in
my dusty jeans and Day-Glo poncho, I felt like I'd finally found my
tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The rain turned the ground into mud that locked bicycle wheels
and turned shoes into platforms. Shades of Woodstock. I hated
Woodstock, all three of them _ not that I ever went. The whole
hippie commune ideal it conjures, the woolly politics turn me off.
There are no politics at Burning Man, except a practical
environmental commandment _ ``Leave no trace!'' _ that keeps the
peace with the Bureau of Land Management, and a libertarian social
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do anything you want as long as it doesn't interfere with
anyone else's good time,'' as I read in the daily alternative
paper; there is also an official daily paper, which is already
pretty alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Smith could have lived with that. So could a Deadhead or
any Silicon Valley chief executive in our camp.
</P>
<P>
   For all the tribal drum beating, what really drives Burning Man
is individualism. In the 1960s, hippies young and old basically
wore the same pair of bell-bottoms. Here, the point is not to wear
the same thing as anyone else. ``I just want to be different like
all the other different people'' was Ted's joke about all the
nonconformist conformism around us. But it was energizing. What we
labeled the ``obnoxious friendliness'' of most of the Burners was
infectious. Before long, you stop fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   I went soft. I drummed _ once. For my last night, I asked Tracy,
our resident face-paint artist, to give me a couple of red-glitter
tears. When the Man burned, the sad chili-pepper salesman would
bear witness! I hugged that chubby chick back.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides the nudity, the allure of Burning Man is aesthetic.
Aesthetic escapism from Disney and MTV and Old Navy and Starbucks.
I understood why people covered up the sign on their Ryder rental
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Even for a hard-core free-market capitalist like me, branding is
starting to seem like a plague, turning cities into billboards,
foreign countries into fast-food courts. In his book on globalism,
``The Lexus and the Olive Tree,'' Thomas L. Friedman argues that no
two countries with McDonald's franchises have ever gone to war. The
price of this supersized Pax Romana is, well, a McDonald's in every
country.
</P>
<P>
   Driving back into civilization _ or, rather, Reno _ I looked at
the Emporio Armani logo on my sunglasses case. I'd never given it a
second thought. It looked kind of stupid.

OIL PRICES ON VERGE OF A FALL, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  DUPLICATION WARNING: Story is being double filed in ``a'' general
news and ``f'' financial categories. 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By DAN PILLER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As President Clinton and other world leaders wring their hands
about a 10-year high in crude oil prices, some energy traders are
putting out the word that oil prices could tumble _ and soon.
</P>
<P>
   They say that, contrary to recent reports, there is no shortage
of crude oil. Rather, they say, the recent run-up of crude prices
above $30 per barrel reflects artificial trading conditions. Thus,
the expected increase in production by members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries this weekend could trigger a
sudden fall in crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in crude oil prices would be a mixed blessing in Texas.
Although motorists would get some relief from pump prices that are
50 percent higher than last September, the state's oil producers
could be thrown into the pit of low prices they endured two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that when oil prices start down, the correction
could be anything but mild,'' said energy analyst Frederick Leuffer
of the Bear Stearns investment firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Houston oil analyst Ken Miller of Purvin &AMP; Gertz said on
Thursday that if OPEC countries decide to increase production in
order to stabilize prices, ``they very well could cause prices to
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Houston consulting firm, Groppe, Long &AMP; Littell, said
Thursday that ``missing barrels'' of crude aren't being counted in
the international energy statistics that show tight worldwide crude
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   George Littell of the firm said that if OPEC ministers add to
their daily production when they meet this weekend, as expected,
``it is very possible for them to cause another period of low
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Texans in the energy business know how quickly things can
change. Three years ago, the industry was enjoying stable prices
ranging between $20 and $22 per barrel, well above the $15 price
considered the profit level for producers.
</P>
<P>
   Then OPEC, which controls prices by virtue of having 70 percent
of the world's crude oil supplies, decided to loosen the production
spigots. The result was a plunge in prices to as low as $10 per
barrel by early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The results were dramatic. Fort Worth's biggest oil company,
Union Pacific Resources Group, laid off 400 workers. UPR moved its
remaining 800 Fort Worth jobs to Houston after being acquired this
year by Anadarko Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Oil giants Exxon and Mobil merged, as did British Petroleum and
Amoco. Oryx Energy of Dallas was bought by Kerr-McGee of Oklahoma
and, like Union Pacific Resources, saw its jobs moved out of town.
On the service side, Halliburton and Dresser Industries did a
crosstown merger in Dallas. In the process, Halliburton eliminated
the 400 jobs at its Fort Worth production facility.
</P>
<P>
   The low prices were reversed beginning in the spring when OPEC
was able to impose production quotas on its members. As a result,
motorists have paid around $1.50 for regular self-serve gasoline
this summer, and prices reached $2 a gallon in California and parts
of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says the crude oil market could be on the precipice of a
sudden drop because of a phenomenon in futures trading called
``backwardation.''
</P>
<P>
   With backwardation, prices for a commodity such as crude oil are
lower in future months than they are at present. In the case of
crude, the $35 per barrel price this week for October delivery
slides to $30 for April and $28.45 for September 2001.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon causes the big oil companies, which do the bulk
of energy futures trading, to buy the bare minimum of crude for
their refineries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to pay $34 for crude today when the price may be
$4 to $6 per barrel less in a few months,'' said Miller. The
refining companies themselves don't comment on their futures
trading strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But with an increase in OPEC production, the reverse could set
in, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Saudis might have to let the price of oil drop down to as
low as $20 per barrel in order to stabilize the market,'' he said,
reflecting the widespread belief that the equilibrium price _ where
demand meets supply _ is the same $20-$24 per barrel level where it
traded before its plunge, beginning in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If the drop happens, he said, oil companies would quickly buy
more crude and thus produce more gasoline and other distillates,
driving down retail prices for motorists and users of home heating
oil.
</P>
<P>
   That would be, in traders' terms, a ``contango,'' a situation in
which futures prices are higher than the current price. That would
cause oil companies to buy crude furiously to lock in the lower
prices, thus duplicating the trading environment that caused crude
prices to plunge two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The crude is there for the buying, according to Bear Stearns'
Leuffer, who says there are about 250 million barrels of crude oil
that are ``missing'' from international reports. Those barrels are
in tankers at sea and sitting in various pipelines and storage
facilities in OPEC nations, going unsold because of backwardation,
he contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is a lot of oil in Asia and on the water, and
it's coming here next,'' Leuffer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that international energy statistics that traders have
been using to justify shortages and higher prices are ``notoriously
unreliable.'' Instead, Leuffer contends, higher tanker rates this
year show that plenty of oil is moving around but that it hasn't
yet been directed to refineries in the U.S. and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that oil is headed for a tumble,'' Leuffer said.

WILLIAMS DESERVES TO RETURN IN 2001

   Jimy Williams will be the manager of the Red Sox next year, if
he chooses to be. Williams has a year left on his contract. The Red
Sox feel he has done a solid job managing the team since he started
in 1997 and that he is one of the best managers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   We bring this up because there seems to be a growing rumor that
general manager Dan Duquette is ready to get rid of Williams and
bring in Felipe Alou, his old friend from Montreal. Alou was the
manager of the Expos when Duquette was their GM, before coming to
Boston in January 1994. Reportedly, even though Alou has another
year left on his contract, he will finish as manager this season,
setting up a conspiracy theory with Duquette dumping Williams and
bringing in Alou.
</P>
<P>
   It says here that would be a lousy thing to do because, even
though Williams is quirky, he has been the best manager this team
has had since Dick Williams. The job he and pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan have done with that staff this season is remarkable. The
Red Sox have gotten nothing out of second and third base this year,
and are still hanging in the playoff race.

   Tapegate: The Jets think they know who sent a coaching tape to
one sportswriter in the Boston area and another in New York, in an
effort to belittle Bill Parcells. The No. 1 suspect is current
Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. No. 2 is former Jets offensive
coordinator Charlie Weis, now the Patriots' offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets say the tapes are coaching tapes, which would only be
available to the coaches. The video did not come from national
televison or NFL Films. This particular version could only come
from coaching tapes belonging to the New York Jets, because they
show Parcells and Belichick on the sideline during the closing
minutes of the Patriots' 30-28 win at the Meadowlands last Sept.
12. The Jets believe that when Belichick's group of former New York
employees came to Foxborough, they took some of the tapes with
them. Then, 10 days ago, they sent them out of the Patriots office
in Foxborough to the sportswriters with a note saying they show
that Parcells was confused at the end of the game and didn't know
the score. The stories written off the tapes by these writers say
that because Parcells didn't know the score, he mismanaged the
game's final six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is a lie,'' said Parcells. ``I knew the score. I
knew we were ahead. When the Patriots made a first down deep in our
end on a pass to Troy Brown with two minutes to go, I felt the game
was over for us. We only had one timeout left. They could run the
clock down and kick an easy field goal to beat us, which they did.
During that final two minutes, I didn't pay attention to what was
going on with the time. My mind was on what I was going to say to
the team about all of the injuries we had that day and losing such
a tough game. It was a very unusual set of circumstances and I was
trying to sort out what I was going to say to my team in the locker
room. This thing is so stupid, it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets think Belichick was trying to counter the criticism of
him in Parcells's new book, ``The Final Season,'' (written with
yours truly) which went on sale this week.

   It was 40 years ago today that their paths crossed for the
second time, and together Gino Cappelletti and Frank Tripucka made
history. Cappelletti scored the first points in the history of the
American Football League with a 35-yard field goal in the first
period of the Patriots' opening 13-10 upset loss to the Denver
Broncos. Tripucka threw the first touchdown pass in the new league,
a 59-yarder to Al Carmichael in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny thing about that game,'' said Tripucka, an All-American
at Notre Dame in the late 1940s, and a star in Canada before being
called back to the AFL. ``I had met Gino years before in
Saskatchewan. He was just out of college and he came to Canada
looking to play ball. But we could keep only eight Americans in
those days, and only one quarterback. I already had the job. I
didn't know he could kick until he kicked the field goal. He never
tried that with us. I didn't know he could catch until he became
one of the best receivers in the AFL, because he didn't try that
with us. Our coach, Frank Filchock, never tried him at any other
position other than quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the AFL opener, Cappelletti, who went on to
become the all-time leading scorer in AFL history, was not a pass
catcher. He was a safety. Later in the year, he established a club
record with three interceptions in a game against Babe Parilli,
then the Oakland quarterback, who would join the Patriots and
Cappelletti in '61.
</P>
<P>
   ``We killed Denver three weeks before that (43-6) in a preseason
game in Providence,'' said Cappelletti. ``We had a great preseason
(4-1). They didn't win a game. They were on the road for three
weeks and should have been washed out. Then they came in and
knocked us over. We were stunned.'' But Cappelletti found out years
later there was a good reason for the sudden Denver turnaround. ``I
bumped into Filchock (the same coach who cut him in Canada and was
the Broncos' first head coach) and he told me what happened.
(Denver) had practiced at BU the evening before the opener. We came
in to practice at night, because our coach (Lou Saban) wanted to
practice under the lights, at the same time of the game the next
night. Filchock told me when he was leaving practice, walking up
the street, he looked down on the field and saw us practicing.
There was a gate open so he walked in and stood up at the back of
the stands. He watched the whole practice. Normally, the practice
before a game wouldn't show much, but Saban kept us out there for a
couple of hours, ran everything we had on offense and defense. So
by the time practice was all over, Filchock knew everything we were
going to do. They stopped our offense cold the next night.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripucka remembers the game this way: ``I threw a touchdown pass
to Carmichael, then in the second half, our kicker, Gene Mingo, ran
back a punt for a touchdown. That's the only time he ever did it.
He really wasn't a kick returner, but in those days players had to
do more than one job, so they used him as a returner. In those days
in the AFL, it was a league of haves and have-nots. The rich owners
had the good teams because they could afford to pay the better
players. Denver had the poorest team in the league. We couldn't
even afford sweatsuits to have for cold weather. We didn't have
playbooks. We never had a game plan. Filchock was a different kind
of coach. The players never watched films of the other team, or the
game they played the week before. He didn't believe in a lot of
practice. In fact, he didn't like to practice. The night before a
game, when he got the team together to watch a film, it wasn't
football. He showed Mickey Mouse cartoons. He thought they were
funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played for four years and had to retire because I was 38 and
couldn't do it anymore. They've retired my number (18) in Denver.
There are only three numbers retired. Mine, Floyd Little's 44, and
John Elway's 7. I'm proud of that. I think I'm up there for
surviving four years,'' he said with a laugh. Meanwhile, the
league, now folded into the NFL, has survived 40 years.

   Antoine Walker is right. The Celtics aren't going anywhere until
they get a center. You can't play defense at a high level in the
NBA unless you have a center who can intimidate the opposition with
his rebounding and shot-blocking ability . . . There are some bad
vibes on one of the local professional teams. The ex-wife of one of
the players has been blowing the whistle to wives of others
players, saying their hubbies have been cheating on them on the
road. This has been causing problems on the team, very similar to
the situation Wade Boggs and Margo Adams triggered on the Red Sox
years ago . . . Here is the latest line on the Boston teams from
the Mirage Sports Book in Las Vegas: The over/under on the Patriots
is 7 1/2, meaning the oddsmakers don't think they will win eight
games this year. They are 40-1 to win the AFC and 75-1 to win the
Super Bowl. The Celtics are the longest shots of the locals, 125-1
to win the NBA title. The Bruins check in at 55-1 to win the
Stanley Cup. The Sox are 7-1 to win the American League pennant and
14-1 to win the World Series. The Yankees are 12-5 favorites to win
the division.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   This is the assessment of one NFL general manager who watched
the films of the Patriots' loss to Tampa Bay last Sunday: ``It is
the worst performance I have ever seen by an offensive line. They
got slaughtered. Not on any single play did they block all four
Tampa defensive linemen. Not once. If you graded out every Tampa
linemen, all of them would have been 90-plus, they were that
dominant. On one play, (Warren) Sapp took the guard in front of
him, ran him down the line 7 yards, and threw him into the
ballcarrier, knocking them both down. I've never seen anything like
that before in this league'' . . . The sale talks on Suffolk Downs
are ongoing. The owners of Suffolk have come back with a
counteroffer. If the buyers take the deal on the table, they can
take over the East Boston track . . . The word is that the Seattle
defensive back the Dolphins torched consistently last Sunday in
their 23-0 victory was former Patriot Chris Canty . . . Don't think
they aren't a little upset in Pawtucket that the Red Sox called up
some of their best players heading into the final weekend, after
which the PawSox lost their final four games to fall out of the
playoff picture. The Red Sox should have left them on the farm
until Pawtucket clinched before bringing them to the big club,
especially if they were going to come to Boston and sit on the
bench.

   The Bruins are going to support defenseman Marty McSorley at his
trial in Vancouver later this month. Charges have been brought
against McSorley for using his stick to hit rugged Donald Brashear
in the head in the closing seconds of a game in Vancouver earlier
this year. ``We're going to back him up as much as we can,'' said
Bruins president Harry Sinden. ``We feel the entire story should be
told. There were things that happened in that game before the final
minute that played into what happened.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BATH, England _ Across the Atlantic, the role of religion in the
American presidential race has been followed with a mixture of
interest and polite puzzlement. What Europeans find so striking is
not that there is a Jewish vice presidential candidate, but that
Joseph Lieberman wears his piety on his sleeve, just like other
American politicians of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing so vividly illustrates the gulf between America and
Europe. After all, a Jewish leader is not new for Europe. France
had a Jewish prime minister in 1936, England in 1868, and Spain, of
all countries, in 1835, but none of them _ Leon Blum, Benjamin
Disraeli or Juan Alvarez Mendizabal _ were devoutly observant, as
Lieberman is. Indeed, Disraeli had been baptized as an
Episcopalian, just like Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is the cradle of institutional Christianity, but today,
institutional religion in Europe is on the point of collapse. Fewer
than one French person in 10 goes to church even once a year, and
the Roman Catholic church has never been less influential in the
life of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In my country, we have a Church of England ``by law
established,'' with the queen as its supreme governor. And its
services are now regularly attended by a mere 2 percent of the
population. So it goes across Europe; the collapse of organized
Christianity, for better or worse, can be seen from Ireland to
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the advanced industrial world, only in the United States does
religion thrive. Polls have shown that a remarkable 40 percent of
Americans claim to worship in various churches, synagogues and
mosques.
</P>
<P>
   This gulf is reflected in politics on either side of the
Atlantic. European politicians invoke God rarely if at all, and not
many of them even pretend to be personally devout. Tony Blair is a
High Episcopalian who often goes to Mass with his Catholic wife,
but he is an exception. Indeed, only a minority of British prime
ministers in the 20th century could be called Christians in any
serious sense. Winston Churchill, for example, went to church on
formal occasions, but was privately agnostic.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the days when European statesmen were more often
privately inspired by faith, as Gladstone and Bismarck were in
their different ways, they did not parade their religious devotion,
as this year's presidential candidates have all felt obliged to do.
The only one who didn't was Bill Bradley, and look where it got
him.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when an American politician could have publicly
echoed the Italian nationalist Cavour's phrase about ``a free
church in a free state.'' He might even have privately agreed with
H.L. Mencken that you respect the other guy's religious faith in
the way you respect his belief that his wife is beautiful and his
kids are smart.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Today, Lieberman continually calls on the Almighty
and asserts that religion is the only true basis for morality, a
claim that makes us very uneasy here. George W. Bush, in his guise
as a born-again Christian, excites derision among English
commentators, and so does Al Gore when he says he asks himself,
``What would Jesus do?''
</P>
<P>
   What indeed? What would Jesus do about the budget surplus, China
trade or Sierra Leone? The gospels provide remarkably little
guidance about practical conduct, certainly not in military or
economic matters.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt European bafflement at American religiosity has
overtones of condescension toward American cultural
``backwardness,'' a condescension that often thinly conceals envy
and resentment. But in this case, the cynical Old World may have a
point.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of preaching, Lieberman could simply say, ``I take my
religion from the Torah and my politics from America.'' He could
recognize that plenty of unbelievers lead highly moral lives and
that some religious people don't. He might reflect on what his
people went through in vehemently religious societies. He might
note that his political career, like those of Disraeli and Blum,
has benefited from the defeat of political sectarianism.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of saying that he is going to keep doing what he
does because he believes it's the American way, he could
acknowledge that the free exercise of religion is truly part of
American way _ and one of the blessings of a free, open and secular
society.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The quality of teachers has been declining for decades, and no
one wants to talk about it. Principals know the truth and have to
deal with it as best they can, but unions are reluctant to admit
weaknesses in any of their members, colleges are loath to
acknowledge the poor quality of their education programs, and
administrators are afraid that confronting the problem will further
erode confidence in public education.
</P>
<P>
   And so we tolerate inadequate teacher education, noncompetitive
pay, inflexible work rules and regulations denying bright people in
other professions a chance to switch to teaching. That is why we
not only need a renewed national commitment to teaching, but
alternative teacher certification programs like the one we have
adopted in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Which of our college-age students, today, are preparing for
teaching? A 1997 report by the National Center for Education
Statistics found that education majors were placed in remedial
college courses at higher rates than their counterparts in the
humanities and social sciences _ nearly twice as many education
majors needed remedial English and math classes.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, a quarter of those teaching in the public
schools earned their bachelor's degrees from institutions that
Barron's rankings of colleges and universities describes as ``less
competitive or noncompetitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully 31 percent of New York City public school teachers who
took the liberal arts and sciences test required for certification
failed, compared to only 4.7 percent in the rest of New York state.
Admittedly, the problem is especially acute in New York, where low
salaries, high living costs and a lack of recognition for
extraordinary accomplishments scare many candidates away. But the
story of declining teacher quality is consistent across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   So is an impending shortage of certified teachers. The
Department of Education estimates a nationwide loss of 2.5 million
teachers over the next decade as teachers born in the baby boom
years reach retirement age. These are also the enduring teachers
from an older era of higher quality.
</P>
<P>
   Certification is a minimum standard and should be required of
all teachers. But minimum standards should not be the goal. Our
children need teachers with outstanding abilities and rigorous
academic training. We need to find more powerful means to attract
the most promising candidates to the teaching profession.
</P>
<P>
   To recruit a higher caliber of college student into teaching, we
must make it both more lucrative and more revered. To improve the
quality of the preparation teachers get, we need stringent
standards for entrance into teacher education, college classes
geared to the real needs of schools and increased rigor of
certification exams in the content areas. We need improved models
of teacher development that begin with undergraduate internships,
continue with student teaching and culminate in apprenticeships
with mentors and ongoing training.
</P>
<P>
   We must also stop closing the door to would-be teachers who did
not choose to take education courses in college. Alternative
certification programs like New York's teaching fellowships admit
bright people who may not have thought about teaching until it is
too late in their undergraduate program to switch to education and
mid-career changers who want to do something more meaningful with
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on the local level we must have a stronger commitment
to paying teachers a competitive wage. Teachers 22 to 28 years old
earn an average of $7,894 less a year than their college-educated
counterparts in other professions. The gap increases threefold by
the time they are 44. Inevitably, teaching is not going to be as
financially lucrative as some other careers, but it shouldn't mean
taking a vow of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   School systems, particularly the New York City Board of
Education, must reduce the bureaucratic hurdles to becoming a
teacher, work to increase teacher salaries and address the work
conditions of inner city schools. In return, we must be able to
demand more hours, more accountability and better work from an
improved teaching force. This may be our last opportunity to avoid
locking in mediocrity for a generation.
</P>

   NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT1 _ Outwardly Pat Nixon gave every
indication that she was the perfect politician's wife. Inwardly,
however, she was miserable: she hated public life and campaigning.
Richard Nixon was cold and dismissive toward her, and associates
never saw any signs of affection. This excerpt describes their
troubled relationship, punctuated by accounts of abuse, on occasion
allegedly physical. 1,100 words. NORTH AMERICAN RIGHTS ONLY.
</P>
<P>
   NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT2 _ This excerpt describes how winning
the preidency changed Richard Nixon. He lavishly redecorated the
White House living quarters, and set up nine separate offices, all
with expensive communication systems, yet kept a very leisurely
work schedule. As former Republican Party chairman Len Hall put it,
Nixon became ``regal, kinglike. ... He loved power, power to sit in
the Oval Office and just issue orders. ...'' 1,100 words. NORTH

   NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT3 _ This excerpt describes how, in 1968,
the founder of the Dreyfus Fund gave Richard Nixon a large quantity
of the prescription drug Dilantin, which Nixon began taking without

 &HT;    By ANTHONY SUMMERS with ROBBYN SWAN 
 &HT;    (North American rights only) 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Anthony Summers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (In his book Mr. Summers describes a troubled relationship
between Pat and Richard Nixon, punctuated by accounts of abuse, on
occasion allegedly physical.)
</P>
<P>
   Evlyn Dorn, Nixon's longtime secretary, saw her boss reach out
to touch his wife's hand only once _ and then merely to steady her
as they stood in the back of a car. ``He had a way of ignoring
her,'' she said. ``I never saw him touch Pat's hand,'' recalled Tom
Dixon, a broadcaster who acted as an aide during elections in the
late forties. ``I have never seen quite so cold an arrangement.''
...
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never, ever, ever, ever any sign of affection
whatsoever,'' recalled Kandy Stroud, who specialized in covering
Pat for Women's Wear Daily. ``I rode in the limousine with them,
the first time I was alone with them together. He did all the
talking, she did none. She just sat there ... like a staff member
... the entire ride and he didn't refer to her, or defer to her.''
...
</P>
<P>
   The damage from Richard Nixon's loss in the 1960 presidential
election went beyond politics. In 1961, journalists in search of a
``human interest story'' got more than they bargained for. On the
day the moving van was being loaded for the family's return to
California, Pat suddenly came rushing out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   She was ``screaming like a banshee,'' recalled Washington Daily
News reporter Tom Kelly, ``completely out of control. Her hair was
disheveled, her face red, and her eyes were wild.'' Kelly and an
Associated Press colleague quickly discovered that it was they who
were the targets of Pat's rage. She stood cursing them, claiming
that a hostile press had caused her husband's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Pat the public had never seen, a Pat embittered by
the experience of the previous year. ``I've given up everything I
loved,'' she had said even before the campaign, referring to the
loss of privacy and family time. Other intimates noted that much of
Pat's rage was directed against her husband, the husband who had
ignored her appeals to quit politics. ...
</P>
<P>
   There are varying versions of her reactions during dinner at a
restaurant in late September 1961, the night Nixon publicly
announced he would run for California governor. Future cabinet
member Bob Finch's wife, Carol, recalled Pat's saying suddenly,
``I'm trapped. Which way can I go?'' ...
</P>
<P>
   But in public Pat acted out her role, telling reporters, ``Our
hearts are in politics and we are glad to be back in the thick of
it.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Watching as she went through the motions, the Los Angeles
Times's Richard Bergholz thought her ``just a stick of furniture
sitting there ... she was obviously on edge. He abused her
perpetually.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Word spread about an ugly moment during a plane trip from San
Francisco (during the 1962 California governor's race, which he
lost to Pat Brown by 297,000). Pat, sitting apart from her husband
while he talked with others, had asked if she might join them for a
drink. The answer, reportedly was a snarled, ``Keep you f---ing
mouth shut.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   In the blur of Nixon's defeat, when he was drunk in his suite at
the Beverly Hilton, aides were preoccupied with preventing him
going downstairs. Pat reportedly sat alone, sobbing quietly in an
adjoining room. ...
</P>
<P>
   Future cabinet member Bob Finch, Nixon's intimate for many
years, once admitted cautiously that he had sometimes witnessed
Nixon in a rage, a rage ``irrational in that it was much broader
than the incident that provided it.'' Speechwriter William Safire
would write of Nixon's capacity of ``deep, dark rage.'' Pat had a
temper too. ...
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that that Nixon had physically abused Pat circulated in
Washington for years. Two investigative reporters stumbled on such
stories, but none were at the time well enough sourced to publish.
While writing ``The Final Days'' with Carl Bernstein, their account
of the end of the Nixon presidency, Bob Woodward was told of an
incident in which Nixon supposedly hurt his wife badly enough to
put her in the hospital. Seymour Hersh, while working on his study
of Henry Kissinger, ``The Price of Power,'' was told by sources of
three alleged wife-beating incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after resigning the presidency, Hersh was told, Nixon
attacked Pat at their home in San Clemente. According to the
source, she had to be taken to a nearby emergency room. The doctor
who treated her corroborated the story. The most compelling account
of such abuse, however, relates to the 1962 defeat and comes from
several sources. Governor Pat Brown said years later, ``We got word
at one stage of the campaign that he kicked the hell out of her,
hit her.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Los Angeles area reporter, Bill Van Petten, years later
told a friend, the writer Jon Ewing, of his experiences while
covering the gubernatorial campaign. Nixon, he said, had been a
``terrible, belligerent drunk, mean when drunk, and would become
obnoxious at night when in hotels on the road.''...
</P>
<P>
   (After the defeat) Nixon ``beat Pat badly ... so badly that she
could not go out the next day. ``This had happened before,'' Van
Petten was told, ``and aides like Haldeman, Robert Finch, or
Ehrlichman would on occasion have to go in and intervene. On this
particular night there was a lot of commotion at an ungodly hour,
and one or some of the aides had to run in and pull him off Pat.
She had bruises on her face. Everyone was shaken up.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   First credible corroboration of the 1962 beating allegation was
provided during the writing of this book by John Sears, a former
Nixon aide who went on to political distinction. ... He was to be a
key figure in the Nixon comeback in 1968 and would join the Nixon
White House as a political strategist under Ehrlichman.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he met the couple, Sears recalled in a 1997
interview, the marriage seemed to him ``peculiar.'' ... Then Sears
related what he had learned of Nixon's physical abuse. ``The family
lawyer told me that Nixon had hit her in 1962 and that she had
threatened to leave him over it. ... I'm not talking about a smack.
He blackened her eye. ... I had heard about that from Pat Hillings
(a longtime Nixon friend and associate) as well ...'' Sears
identified the ``lawyer'' as the late Waller Taylor, who in 1962
had been a senior partner at Adams, Duque and Hazeltine, the firm
Nixon had joined after his defeat by John F. Kennedy. ... According
to Taylor, divorce was discussed at this time. ...
</P>
<P>
   In her memoir of her mother, Julie Nixon recalled how the day
after the 1962 election ended, ``Mother lay on her bed, the room
darkened by closed shutters, and cried in front of us for the first
time we could remember. Tricia and I sat on the floor by the bed
and cried also.'' That evening close family friends took both the
Nixon daughters away to their home for a few days. ``When we
returned,'' said Julie, ``my parents seemed fine.'' But ``There was
a sadness,'' as Tricia told Nixon himself later when he asked for
her teen-age memories of the 1962 race, ``and the sadness went on
for years.''

<P>
   (This excerpt describes how winning the presidency changed
Richard Nixon. As former Republican Party chairman Len Hall put it,
Nixon became ``regal, kinglike. ... He loved power, power to sit in
the Oval Office and just issue orders. ...'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you dare call me Dick. I am the president of the United
States. When you speak to me you call me Mr. President.'' So
commanded Nixon, early in the presidency, at a meeting with Florida
banker Hoke Maroon, a man he had known for years. ``He was as
obsessed with the office as any president has ever been,'' his old
friend Bob Finch ruefully recalled. ``He gloried in it, night and
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The outward signs were quickly obvious. Before the Nixons moved
into the White House, the message they had conveyed to the public
was that it did not need refurbishing. That soon changed, however,
and a massive remodeling program, costing millions, began.
</P>
<P>
   Military planes were dispatched to Italy to bring back green
watered silk for just one medium-size room. An ornate four-poster
bed for Nixon cost six thousand dollars, its draperies ten
thousand. The next presidential couple to occupy the White House,
the Fords, thought it unbelievable, ``something Marie Antoinette
would have slept in,'' and promptly had it removed.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Lyndon Johnson had maintained three Boeing passenger
jets, Nixon had three Boeings, eleven Lockheed Jetstars, and
sixteen helicopters at his exclusive disposal. The existing Air
Force One was refurbished at a cost of $800,000, with the emphasis
on the First Family's accommodation. Later, when a new plane was
delivered _ with a layout the Nixons did not like _ another
$750,000 went toward the alterations.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet was not used solely for government business. Nixon's
extended family, including in-laws, availed themselves of the
planes. When a troubled official reported that senior aides were
taking Air Force One on transcontinental flights to and from
vacations, Nixon signed off on them. An Air Force Jetstar was once
used to ferry a package from Florida to Camp David for senior
aides, at a cost of five thousand dollars in fuel alone. Its
contents: ten pounds of crabs from Joe's Stone Crabs in Miami
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Camp David retreat were not sufficient
for Nixon. He bought houses on Key Biscayne _ the complex that came
to be known as the Florida White House _ and at San Clemente, the
fourteen-room house and estate in California styled the Western
White House. Nixon himself purchased the properties, with a massive
financial assist from Bebe Rebozo and aerosol tycoon Robert
Abplanalp. The government, however, was to spend more than ten
million dollars _ more than forty-four million dollars at today's
values _ to install special features not only at Nixon's
out-of-town homes but also at houses he frequented, like
Abplanalp's in the Bahamas. ...
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had nine offices for his personal use: the Oval Office, a
hideaway in the Executive Office Building, a room in his private
quarters, two at Camp David, one at the Key Biscayne house, another
at Abplanalp's Caribbean home, and two at San Clemente. All
required sophisticated communications systems, installed at public
expense. A former Budget Bureau official would calculate that, by
four years into the presidency, Nixon's household expenses had
added up to a hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon spent more than one in three nights away from the White
House in the first eighteen months of his term. While the days of
absence included foreign trips, there were also forty-two trips to
Camp David, fourteen to Key Biscayne, and nine to San Clemente. The
California stays tended to last two or three weeks. ...
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's assistant Alexander Butterfield was struck by the fact
that his boss ``had so much leisure time. There were many days with
no appointments at all. Every now and then he would work like a
Trojan. ... But generally he allowed plenty of time to sit and kick
things around. ... And every afternoon Nixon took a nap.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Early in his travels as president, Nixon was greeted in Brussels
by royal guards in operatically grand uniforms. In India he was
escorted by outriders in British Empire-vintage scarlet coats. One
of these trips reportedly inspired the outfitting of the White
House police in similarly outlandish uniforms. The new outfits,
high-necked white tunics with gold epaulets, first appeared on
public view a year after the inauguration. They were topped by tall
military caps with blue and gold visors, reportedly paid for by
Nixon himself.
</P>
<P>
   After early critics noted how plump the uniforms made their
wearers look, the policemen were ordered to diet. Then, following a
national chorus of ridicule, the regalia was withdrawn altogether.
The tunics were eventually sold off to high school bands in Iowa,
and the caps reappeared at an Alice Cooper rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President,'' H.R. Haldeman said by way of explaining the
uniforms, had ``wanted something more formal.'' Peter Flanigan,
Nixon's political adviser, thought the livery an attempt to emulate
the ``grandeur'' his boss admired in Charles de Gaulle. ... Defense
Secretary James Schlesinger, who agreed that Nixon tried to imitate
de Gaulle, suggested dryly in a 1997 interview that therein lay the
difference: Nixon was ``a shrewd, calculating figure, but no giant.
He would have liked to have been more giant than he was. He was not
an imposing figure like de Gaulle.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The official roster of Britain's nobility, Burke's Peerage,
pronounced Nixon one of thirteen U.S. presidents able to claim
royal ancestry. The grocer's son from Whittier was supposedly a
direct descendant of King Edward III (d. 1377) and thus distantly
related to Queen Elizabeth II and Sir Winston Churchill. While
thousands of people can claim similar bloodlines, one should
perhaps not assume this was totally irrelevant to Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often felt that inwardly the president secretly wanted to be
considered an English lord,'' said his close associate Herb Klein,
``someone who, like Jack Kennedy, would be praised for upgrading
the social dignity of the White House. ... he longed for this elite
social distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon himself denied such notions. ``The Imperial President,''
he wrote, was a straw man created by defensive congressmen and by
disillusioned liberals. ...'' One such critic was future Speaker
Tip O'Neill. ``After he became President,'' O'Neill recalled,
``Nixon seemed to change. He no longer played cards with our group,
and I doubt he played with anybody. Unlike Truman, Kennedy and
Johnson, Nixon didn't pal around much with his old friends ... he
became aloof and imperial.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republican stalwarts had similar thoughts. ``I could
not detect a touch of humility in his demeanor or in his facial
expression,'' Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns said of the
inauguration. ``That troubled me very much. That, combined with his
attitude when he took me through the White House and talked about
its splendor.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   He behaved ``like Napoleon,'' said the San Diego entrepreneur
Arnholt Smith, who had known Nixon since childhood. ``I mean, he
was very imperious, gave you a feeling you were almost traveling
with God.'' Former Republican Party chairman Len Hall thought Nixon
became ``regal, kinglike. ... He loved power, power to sit in that
Oval Office and just issue orders. ...''

 &HT;    By ANTHONY SUMMERS with ROBBYN SWAN 
 &HT;    (North American rights only) 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Anthony Summers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Mr. Summers describes how, in 1968, the founder of the Dreyfus
Fund gave Richard Nixon a large quantity of the prescription drug
Dilantin, which Nixon began taking without a doctor's supervision.
In 1974, as his presidency deteriorated, Mr. Summers recounts how
Nixon's aides and advisers took steps to ensure that an
increasingly erratic president didn't compromise national
security.)
</P>
<P>
   It became clear during research for this book (that) Nixon
consumed large quantities of one particular drug over a long
period, apparently without a prescription or proper medical
supervision. The drug was Dilantin, the brand name of an
anti-epileptic medication known to pharmacologists as Phenytoin,
and the circumstances in which Nixon came to start taking it were
alarmingly casual. He heard about the drug, probably soon after
being elected president, while dining at Key Biscayne with Bebe
Rebozo and the millionaire founder of the Dreyfus Fund, Jack
Dreyfus, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus, who had contributed to the Nixon campaigns in both 1960
and 1968, had no medical qualifications. Having credited Dilantin
with relieving him of chronic depression almost overnight, he had
become the leading advocate of it as a panacea for all manner of
ailments. ...
</P>
<P>
   At their 1968 meeting in Key Biscayne, as Dreyfus told the
author, ``Nixon said, 'Why don't you give me some Dilantin?' So I
thought, 'What the heck, he's (going to be) president of the United
States. I can't get in trouble. ...' So I went out to the car and
got a bottle of a thousand and gave it to him. A few days later he
called me and said, 'Is it all right if I take two a day?' I said,
'Yes, I think so.' Later on when I went to see him at the White
House, he asked me if he could have some more. I gave him another
large bottle ....''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Nixon wanted the Dilantin for, Dreyfus was vague.
Nixon, he said, had ``a lot of things ... worries.'' At one point,
when Dreyfus suggested that the president should perhaps get the
medication from a doctor, Nixon had said, 'To heck with the
doctor.''' ... The ``Physicians' Desk Reference,'' used by doctors
nationwide, lists numerous known adverse reactions to Dilantin.
They include ``slurred speech, decreased coordination, and mental
confusion, dizziness, insomnia, transient nervousness ...'' Dr.
Lawrence McDonald, a Washington physician consulted by the author,
was alarmed at the notion of anyone's _ especially a person in a
position of high responsibility _ using Dilantin in uncontrolled
doses or combined with other medications or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such a user of the drug were the president of the United
States,'' Dr. McDonald said, ``I would be very nervous. Mental
confusion is not something you want in a leader. Dilantin certainly
could impair someone of that caliber from making correct and timely
and appropriate judgments. It's a potential time bomb, waiting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon did use alcohol and did use sleeping pills. His longtime
speechwriter Ray Price recalled how even a single drink could make
him appear drunk ``if he had a sleeping pill.'' As if the drinking,
the sleeping pills, and the Dilantin were not troubling enough,
Rabbi Baruch Korff _ a Nixon apologist late in the presidency _
said he learned that ``at times he resorted to amphetamines.''
Amphetamines, of course, are stimulants, the opposite of the
relaxing medications mentioned by other associates. ...
</P>
<P>
   The uncertain days of August 1974 sparked unprecedented
precautions, the logical outcome of months of anxiety about the
president's mental stability. ... A group of legislators, headed by
Jacob Javits, the Republican senator from New York, even consulted
the director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Dr.
Bertram Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had breakfast with a half dozen senators,'' Brown recalled.
``It was to talk about these issues, whether he would lose his
cool. ... Whether he was going crazy, becoming psychotic, whether
he would start a war.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of defense, James Schlesinger ... was already
alert to such fears. His attention had been drawn to the
president's state of mind by a phone call a few months earlier from
Joseph Laitin, the public affairs spokesman of the Office of
Management and Budget, based in the Executive Office Building, just
across from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the author Laitin vividly recalled the
encounter with Nixon in the spring of 1974 that prompted him to
phone Schlesinger. ``I was on my way over to the West Wing of the
White House to see Treasury Secretary George Shultz,'' Laitin said.
``I'd reached the basement, near the Situation Room. And just as I
was about to ascend the stairway, a guy came running down the
stairs two steps at a time. He had a frantic look on his face,
wildeyed, like a madman. And he bowled me over, so I kind of lost
my balance. And before I could pick myself up, six athletic-looking
young men leapt over me, pursuing him. I suddenly realized that
they were Secret Service agents, that I'd been knocked over by the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Laitin was so shocked at Nixon's appearance that he postponed
the meeting with Shultz and returned to his office. ``I sat there
stunned,'' he said, ``and I thought, you know, 'That madman I have
just seen has his finger on the red button.' I had a number for
Schlesinger, a phone that only he would answer. I called him, and I
asked him if the president could order the use of atomic weapons
without going through the secretary of defense. I said, 'If I were
in your position, I would want to know who the nearest combat-ready
troops were who would respond to the president's wishes to surround
the White House. I would want to know what the next nearest
combat-ready division was, which would not only be able to overcome
them but also respond only to the chain of command. That's what I
have to say.' Then there was just a click at the other end, as the
secretary of defense hung up.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Given his own access to the president, Schlesinger also had the
benefit of his own observations. He was also aware of concern that
the White House might attempt to use the military to prevent the
president from being forced from office. ... In late July, he asked
for a meeting with the chairman of the joint Chiefs, Air Force
General George Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him,'' the former secretary recalled in an interview
with the author, ``that every order that would come from the White
House had to come to me directly, immediately upon receipt. ... The
message had to be gotten through that there were not to be any
extraordinary measures taken. The message did get through.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   A former army operations intelligence specialist, Barry Toll,
told a Senate committee in closed session: ``The last week or so of
the Nixon administration we received a top secret 'eyes only,'
limited distribution order effectively instructing us not to obey
the president _ on anything, not just nuclear, until further
notice. ... It was signed, at the Joint Chiefs' insistence, as I
understood it, by not one but two cabinet officers. The names I
recall as having signed were Secretary Schlesinger and Secretary
Kissinger.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the Nixon presidency was an extraordinary episode
in American history,'' former Secretary Schlesinger said in 2000.
``I am proud of my role in protecting the integrity of the chain of
command. You could say it was synonymous with protecting the
Constitution.''

RELIGION COLUMN: SECULAR HUMANISTS OFFER ALTERNATIVE TO
NON-BELIEVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Health care, education and the military have all been
_ not surprisingly _ major topics in the current presidential
campaign. But then so, too, has personal religious belief.
Certainly, a series of declarations by major candidates have made
it seem so, as when Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, said that belief in Christ had changed his
life and when Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee, delivered a speech about the value of
religious belief in public life.
</P>
<P>
   It has made some defenders of church-state separation uneasy.
And a couple have even worried that all this talk of faith leaves
non-believers feeling like outsiders. According to polls, this is
not a small group in a nation of more than 270 million people. At
least 5 percent of Americans claim no belief in a deity; nearly
three times that number say they have no religious preference or
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   But their presence is not always obvious _ unless, that is, an
organized group shows up, like several hundred secular humanists
who have come to New York this weekend for a conference declaring
that one can affirm values and culture that originated in a
particular religious faith, in this case, Judaism, without having a
need to believe in God.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is the International Federation of Secular
Humanistic Jews, an association of organizations in Europe, Israel,
North and South America and Australia. It recently established a
small headquarters in New York, but its previous meetings have been
held overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The New York event began Friday night at Cooper Union, with
speakers ranging from the poet laureate Robert Pinsky to the film
director Lawrence Kasdan. But in an interview beforehand, two of
the federation's leaders voiced concern that some who might want to
belong to a community of secularists (just as religious believers
might want to join a church or synagogue) may be unaware that such
opportunities exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many people don't know that there's a place to go,''
said Myrna Baron, the federation's newly appointed executive
director and also founder of the City Congregation, a humanistic
Jewish group in New York. The word ``humanism,'' she said, does not
translate into all languages (modern Hebrew being one of them) but,
in her experience, those who wear the label of humanistic Jews
share an interest in human dignity, human rights and the study of a
Jewish heritage that emphasizes its human contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Baron was accompanied by Felix Posen, a co-chairman of the
federation who lives in Great Britain. ``What we're interested in
is to give the extra option,'' he said. By that, he said, he meant
a Jewish identity distinct from that offered by religious
organizations. The constituency of the secular communities, he
said, would be those who agreed with a phrase he attributed to the
philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin: ``I'm tone-deaf as far as God is
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron brought along a copy of ``Sh'ma,'' an independent journal
of Jewish opinion, which devoted its June issue to the subject,
with articles by Rabbi Sherwin T. Wine, founder of both the
federation and the humanistic Jewish movement in the United States,
and Yehuda Bauer, an Israeli scholar of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our movement is secular because its focus is on the pleasures
and pains of this world,'' Wine wrote. ``It is humanistic because
it finds the source of power for solving problems in human beings
and because it sees the meaning of Jewish history in the Jewish
defiance of an unjust world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer wrote that for him, God's existence after the Holocaust,
in which 1.5 million children were killed, was ``impossible from a
moral point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal provided space, too, for theological replies. Rabbi
Marcia Prager, an official of a Jewish renewal organization, wrote
that one can draw a lesson from the mystical teachings of Jewish
Cabala: ``It is perhaps the ultimate testimony to the magnificence
of the Divine love that God is willing to create and sustain a
universe in which God's own Presence is hidden, in which God's own
existence can be denied, in which God can be abandoned.'' And Rabbi
David A. Teutsch, president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical
College, wrote: ``When we do not feel the presence of the Divine,
living Torah keeps God present nonetheless.''
</P>
<P>
   Posen said that he and others in the federation hope to develop
educational materials for children and adults who want to study
Judaism as culture, rather than religion. ``I'm starting a huge
literary project of cultural Judaism,'' Posen said, citing one such
project. He said the work already had scholarly advisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will divide history into seven or eight periods, starting
with the Torah,'' he said. The project will range well into the
modern era, so that much of its attention will be on recent Jewish
cultural contributions. Placing his palms about two feet apart to
indicate several volumes of books, Posen said, ``If it is this
size, more than half of it will be the last 150 years.''

 &HT;    When faced with a loved-one's death, resources may help
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Talking about death and dying with a parent or
other loved one can be frightening for even the closest of
families. But the subject must be broached if the needs and wants
of the dying person are to be met, and to give them peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   The best time, of course, to talk about end-of-life issues is
before a crisis occurs, when heads are clear and there is still
time to plan.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what your family member wants ahead of time can prepare
you to be an advocate for their wishes at the end of life.
</P>
<P>
   Key topics for families to discuss include:
</P>
<P>
   _ When would you want medical treatment to offer comfort rather
than prolong life?
</P>
<P>
   _ Who would you want to make your health-care decisions if you
could not speak for yourself?
</P>
<P>
   _ What are your religious, cultural or philosophical beliefs
about death and dying?
</P>
<P>
   _ How do you want to live at the end of your life?
</P>
<P>
   To help guide your family discussion, Sacramento Healthcare
Decisions, (916) 484-2485, has published a booklet called ``Finding
Your Way: A Guide for End-of-Life Medical Decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the topic has been aired, families need to act.
</P>
<P>
   _ Draw up a living will or an advance directive. Discuss this
with the family member's doctor or other advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Gundersen Lutheran's Programs for Improving End-of-Life Care,
(800) 362-9567 ext. 5279, offer an information packet called
``Respecting Your Choices'' that includes tools for completing
advance directives. For state-specific advance directive forms,
contact Partnership for Caring: America's Voices for the Dying at
(800) 989-9455, or www.choices.org.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before it's too late, ask a family member or friend to tell
you about memorable events in his or her life. Retelling life
stories and documenting them in writing or on tape can ease the
dying process and leave a lasting treasure for loved ones. The
Hospice Foundation of America, (800) 854-3402, offers a publication
called ``A Guide for Recalling and Telling Your Life Story.''
</P>
<P>
   _Visit a sick or dying friend, offer to give a family caregiver
some time to rest, or volunteer to spend an hour or two each week
helping a seriously ill person. To learn more about volunteer
opportunities, call Hospice of Dayton at 256-4490, or visit
www.hospicedayton.org, or contact any of the other hospice
organizations listed below.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek help if you are grieving or bereaved. Hospice
organizations can help. So can your church or other faith
community. Some funeral homes, including Tobias, also offer grief
counseling.

 &HT;    PBS series raises awareness of end-of-life issues
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dying is not an option, eventually, but to those
of us who don't go quickly, the Grim Reaper does offer some
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital, home or hospice? Resuscitate or terminate? Seek out
new experimental therapies or old friends? Painful alertness or
comfortable sedation? Acceptance or defiance?
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few Americans are aware of those and other choices
they can make as their lives or the lives of loved ones wind down.
More of us are willing to discuss safe sex and unsafe drugs with
our children than to talk with our terminally ill parents about how
they want to be cared for in those last weeks and days, according
to a National Hospice Foundation survey last year of Americans 45
and older.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 percent of those who lost loved ones to terminal illness
used hospice services in 1998. Physicians often are clumsy or
dumbstruck about end-of-life topics, but research shows that's fine
with most terminal patients and their families. They don't want to
have that conversation either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to create higher expectations in the community when it
comes to care for the dying,'' said Victoria Weisfeld, senior
communications officer of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
(RWJF). To that end, the RWJF has been at the forefront of both
researching and raising awareness of the many issues involving
death and dying.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is a principal sponsor of a six-hour PBS series
running tonight through Wednesday, ``On Our Own Terms: Moyers on
Dying,'' to air from 9 to 10:30 p.m. each night. Bill and Judith
Davidson Moyers follow more than a dozen dying patients and their
families to address options available for the terminally ill, and
the obstacles to making those choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the series is to make an impact on the way that
we all think about death, and how we can all die better in
America,'' said Dr. Jules Sherman, medical director of Hospice of
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   There is broad consensus that American medicine is far better at
curing than it is at comforting, whether from physical, spiritual
or emotional pain. The health-care industry should be more
sensitive to the dying, few would argue, and should give more
encouragement to those who want to reconcile old rifts and regrets,
and to stipulate whether doctors should try to restart their hearts
again.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, there are concerns that the growing
``good death'' movement is deceptively glorifying something that is
inherently bad. Or that it is driven as much by saving money as by
relieving pain. Or that there is frightfully little ground between
the right to die and the duty to die. Or that physicians should no
more embrace death than policemen should embrace crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News talked with dozens of local physicians,
nurses, counselors, ethicists, patients and their families about
these end-of-life issues for a series that will run concurrently
with the PBS series. The newspaper series also will look at hospice
care and similar programs based in hospitals or geared for the
indigent.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, we will raise more questions than answers, if
only because many answers are as individual as fingerprints. For
some people, dying on our own terms means fighting all the way.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of local health-care organizations plans to turn the
PBS series into the beginning of a community conversation, said
Sister Carol Bauer, Good Samaritan Hospital's vice president of
mission effectiveness and the chair of the fledgling Greater Dayton
Healthcare Ethics Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to tell the people what they need to be
educated about,'' she said. ``We're hoping this will raise clarity
about what are the key issues that the community wants to talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   WORDS TO TRY
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the right phrasing can make all the difference in
talking with a sick person.
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead of: ``Dad, you are going to be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Try: ``Dad, are there some things that worry you?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead of: ``Don't talk like that! You can beat this!''
</P>
<P>
   Try: ``It must be hard to come to terms with all this.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead of: ``I can't see how anyone can help.''
</P>
<P>
   Try: ``We will be there for you, always.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead of: ``I just can't talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Try: ``I am feeling a little overwhelmed now. Can we take this
up later tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead of: ``What do the doctors know? You might live
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Try: ``Do you think the doctors are right? How does it seem to
you?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead of: ``Please don't give up. I need you here.''
</P>
<P>
   Try: ``I need you here. I will miss you terribly. But we will
get through somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead of: ``There has to be something more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Try: ``Let's be sure we get the best of medical treatments, but
let's be together when we have done all we can.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead of: ``Don't be glum. You will get well.''
</P>
<P>
   Try: ``It must be hard. Can I just sit with you for a while?''
</P>

NEBRASKA-NOTRE DAME AT THE TOP OF EVERYONE'S GAME DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ You can feel it in the air. You can almost
smell it. You certainly can see it with all the RV's in the parking
lots. And you can certainly see in in the sea of red that has
invaded the Notre Dame campus, reportedly close to 20,000 of them,
most of them without tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, no question about it. Saturday's meeting between No. 1
Nebraska and Notre Dame is a marquee game in a weekend that has a
few of them.
</P>
<P>
   But look around more closely. Listen to the words and the
atmosphere is far different than it was back in 1993 when No. 1
Florida State came to town.
</P>
<P>
   Back then it was a battle of equals, in which Notre Dame was
more equal for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. And that's what's strange. Notre Dame is an
underdog. A big one and the Irish are saying the things that
underdogs stay, starting with Irish coach Bob Davie, who earlier
this week talked about Notre Dame aspiring to get to the level of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Davie was speaking the truth, of course. Notre Dame wants to be
like Nebraska, like Florida State. Like the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   Now just think about that for a minute. This is Notre Dame.
Rockne and Leahy and Parseghian. The Gipper. The Golden Dome.
</P>
<P>
   But people don't think Notre Dame can win. Just make it
respectable is the hope of even the most devout Subway Alumni.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish players _ fed by Davie who fired them up at a pep
rally in Notre Dame Stadium Friday night _ are taking strength the
underdog role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a respect game,'' said Notre Dame linebacker Anthony
Denman. ``People across the country are writing us off, saying that
we're going to get blasted. They're basing that on last year. They
don't know what we have inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Or outside, which is the problem. On paper, it does look like a
mismatch in a lot of areas. Nebraska, which is making its first
regular season appearance against the Irish in 52 years, looks
stronger in a lot of areas. Along both lines of scrimmages. At
quarterback where Eric Crouch has Heisman potential, while Notre
Dame's Arnaz Battle has only potential, with one game experience as
a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska also has talented I-back in Dan Alexander and a
dangerous wide receiver in Bobby Newcombe, the former Husker signal
caller until Crouch supplanted him.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's 49-13 romp past San Jose State, which was nothing
more than a glorified controlled scrimmage for the Huskers, Crouch
ran for three touchdowns and passed for another.
</P>
<P>
   But San Jose State is not Notre Dame. And Nebraska is not Texas
A&AMP;M, which bowed to Notre Dame, 24-10, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska may very well be the best team this season. The Huskers
make a strong statement of being the best team of the last decade
with three national championships and an 82-8 record in eight
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The X factor is the Notre Dame mystique, especially at Notre
Dame Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska fans as well as Notre Dame fans were informed _ if they
didn't already know _ that No. 1 Miami came here ranked No. 1 in
1988 and left with a 31-30 loss; and Florida State invaded Notre
Dame Stadiuim ranked No. 1 in 1993 and were hit with a 31-24 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Logic says that Nebraska is better and will survive this weekend
of early September madness.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition and the mystique that surrounds this place _ even when
the spiral is downward as last year's 5-7 record indicated _ says
something strange might happen this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this game is so intriguing.

HOLLYWOOD INVADES TORONTO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
C. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
TORONTO _ Movies stars. Paparazzi. Why, we could almost be in
Hollywood.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every September for 10 days, Toronto turns into Los Angeles
without the ... well, without a lot of things _ killer smog,
massive traffic jams, a debilitating fear of downtown and of
walking. OK, so there's no comparison. Still, while the annual
Toronto International Film Festival is going on, some call this
city Hollywood North. And, at times, it's almost possible to
believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Times like now.
</P>
<P>
   It's the festival's opening night, and the waterfront teems with
beautiful people, almost 4,000 by some counts. A massive line of
Canadians has formed to get into the gala outdoor party. At least,
it's assumed they're Canadians and not Californians, since none of
them seems to know that nobody who's anybody (begin ital) ever (end
ital) waits in line.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the fence, past security, a rhythm and blues band is
playing, though few people are paying attention. They're lining up
for food and drinks, or else they're gawking. Or, more precisely,
they're looking for someone to gawk at.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gere, Gwyneth Paltrow, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Alec
Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker are among the stars said to be in
town. But except for a stray Canadian movie director or an actress
few people south of the border have heard of, the big names are
partying in the VIP tent, shielded from the little people. Maybe
this (begin ital) is (end ital) like Los Angeles after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto festival, which kicked off Thursday, is celebrating
its 25th year. Started in 1976 by a real estate lawyer and local
impresario with nine filmmakers and actors in attendance and 127
films from 30 countries, it now has grown to the second most
important international festival behind Cannes. Nearly 2,500 film
industry representatives are here this year; 329 movies will be
shown from 56 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of the big film festivals, it pretty much reflects what
the film industry is all about _ commerce, glitter and art.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is considered by many who work in Hollywood, at least
among those who actually (begin ital) like (end ital) movies, to be
the best festival to go to because of the balance it has struck.
Films are shown here from around the world _ Europe, Latin America,
Asia, Africa _ and there is an emphasis on film as art. But at the
same time, it's a congenial place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   The trade publication Variety blew an ill wind in this direction
with a story on the eve of the event bemoaning the earnings
fall-off for ``specialty films,'' the kind of small movies that
tend to dominate festivals. But Hollywood interest in Toronto has
never been higher _ especially since so many movies in recent years
(including ``American Beauty,'' ``The Red Violin,'' ``To Die For''
and ``Shine'') have gone on to acclaim and commercial success. The
presence of all the stars is one indication of that.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate its silver anniversary, festival organizers have
commissioned 10 short films inspired by the festival. It also is
showing movies from the festival's inaugural year, including
``Cousin, Cousine;'' ``Dersu Uzala;'' ``Harlan County, U.S.A.;''
and ``Grey Gardens.'' The anniversary also seems to have inspired
an inward gaze on the part of festival organizers; a number of the
most visible films being showcased reflect on the industry itself
and on the nature of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stardom,'' the opening-night movie, is about a teen-age
fashion model who zooms to spectacular international success but
who, in the glare of the spotlight, loses her identity in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   One of the movies receiving a warm critical reception is ``State
and Main,'' David Mamet's story of a film crew that plops down in a
small Vermont town and turns life around for the inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duets,'' starring Paltrow, is about nobodies in the Midwest
who find fulfillment on the karaoke stage, where for the length of
a three-minute song, they become stars.
</P>
<P>
   At a private party before the opening-night gala for his movie,
Denys Arcand, the director of ``Stardom,'' noted the irony _ his
movie was about the very phenomenon he was experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media, the cameras, the stars. The people here will not be
disoriented when they see (the movie),'' he told reporters. ``It's
the same subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamet's movie, which stars Baldwin, Parker, William Macy and
Philip Seymour Hoffman, steps away from the seriousness of his
recent stage and film work. It pokes fun at the insincerity and
foibles of movie people confronting crisis after crisis in a remote
village where even old farmers know the current market share of
Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to see the characters spout venom and slurs through
their fake smiles and witness their oily machinations without being
reminded of another movie showing at the festival, ``The
Contender,'' starring Jeff Bridges, Joan Allen, Christian Slater
and Gary Oldman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Contender'' is about politics _ not show business _ but as
``Wag the Dog'' showed, there doesn't seem to be much difference.
Allen plays a woman tapped to replace the sitting vice president,
who has died in office. But her nomination is threatened when
photos that possibly show her engaged in a college orgy come to
light.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians in the movie spin fictions and alter truth in
much the same way the moviemakers in ``State and Main'' do.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto festival was started in 1976, at a time when the
American film industry was undergoing fundamental and cataclysmic
change. For a brief period in the 1970s, then-young film auteurs
such as Martin Scorsese, Altman, Francis Ford Coppola and Peter
Bogdanovich used film in much the way a writer would use a pen, to
make personal statements. But then Hollywood caught blockbuster
fever after the success of ``Jaws'' and ``Star Wars'' in rapid
succession in 1975 and 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto festival, and the films it discovered and promoted,
ran counter to the big-budget-blockbuster trend. In recent years,
with the new emphasis in Hollywood on independently financed and
produced movies, the festivals have risen in importance.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's drop in box office for specialty films
notwithstanding, the Toronto festival is secure. Since 1976, 291
movies screened in Toronto have won Oscar nominations, and each
year Hollywood comes calling.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to pass up the opportunity to snatch up the next
``Blair Witch Project'' or ``Life Is Beautiful,'' both of which
came out of the festival circuit. No one can resist the call of
commerce.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ First came the tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   In just one afternoon in a week that he will not soon forget,
Larry B. Seabrook saw his race for Congress rocked by a tabloid
revelation that he had filed joint tax returns even after he and
his wife were divorced. There was the added tidbit that both
Seabrook, a state senator from the Bronx, and his former wife
maintained that they were unaware of their divorce until years
after it became official. The day wasn't done yet, and neither was
his opponent, who accused the senator of breaking the law and
called for a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In that same tumultuous week that Seabrook went on to accuse his
opponent, U.S. Rep. Eliot L. Engel, of being so conniving and
desperate to win re-election that he had illegally obtained the
information from sealed divorce records and leaked it to the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook then took his complaints to the doorstep of Engel's
office, holding a news conference to accuse his opponent of a list
of misdeeds. But Seabrook was ultimately upstaged by a woman who
brought the news conference to a screeching halt by falling to the
ground and screaming incoherently about being Seabrook's wife. That
sent a frightened Seabrook dashing from the scene, fearful, he
said, that the woman might have been carrying a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this primary battle in the 17th Congressional
District, which includes parts of the Bronx and some of Westchester
County, is not your typical political contest. With a seemingly
endless stream of vitriol, the campaign has provided voters with a
box-seat view of charges of racism, anti-Semitism, sabotage,
malfeasance and political betrayal, not to mention enough
revelations about Seabrook's marital woes to provide a season's
worth of soap opera scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Engel, a 53-year-old white incumbent, is working feverishly to
get re-elected in a district whose demographics have shifted
dramatically, from the mostly white electorate that first sent him
to Congress 12 years ago to its current overwhelmingly black and
brown majority.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook, 49, a black state senator, has invoked the theme of
black political empowerment in a campaign that has been marred by a
string of embarrassing revelations that have portrayed him as
acting injudiciously at best _ and illegally at worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a pretty thing to watch,'' said J. Philip Thompson,
a professor of political science at Columbia University. ``The
effect of all this activity has been to push issues completely out
of the campaign.'' When Engel first won the seat in 1988, the 17th
Congressional District was about 60 percent white; now it is only
about 22 percent white, with the balance being mostly black and
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Seabrook has criticized Engel as an inattentive
incumbent who spends far more time at his home in Maryland than in
the district. If elected, Seabrook would be the first black
congressman to represent the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   As Seabrook was busy putting together his campaign, Engel's
aides were busy collecting damaging information on Seabrook. They
chronicled, for example, Seabrook's poor attendance record in the
State Senate and gathered records indicating that Seabrook sought
reimbursement for travel expenses to Albany for more days than the
Senate was in session.
</P>
<P>
   Engel and some of his supporters also suggested that, in
appealing to black pride, Seabrook had injected race into the
campaign in a bold and racist appeal to black voters.
</P>
<P>
   The next shoe to drop came when Seabrook, who has long had an
arm's-length relationship with the party, was suddenly endorsed by
its chairman, Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, a move that some Engel
supporters charged was anti-Jewish. Engel lent his own voice to
that view, even suggesting that Hillary Rodham Clinton was harming
her standing with Jewish voters by not supporting him ( Clinton has
refused to take sides in contested Democratic primary races).
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the race has split Democrats in the district
and beyond. Engel has been endorsed by former Mayor Ed Koch, as
well as the Democratic Party organization of Westchester County.
Seabrook has been endorsed by the Rev. Al Sharpton, as well as most
Democratic officials in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliot Engel offers nothing to the people of this district,''
Seabrook said. ``To those of us who live here, he is a ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel has a ready retort. ``Larry Seabrook is the biggest
scofflaw in the New York State Legislature,'' the congressman said
this week. ``He is the one going around saying that he should be
elected because he is black. He started this campaign on a negative
note.'' ''
</P>
<P>
   Engel has denied having any responsibility for disseminating
information about Seabrook's taxes or his divorce. Still, it is
clear that many voters, particularly black and Hispanic ones in the
district, find that difficult to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Many other voters, particularly white ones, see Seabrook as a
divisive figure, more inclined to rely on race than merit in
presenting himself to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in this area believe he is running for the wrong
reason,'' said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz ``And that reason is
simply demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this has made this peculiar campaign something that many
politicians and voters are already lamenting, despite the
uncertainty of its outcome. ``This race has been mostly about mud
slinging,'' said the Rev. Hillary Gaston, the pastor of the
Parkchester Baptist Church. ``Neither one of them has put forth a
meaningful agenda that would excite anyone. People want to know,
`What are you doing for our community?'''

JUDGE SAYS TOBACCO DISCLOSURE LAW GIVES AWAY SECRETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal judge has struck down the state's
first-in-the-nation tobacco disclosure law, ruling that it forces
tobacco companies to give away valuable ``trade secrets'' by
ordering them to reveal the ingredients in cigarettes and other
tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   In a 40-page decision dated Thursday and released Friday, US
District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. wrote that ingredients added
to cigarettes, snuff, and chewing tobacco ``produce distinctive
flavors, tastes, and aromas which vary from brand to brand and are
a reason why consumers choose one brand over another.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole concluded that the 1996 Disclosure Act violates the
constitutional rights of tobacco companies because it would force
them to reveal ingredient formulas that cost millions of dollars to
develop and have been kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which requires companies to identify the ingredients in
each brand ranked ``in descending order according to weight,
measure or numerical count,'' would make it easier for competitors
to duplicate another company's popular brand and steal business
from them, O'Toole concluded.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the state was aiming to promote public
health by advising consumers of the contents of cigarettes, O'Toole
concluded it was impossible to predict how much protection the
disclosures would provide to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is good reason to think that much, if not all, of the
hoped for benefit could be achieved by disclosure requirements
tailored to avoid the loss of trade secrets . . .,'' O'Toole wrote,
noting that federal law calls for general disclosure of the
contents of tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The decision drew sharp criticism from antismoking advocates who
have made Massachusetts a national leader in tobacco education and
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on this decision, we know much more about what's in a
box of cereal than in a package of cigarettes,'' said Dr. Howard
Kho, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
``We're talking about a product that causes over 10,000 deaths a
year in Massachusetts and it's astonishing that we are trying to
protect any secrets about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers should have a right to know what's in a product that
causes so much suffering and death.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure law has been on hold since it was passed in 1996
after all of the major tobacco companies filed suit against the
state's attorney general and public health department. The
plaintiffs in the case include Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown
&AMP; Williamson, Tobacco Corp., Lorillard, and US Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said, ``We are
certainly pleased that the judge agreed we should be able to
protect propriety brand recipes. We are not opposed to disclosing
ingredients, we are opposed to turning over our propriety brand
recipes.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 federal law requires tobacco companies to provide lists
of ingredients in their products to the US Department of Health and
Human Services, but the information isn't made public and doesn't
include a brand-by-brand breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, tobacco companies are required to disclose information
about the ingredients in their products, but the information isn't
shared publicly. And Minnesota has an even narrower law, requiring
tobacco companies to disclose only certain compounds and additives.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick said Philip Morris currently provides information
about the ingredients in each of its brands on its website,
www.philipmorrisusa.com, but protects the secrecy of its recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Tolman, the former state senator who wrote the disclosure
law, said, ``I don't see why the ingredients in cigarettes should
be any more protected than the ingredients in Coca Cola. I'm not
looking for the recipe or the amounts, just the ingredients, like
we know in every food and every drug made in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While disappointed in the judge's ruling, Tolman noted that the
disclosure law raised public awareness about what is in cigarettes
and prompted one company, Liggett, to voluntarily release a list of
the ingredients in its cigarettes: sugar, menthol, valerian root
etract, cedarwood oil, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Bilafer, a spokesman for Attorney General Thomas Reilly,
said the state hasn't decided yet whether to appeal the decision.

AFRICAN LEADERS GET MESSAGE ACROSS AT UN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes time reference.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Amid a year that has seen intensive
international attention toward Africa and its daunting list of
troubles, dozens of angry African leaders fired back this week at
Western powers, saying concern alone is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   As the United Nations millenium summit finished three days of
deliberations and speeches Friday, an overriding theme emerged from
African heads of state who charged that the forces of globalization
are enriching the West anew while sentencing them to even more
misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were slaves, then there was colonization, and we are saying
that even with globalization we will never become global slaves
again,'' said Gambian President Yahya Jammeh in an interview in his
hotel suite overlooking Central Park. ``It took African blood,
sweat and tears to build the West, and now the West, instead of
respecting us, is treating us like dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Several African leaders voiced solidarity with the grassroots
international movement against the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank, suggesting that an alliance was possible in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Seattle to Washington, D.C., from Davos to London and in
many other places, people have spoken and signaled in no uncertain
terms that the present world order, particularly in economic, trade
and development areas, is unsatisfactory and needs to be
reformed,'' said Anund Priyay Neewoor, UN ambassador from the tiny
island nation of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the people have said in the streets now, the developing
countries have been saying for many years in various international
fora with little success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment from Africa is not uncommon at world events, but this
time it came in a year in which the United Nations held extensive
hearings in January on the continent's needs. On Thursday, a
historic meeting of the UN Security Council focused on revamping
peacekeeping operations, with Africa very much in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, as well, has rhetorically elevated
African policy to a higher plane than any previous administration.
Clinton traveled twice to the continent, most recently last month
to Nigeria and Tanzania. And his administration has advocated debt
forgiveness, increased spending to fight HIV/AIDS and faster
deployment of better trained UN peacekeepers to defuse conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   But at the three-day summit, leader after leader from African
nations delivered withering attacks against the West, some
specifically mentioning the United States. They said the Western
powers talked a good game about extending the benefits of
globalization to Africa but then stood by as corporations plundered
riches from the continent.
</P>
<P>
   South African President Thabo Mbeki decried the day-to-day
misery of one-sixth of all people of earth who survive on less than
a $1 a day, saying it should be ``offensive'' to all leaders at the
summit. The General Assembly, as expected, passed a resolution that
including sweeping goals on behalf of the poor, including lifting
an astronomical 600 million people out of extreme poverty in 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor of the world stand at the gates of the comfortable
mansions occupied by each and every king and queen, president,
prime minister and minister privileged to attend this unique
meeting,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   And J.J. Rawlings, the president of Ghana, singled out
multinational corporations as nourishing and ``thrusting''
corruption on Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Rawlings, and other African leaders this week,
didn't turn the spotlight back on the role of the continent's
rulers in nurturing such systems of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they portrayed themselves as victims of globalization,
burdened by debt, forced to accept harmful economic terms to secure
World Bank loans and falling far behind the rest of the world in
technological advancement.
</P>
<P>
   All week, one of the most forceful voices was The Gambia's
Jammeh, who said it was time that African nations received far
better reimbursement for their natural wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Africa today _ we are one of the richest
continents in terms of raw materials _ because of the lack of
technology and lack of means of extracting oil and diamonds and
other materials, foreign companies come and exploit and set their
own terms and say `Take it or leave it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It is either accept what they offer or you will have no jobs
for people,'' he said. ``We have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He also singled out the World Bank's influence. In The Gambia,
the World Bank pushed for privatization of several state
industries. The first was the peanut industry, which had employed
14,000 people. After the industry was sold, a foreign company
closed the processing plant and shipped the peanuts abroad for
processing. Now the industry employs fewer than 700 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now importing peanut oil into the country,'' Jammeh
said. ``It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Jammeh, 36, is not on the Clinton administration's list of
promising African leaders.
</P>
<P>
   That is largely due to the way he came to power _ a bloodless
military coup in 1994, only six months after Jammeh completed
military police training in Port McClellan, Ala. Jammeh said he and
other young army officers overthrew the government of Dawda Jawara
because of widespread corruption and economic stagnation that
resulted in a 84 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup, the United States and the European Union
suspended much of their trade. In 1996, Jammeh won election as
president in a vote that was questioned by some international
groups, and since then his government has been criticized by human
rights groups for detaining its critics, including journalists and
politicians. But he has also built numerous schools and formed a
foundation to provide better health care.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his relationship with the US government remains frosty.
</P>
<P>
   One of his priorities this week was to meet with human rights
activists and encourage them to observe next year's elections.
Peter Takiram Budde, director of the Africa division of Human
Rights Watch, said he appreciated Jammeh's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised and intrigued by the fact that he didn't want
people to come merely for the elections, but that he wanted them to
come for the process leading up to them as well,'' Budde said after
spending two hours with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to hide,'' Jammeh said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, perhaps because of his country's human rights record,
or because of Jammeh's outspoken opposition to the forces of
globalization, his country is having trouble attracting new
businesses. One possibility arose this week, with the announcement
of a plan for a $5 million investment to build a flour mill. If
terms are finalized, the deal would create 140 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Gambia has 1.4 million people. Jammeh understands the terms
of battle. But he said that he, and others on his continent, would
continue to demand better deals for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid of any power, big or small,'' he said. ``We
want to make sure Africa is respected.''
</P>
<P>
   All week long, the president of Africa's smallest nation wore a
traditional white robe and pointy, white slip-on leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere he went, from lunches with the leaders of the
West to the podium at the General Assembly, Jammeh carried a sword
wrapped in prayer beads. It was a tipoff, if one were needed, that
he was ready for battle.

GORE WIDENING LEAD OVER BUSH AMONG WOMEN VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes time reference.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Married, working, and with young children at home,
the Pennsylvania woman who took part in a focus group earlier this
week seemed to sum up George W. Bush's problem with female voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so classic male,'' she told Democratic pollster Celinda
Lake, referring to the Texas governor's proposal to privatize a
portion of Social Security. ``He wants to take your savings and
risk it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning development in the latest, post-Labor Day
round of national polls is Al Gore's grip on women voters.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president not only has erased the advantage Bush held
earlier with women. But with an appeal centered on social and
economic security for working families, Gore also has opened up a
gender gap _ call it a chasm _ that appears to be the biggest since
pollsters first noted this Mars-and-Venus disparity in voting
behavior in the 1980 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Friday shows Gore leading
Bush 57 to 33 percent among female voters, Bush ahead among men 55
to 37 percent, and Gore with a slim overall lead of 47 percent to
Bush's 44 percent. A Reuters/Zogby poll, out Thursday, had Gore
with a 53.6 to 33 percent advantage among women and leading Bush by
5.4 percent overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like it. You have to wonder if it
is going to continue,'' pollster John Zogby said. ``Bush was doing
well among women, even Democratic women, and we have watched that
support dissipate. Bush is not going to get it back unless he
starts talking about issues women care about _ education and health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Linda DiVall says her newest survey,
completed Thursday night, shows only a 5 percent Gore lead among
women. ``Bush's rating with women is fine,'' DiVall said. However,
she added that to regain the advantage, ``he needs to become more
aggressive and energetic and enthusiastic, and do a better job
contrasting his issues with Gore and exploiting his own ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree that Gore has gained the upper hand among women
with both image and issues. First, he largely has neutralized the
so-called character question by declaring his independence from
President Clinton, and indirectly the scandals of his
administration, by picking Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his
running mate and by dramatizing his strong family values and loving
relationships with his wife, daughters, and mother at the
Democratic National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Gore has made it a point to address women's anxieties
about the fragility of the nation's prosperity with detailed plans
to guard the budget surplus and target tax credits for college
tuition, child care, and long-term care for elderly parents. When
he is not touting his own fiscal prudence, Gore accuses Bush of
wanting to take risks privatizing Social Security and Medicare,
federal programs that disproportionately benefit women.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is the young, middle-class mother in Pennsylvania, or
the senior citizens she surveys, economist Heidi Hartmann says
women have reason to be risk-adverse: Over their lifetime they
typically earn less than men, have been the first to be laid off,
less likely to receive private pensions, and have not accumulated
savings to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Bush has to promise that nobody who is retired,
or near retirement, will have any reduction in Social Security
benefits under his plan creates the concern for many women that
maybe he won't be able to keep his promise,'' said Hartmann,
president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a nonprofit
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Lake says the presidential race could come down to the fight to
capture two key female groups: elderly women, who went Republican
in the 1998 congressional elections and were particularly disgusted
by Clinton's extramarital affair, and so-called ``waitress moms'' _
working mothers, married and single, with some or no college
education _ who now make up 60 percent of the undecided vote.
``Waitress moms are back in charge of the election,'' Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   They are one reason Gore refers so often to ``working families''
in his speeches and has made their concerns central to his
campaign. Gore's proposals for universal preschool, pay equity,
raising the minimum wage, expanding the federal Family and Medical
Leave Act, and giving a five-year Social Security credit to women
who leave jobs to raise children are aimed directly at middle-class
mothers juggling work and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy is booming, the demands of balancing work and
family gets a little more intense,'' said Dianne Bystrom, director
of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa
State University. ``And women, who tend to be the family
caretakers, turn to government programs when they need a life
preserver.''
</P>
<P>
   In focus groups, women say they expected the economic boom would
allow them to work fewer hours and spend more time with their
children. Instead, a tight labor market, global competition, and
mobile technology are making employers demand more of them and
their spouses. Two recent strikes _ by Verizon Communications
workers in the Northeast and nurses at St. Vincent Hospital in
Worcester _ were fought over the issue of mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   A report titled ``The State of Working America'' released on
Labor Day by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank,
showed that between 1979 and 1998, the average number of hours
worked by middle-income women, married and with children, increased
from 884 hours to 1,360 hours annually, up roughly 12 weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to spend money on polls to find out that women,
as well as men, feel they are stretched too thin,'' said Ellen
Bravo, co-director of 9to5, an Milwaukee-based advocacy group for
working women. ``I would be happy to hear what Gore and Bush say
they will do about it. It is a real issue, and it hasn't been taken
up enough, it hasn't been addressed enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday Bush began fulfilling his promise to get closer to ``real
people'' and their issues when he spent more than a hour chatting
and taking questions at a telecommunications-equipment plant near
Pittsburgh. ``This is what I am good at,'' he said. Aides to the
GOP candidate said they expect him to visit with families and
explain how his proposals would benefit them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also expected to put renewed emphasis on education, an
issue that won him support from women, and on some of the other
``compassionate conservative'' themes that he stressed at the GOP
convention in Philadelphia _ an event whose program and symbolism
were designed, in part, to broaden the party's appeal among women.
Whether he can regain the lead among women is uncertain. No
Republican presidential candidate has held the advantage with women
voters since 1988, when Bush's father got 50 percent of the female
vote to 49 percent for former Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both Bush and Gore have agreed to answer the
question, ``Why should I vote for you?'' when they make separate,
hourlong appearances on the Oprah Winfrey show. Gore will face the
TV show's largely female audience of 22 million on Monday. Bush is
scheduled to appear Sept. 18.

BUSH SAYS HE'LL TALK ABOUT DEBATES SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ George W. Bush, less than a week after rejecting
two out of three proposed 90-minute debates in favor of shorter
television talk show face-offs, agreed Friday to renegotiate the
debate schedule as it became clear he and Vice President Gore were
at an impasse on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had said he would debate Bush ``anytime, anywhere'' _ as
long as his opponent also agreed to three 90-minute debates,
including one set for Boston, sponsored by the Commission on
Presidential Debates. Those debates, the standard for the last
three election cycles, are traditionally broadcast on all three
major television networks, guaranteeing the largest possible
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed bypassing the first two commission debates in
favor of 60-minute appearances on CNN and NBC. When Gore refused,
Bush accused him of breaking his word, touching off a bitter round
of attacks that culminated in a negative ad questioning Gore's
credibility on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, however, as concerns about the direction of the Bush
campaign mounted in Republican circles, the Texas governor backed
away from his original stance. Without conceding they had
miscalculated in assuming they could cast Gore as a hypocrite, Bush
campaign officials said they were no longer committed to their
original plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush communications director Karen Hughes even tried to turn the
about-face to Bush's advantage, saying that campaign chairman Don
Evans would call the commission to ``offer to meet with them
anywhere, anytime to discuss with them and the Gore campaign a way
to work out a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is taking the initiative to break this impasse
and make sure the American people will have debates,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after NBC executives canceled a proposed
debate on a special edition of ``Meet the Press'' next Tuesday
night. Bush had said he would appear solo if Gore did not accept,
but network executives refused to invite him, saying both
candidates would have to be present.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already agreed to one commission debate, but rejected
two others, the first of which was scheduled to occur in Boston on
Oct. 3. Despite his sudden change of heart, the Boston event
remains unlikely, given Bush's lack of interest in visiting
Massachusetts and his view that the site, because it is adjacent to
the John F. Kennedy Library, has partisan associations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's willingness to compromise left both sides hopeful
the two candidates were closer than before to reaching an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we will come to a comfortable and satisfying
compromise, and the debate on the debates will be a non-issue
shortly,'' said Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, who campaigned
with Bush Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates issued this statement:
``The Bush campaign has accepted the CPD's invitation to meet. We
are working to schedule a meeting with Bush and Gore campaigns
representatives next week.''

OVERKILL ON MP3 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 10, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge Jed S. Rakoff went too far last week when he clobbered
MP3.com for allowing owners of compact discs to access their music
on the Internet. The fines he will levy could destroy the company
even though the plaintiff, Universal Music, produced no evidence
that it suffered harm.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff, sitting in New York federal district court, was acting
on Universal's complaint that MP3 was violating copyright law when
it put Universal's music in a vast database on the MP3.com Web
site. Anyone in possession of a CD could listen to music from that
recording via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com ought to have obtained permission beforehand, and Rakoff
correctly noted that the company was aware of the treacherous legal
ground it was occupying. But the company's intent was not to cut
into sales of CDs, but to enhance its standing among CD owners. The
database was only accessible from January to April, when Rakoff
ordered it taken off the Internet. Since then MP3.com has reached
settlement with four other music companies. Only Universal kept
fighting in court.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff decided that MP3 should pay $25,000 for each Universal
disc it had copied into the database. Depending on how many this
was, the fine could be as high as $250 million. Rakoff said in his
decision: ``The potential for huge profits in the rapidly expanding
world of the Internet is the lure that tempted an otherwise
generally responsible company like MP3.com to break the law and
that will also tempt others to do so if too low a level is set for
the statutory damages in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com, like many Internet companies, has yet to make any
money. Its stock plunged more than 75 percent in a year and stands
at $6.25 a share. Its settlement with the four other companies will
cost at least $80 million (more depending on how much Universal
gets). The company has set aside $150 million, but if it has to pay
more than that, it may go out of business. By putting the company
at risk, Rakoff does more than deter; he discourages any innovation
that might prompt a lawsuit over copyright.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Napster Web site, where songs are freely traded
without payment, MP3.com is trying to establish a middle ground
that recognizes the popularity of listening to music on line while
acknowledging the property rights of the recording industry.
Universal should be trying to enhance this plan, not cripple the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Universal and other recording companies are experimenting with
online sales, but they remain tethered to a retailing model in
which people physically buy a CD instead of downloading music.
Rakoff, in the guise of protecting a copyright holder, is actually
sustaining an industry. MP3.com will appeal, and Rakoff will hold
another hearing in November. In the meantime, Universal ought to
settle with MP3.com so that the company can continue to innovate.
MP3.com deserved to be slapped down, not threatened with
extinction.

A DEBATE ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 10, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that President Clinton has bowed to necessity by postponing
any decision to begin construction on a national missile defense
system, his would-be successors owe the American public an honest
debate about missile defense. To clarify crucial security decisions
looming before the nation, Texas Governor George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore have an obligation to demystify an issue that has
been too often obscured by misleading slogans and disingenuous
political motives.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides of the dispute about a system that relies on
intercepting warheads outside the earth's atmosphere, politicians
have exhibited a misplaced insouciance toward technical problems
that knowledgeable scientists say are insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Postol, an MIT physicist and missile specialist, has written
a letter to the White House, informing the Clinton administration
that his analysis of test flights shows that the sensors meant to
guide ``exo-atmospheric kill vehicles'' to incoming warheads cannot
discriminate between simple decoys such as Mylar balloons and a
live warhead. Postol also charged that the Pentagon juggled test
data to hide the failure, perpetrating scientific fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Nyra Schwartz, a whistle-blower who supervised testing of the
system at TRW, told the Globe last spring that the technology of
the sensors ``does not work, will not work, cannot work.''
</P>
<P>
   The gist of White House and Pentagon responses to such warnings
has been to say that even if sensors cannot now locate a warhead
among balloons, sooner or later some technological breakthrough
will correct the problem. This amounts to blind faith in the
strategy of muddling through. A similar heedlessness led to the
waste of $60 billion in the futile pursuit of the space-based Star
Wars system that Ronald Reagan propounded.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats and Republicans alike have been barking up the
wrong tree in the search for a shield against strategic missiles
from Iraq, Iran, or North Korea, their indifference to the laws of
physics may be traceable to their political habits of thought. Some
things, however, may not be spun.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton originally acceded to the Republican clamor for a
national missile defense as a political ploy, proceeding with a
limited system so that Republicans would find it harder to accuse
candidate Gore of being soft on defense. For their part, certain
conservative senators have battened on the public's psychological
craving for absolute security to flog an issue that pollsters
describe as a no-lose proposition.
</P>
<P>
   But science adheres to principles of proof and disproof that
politics cannot bend to its purposes. While partisan politicians
ignore the warnings of independent scientists, the country risks
provoking a new nuclear arms race encompassing China, India, and
Pakistan. In their debates, Bush and Gore should stop acting like
enthusiasts who have not heard the bad news and start discussing
the real advantages and disadvantages of disparate missile defense
approaches, including those that rely on lasers and boost-phase
interception.

GORE CHALLENGES BUSH ON SOCIAL SECURITY INVESTMENT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes time reference.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ George W. Bush should explain to the American
people before the election how he would pay up to $1 trillion in
transition costs for his plan to let workers invest some of their
Social Security taxes in the stock market, Al Gore said Friday
</P>
<P>
   Pivoting off a planned speech about education and job training,
the Democratic presidential contender focused on his rival's
repeated unwillingness to provide such details. Bush has said the
details will be worked out in negotiations with Congress after he
is elected.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said the specifics are especially important
considering the $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut that Bush wants to
provide. Gore contends the tax cut would crowd out other uses for
projected budget surpluses, including improving education and
retraining workers for the high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have to make hard choices, we don't pretend that we
can have our surplus and eat it, too,'' Gore told students and
administrators at Delgado Community College. ``We face up to the
hard choices and just make 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It does matter if the numbers add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling Gore's statement was a letter sent to Bush by a longtime
Social Security commissioner and two other academics. They wrote:
``We do not understand how you are going to keep your promise not
to cut Social Security benefits for those at or near retirement
while diverting substantial payroll tax revenues into private
accounts. . . . The question is, where will that $1 trillion come
from?''
</P>
<P>
   The letter's authors _ Robert Ball, Social Security commissioner
from 1962 to 1973; Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution; and Alicia Munnell, a Boston College economics
professor _ said the only options are to cut benefits for existing
retirees; pay the costs with the surplus; pay them from the
existing Social Security trust fund, accelerating its insolvency;
or borrow the money.
</P>
<P>
   All three authors are not formally affiliated with the Gore
campaign, but have been advising the vice president and offering
analysis to reporters on the campaign's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign criticized the trio, offering excerpts of
interviews in which all three expressed support for having the
government _ not individuals _ invest Social Security money in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that Al Gore would unleash his own partisan
advisers to attack Governor Bush on Social Security, since all
three advocate making the federal government the largest investor
in the stock market and increasing taxes to shore up Social
Security,'' said Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett. ``Governor Bush's
plan locks away $2.4 trillion to save and strengthen Social
Security and provides younger workers more control over their
retirement savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential contenders acknowledge that the Social
Security system must be reformed to maintain its solvency. While
the system currently takes in more money than it pays out in
benefits, that will change with the retirement of the Baby Boom
generation and increasing life expectancies.
</P>
<P>
   By 2015, the Social Security Administration will start paying
out more in benefits that it takes in from payroll taxes. By 2037,
the system is projected to be insolvent. Gore wants to extend it to
2054 by paying down the national debt and plowing the interest
savings back into the Social Security trust fund. Bush contends
that Gore would do so with IOUs that would ultimately cost $67
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush hasn't directly addressed the solvency issue, he has
proposed allowing younger workers to invest some of their 12.4
percent Social Security tax in the stock market to achieve greater
retirement savings. The Texas governor hasn't defined a percentage,
but most discussion centers on 2 percentage points, or about 16
percent of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   A ``transition cost'' would be incurred as younger workers
shifted over to the private accounts, reducing the amount of money
flowing into the trust fund even as it is being drawn upon to pay
benefits for existing retirees. Experts say it could create a cash
shortfall of up to $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced his proposal in April, Bush said he wanted to
avoid details to leave negotiating room with Congress and avoid the
gridlock that doomed President Clinton's proposal to provide
universal health insurance.

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ A favorite story of Joe Ford, chairman and
chief executive of the Alltel Corp., involves a real yet proverbial
little old lady. He tells it to every new group of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1948, Alltel, then known as Allied Telephone, bought a
group of tiny independent phone companies in southwest Arkansas,
including one in the hamlet of Amity. ``It had 200, maybe 250
customers,'' Ford recalled. It also had an employee named Edna
Nunn, who, despite being restricted to a wheelchair by childhood
polio, operated the company's manual switchboard, collected all its
bills and handled customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Ford became vice president and treasurer of Allied
in 1963, he noticed something odd about the Amity operation.
``Every single bill was paid on time,'' he said. ``Same thing the
second month. Now, that just doesn't happen.'' But it did happen
again the month after that, so Ford drove out to Amity to get an
firsthand explanation from Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she said bashfully, ``they'll all pay me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford uses the story to drive home a central tenet in his
strategy _ that customer service translates into customer loyalty.
From a small regional base, he has built a communications empire
around the idea, one whose modest national profile belies its size
and reach. And if the concept is not necessarily original to Ford,
well, ``I still want to convey that attitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday, however, Ford seemed equally eager to be
conveyed to Scotland, to start a vacation with his wife after 14
breakneck months of acquisition and expansion at Alltel. The
company now has 10 million communications customers in 24 states,
making it the sixth-largest land-line phone company in the country
and the fifth-largest wireless provider; nearly a million of those
customers have been added since Ford's last vacation in June 1999
(golf in Pebble Beach, Calif.)
</P>
<P>
   Growth by accretion has been the rule since Ford married the
founder's daughter, Jo Ellen Wilbourn, and joined the company as an
advertising salesman in 1959. That year, Allied Telephone reported
a whopping $12,000 in profit.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1960s and 1970s, most of the company's acquisitions
were of small, independent operators in Arkansas and nearby states
_ like the one that brought Edna Nunn onto the payroll. But that
all changed in 1983 when Ford, by then a senior executive, helped
engineer a transforming merger in which Allied effectively
swallowed Mid-Continent Telephone of Canton, Ohio, a company four
times its size, to form Alltel. Ford became president and chief
executive in 1987 and chairman in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   More big deals followed, culminating in the $6 billion
acquisition in 1998 of 360(degree symbol) Communications, a
wireless operator based in Chicago with 2.6 million subscribers. A
smaller deal last year _ $1.8 billion for Aliant Communications of
Lincoln, Neb. _ brought the total number since Ford joined the
company to more than 250.
</P>
<P>
   Other independent phone companies have also expanded by gobbling
up their peers, large and small, but few have transformed their
businesses quite as sweepingly. The 360(degree symbol)
Communications deal was ``the seminal event for the company,'' said
Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber,
because it made Alltel as much a wireless company as a land-line
phone utility; last year, wireless operations provided 42 percent
of Alltel's $6.3 billion in revenue and 52 percent of its $1.62
billion in operating income.
</P>
<P>
   The two businesses are closely integrated. ``While others are
talking about bundling of services and being a company that
provides one-stop shopping, Alltel is, of all the large companies,
the only one executing that strategy well,'' Strumingher said.
``There's no other company I know of at its size or larger that has
completely torn down the structural barriers that exist between
wireless and hard-line business.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's growth has not come cheaply. In some deals, Ford
said in an interview, he has agreed to pay as much as $1,100 a
customer _ a price that he regards as a sharp premium, but one that
market conditions forced on him. ``Everything I've ever bought, I
always thought I paid too much for,'' he said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   But the math has always turned out all right, he quickly added:
``We've worked through everything we've paid.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to giant rivals like the former Bell companies,
which usually turn for capital to the big financial center banks
and Wall Street houses, Alltel has financed much of its growth
through a Little Rock neighbor that shares its tendency to fly
under the radar of its rivals: Stephens Inc., the brokerage and
investment banking firm. The Stephens Group, the family-owned
parent holding company of Stephens, is also Alltel's largest
shareholder, with a stake valued at about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's personal ties to the Stephens family are three decades
old; he and his wife are close friends of Jackson Stephens,
chairman of Stephens, and Ford's youngest son, Scott, 38, worked
for Stephens for a decade before becoming an executive at Alltel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The changing industry landscape has helped open the way for
Alltel. ``Deregulation changed it all,'' Ford said. ``Competition
replaces regulation.'' But he wondered whether the government's
grip has relaxed enough. ``The FCC, to my mind, is still too much
of a regulator,'' he said. ``They've been doing too much `social'
regulation as opposed to economic regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's other main public policy concern is education. ``I think
it's pretty serious when some youngster comes out of high school
and really can't read or write,'' said Ford, whose father was a
state education commissioner for many years. Without adequate
schooling, he said, people cannot take full advantage of Internet
access, a market he has positioned Alltel to penetrate,
particularly through wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the thing that's out there,'' Ford said. ``I'm convinced
people are going to be more on the go in the future than they have
been in the past. They want access to information and we want to
give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Alltel took a big step toward that goal with a deal
it struck earlier this year with Verizon Communications, swapping
$600 million in cash and some of Alltel's wireless properties in
the Midwest and Northeast for Verizon's in Ohio and in Sun Belt
states from Arizona to Florida. Alltel gained 700,000 customers in
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Colette Fleming, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New
York, said the deal was shrewd for the company, even though by
widening its service area it is increasing the proportion of its
calling volume that will not generate roaming charges, the fees
that callers pay when using their phones outside their own
company's territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any short-term hit they're taking in earnings due to reduced
roaming revenues is necessary to position them for the long term,''
Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   The company told analysts last Thursday that 2001 earnings would
indeed fall short of the $3.26 a share that they had been
expecting, and that $3 to $3.10 was more likely. But Bruce Behrens,
who manages the Flag Investors Communication fund, said Alltel
stock ``ought to be worth a lot more'' than the $50.88 it fetched
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will turn 65 in 2002, and expects to retire then. His son
Scott, now chief operating officer, is widely seen as his heir
apparent, but Ford deflects questions about succession, saying
only, ``It's up to the board of directors.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he is enjoying Alltel's success as much as ever. ``I
think we've hit a stride,'' he said. ``I think it's just a matter
of `keep expanding, keep growing.' I get up every day looking
forward to it.''

MOVING INTO EINSTEIN'S HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 10, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a roomful of profesionals, Eric Maskin would not stand out
except perhaps for his gravity and the the mildness of his mien. He
is 49, somewhat formal. He plays classical clarinet well enough to
have once thought of trying to make his living as a concert
musician, but that is true of any number of professional
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the economist Maskin who this autumn is moving into
the house at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.,
that once belonged to Albert Einstein. And as you would expect,
there is a story in that.
</P>
<P>
   Maskin's appointment was the climax to a long search to replace
Albert Hirschman as the only economist on the faculty of the
storied Institute. Founded in 1930 as a research center where great
minds could pursue their studies without the burden of teaching,
the Institute became a haven to Einstein, mathematicians John von
Neumann and Kurt Goedel, as well as any number of humanists of
similiar seniority in their fields. Promising young scholars visit
for a year at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschman himself is, at least in certain precincts, only
somewhat hard an act to follow than is Einstein. As a Jewish
refugee from Nazi Germany in the 1930s, he spent most of a decade
battling fascism in Italy, Spain, and France, then fled to the
United States and became an influential development adviser to
third world nations for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   After his appointment to the Institute in 1974, he wrote a
series of perceptive and original books which stretched the
conventional boundaries of economics. He is the living symbol of
the humanist approach to the discipline, an action intellectual who
throughout his career rejected the modern tendency to formalism,
politely but firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Maskin is just the opposite. A highly-regarded theorist who
played a key part in the integration of game theory into economics
in the 1970s and 1980s, he continues to use entirely mathematical
tools in his investigations into learning, bargaining and other
topics. So his selection is important for what it says about the
changing place of economic thought in American culture.
Traditionally the Institute's mathematicians and physicists have
disdained economists; humanists have mistrusted them. Hirschman
held his ground with moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his temperament, Maskin may be the ideal person to
mediate in the little inderdisciplinary hothouse, says a colleague.
The house? It was no part of the recruting bargain, says Maskin.
The home of Einstein's sister-in-law until the mid-'80s, and a
physicist after that, it just happened to be empty when the time
came to move. Maskin had other motives. ``Even at a university as
good as Harvard, you never see the people in the building next door
to your own. The demands of a department are just too great.''
</P>
<P>
   That Princeton was to lure Maskin away from Cambridge -- a
Harvard professor, he had been visiting the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology last year -- reflects the continuing improvement in
the fortunes of economics at that very wealthy university. The
department has recruited several top economists in recent years:
Jose Scheinkman from Chicago, Christopher Sims from Yale, Paul
Krugman from MIT. With Maskin also planning to teach, Princeton
surely now must be considered among the top centers of American
economics, along with MIT, Harvard, Stanford and the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will applaud the institute's choice. The scene in
France has been enlived this summer by the appearance of a
newsletter of Post-Autistic Economics, aiming to ``link people
wishing to bring sanity, humanity and science back to economics.''
(A translation can be had for the price of a blank e-mail to
pae(long dash)news(at)hotmail.com.) The first issue reported, ``The
French economics mainstream is in a state of shock and apprehension
following dramatic and unexpected events in June.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Ecole Normale Superieure, a leading university, students
had circulated a petition complaining of excessive mathematical
formalization. Le Monde, the Paris daily, took up the cudgel on
their behalf. Some well-known economists _ Daniel Cohen, Jean-Paul
Fitoussi, Michel Vernieres -- expressed sympathy and support.
Education minister Jack Lang promised an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   More indicative of the drift in France, however, may be the fact
that mathematical economists at the Institut Universitaire de
France (who are among the leaders in the world) have begun teaching
their courses in Toulouse in English in order to attract higher
quality international students. Mathematics has become the standard
language of written economics; perhaps the conversion to a verbal
English standard is next.
</P>
<P>
   At the Eighth World Congress of the Econometric Society in
Seattle last month, Maskin gave the first of five featured
lectures. His topic was auctions: the growing excitement among
theorists as economists learn to design auctions which take effect
of the interdependence of values, instead of pretending (as in the
past) that no buyer's private information affects any others'
valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Governments have been conducting such auctions for years, of
course, especially of the rights to the electromagnetic spectrum
for television and radio broadcasts and cell phones. They had been
alerted to the possibilities by theorists such as William Vickrey
and Ronald Coase. Robert Wilson, the Stanford University professor
who introduced Maskin, is a principal in a firm that has made a
fortune serving as consultant on spectrum auctions. But greater
realism in theory means better results in practice, as economists
home in on a better understanding of the intricacies of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Other plenary lectures at the Seattle meetings included Torsten
Persson of Stockholm's Institute for International Economics,
surveying extensive new work on how political institutions shape
market outcomes; James Heckman of the University of Chicago on
various grounds for evaluating the effects of policies; Thomas
Sargent of Stanford University on the difficulty of anticipating
all possible outcomes of events; and Elhanan Helpman of Tel-Aviv
University and Harvard University on the nature of lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Economics is becoming harder, as physics is hard. But this is as
far from autism _ the disregard of external reality _ as you can
get. Economics itself is moving into Einstein's house.

   LABOR-CONTRACTS (Undated) _ It's been not just a big month, but
a gigantic month for big labor judging from the bargaining results
at some of the nation's best-known companies, like
Bridgestone/Firestone, United Airlines, and Verizon, formerly
called Bell Atlantic. While it is unclear whether these three
settlements will be imitated, what is clear is that labor unions
are doing much better at the bargaining table than even five years
ago when much of corporate America was demanding _ and winning _
major concessions on wages and benefits. By Steven Greenhouse

   RUSSIA-MICROPHONES (Tula, Russia) _ A small Soviet-era factory
called Oktava has a well-known fan: the musician Sting. The reason
is its microphones. The company, based in this small city three
hours south of Moscow, was focused primarily on weapons production
in Soviet times. But since the 1950s, when Moscow ordered mass
production for everything from recording studios to
telecommunications equipment, it has been making a variety of
microphones that lately have found unlikely global success. By

OLD FOES MEET IN A MORMON NEUTRAL GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELMONT, Mass. -- Politics is a Massachusetts blood sport, but
its wounds can heal with time.
</P>
<P>
   That message was reaffirmed Friday at the gleaming Mormon temple
on a Belmont mount, where church activist Mitt Romney led US
Senator Edward M. Kennedy on a tour of the controversial, nearly
completed structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not bad blood; there has not been bad blood,'' Romney
said of his relationship with Kennedy since their bruising US
Senate campaign in 1994. ``We have differing views on a number of
issues, for sure. But as individuals, we certainly respect each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney's prominent role in the Mormon Church played a part in
the Senate race. Kennedy and his nephew, then-US Representative
Joseph P. Kennedy II, said then that Romney should be questioned
about the Church's exclusion of women from the clergy and its ban
before 1978 against black clergy.
</P>
<P>
   A quick, negative backlash stung the Kennedys, and Joseph
Kennedy apologized for saying, incorrectly, that Mormons continued
to ban blacks from the clergy. The role of religion in the
remainder of the campaign was put to rest -- publicly, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, any lingering aftertaste from that delicate
but explosive issue appeared to have been long washed away, with
Kennedy praising the ``magnificent'' architecture of the temple and
the zeal of its missionaries. The senator even said he believes the
temple should be allowed to build a 139-foot spire that neighbors
have blocked in Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If other churches are going to have their expressions in terms
of spires, this one should as well. What's fair is fair,'' Kennedy
said. The Belmont temple has brought its case to the state Appeals
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the former rivals, only their second since the
campaign, may have further undercut the sputtering, renegade bid by
Jack E. Robinson to unseat Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Romney Friday declined to endorse Robinson, a fellow Republican
who has been unable to secure any backing from the state's GOP
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know him. I haven't met him, haven't heard from him.
I'm living in Utah now,'' said Romney, who was summoned after a
corruption scandal to be chief executive of the 2002 Winter
Olympics, which is planned for Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, too, shied away from giving Robinson any recognition.
When asked if he would debate his challenger, Kennedy answered
instead by thanking Romney profusely for inviting him to the
temple.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the tour, Kennedy listened respectfully as Romney and
church elders guided the senator through various rooms where
Mormons will reflect, pray and marry after the temple's dedication
on Oct. 1. He also asked many questions, particularly about the
church's aggressive missionary program in which 60,000 young people
are spreading the faith worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1994 campaign, Romney had been president of the 14
Mormon churches in the Boston area. At the time, he said that an
elected official could be a devout Mormon and also protect the
beliefs of others.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters remained unconvinced. Romney said after the race
that his religion may have contributed to a sense that he was
culturally alienated from the largely Catholic electorate in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Romney also was hurt by the Kennedy's efforts to portray him as
a heartless corporate raider, linking him to the layoffs of 266
union workers in Indiana. Some of the striking workers traveled to
Massachusetts to blast Romney, whose venture capital firm had
acquired the company that laid off the employees.
</P>
<P>
   Romney had not been directly involved in the layoffs, having
taken a leave of absence as chairman of Bain Capital in order to
campaign. But he was slow to respond to the Kennedy attacks, and he
further hurt himself by describing the layoffs as justified
economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Romney reiterated his stance that Mormons can separate
religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally keep three things completely separate: sport,
politics and religion,'' Romney said. ``I have strong faith, but I
don't mix my faith and my sport, or my politics. Instead, I try to
keep those in separate dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator echoed that sentiment. ``I think President Kennedy
probably said it best: that he wanted to be evaluated as an
American who was Catholic and not as a Catholic president,''
Kennedy added.

 &HT;    Leaving life gracefully
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANDALIA, Ohio _ The morning after Chuck Gross's 90th birthday
bash, he woke up in severe pain from a fracture in his spine. His
doctor guessed it had been caused by the spread of his prostate
cancer, first diagnosed eight years before. But Gross declined to
be treated or even tested for metastatic disease. He felt the time
had come to leave this life gracefully, and on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't interested in any heroic measures _ no chemotherapy
or anything like that,'' Gross said. ``I figure I'd lived my
lifespan _ over my lifespan. I was on borrowed time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days before his birthday last December, Gross had been
cooking, cleaning, even driving. So his doctor assumed that his
refusal of treatment meant that he was depressed and prescribed a
mood-enhancing medication. Gross told his family to flush the pills
down the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever been depressed,'' he said. ``I just
knew I didn't want to set any records for longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Until two generations ago, Americans usually died suddenly after
an acute illness or an accident. But infections and fevers that
once ran their deadly course in a matter of days have been replaced
by chronic illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease and
Alzheimer's, that take months and even years to kill while doctors
and patients fight back with an array of modern medical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, dying for most people has become a process, one that
requires more care and more forethought than ever before. Every
family faces a different set of challenges, and every death has its
own course.
</P>
<P>
   In the mornings when he rises, Gross sits a moment on the edge
of his bed and musters his strength to meet the day. In silhouette,
his curved back and bone-thin legs form a human question mark.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his cancer, Gross also suffers from emphysema, the
result of 65 years of smoking. Just reaching for the phone now can
leave him gasping. At his family's insistence, Chuck quit smoking
four years ago when he first moved into the Vandalia home of his
oldest son, Charlie, and his wife, Susie.
</P>
<P>
   In May, after Gross had grown so thin and weak he needed a
wheelchair, he talked with his three grown sons about his decision
to let go. They agreed to share in his care and promised to keep
him comfortable. In June, they called on Hospice of Dayton, a
nonprofit agency that neither hastens nor postpones death. Its
mission is to keep patients free of pain and their quality of life
as high as possible, to the very end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was on the last furlong, and we talked about it
with him,'' said Charlie, 54. ``We knew nothing about hospice,
except that they help people through the death process. And we had
heard nothing but good things about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospices here and around the country began as a volunteer
movement 25 years ago that believed in providing services to ease
the pain and fear at the end of life rather than therapies that
hook patients to machines and isolate them from loved ones. Hospice
founders set out to give dying patients and their families choices,
and to help them face life's inevitable end with dignity, comfort
and hope. Hospice services include patient and family counseling,
specialized nursing care and drugs and supplies for pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s, the hospice industry, which gets nearly $2
billion a year from Medicare, has been forced to operate
increasingly like a business because of government and insurance
constraints. In the past five years, the average number of Hospice
of Dayton patients served in the Miami Valley dropped by a third,
from 324 per day in 1996 to 221 in 1998. Currently, Hospice of
Dayton cares for about 240 patients per day in its inpatient and
home-care programs. While the organization continues to break even,
it drew on $2.8 million in community donations last year to cover
the cost of uncompensated care.
</P>
<P>
   FACING THE INEVITABLE WITH A CLEAR VISION
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gross, Chuck's 51-year-old middle son, said their father
made it easy to get hospice involved early on, before Chuck was in
crisis and while heads in the family were still clear. ``He said
that sounded like a good idea. . . . He knows he only has so much
time left. He's never tried to put a phony face on things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospice nurse Donna Sweeney, who visits Gross once a week to
check on his symptoms and his medications, said Chuck's
straightforward approach to death, and his sons' forethought in
granting his wishes, aren't typical of American families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never talk about (death and dying) until it's too late,''
she said. ``We reached some turning point in the 20th century where
we thought, once we were born, we would live forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross had been prescribed morphine pills by his physician to
control his pain, but his stomach couldn't tolerate them. Instead,
he was switched to a slow-release Duragesic patch, which lasts
three days. The patch, along with regular doses of the milder
pain-killer Darvocet, have eliminated his pain with few side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   When hospice staff took over Chuck's pain management, Charlie
noted, they were more flexible in their approach. ``The nurse told
us you could put on two patches at once if you needed to . . . and
there's no rigid rule that you have to wait 72 hours to change his
patch,'' he said. ``These hospice nurses really know more about
pain control than the doctors because they deal with it all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chuck receives visits from a hospice social worker,
a hospice chaplain and a hospice volunteer, all of whom help attend
to his emotional and spiritual needs.
</P>
<P>
   `I'M GOING TO A FAR BETTER PLACE'
</P>
<P>
   End-of-life experts would agree that the Gross family is doing
nearly everything right in supporting Chuck in his decision, but
family stresses and strain are inevitable. In early June, when
Charlie was convinced that he was ``shutting down,'' Charlie and
his brothers spent a 12-hour vigil in Chuck's room until the
feeling passed.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been nights when Chuck has woken in a panic,
overwhelmed with an indescribable dread, a feeling he compares to a
visit from ``the Angel of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just had a feeling he was going to die and he couldn't
explain it,'' Charlie said. ``Of course, maybe the Angel of Death
was there. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   On those nights, Chuck called out for Charlie and asked him to
stay with him and rub his back. On several nights, he asked if
Charlie would sleep in his room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always says, `Apologize to Susie that I asked you to stay
here,' '' Charlie said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though hospice works to educate families on the warning
signs of impending death, emotions can take over. Charlie and his
brothers twice have called Sweeney when they were convinced their
father was near death. ``The sons went into panic mode. But you can
expect that: They haven't dealt with this before,'' Sweeney said.
She noted that Chuck cared for his wife, Ruth, almost exclusively
during the last two years of her life, shielding his sons from the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said he is comfortable now and ready to accept the
inevitable. He neither looks forward to nor fears death, he said,
believing ``that when I die I'm going to a far better place than I
am now.'' A Lutheran by faith, he believes in the Resurrection and
looks forward to meeting his past friends and loved ones in the
next life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a place of great peace and joy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck has given power of attorney for medical decisions to
Charlie. His advance directive asks that there be no tube feeding
and no resuscitation efforts and that he be permitted to die at
home _ hopefully, surrounded by his three sons _ rather than in a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's had good days when he can walk behind his
wheelchair from kitchen to bedroom, Chuck mostly sits and conserves
his strength. His small sitting room has been dubbed ``the Ferndale
room,'' since it is furnished with a well-worn recliner, an old
clock and other beloved items from the family's Ferndale Avenue
home, where Chuck lived for 46 years. The room has a window that
looks out to a neighbor's gazebo and a small wooded lot. He likes
to watch the treetops swaying in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think I'd get bored sitting here and doing nothing, but
I really don't,'' he said, his hands clasped behind his head. ``The
Lord made me a good sitter. There's an art to good sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that cartoon guy, the one that always said, `What, me
worry?' I guess that's it. I don't worry about anything. There's
very little in the world you can change, so why not accept it and
not worry. I guess that's my philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK ON LESSONS LEARNED
</P>
<P>
   Gross credits a strong religious faith for his belief in death
as a transition, but he says he's still left wondering about the
meaning of his long life when so many of his friends and family
members have passed, including his wife of 43 years, Ruth Louise,
who died in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I still here? I'm pretty much to the useless point now,
yet I know I'm here for a purpose. I just can't see any. But the
Lord must have some reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross quotes a snippet of poetry long ago committed to memory,
some lines he saw on a now-forgotten wall plaque. ``I would not sit
in the scorner's seat, nor hurl the cynic's ban. But let me live in
a house by the side of the road, and be a friend of man. . .''
</P>
<P>
   His sons say their father, a retired accountant who once headed
Dayton's tax division, is facing death with the same grace and
equanimity that he brought to his life. ``Not that he never gets
rattled or doesn't have a bad day, but he doesn't stay there,''
Steve said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck wasn't always so even-tempered. He remembered a day during
the Great Depression when he discovered the boss's son had gotten a
pay raise while he had taken a cut. ``I was sitting in my boss's
chair, my feet up on his desk, yelling my head off when I fell back
flat on the floor. I was still yelling, with my finger in the air,
when it suddenly dawned on me: Here I was, making all this fuss,
and it won't accomplish a damn thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I try to be more selective in my anger. In fact, I don't
have much anger in me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross says he has no major regrets in his life, although he
never took that ocean cruise he promised himself after spending the
war in an accounting office in East Africa, working for an aircraft
maintenance center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a happy marriage, a good home. I enjoyed my family. I
was basically a happy man at heart,'' he said. ``I guess if I knew
then what I know now I would have gotten more education. But I grew
up at a time when you didn't need a (college) degree to be an
accounting clerk.'' He was among the first graduates from Dayton's
Roosevelt High School in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   `THERE'S NOTHING UNDONE, NOTHING UNSAID'
</P>
<P>
   Charlie and his two brothers say the talks with their father,
and with the hospice staff, have prepared them for their father's
death. ``When he goes, it's going to be OK. We've given him
permission to die,'' Charlie said. ``There's nothing undone,
nothing unsaid.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Gross family has come to accept Chuck's dying so matter
of factly, it may be because they have lived so closely together as
a family.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day weekend, the three sons and their children gathered
at Charlie's home in Vandalia, as they do for nearly every holiday.
They fired up the grill for hamburgers and then did what the Gross
family has done at every gathering since the boys were big enough
to bounce a basketball _ played hoops in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck watches from his wheelchair as his own sons take on the
grandkids _ Kevin, 24; Nate, 22 and Jonathan, 16 _ in what the
youngest son Dave calls a ``grudge match'' between the two
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've beaten us the last two times, but we still hold the
overall title,'' said Dave, 43. ``And we always will, because we'll
quit before we let them take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie compared his childhood memories on Ferndale Avenue to
episodes of ``Leave it to Beaver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our life was like what so many people make fun of today. We
didn't have much, but we ate well. Our mother was a professional
homemaker. We were a close family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being together as a family _ that was fun, and still
is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing end-of-life issues with their father is easier, too,
because ``he's still sharp,'' Steve said. ``He's still like he's
always been: he's just Dad. You can be like two adults (with him),
or if you want to talk about something, you can get advice _ like a
son to a father.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck reads mysteries and historical novels, devours crossword
puzzles and can still play a mean game of Trivial Pursuit. ``He's
one of the smartest men I've ever met,'' Charlie said. ``He has a
vast array of what he calls useless knowledge. . . . He still beats
everyone who's on 'Jeopardy ' and 'Wheel of Fortune.''''
</P>
<P>
   TELLING THE TRUTH WITH COMPASSION
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said that Chuck's vital signs have been strong enough
lately that, if he continues to stabilize over the next few months,
he might be discharged from the hospice program. Patients must have
a life expectancy of six months or less to qualify for hospice
services.
</P>
<P>
   But predicting longevity is as much an art as a science, she
said. ``One time it will turn out exactly the way you tell the
family, and the next three times it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Every person reacts differently to their approaching death,
Sweeney said, and in her 8 1/2 years as a hospice nurse, she's seen
the full range, from a 57-year-old woman who made all of her own
funeral arrangements before deciding to end her kidney dialysis and
her life, to a real estate woman in her 50s with end-stage lung
cancer who begged Sweeney ``to help me get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Telling patients the truth in such cases is the only option, she
said, but it has to be done with care. ``Those are the ones where
you take a deep breath and hope you're saying the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, not everything that comes out of our mouth is always
from us. For those who believe it's from God, it's from God,'' she
said. ``You just know when you go off on this progression of words.
You ask yourself, where did that come from? I'm not that clever.
I'm not that smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Gross says the day his brothers and father met with the
hospice team for the first time in June, ``It was strange _ just
the fact that you're sitting down and you're talking about someone
in your midst who is probably going to die in the foreseeable
future. But it was actually a good meeting. We actually laughed a
lot, and once it was over, (Chuck) said he felt really good about
things.''
</P>
<P>
   It was after one of his father's Angel of Death experiences that
Charlie started getting Chuck up in the mornings before going off
to his job as a salesman for RIS Paper in Dayton. Charlie helps his
father dress, brings him a wet rag for washing and combs his hair.
Then he wheels him out to the kitchen, where Chuck usually has a
frozen waffle and tea as he reads the morning paper.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast on a recent morning, Charlie wheeled Chuck back
to the Ferndale room, watched as he settled into his recliner and
then stooped to give him a big parting hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``See you tonight,'' Charlie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss you,'' said his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay out of the liquor cabinet,'' Charlie teased.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you sell a lot of paper today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd better, or they'll fire me,'' Charlie said.
</P>
<P>
   On his way back to the kitchen, Charlie said, ``When he's having
a tough time, he doesn't want to be alone. You might have to sit
with him more, and he wants to know where you are. You'll ask him,
'Are you hurting?' He'll say no, but he'll say, `My mind is racing
and I'm fidgeting. Just sit with me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he wants to die alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Illich, a hospice volunteer, visits with Gross just to talk,
or not to talk, whichever seems more comfortable at the time. ``He
needs company. So he has a big family? That doesn't mean
anything,'' Illich said. ``You can feel isolated at times even with
a big family.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time he visited Gross, Illich said, ``I thought I had
to talk. I thought Chuck would be upset with me if I didn't say
anything. But the second time I just sat there. I felt comfortable,
and I think Chuck did, too.''
</P>
<P>
   THE AGE-OLD CYCLE COMES AROUND AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Steve, who helps shower his father and cuts his hair, said Chuck
has made it easier on his sons by accepting their care.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not embarrassed at all by what we do for him,'' Steve
said. ``I told him, `You know you took care of us when we were
little. We'll never be able to return the favor.' And he said, `But
that was different.' I said, `No, it is isn't. It's the same
thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dave agreed with his brother. ``It's almost a privilege to be
able to care for him now. It's a way of completing the whole
cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie refuses to use the word ``tied down'' in relation to his
father's care, but he and his wife Susie can't leave him by himself
for long periods. And Chuck needs Charlie's help getting up in the
mornings and going to bed at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a bit like having a child again,'' Charlie said.
``He told me one night, `Our roles are reversed now.' I told him,
`That may be true, but we'll never catch up. We'll never get even
for all the things you did for us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's the age-old cycle, Dave said, of love begetting love from
one generation to the next. ``We're all pretty much convinced that
love isn't what you feel, it's what you do,'' he said. ``Our
parents taught us that.''

<P>
   MITSUBISHI (Normal, Ill.) _ For a short but trying time a few
years ago, this small town made national headlines. Horrifying
stories had emerged about the Mitsubishi auto assembly plant here.
Its factory floor, some workers charged, was one where some men
felt free to grope female workers, to ask them to bare their
breasts or to aim air guns between their legs. The company, while
vehemently denying the charges, nevertheless agreed in June 1998 to
pay a record $34 million to settle the largest federal lawsuit over
sexual harassment. In reality, however, while the headlines have
faded, the problems have not. By Reed Abelson. (With photo and

   INVEST-BHAMAN-OPPENHEIMER (Undated) _ Ajeev Bhaman was born in
Bombay, has lived in England and was educated in the United States.
As a teen-ager, he traveled the world with his father, the captain
of a cargo ship. So he is not fazed by the travel required in his
job, running the $170.8 million Oppenheimer Developing Markets
fund. His travels have paid off. The fund returned 12.7 percent a
year, on average, for the three years through Sept. 1, putting it

   OFFICE-POLITICS (Undated) _ With the post-Labor Day political

<P>
   HEALTHCARE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The consensus of
politicians, economists and the public on health policy has shifted
since the 1992 election. Then, the prevailing view was that the
failure of many Americans to have medical insurance posed a serious
national problem. Now, the politicians and economists have come to
believe _ and the public has become convinced _ that the problem is
simply too difficult to solve in one giant stroke. By David E.
Rosenbaum.

   BUSH-INSULT-REVIEW (Undated) _ I am used to being around big
news. But observing the story is different than being it. And last
week I seemed to be the story. Gov. George W. Bush spotted me at a
rally in Naperville, Ill. Not realizing the microphones were
working, he told his running mate, Dick Cheney, that I was a
``major league (expletive).'' This was hardly the first time I have
been attacked, though it was the first time the attack accorded me
``major league'' status. By Adam Clymer.

   GLOBAL-WARMING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Past climate ups and downs
mostly mesh well with simultaneous natural variations in the
brightness of the sun or the cooling effect of parasol-like plumes
of particles spewed by big volcanoes. But the recent warming,
according to several recent studies, only correlates well with one
thing: the buildup of carbon dioxide, methane and the other
greenhouse gases. The lesson in all of this, according to many
climate scientists, is that no one should expect some alarm bell to
start ringing to conveniently summon societies to take action to
forestall a hot-house future. By Andrea C. Revkin.

<P>
   RELIGION-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The disagreement over the
proper place of religion in politics summons us once again to the
works of those ever-useful observers of American life, Alexis de
Tocqueville of France and James Bryce of Britain. Both of their
classic studies, Tocqueville's ``Democracy in America'' (1835) and
Bryce's ``The American Commonwealth'' (1888), attend the matter in
a spirit that should elicit an amen from Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who
has rekindled the issue by saying that religion supports a moral
foundation for public policy. By Walter Goodman.

<P>
   BANNED-APPAREL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why do politicians focus on
certain types of clothing. And how does a brief bit of fabric cause
so much consternation? Several nations have banned or actively
discouraged miniskirts. France requires male bathers to wear
skintight Speedos rather than trunks, on the ground that trunks
could pass for shorts and be worn in potentially unsanitary areas.
And in America, Chief Justice William Rehnquist has suggested that
women in provocative clothing may be inadvertently inviting sexual
harassment. By Jenny Lyn Bader.

   CIA-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The CIA has been struggling
for its footing since the end of the Cold War robbed it of a raison
d'etre. But under the Clinton administration, it has suffered from
two worsening trends: a skittishness about politically sensitive
intelligence and an aversion to risky espionage operations. This
spring CIA analysts were ordered that there were to be no surprises
and no intelligence fiascos that could cause headaches in November.

   OLYMPIC-FORECAST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Two Yale business school
professors have developed a formula they say enables them to
predict exactly how many gold medals each country will win at the

   YUGO-ELECTION-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Democracy is about choice, but
in the Yugoslav version, now playing itself out with Slobodan
Milosevic's future at stake, there are likely to be more choices
than usual. But with a strong opposition candidate doing better
than Milosevic in the opinion polls, Milosevic also gets to make a
choice: whether to accept the choice of the people _ if it goes
against him _ or to manipulate the totals and declare victory
regardless. By Steven Erlanger. (Moving in `i' category)

   THEATER-NEW-SEASON (New York) _ Ben Brantley surveys the

Albee, one of the handful of working American playwrights to whom
the word ``great'' adheres easily and a dramatist who rarely fails
to exasperate and never fails to intrigue.
</P>

   DEVIL-FILM (Los Angeles) _ Lately, and almost unnoticed, the
Devil has been getting his due on the silver screen. For the new
season, ``Bedazzled'' stars Brendan Fraser as a nerdy young man who
surrenders his soul to a very seductive Devil played by Elizabeth
Hurley. ``Little Nicky'' stars Adam Sandler as Satan's good son,
Harvey Keitel as Satan and Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father. In
``Lost Souls,'' a thriller, Winona Ryder plays a devout
schoolteacher who becomes aware of a Satanic conspiracy. And the
granddaddy of them all, ``The Exorcist,'' will be re-released with
additional material never shown before. By Jamie Malanowski.

   VAMPIRE-FILM (Undated) _ When E. Elias Merhige's ``Shadow of the
Vampire,'' with its attention-snagging stars John Malkovich and
Willem Dafoe, opens on Dec. 29, it will mark at least the fourth
time that filmmakers have resuscitated this particular version of
the vampire: Nosferatu, that disturbingly peculiar and apparently
iconic figure created by an odd little group of Germans 79 years
ago. By Jim Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-SEASON (Undated) _ The cleft dividing the composers of the
19th century from those of the 20th is arguably the most prominent
geographical feature of our musical landscape. Two attitudes _ on
how music should sound, how it should feel and what its purpose
should be _ have split audiences, musicians and commentators so
decisively that in still a third century, the 21st, the gap is only
marginally narrower than it was 100 years ago. On consecutive days,

   POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ The paradox of pop is that intentions
rarely correspond to results. The most carefully thought out,
elaborately realized musical opus may well be ignored or
repudiated, while a casually tossed off ditty can turn out to be
timeless. Listeners, not musicians, will make the final decisions
about what is worth saving. And in the meantime, fleeting pleasures
will do just fine. By Jon Pareles.

   PIERRE-GILLES-ART (Paris) _ When Claudia Schiffer posed for
them, she became ``Venus,'' framed by sparkling plastic flowers,
two lovely tears running down her porcelain cheeks. The pop singer
Nina Hagen metamorphosed, improbably, into a beatific Virgin Mary
and, in another image, into a bondage victim, dressed in latex and
roped to a kitchen chair. Catherine Deneuve turned into the ``White
Queen,'' floating among clouds in a gown and tiara. This is the
pop-culture paradise of the French artists Pierre and Gilles, who
use fashion, religion and the star system to create an idealized
universe of their own. Over the next year, that universe is coming
to the United States. By Amy Serafin.

   ANTIQUES-SEASON (New York) _ In the year ahead there will be an
amazing variety of private art collections starring in exhibitions

private art collections are formed, why museums exhibit them _ and
in some cases acquire them _ and why museumgoers find them
irresistible. One such show, ``The Embodied Image: Chinese
Calligraphy From the John B. Elliott Collection,'' opens September
15 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. By Rita Reif.

BIOTECH PATENT TRIAL WRAPS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Trading charges of greed and deception, attorneys for
Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. and Amgen Inc. concluded a
four-month-long trial over TKT's alleged infringement of patents
Amgen holds on the world's best-selling biotechnology drug, Epogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greed here is the defendants's who wish to take our
product and sell it,'' said Lloyd Day, Amgen's chief attorney.
Epogen, which stimulates production of red blood cells and is
useful in combating anemia, has sales of $4 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In a courtroom filled with patent attorneys and Wall Street
biotechnology analysts, Day argued that TKT and its partner,
Aventis SA, did not prove that Amgen's five patents were invalid,
unclear, or that critical information was knowingly withheld from
the US Patent and Trademark office and from patent examiners. Thus,
he argued, Amgen's patents were sound.
</P>
<P>
   TKT's defense team said the Cambridge company is not violating
Amgen's patents because its gene-activation technology for making
erythropoietin, the protein that is the active ingredient in
Epogen, is significantly different. However, US District Court
Judge William Young ruled early in the trial that TKT infringed on
one of the five patents in question, weakening TKT's arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, several TKT attorneys reiterated their defense that
Amgen's patents are overly broad. Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks,
Calif., is abusing the patent system by making claims that were
never explained in its patent filings, said James Haley, a TKT
attonrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a common thread here, and that thread is greed,''
said Herbert Schwartz, the last of the four TKT attorneys who said
Amgen constructed a ``wall of patents'' to protect its product from
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were interrupted several times by Young, who sought
to clarify several issues as he listened to the closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a complex case, and the judge knows the legal
framework is very difficult,'' said Kathy Williams, biotech patent
counsel at the Boston law firm of Palmer &AMP; Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the judge gave himself a mental timeframe for deciding
of a month or two,'' said Ivor R. Elrifi, a biotech patent attorney
at Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq Stock Market, TKT shares closed at $38, down
$3.50, while Amgen shares rose $2.94 to close at $74.94.

   LABOR-CONTRACTS (Undated) _ It's been not just a big month, but
a gigantic month for big labor judging from the bargaining results
at some of the nation's best-known companies, like
Bridgestone/Firestone, United Airlines, and Verizon, formerly
called Bell Atlantic. While it is unclear whether these three
settlements will be imitated, what is clear is that labor unions
are doing much better at the bargaining table than even five years
ago when much of corporate America was demanding _ and winning _
major concessions on wages and benefits. By Steven Greenhouse

   RUSSIA-MICROPHONES (Tula, Russia) _ A small Soviet-era factory
called Oktava has a well-known fan: the musician Sting. The reason
is its microphones. The company, based in this small city three
hours south of Moscow, was focused primarily on weapons production
in Soviet times. But since the 1950s, when Moscow ordered mass
production for everything from recording studios to
telecommunications equipment, it has been making a variety of
microphones that lately have found unlikely global success. By

   GERMANY-WALLMART(Frankfurt, Germany) _ On Friday, German
competition regulators accused Wal-Mart Stores of being too
competitive, and ordered the giant retailer to raise its prices for

The decision is Wal-Mart's latest and strangest setback in Germany,
where it arrived two years ago with plans to overwhelm competitors
through lower prices, better selections and friendly store clerks.

 &HT;    LITTLE TREAD LEFT ON OLD POLITICAL WHEEL
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By JANE ELY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who practice, report or pontificate about politics long
have had a tendency to reinvent the proverbial wheel.
</P>
<P>
   This election, however, seems to have offered far more
reinvention cliches than any in modern times. At least, this seems
true to one old, tried _ and, admittedly, pretty tired _ political
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, this ragtag political writer finds herself
particularly resenting some of the conclusions this new generation
of political reinventors have attached to many of their varied new
views of old political ploys and personal acts.
</P>
<P>
   One activity that has presented a special opportunity for goofy
deductions has to do with political husbands and wives and the
exchanges of kisses _ and adoring looks _ between various pairs,
notably Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore and his wife,
Tipper, and former Republican President Ronald Reagan and his wife,
Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Some actually maintain that a strong contributor to Gore's
recent attraction for women voters can be directly attributed to
the passion demonstrated in the onstage embrace between Gore and
his wife at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITAL) The kiss, (END ITAL) a prolonged and rather
provocative act in political circles, actually has been cited as
the reason Gore finally has attracted the usually Democratic women
to his camp.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us more than resent this dopey conclusion, a conclusion,
by the way, most often reached _ and announced _ by men. Perhaps we
can take some heart that many of the guys hung up on the (BEGIN
ITAL) kiss, (END ITAL) at last, have suggested a reason for Gore's
belated political capture of many female voters might have more to
do with his positions on so-called women's issues than with how he
greeted his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Along these lines, no matter how incredible it may seem to many
of us, there actually is a new bunch of folk which has decided the
adoring looks Nancy Reagan so often cast at her husband may have
been genuine. This not-exactly-profound conclusion comes from those
who have seen the recently published ``I Love You, Ronnie,'' a
collection of letters written by Ronald Reagan to his wife, whom he
married in 1952, and her commentary.
</P>
<P>
   While admittedly the Reagans were not inclined to express their
more passionate feelings in such a forum as a national convention,
anyone who ever saw them really embrace can tell you their kisses
were scorchers, especially compared to the Gores' last month. Once,
a photographer who had fired his camera at a kiss of the Reagans
after they had been apart a few days swore the scene burned up his
film and he was unable to salvage any pictures.
</P>
<P>
   None who had seen that _ or any other semi-private Reagan _
embrace ever bothered to demand to see the reportedly burned-up
film.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most reinvented of all political wheels this year is
the one turning around the debate over the fairly traditional
presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Republican George W. Bush has managed to sound pretty
silly in his gamesmanship over where and when he'll debate Gore.
The candidate who balks the most at accepting the design of the
so-called official debate commission always does.
</P>
<P>
   But, the claim of many _ so-called independent observers as well
as a lot in the Gore camp _ that Bush wants to be seen in debate by
as few Americans as possible is downright insulting to the American
people as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   To contend, as the anti-Bushers do, that, ideally, the debates
should have no television competition is beyond silly. Their
premise that the more television channels carrying a debate, the
larger the audience, hardly compliments the American public.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, if a debate were broadcast only on, say, NBC, what
is there to keep everyone in America with a television set from
watching it? To suggest, as this bunch does, that the more
opportunities the public has to watch something other than a
debate, the smaller the debate audience will be, is one thing.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest, as this bunch does, that every effort should be made
to give the public no alternative to watching a debate is awfully
offensive to one old ragtagger.
</P>
<P>
   Good grief. This goes beyond Big Government to Big Brother and
that's flat damn terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are all those who think every political
action they haven't seen personally must be new.
</P>
<P>
   But ... enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many reinventions and interpretations on the old
political wheel, it soon may not be able to turn at all. Let us
hope it doesn't go completely flat before Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But, then, let us also hope it doesn't get so filled with hot
air by then that it bursts. &QL;

   KERRVILLE, Texas _ Gerardo Ureste wore a serene expression
Friday as he toppled charred trees and churned up embers from a
brush fire that had scorched the scenic highlands overlooking this
Hill Country city.
</P>
<P>
   For the 39-year-old Mexican firefighter, working here for $9.75
per hour offers the chance to earn in two weeks what could take
five years or more in his impoverished northern Mexican village,
Boquillas del Carmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no work there,'' said Ureste, noting that most
neighbors cater to tourists to get by.
</P>
<P>
   He was among 23 Mexicans recruited in 1990 and trained by the
U.S. National Park Service to fight fires in the 800,000-acre Big
Bend National Park, just across the Rio Grande from his village.
</P>
<P>
   The squad known as ``Diablos'' has since expanded to 43 members,
and the cross-border partnership has proven so successful that last
fall the Immigration and Naturalization Service cleared them to
fight fires across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't have been better, with hundreds of blazes in
the West and South straining American resources. The Diablos have
seen action this year in Arizona, Colorado and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a hard-working group,'' said John Zubia, a National
Park Service supervisor who traveled with the 20-man team who made
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Diablos use shovels, chainsaws and ax-like tools called
Pulaskis to fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   The fire near Kerrville, some 40 miles northwest of San Antonio,
broke out Sunday and came perilously close to neighborhoods west of
town, where homes sell for $700,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Such a lifestyle is a world away from the Diablos' simple homes,
which have no electricity and running water.
</P>
<P>
   The team has been living in relative luxury at a resort hotel
and has enjoyed ready supplies of food and drink donated to
firefighters by local businesses and charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work and vacation, too,'' Ureste said with a smile Friday,
the Diablos' last day in Kerrville.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Forest Service plans to pack up Saturday and let the
Kerrville Fire Department finish extinguishing the few remaining
hotspots in the 1,300-acre fire zone.
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 of the original Diablos remained when John Morelock,
program supervisor for the Park Service at Big Bend, arrived at the
park in 1997. He organized new training sessions and revived the
corps, which is made up largely of men in their 30s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them to think long and hard before accepting this
position because this job is one of the most dangerous jobs they
can have,'' he said. ``And we told them to consider their family
situation, and the possibility they would have to go away at a
moment's notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Park Service and INS expanded the Diablos' domain last
September, each crewmember worked only about two weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   If the current program continues to be a success, Morelock said
the Diablos ranks may be expanded again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, some of the people at high levels are excited
about the potential for Mexico to help with fire-fighting
shortages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a firefighter shortage, but this has been a
record breaking year.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Diablos' pact was arranged, the United States and
Mexico already had a mutual aid agreement regarding fires within 10
miles of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Canada and Australia also have provided fire-fighting crews to
help in the United States this year.

   New York _ President Clinton brought his extended farewell tour
to the periphery of Broadway last week and indulged in a variety of
his favorite roles _ Daddy Warbucks, Peter Pan, Tiny Tim. His star
turn was a brief, largely anodyne speech at the beginning of the
United Nations Millennium Summit in which even the few zingers,
including a couple of welcome ones (a dart for Burma, for
instance), took no particular courage for the leader of the last
remaining superpower.
</P>
<P>
   His performance was a typical Clinton attempt to make more of
the moment than was merited, to challenge the assembled worthies
not to kill each other, and, most importantly as his days dwindle
down, to polish the memory of his own eight years on the world
stage. Clinton continues to attach more importance to the Kosovo
conflict than is warranted and to slide over the fact that on his
watch the weapons inspection program in Iraq collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In classic Clinton fashion, he used decorative but pointless
rhetoric to address what is perhaps the central question facing the
world body _ whether or when to intervene in civil, ethnic or
religious dust-ups _ but offered nothing definitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conflicts present us with a stark challenge,'' the
president said, observing the obvious. ``Are they part of the
scourge the U.N. was established to prevent?'' he asked, without
really answering. But lest there be some question whether he has a
handle on the issue, Clinton offered self-evident vacuity: ``If so,
we must respect sovereignty and territorial integrity but still
find a way to protect people as well as borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The laundry list of international platitudes contained one of
Clinton's periodic, irritating attempts to equate what Israel and
the Palestinian Authority (a growing contradiction in terms) have
done to advance the Middle East peace process. Clinton knows
better, but he's not missing many chances these days to jolly up
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Clinton demonstrated that he sees the Middle East
conflict through the prism of his own, quickly vanishing term in
the White House. He referred to the ``fleeting'' chance for peace
that is ``about to pass'' and cautioned: ``There is not a moment to
lose.'' He wanted to appear to be talking about Arafat's seemingly
fungible deadline for unilateral declaration of a Palestinian
state. But Clinton's real frame of reference wasn't lost on many.
</P>
<P>
   (And remember, there's already a Palestinian state in the Middle
East. It's called Jordan. It just happens to be run by a family
from the Hashemite minority.)
</P>
<P>
   In a sideline forum Clinton advanced his dubious idea of
expanding the U.N.'s security mandate to cover unfortunate but
nonmilitary disasters, specifically HIV-AIDS. Regretfully, he was
speaking to African leaders, many of whom have shamefully failed to
deal with the continent's leading health menace and at least one of
whom, South African President Thabo Mbeki, has willfully engaged in
massive, persistent disinformation about the plague. Clinton, of
course, called neither to book.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of his usual quick hit to address the annual opening of
the General Assembly, Clinton encamped Tuesday-Friday at the
Waldorf-Astoria to revel in the entire U.N. fandango, which he
seemed to take as a premature going-away party. On hand was a
record 160 or so world leaders (using the term very loosely). Given
their incessant to-ing and fro-ing, in motorcades that clogged the
East Side, they had come to New York primarily to see, be seen,
socialize and complain to each other about U.S. hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   The mocking perfidy of some of this crowd was illustrated as the
conference began by the savage beating deaths of three unarmed U.N.
workers in East Timor, almost certainly at the hands of a mob egged
on (or at least certainly not restrained) by the Indonesian
government. Perhaps the delegation from Jakarta wasn't smirking as
Clinton remarked on the tragedy, but it might as well have been.

BUSH TURNS FOLKSY TO REVAMP CAMPAIGN IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARRENDALE, Pa. _ The interior of the Marconi manufacturing
plant seemed ill-suited for a rousing campaign event: vast and
grey, filled with work cubicles, lit by fluorescent lights.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it really ready to host George W. Bush Friday. His
microphone kept popping. Then a generator kicked in, drowning out
his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Aesthetically speaking, it was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But for Bush, this telecommunications equipment company, and the
last-minute visit here, marked an intentional change of course.
Gone were the confetti machines, the upbeat music, the cheering
crowds. In their place were people _ ``real people,'' Bush said _
and a string of serious policy remarks, as the Republican nominee
abruptly switched gears to counter a spate of troubling poll
numbers and growing concern his campaign is a mess.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign proudly noted the overnight metamorphosis, saying
they had ``turned on a dime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you notice? I hope you noticed,'' communications director
Karen Hughes said. ``We're very quick, a very nimble campaign. I
want you to report: a very nimble and agile campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden shift toward a more intimate campaign style _
reminiscent of the town hall meetings made famous by Senator John
S. McCain during the GOP primaries and relied on by Vice President
Al Gore _ felt familiar to longtime observers of the Bush campaign,
which underwent a similar transformation in the week after losing
the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Bush waited less than a day after getting
the bad polling news to unveil a new slogan _ ``Real plans for real
people'' _ and admit he had been off course.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike his about-face last February, when he introduced new
themes, the changes Friday were cosmetic, leaving unaddressed
concerns expressed by some Republicans that his $1.3 trillion tax
cut is failing to resonate with the public. Bush campaign officials
explained that they had not conveyed his message effectively, and
would spend the weekend at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, continuing
to ``retool.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the campaign shifted direction on another
matter: the presidential debates. For the first time, Bush aides
said they were willing to negotiate with the Commission on
Presidential Debates, rather than demand the debates be held on
their terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush did not mention the issue Friday. He stuck mostly to
policy matters in the visit to the communications firm outside
Pittsburgh, then focused on Social Security privatization during a
rally in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush met with supporters in several roundtable settings
after the primaries, aides said he would place a greater emphasis
on one-on-one events from now on. He may also visit the homes of
some middle-income supporters who would benefit from his tax cut
proposal _ the ``tax families,'' who feature prominently at his
events _ to put a ``human face'' on his policies, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, at least, the personalized format seemed to put Bush at
ease.
</P>
<P>
   Unscheduled and unscripted, the Texas governor arrived at the
warehouse shortly after 8:30 a.m., dropping into the office
cafeteria to chat with employees. A cup of coffee in one hand, he
spoke to the group about the new economy, explaining that, as
president, he would limit the role of government to ensure further
entrepreneurial growth.
</P>
<P>
   Later, giving an address twice as long as his normal stump
speech, Bush described his proposal for Social Security, saying he
would set aside $2.3 trillion of the federal budget surplus to
overhaul the system and reiterating his belief that younger workers
should be allowed to invest some of their Social Security funds in
the markets themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a move that had been decided upon only a day earlier,
Bush opened the floor for questions and addressed each question at
length. It made for an unusually long event; the session lasted
more than 45 minutes, as opposed to his usual 8-minute stump
speech.
</P>
<P>
   At least one employee helped him along, asking: ``How can the
campaign overcome the clearly one-sided media coverage that so
severely restricts the Republican message getting to the people?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, chuckling, started to repeat the question to the rest of
the crowd, who had been unable to hear. ``The question was about
the media,'' he said, then stopped, saying he didn't want any
reporters to take offense.
</P>
<P>
   It was a delicate topic; just four days earlier, Bush had
accidentally uttered a vulgar insult about a New York Times
reporter over a public address system, causing a daylong uproar.
But even that didn't ruffle him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the media. Of course _ I've got 60 days before the
election,'' Bush said. ``There's an interesting relationship
between me and the media. One, I need them to get my message out.
And sometimes it comes out fairly, and sometimes, frankly, I don't
care for the coverage. . . . And they need me to make news.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that dynamic was about to change. ``The best way for
me to get my message out is to speak directly to the people.''

 &HT;    DEBATE ABOUT DEBATES JUST PART OF ELECTION RITUAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ As has been observed before, political campaigns are
not designed to improve government or to help voters make the best
choice on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Political campaigns are designed for one reason and one reason
only _ to get specific candidates elected to office.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates may have a host of reasons _ some of them even
high-minded _ for wanting to get elected, but they won't have a
chance to realize any of them if they first don't get more votes
than their &QL; 
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   That's why even church-going, family-loving candidates sometimes
hedge the truth, outright lie or trash their opponents with
negative advertising.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the major presidential candidates have been
treating us to the quadrennial ritual of feinting and posturing
over how and when they should debate.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty safe bet that George W. Bush and Al Gore will face
off in formal debate at least once _ and probably twice _ before
Election Day. A deal may even be worked out by the time you read
this.
</P>
<P>
   But the pre-debate debate alone has told us something about what
the two candidates and their handlers think of their respective
strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore didn't offer to debate Bush ``anytime, anywhere'' because
he wanted voters to view himself and his Republican opponent
performing on a level playing field. Gore issued the challenge
because it made him sound like a confident, in-control candidate,
and he believes _ probably correctly _ that he would have an edge
over Bush in most debate formats.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reasons, it also was no surprise that Gore would
readily agree to the three debates proposed by the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates, which has been sponsoring
debates between White House nominees since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Bush would be mistaken for a golden-throated
orator, but past performances indicate Gore is a stronger debater.
Bush never embarrassed himself during a string of Republican
primary debates last winter and seemed to become more confident
with each effort, but debating is not what he does best.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was equally no surprise that the Texas governor was
reluctant to agree to all three debates proposed by the commission,
since they would promise the largest potential television audiences
for a face-off between him and his Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush proposed substituting two of the commission's
debates with joint appearances on network news or talk shows. He
doubtlessly would prefer their less restrictive, more informal
atmospheres, and he was able to catch Gore in a bit of a bluff. It
seems the vice president's ``anytime, anywhere'' challenge had
conditions attached.
</P>
<P>
   But, more importantly, the debate venues that Bush advocated
would offer much smaller audiences in the event that the governor
were to commit a major gaffe or turn in a lackluster performance.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, though, Bush may have been feeling more
pressure to reach a compromise with Gore because of the governor's
recent slippage in the polls and struggle to regain the momentum in
the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also may have had another goal in all the pre-debate
rhetoric _ to lower public expectations of his performance.
According to that theory, he could declare victory or at least a
tie with Gore if he didn't stumble while walking across the stage
and didn't botch the name of more than one Third World dictator.
</P>
<P>
   If the debates between Bush and Gore are true to recent form,
however, neither candidate will commit a major gaffe nor deliver a
knockout punch _ although both possibilities, particularly the
former, will loom.
</P>
<P>
   But, more importantly, maybe some undecided voters will actually
hear or see something that will help them choose between the two
major candidates _ or send them off in search of a third-party
alternative.

the endorsement of the National Fraternal Order of Police while
Gore touts a 10-year, $36 billion tax break for college tuition.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: FIELD HOCKEY  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  The game is ``hockey'' to aficionados, who defensively insist on
calling the version played on skates with a puck ``ice hockey.''
But the aficionados should feel appreciated at these Olympics,
where field hockey will be more visible than ever because of
Australia's affection for and proficiency at this hard-running,
low-scoring game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   There will be 12 men's teams and 10 women's teams in Sydney, and
the only Americans on the artificial turf will be officials.
Neither the U.S. men nor, more surprisingly, the U.S. women
qualified. The semifinalists are determined by pool play, with the
top two teams in each pool going to the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   Halves are 35 minutes long, and if that does not produce a
winner, two sudden-death overtime periods (each seven-plus minutes
long) are played. If that still does not work, the medals will come
down to penalty strokes in which players take turns shooting on
goal. As in ice hockey _ let us give the aficionados what they want
_ players can be forced to leave the game for short periods to
serve penalties for fouls.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The Australian women, known rather unimaginatively as the
Hockeyroos, have had a mediocre season, finishing third in this
year's prestigious Champions Trophy tournament behind Germany and
the Netherlands. But the now-chastened Hockeyroos remain the
favorites to defend the Olympic title they won in Atlanta (they
also won in Seoul, South Korea, in 1988). South Korea could also be
a factor. In the men's event, the Australian men, known not much
more imaginatively as the Kookaburras, are also medal contenders
but have a reputation for succumbing to pressure (they have never
won an Olympic gold medal).
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch, who won in 1996, and the Germans, who won in 1992, do
not have such skeletons rattling around in their closets. The
Indian men, incidentally, are considered to have an outside chance
for a medal after 20 years of frustration in a game they once
utterly dominated.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton on Friday urged China's
president, Jiang Zemin, to open a dialogue with the new government
of Taiwan and put a stop to its missile exports to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But in what had already been a week of diplomatic frustration
for Clinton, Jiang offered little more than cordial good wishes for
the president's retirement in four months and thanks for supporting
China's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's aides described the session as ``cordial,'' the
lack of progress on some of the major issues still dividing the
United States and China finished off a week in which the president
had tried _ and failed _ to win one or two major foreign policy
accomplishments as he enters his final months in office.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts to restart the peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians that broke down at Camp David in July made such little
headway that Clinton was overheard by photographers on Friday
telling the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahearn, ``This Middle East
thing _ it's maddening.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not the only leader unhappy at the diplomatic gridlock. A
senior Japanese official said Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak,
vented his unhappiness to his Japanese counterpart, Yoshiro Mori.
At a meeting on Friday, he complained that the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, ``has not responded'' to several new proposals on
the status of Jerusalem, and questioned whether ``Arafat has the
political courage to make the move.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides had played down the prospect of any major
progress on Chinese missile exports, Tibet or Taiwan in the days
leading up to the meeting with Jiang. But they had hoped that the
expected passage by the Senate this month of permanent normal trade
relations with China _ a prerequisite for the country's admission
to the World Trade Organization _ would be rewarded with some
political progress on issues that have bedeviled Washington's
relations with Beijing since the two leaders first met in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of their communications problems after seven years
of interchanges, a senior administration official said on Friday
that the meeting was ``designed to get these two men on the same
wavelength a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official noted that Clinton's hopes of using the WTO
vote as leverage in his talks with Jiang had yet to pay off,
saying: ``We look to use the WTO entry to deepen political
cooperation. But they view Taiwan and issues like it as purely
internal issues. They don't connect the two the way we do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jiang was eager to show his American hosts that he could
talk the talk of a high-tech nation, even while offering up
familiar lectures about respecting China's sovereignty. Immediately
after his hour-and-a-half meeting with Clinton, he used a luncheon
meeting of America's top business executives to declare that China
is plugging into the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have over 16 million netizens,'' he said in a speech
delivered entirely in English, ``more than 27,000 World Wide Web
sites, over 70,000 Chinese domain names and 61 million mobile
phones in China.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not mention China's recent efforts to crack down on
the use of the Internet for the spread of dissenting opinions in
China, and Clinton, aides said, never broached the subject in their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When he was done reciting China's technological advances to the
executives, though, Jiang wove back to familiar territory. He
argued that China was a place of religious tolerance, saying: ``The
languages, religions and customs of ethnic minorities in China,
including the Tibetans, are protected and respected, and their
cultural traditions have been carried forward and developed.''
Pro-Tibet groups argue that China has done whatever it could to
stamp out the Tibetan culture, and they succeeded in killing a
World Bank project this summer that some feared would relocate
ethnic Tibetan farmers and further dilute the culture.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also called the Falun Gong religious group, whose members
have been arrested in large numbers in recent months, a `cult'' and
said any government would crack down on ``those who have done
severe harm to the people.'' As he spoke, members of the group
performed silent exercises across Park Avenue, under the watchful
eye of the police.
</P>
<P>
   James Lilley, a former American ambassador to Beijing and a
guest at the lunch, said Jiang's arguments amounted to ``an effort
to grab the religious issues by the throat and say we have
religious tolerance, but not your kind,'' adding: ``He just wants
to sail right by the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation on China's missile exports to Pakistan came
after Clinton, earlier this summer, sent a delegation to China to
try to cut off the supply. The administration worries that any new
missile technology would heighten Pakistan's ability to strike
India.
</P>
<P>
   But Jiang, by all accounts, has paid little attention to the
issue. ``This is going to take a while,'' one of Clinton's aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Chinese leader indicate that he was ready to open
talks with Taiwan's newly elected leader, Chen Shui-bian. ``They
spent a long time on Taiwan, but Jiang took much of that describing
China's historical claims'' to the island. That also seemed out of
place for what will likely be the second to last meeting between he
two leaders; Clinton, by now, has heard China's claims to Taiwan
many, many times.

 SOUTHERN LAWMAKERS DRIVING FIRESTONE/FORD PROBE 
 &HT;    
 By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ Southern lawmakers
<TEXT>
were in the driver's seat as Congress turned the high beams on
Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford Motor Co. and their corporate
culpability in tire failures that have claimed dozens of lives and
prompted a massive recall.
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., opened the congressional review of
the ongoing consumer controversy Wednesday morning as chairman of
the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. Rep. Billy Tauzin,
R-La., followed up as chairman of a hard-hitting House Commerce
Committee hearing that ran into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers from the region where sport utility vehicles are
a way of life were quick to weigh in as well on the human side of
not moving fast enough in the face of evidence of problems with
tires mounted on Ford Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is fourth in the number of crashes resulting from
these tire failures and accounts for the most fatalities,'' Rep.
Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., declared at the House hearing. ``Although
this is a national and international problem, these accidents have
been a great source of tragedy in my home state.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin, who acknowledged he had Firestone tires on his own
vehicle and has since parked it, said the hearings were not an
attempt to fix legal blame but were ``to ask ourselves why we're in
this mess and what we can do as a panel representing the Congress
here to make sure this never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Shelby: ``Ford and Firestone had at a minimum a moral
obligation to make sure that the products they sell to the American
public and other people in other countries are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a distinct change in tone for a Congress that has been
generally friendly to the auto industry given its importance to the
U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tauzin and Shelby, for instance, received campaign
contributions from Ford's political action committee. And Shelby's
panel has been cited by auto safety advocates as a potential
roadblock to new federal Internet posting of potential roll-over
rates of some vehicles. Shelby has been credited, however, with
backing a tougher drunken driving standard.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the congressional attention to the tire
recall could have broad implications, shaking loose some safety
standards they say have been ``stuck in neutral'' for years due to
industry resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you buy a brand-new car you expect to have a
state-of-the-art stereo in there, but you have a car that is
subject to safety standards issued in the late 1960s and 70s,''
said Jackie Gillan, vice president of the Advocates for Highway and
Auto Safety.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTA QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   Congress is still wrestling with whether to extend a ban on new
commercial fishing quota programs sought by some in the Gulf of
Mexico and elsewhere but must act by Oct. 1 or the prohibition will
expire on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf fishing interests say current short seasons for such valued
species as red snapper force captains to sail in bad weather and
lead to wasted fish caught out of season and discarded. They want
the ability to enact new annual individual catch limits, a move now
backed by a group of Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers and environmental groups want to extend the
moratorium another year to work out an acceptable system. They hope
to attach their plan to one of the giant spending measures expected
to move through Congress in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL REPAIRS
</P>
<P>
   Southern lawmakers are banding together to push legislation that
would provide seven historic women's colleges in the South with up
to $70 million over five years to restore landmark buildings on
their campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't lose these historic campuses to age and neglect,''
said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a chief sponsor of the aid to
colleges that date back 120 years and gave women their first
opportunity for higher vocational and industrial education.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that would receive aid if Congress agrees are:
University of Montevallo in Alabama; Mississippi University for
Women; Georgia College and State University; University of North
Carolina at Greensboro; Winthrop University in South Carolina;
Texas Woman's University, and the University of Science and Arts of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   COASTAL CONTROVERSY
</P>
<P>
   A $3 billion conservation measure that would provide a windfall
to coastal states remains hung up in the Senate and Majority Leader
Trent Lott isn't sure he can move it through this year despite his
own support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the one bill that would be very helpful for beach
erosion and preservation of important areas, the CARA bill,'' said
Lott as he listed the Conservation and Reinvestment Act among his
priorities for the remainder of Congress. ``But we may not get to
all of those.''

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: EQUESTRIAN  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once, these were tests for military men on horseback. Now, the
riders are usually civilians and often women, and age is no
barrier. The four riders on the U.S. jumping team are women, ages
42, 40, 34 and 23. The U.S. eventing team includes David and Karen
O'Connor, husband and wife from The Plains, Va., who won team
silver medals in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The three disciplines _ jumping, dressage and eventing _ award
individual and team medals. In jumping, horse and rider race one by
one over a stadium course of 15 to 18 jumps, with fastest time
(combined with fewest faults) deciding. Dressage is seven minutes
of ballet on horseback, with the horse doing required moves in
response to invisible commands from the rider. Eventing combines
separate days of cross-country riding over 35 to 40 jumps, dressage
and show jumping.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Especially tricky in eventing because the horse would be worn
out if it always took the shortest route over the jumps, which may
be higher in the middle. So beforehand, coaches and riders walk the
course over and over, trying to determine the smartest line.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   Gold-medal favorites are Rodrigo Pessoa of Brazil in jumping,
Isabell Werth of Germany in dressage and Blyth Tait of New Zealand
in eventing. The best teams are Brazil and Germany in jumping,
Germany and the Netherlands in dressage and the Netherlands and the
United States in eventing. The Americans have good shots at one or
two medals in eventing and a medal in jumping from Margie
Goldstein-Engle of Wellington, Fla.

BUDGET TURMOIL AT SAN JOSE CLEVELAND BALLET 
</HEADLINE>
   By OCTAVIO ROCA  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Jose Cleveland Ballet suspended all operations in
Cleveland on Thursday night, laid off all the dancers and canceled
its 25th anniversary season in that city.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Ballet School, which was to open its doors Monday
to 300 students for the new school year, also closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply saddened,'' said board president Robert Jones,
``but we simply do not have the resources to continue to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company could not ask the dancers to continue
working ``when it finally became apparent that there was no
reasonable expectation'' that they would be paid. As of Friday
afternoon, the dancers were owed 3 1/2 weeks salary.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the board of directors in Cleveland caught the
San Jose board by surprise. And it placed in jeopardy the season in
San Jose that is scheduled to open Oct. 12 at the San Jose Center
for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working desperately with the people in San Jose to do
anything we can to make the season there happen,'' Jones said.
``But we know it is not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   San Jose Cleveland Ballet is unique, belonging to two cities
thousands of miles apart. Each city has its own budget and is
responsible for its own fund-raising, but they share productions
and dancers. The Cleveland company, with an annual budget of $6.5
million, has been running at a deficit for a decade and has come up
short in its fund-raising projections.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose side of the ballet company operates in the black,
with an annual budget of $4.5 million that is not directly affected
by Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   For all its financial good health in San Jose, however, the
company's shutdown in Cleveland has unsettling repercussions for
dance in the Bay Area: The San Jose Cleveland Ballet dancers make
Cleveland their home. They take daily classes and rehearse every
ballet in the Cleveland studios, flying in and out of San Jose only
to perform. Relocating 40 dancers is a costly and time-consuming
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the dancers, set builders, costume makers and all the
other workers who put together a dance season were laid off in
Cleveland. The company has no costume shop in San Jose. Real estate
and commercial rental space are considerably more expensive in San
Jose than in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose ballet board lent the Cleveland board $1 million
last year. So far this year, donors in San Jose have contributed
more than $500,000 for the new production of ``Don Quixote,'' but
now it is not known where or even whether those sets will be built.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In contrast, the Bay Area's other major ballet companies are
thriving. Oakland Ballet, streamlined but in solid financial
footing, opens Friday at the Paramount Theatre. ``We are in the
black,'' said Oakland executive director Ren &LR; e &LR; e Heider.
``Subscriptions are up 23 percent, and we are looking forward to a
great season.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Ballet, America's oldest ballet company, plans to
announce next week that it is in the black for the ninth
consecutive year. ``Our endowment over the last eight years has
grown from $3 million to $36 million,'' executive director Arthur
Jacobus said, ``and I am confident that support from the community
will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very fortunate to be living in San Francisco,'' Jacobus
said, ``a community with a real, strong commitment to the arts.''

 &HT;    VARADERO, Cuba _ It's hard to say no to a US$55 greens fee _
especially when it includes a caddy and cart.
 &HT;    If Toronto native Larry Naccarato hadn't stumbled across a
travel brochure advertising a seven-night, all-inclusive trip to
Cuba's Varadero _ the largest and arguably one of the most famous
tourist resorts in the Caribbean _ for $1,000, he probably would
have ended up in Florida.
 &HT;    ``For this type of a golf course, it's super cheap,'' Naccarato
says of the $5 million Varadero Golf Club, a 6,900-yard strip of
manicured greens, saltwater lakes and sand traps right alongside
the ocean. ``In the States, I can't play for $50 to $55 unless I go
to a municipal course.''
 &HT;    In Canada, which sends more tourists than any other country to
the Caribbean island, Cuba is well known for its beaches. It's only
recently, however, that the socialist government has begun selling
the country as a destination for _ of all things _ golf.
 &HT;    While revolutionary Che Guevara's image now graces all types of
souvenirs from key chains to T-shirts, the blatant promotion of
capitalism's favorite pastime reflects the Marxist government's
tough lie in a deep ideological rough. After all, one of the first
things Guevara and Fidel Castro did after the triumph of the 1959
revolution was bulldoze almost all of Cuba's golf courses and build
schools in their place.
 &HT;    ``I don't see a clash of ideologies, because golf didn't come
from the capitalist countries, but from Scotland, more than 400
years ago,'' says Jose Tovar, director of the Varadero Golf Club.
He gestures to a copy of a famous photo of Che and Fidel, both
bearded and dressed in trademark guerrilla fatigues, playing a
final round of golf before the bulldozing commenced. Apparently
Che, during his early years as a physician, loved golf.
 &HT;    Indeed, now that the government has turned to tourism for hard
currency, it's not about to let the Caribbean golf boom pass it by.
Along with the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, Cuba is planning its
own strategic rollout of greens. Rumbos, the state-owned company
that manages the Varadero Golf Club, will start building in Cayo
Coco, the main tourist island in the Camaguey archipelago, in early
2001. It has plans for three more courses once foreign financing is
secured.
 &HT;    Other government-run companies are also trying to gain a piece
of the action, sparking an internal bidding war of sorts. Gran
Caribe, a company specializing in five-star hotels, starts building
in Jibacoa, 69 kilometers east of central Havana, in September.
Meanwhile, Gaviotas is planning a course for Guardalavaca, a beach
town in the province of Holguin, and Cubalse has the green light to
give a face-lift to the former Rovers Club (now the Havana Golf
Club), the only course not bulldozed after the revolution. Plans
include adding nine more holes and sprucing up its neglected,
withered greens.
 &HT;    The government's short-term goal is to build one course in each
of Cuba's nine tourism zones, according to Raul Martin, Rumbos'
manager. Long-term plans put the total number of courses at 28. The
government's plan to milk Cuba's mass tourism potential is echoed
in the billboards studding the highway between Havana and Varadero.
``Coming soon, the 444-room Hotel Sol y Mar,'' promises one such
sign.
 &HT;    Cuban resorts are a hot investment. Although it used to be that
a foreign partner could not hold more than 49 percent in a joint
venture, 1992 and 1995 modifications to foreign-investment laws
allow for 100 percent foreign ownership, while guaranteeing
investors full protection of their assets and the right to remove
profits in hard currency. Now foreign investors from Canada, Spain,
Mexico _ almost everywhere except the United States, it seems _ are
eagerly coughing up capital to position for the elusive return to a
market economy.
 &HT;    The potential for profit is there. Tourism is growing at a
healthy clip of 20 percent each year. The number of beds in resort
hotels is doubling by the decade. Last year, 1.6 million tourists
visited Cuba, generating a little over $2 billion. For this year,
the government projects 2 million visitors. But per capita revenues
aren't increasing at the projected rate, Martin says. Enter golf,
which is expected to capture a more spendthrift market.
 &HT;    But will the golfers come? And can Cuba replicate Florida's
snowbird success even with half the world's golf market being
barred from visiting the island nation legally? ``There are three
possible scenarios,'' Martin says. ``One is that the blockade
remains as is. Another is that the blockade is maintained but the
travel ban is lifted. Another is that the blockade is lifted
entirely. A study commissioned by the government to analyze Cuba's
infrastructure needs in that scenario estimates we would need about
100 courses to meet demand.'' Adds Varadero's Tovar: ``We've
learned how to live without (the U.S. market).''
 &HT;    Certainly the experience of the Varadero golf course bodes well
for Cuba. The 72-par, Robert Trent Jones-style course, designed by
Golf Design Service of Toronto, brought in 14,000 visitors last
year, generating $1.8 million in revenues, Tovar says. But don't be
fooled by the casual dress code: The course stands up to any other
in the world, adds British transplant Jimmy Burns, a golf
instructor at the nearby 400-room hotel Melia Las Americas and a
member of Britain's Professional Golf Association.
 &HT;    In fact, this past April, all the course's greens were replanted
with dwarf grass per request of the Professional Golf Association
in Europe, which, after holding its grand finale in Cuba last fall,
plans to hold its championship there for the next three years. The
club has at least one tournament booked through the end of 2000,
each bringing in from 45 to 180 players.
 &HT;    The Varadero Golf Club is also a historical attraction. The
course was enlarged from nine holes on the expropriated estate of
chemical tycoon Irene Dupont Nemours. The Dupont mansion now serves
as a small hotel, attracting tourists looking for an alternative to
resort-chain accommodations. Known as ``Xanadu,'' the mansion built
in 1930 is a masterpiece of Italian marble and exotic woods. It has
its own wine cellar and organ, piping music throughout the entire
house, which was renovated in 1998. Guests can eat off the
mansion's original china and use its 19th-century French-style
furniture for $140 to $180 a night.
 &HT;    Varadero Golf Club instructor Pedro ``Choppy'' Klein says that
more courses are needed because golfers like variety. He predicts
that when the blockade is lifted, residents from the southern
United States will fly to Varadero just for the day.
 &HT;    Blockade or no, U.S. citizens are finding ways into Cuba.
According to Martin, 10 percent of golfers coming to Cuba come from
the United States. As Cuba Travel U.S.A., which has been taking
U.S. residents to Cuba since 1977, boldly declares on its Web page:
``President Clinton is encouraging Americans to help the Cuban
people. We'll tell you how and why. Pope John Paul II has
encouraged the world to open up to Cuba and Cuba to the world. We
are doing our part. You can do yours by joining us on a luxury golf
outing in Cuba.'' Fore!

 &HT;    CNN Web site aimed at teachers, studying students
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CNN says it won't allow advertisements on a new Web
site aimed at teachers and at children who go online for homework
help.
</P>
<P>
   But CNN says it expects the site to become profitable. How?
Three education-related companies are paying to have their logos,
names and links appear on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, described as ``education partners,'' also are
supplying some of the site's content. CNN officials say they
eventually will add two more companies as partners.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, CNNfyi.com, launches Monday at fyi.cnn.com/fyi/.
It will have news written with students and teachers in mind,
sometimes by students themselves. It also will have suggested
lesson plans tied to news events, listings of homework resources,
message boards and information on a variety of subjects such as how
to prepare for college.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors include Riverdeep Interactive Learning, a provider of
educational material online; Harcourt, a major publisher of
textbooks and school materials; and HighWired.com, a company with a
Web site for information on specific schools and news from school
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Web site targets middle and high school students, as
well as teachers. It's a big market. An estimated 25 million people
under 18 go online.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also competition for the study time of youth. The
New York Times' Learning Network is a similar offering
(www.nytimes.com/learning/www). And America Online, which is
planning to merge with CNN's parent Time Warner, has launched its
own AOL(at)School (www.school.aol.com/). The new AOL service, which
schools sign up for, overlaps with some CNNfyi.com areas, but it
also includes a link to the new CNN Web site.
</P>
<P>
   CNN Interactive President Scott Woelfel says the AOL and CNN
sites won't be competitors, but he adds, ``We have yet to know
exactly how we fit around that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woelfel said CNNfyi.com will be expected to make a profit
eventually, but he said ``there is a bit of an altruistic
motivation behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   With prodding from founder Ted Turner, the company has since
1989 provided commercial-free half-hour daily news shows produced
for classroom learning.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 schools have signed up for the service,
according to John Richards, Turner Learning's senior vice president
and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   CNNfyi.com is being run in conjunction with Turner Learning, the
educational division of Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System.

 &HT;    VARADERO, Cuba _ It's hard to say no to a US$55 greens fee _
especially when it includes a caddy and cart.
 &HT;    If Toronto native Larry Naccarato hadn't stumbled across a
travel brochure advertising a seven-night, all-inclusive trip to
Cuba's Varadero _ the largest and arguably one of the most famous
tourist resorts in the Caribbean _ for $1,000, he probably would
have ended up in Florida.

eagerly coughing up capital to position for the elusive return to a
market economy.
 &HT;    The potential for profit is there. Tourism is growing at a
healthy clip of 20 percent each year. The number of beds in resort
hotels is doubling by the decade. Last year, 1.6 million tourists
visited Cuba, generating a little over $2 billion. For this year,
the government projects 2 million visitors. But per capita revenues
aren't increasing at the projected rate, Martin says. Enter golf,
which is expected to capture a more spendthrift market.
 &HT;    But will the golfers come? And can Cuba replicate Florida's
snowbird success even with half the world's golf market being
barred from visiting the island nation legally? ``There are three
possible scenarios,'' Martin says. ``One is that the blockade
remains as is. Another is that the blockade is maintained but the
travel ban is lifted. Another is that the blockade is lifted
entirely. A study commissioned by the government to analyze Cuba's
infrastructure needs in that scenario estimates we would need about
100 courses to meet demand.'' Adds Varadero's Tovar: ``We've
learned how to live without (the U.S. market).''
 &HT;    Certainly the experience of the Varadero golf course bodes well
for Cuba. The 72-par, Robert Trent Jones-style course, designed by
Golf Design Service of Toronto, brought in 14,000 visitors last
year, generating $1.8 million in revenues, Tovar says. But don't be
fooled by the casual dress code: The course stands up to any other
in the world, adds British transplant Jimmy Burns, a golf
instructor at the nearby 400-room hotel Melia Las Americas and a
member of Britain's Professional Golf Association.
 &HT;    In fact, this past April, all the course's greens were replanted
with dwarf grass per request of the Professional Golf Association
in Europe, which, after holding its grand finale in Cuba last fall,
plans to hold its championship there for the next three years. The
club has at least one tournament booked through the end of 2000,
each bringing in from 45 to 180 players.
 &HT;    The Varadero Golf Club is also a historical attraction. The
course was enlarged from nine holes on the expropriated estate of
chemical tycoon Irene Dupont Nemours. The Dupont mansion now serves
as a small hotel, attracting tourists looking for an alternative to
resort-chain accommodations. Known as ``Xanadu,'' the mansion built
in 1930 is a masterpiece of Italian marble and exotic woods. It has
its own wine cellar and organ, piping music throughout the entire
house, which was renovated in 1998. Guests can eat off the
mansion's original china and use its 19th-century French-style
furniture for $140 to $180 a night.
 &HT;    Varadero Golf Club instructor Pedro ``Choppy'' Klein says that
more courses are needed because golfers like variety. He predicts
that when the blockade is lifted, residents from the southern
United States will fly to Varadero just for the day.
 &HT;    Blockade or no, U.S. citizens are finding ways into Cuba.
According to Martin, 10 percent of golfers coming to Cuba come from
the United States. As Cuba Travel U.S.A., which has been taking
U.S. residents to Cuba since 1977, boldly declares on its Web page:
``President Clinton is encouraging Americans to help the Cuban
people. We'll tell you how and why. Pope John Paul II has
encouraged the world to open up to Cuba and Cuba to the world. We
are doing our part. You can do yours by joining us on a luxury golf
outing in Cuba.'' Fore!

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: BOXING  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rivalries make for good sport, and in boxing there is a last
remnant of an old fashioned Cold War-like battle of wills. The
Cuban national boxing team, still shrouded in mystery because of
the secrecy surrounding its training, is feared and respected. But
this year's U.S. team could be the strongest since the charismatic
crew led by Sugar Ray Leonard in Montreal 24 years ago. The
Americans have three reigning world champions, the Cubans have
Felix Savon, the six-time world titlist, and two other world
champions. The clash of these two powerful, experienced teams will
highlight the competition at Sydney's Exhibition Center, but in
boxing there are always surprises and enigmatic judging decisions _
enough twists and turns for a Tom Clancy novel.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The one major change in these Games is that there will be four
two-minute rounds separated by a one-minute rest period instead of
three three-minute rounds with one minute in between. Unchanged,
however, is the computerized scoring system where punches in
bunches matter more than heavy power shots. A good jab delivered in
a way that all five judges can see it is a more effective weapon
than a sneaky, crunching left hook to the body that might be
difficult to detect by the judges.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely subjective, and some would say prejudiced.
Computers were instituted to standardize the system, but the judges
create the input for the computer, so there are wide discrepancies
in how a bout is scored. Five judges have a computer score pad with
buttons. The judges are supposed to hit the buttons, like players
of a video game, every time they see a punch from a closed fist hit
an opponent. If three of the five judges hit their buttons within
one second of a punch, it is tabulated as a point for that boxer.
The boxer with the most points at the end of the four rounds wins.
Fights can be stopped if a boxer cannot continue, has been knocked
out or disqualified. But it is the computerized scoring that
remains at the hub of most judging controversies since the buttons
test a judge's reflexes and because judges from different parts of
the world put different values on different punching styles _
European judges, for example, are said to favor head blows and give
less credence to body shots.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   It is a talented and veteran field, with 10 returning medalists
from the Atlanta Games. Brian Viloria, the American entry at 106
pounds from Hawaii, has the best, if most obvious, nickname:
Hawaiian Punch. Viloria is no joke, though; he's the world champ at
his weight. The American Ricardo Juarez is another world champion,
at 125 pounds. The featured matchup figures to be Savon against the
American heavyweight Michael Bennett, a 29-year-old from Chicago
who began amateur boxing less than two years ago. Bennett took up
boxing while serving seven years in prison for armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is also the reigning world champion because Savon
declined to get in the ring for their fight. Savon was protesting _
what else? _ a controversial judge's decision involving another
Cuban boxer. The Cubans have several other talented fighters,
including Mario Kindelan at 132 pounds and Juan Hernandez, the
silver medalist at 147 pounds in 1996.

 Por JULIE DULUDE 
 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Es dificil decir que no a una tarifa de US$55 por jugar golf,
sobre todo cuando incluye el caddy y el carrito.
 &HT;    Si Larry Naccarato, de Toronto, no hubiera encontrado por
casualidad un folleto turistico anunciando una estadia de siete
noches con todo incluido en la playa cubana de Varadero, uno de los
mayores centros turisticos del Caribe, por US$1.000, probablemente
habria ido a parar a la Florida.
 &HT;    ``Para este tipo de campo de golf, es muy barato,'' dice
Naccarato refiriendose al Varadero Golf Club, valorado en US$5
millones, una joya de campo junto al mar. ``En Estados Unidos no
puedo jugar por menos de US$50 o US$55, a menos que sea en un campo
municipal.''
 &HT;    En Canada, desde donde llegan a la isla antillana mas turistas
que de cualquier otro pais, Cuba es celebre por sus playas. Pero
desde hace un tiempo el gobierno ha comenzado a promocionar al pais
como, nada mas y nada menos, un paraiso del golf.
 &HT;    Aunque la imagen del Che Guevara adorna todo tipo de souvenirs,
la flagrante promocion del pasatiempo favorito de la burguesia
refleja un paradojico cambio de rumbo. A fin de cuentas, una de las
primeras cosas que hicieron Fidel Castro y el Che Guevara a raiz
del triunfo de la revolucion de 1959 fue destrozar casi todos los
campos de golf de Cuba y construir escuelas en su lugar.
 &HT;    ``No veo un choque de ideologias, porque el golf no proviene de
los paises capitalistas, sino de Escocia, donde se invento hace mas
de 400 anos,'' dice Jose Tovar, director del Varadero Golf Club.
Senala una foto fsa del Che y Fidel, ambos con barba y vestidos de
uniforme militar, jugando la ronda final de un partido de golf
antes que las aplanadoras iniciaran su tarea.
 &HT;    Ahora que el gobierno ha recurrido al turismo para generar
divisas, no esta dispuesto a dejar pasar el auge del golf en el
Caribe. Al igual que en la Republica Dominicana y Jamaica, Cuba
planea un despliegue estrategico de campos de golf. Rumbos, la
empresa estatal que administra el Varadero Golf Club, comenzara a
construir en Cayo Coco, la principal isla turistica del
archipielago de Camaguey, a principios del 2001. Planea tres campos
mas cuando consiga financiamiento extranjero.
 &HT;    Otras empresas estatales tambien quieren su parte del pastel y
libran una especie de guerra interna de licitaciones. Gran Caribe,
compania que se especializa en hoteles de cinco estrellas,
comenzara a construir en Jibacoa, 69 kilometros al este del centro
de La Habana, en septiembre. Entretanto, Gaviota planea un campo en
Guardalavaca, un centro turistico playero en la provincia de
Holguin, y Cubalse tiene luz verde para remozar el antiguo Rovers
Club (hoy Havana Golf Club), el unico campo que se salvo de las
aplanadoras. Tambien se proyecta agregar nueve hoyos y restaurar el
descuidado y mustio cesped.
 &HT;    El objetivo a corto plazo es construir un campo de golf en cada
una de las nueve zonas turisticas, segun Raul Martin, gerente de
Rumbos. Los planes a largo plazo es tener 28 campos. El
aprovechamiehnto de las posibilidades de un turismo masivo se
reflejan en los carteles que abundan en la carretera de La Habana a
Varadero. ``Proximamente, el Hotel Sol y Mar, de 444
habitaciones,'' promete una valla.
 &HT;    Los centros turisticos cubanos son una inversion atractiva.
Aunque antes los extranjeros no podian tener una participacion
mayor del 49 por ciento en una empresa conjunta, las modificaciones
que se hicieron a las leyes de inversion foranea permiten una
participacion del 100 por ciento, a la vez que se garantiza a los
inversionistas la proteccion plena de sus activos y el derecho de
sacar sus ganancias en divisas. Los inversionistas de casi
cualquier pais menos Estados Unidos, inyectan capital con vistas a
colocarse en una posicion favorable cuando se produzca el esquivo
regreso a una economia de mercado.
 &HT;    Hay un potencial de ganancia. El turismo crece al saludable
ritmo del 20 por ciento anual. La cantidad de camas de hotel se
duplica cada diez anos. El ano pasado, 1,6 millones de turistas
visitaron Cuba, generando ingresos ligeramente superiores a
US$2.000 millones. Para este ano, el gobierno calcula que llegaran
dos millones de visitantes. Pero los ingresos per capita no
aumentan al ritmo proyectado, dice Martin. Se espera que el golf
atraiga a un mercado generoso.
 &HT;    Pero vendran los golfistas? ``Hay tres posibilidades,'' dice
Martin. ``Una, que el bloqueo se mantenga. Otra, que el bloqueo se
mantenga pero se levante la prohibicion a los viajes. Y otra que el
bloqueo se levante por completo. Segun un estudio que encargo el
gobierno para analizar las necesidades de infraestructura, harian
falta unos 100 campos.'' Tovar agrega: ``Hemos aprendido a vivir
sin el mercado norteamericano.''
 &HT;    Sin duda, la experiencia del Varadero Golf Club es un buen
pronostico para Cuba. El campo, de 72-par y estilo Robert Trent
Jones, disenado por Golf Design Service of Toronto, atrajo a 14.000
visitantes el ano pasado, que generaron ingresos de US$1,8
millones, dice Tovar. Pero no hay que dejarse enganar por el
atuendo informal: el campo no tiene nada que envidiar a los de
otros paises, agrega el britanico Jimmy Burns, instructor de golf
en el cercano hotel Melia Las Americas, de 400 habitaciones, y
miembro de la Asociacion de Golf Profesional de Gran Bretana.
 &HT;    En abril se modifico el campo a peticion de la Asociacion de
Golf Profesional de Europa, que tras celebrar su gran final en Cuba
en 1999 planea realizar su campeonato en la isla en los tres
proximos anos. El club tiene reservado por lo menos un torneo hasta
fines del 2000, cada uno con entre 45 y 180 jugadores.
 &HT;    El Varadero Golf Club tambien es una atraccion historica. El
campo, originalmente un terreno de nueve hoyos en la expropiada
mansion de Irene Dupont Nemours, magnate de la industria quimica,
se amplio. La mansion, que es ahora un pequeno y exclusivo hotel,
construida en 1930 y conocida como Xanadu, es una obra maestra de
marmol italiano y maderas exoticas, que se renovo en 1998. Tiene en
el sotano una bodega de vinos y un organo cuya musica llega a toda
la casa. Los huespedes pueden comer en la vajilla original y
acomodarse en sus muebles estilo frances del siglo XIX por entre
US$140 y US$180 la noche.
 &HT;    Pedro ``Choppy'' Klein, instructor del Varadero Golf Club, dice
que hacen falta mas campos porque a los golfistas les gusta la
variedad. Pronostica que cuando se levante el embargo los
habitantes del sur de EU volaran a Varadero a pasar el dia. A pesar
del embargo, el 10 por ciento de los golfistas que van a la isla
llegan de Estados Unidos, segun Martin. La empresa Cuba Travel
U.S.A., que se dedica a llevar estadounidenses a Cuba desde 1977,
anuncia en su website:
 &HT;    ``El presidente Clinton exhorta a los norteamericanos a ayudar
al pueblo cubano. Nosotros les decimos como y por que. El Papa Juan
Pablo II ha exhortado al mundo a abrirse a Cuba y a Cuba a abrirse
al mundo. Nosotros hacemos nuestra parte. Usted puede hacer la suya
acompanandonos a una gira de golf de lujo en Cuba.''

 &HT;    En abril se modifico el campo a peticion de la Asociacion de
Golf Profesional de Europa, que tras celebrar su gran final en Cuba
en 1999 planea realizar su campeonato en la isla en los tres
proximos anos. El club tiene reservado por lo menos un torneo hasta
fines del 2000, cada uno con entre 45 y 180 jugadores.
 &HT;    El Varadero Golf Club tambien es una atraccion historica. El
campo, originalmente un terreno de nueve hoyos en la expropiada
mansion de Irene Dupont Nemours, magnate de la industria quimica,
se amplio. La mansion, que es ahora un pequeno y exclusivo hotel,
construida en 1930 y conocida como Xanadu, es una obra maestra de
marmol italiano y maderas exoticas, que se renovo en 1998. Tiene en
el sotano una bodega de vinos y un organo cuya musica llega a toda
la casa. Los huespedes pueden comer en la vajilla original y
acomodarse en sus muebles estilo frances del siglo XIX por entre
US$140 y US$180 la noche.
 &HT;    Pedro ``Choppy'' Klein, instructor del Varadero Golf Club, dice
que hacen falta mas campos porque a los golfistas les gusta la
variedad. Pronostica que cuando se levante el embargo los
habitantes del sur de EU volaran a Varadero a pasar el dia. A pesar
del embargo, el 10 por ciento de los golfistas que van a la isla
llegan de Estados Unidos, segun Martin. La empresa Cuba Travel
U.S.A., que se dedica a llevar estadounidenses a Cuba desde 1977,
anuncia en su website:
 &HT;    ``El presidente Clinton exhorta a los norteamericanos a ayudar
al pueblo cubano. Nosotros les decimos como y por que. El Papa Juan
Pablo II ha exhortado al mundo a abrirse a Cuba y a Cuba a abrirse
al mundo. Nosotros hacemos nuestra parte. Usted puede hacer la suya
acompanandonos a una gira de golf de lujo en Cuba.''

 Por JULIE DULUDE 
 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Es dificil decir que no a una tarifa de US$55 por jugar golf,
sobre todo cuando incluye el caddy y el carrito.
 &HT;    Si Larry Naccarato, de Toronto, no hubiera encontrado por
casualidad un folleto turistico anunciando una estadia de siete
noches con todo incluido en la playa cubana de Varadero, uno de los
mayores centros turisticos del Caribe, por US$1.000, probablemente
habria ido a parar a la Florida.
 &HT;    ``Para este tipo de campo de golf, es muy barato,'' dice
Naccarato refiriendose al Varadero Golf Club, valorado en US$5
millones, una joya de campo junto al mar. ``En Estados Unidos no
puedo jugar por menos de US$50 o US$55, a menos que sea en un campo
municipal.''
 &HT;    En Canada, desde donde llegan a la isla antillana mas turistas
que de cualquier otro pais, Cuba es celebre por sus playas. Pero
desde hace un tiempo el gobierno ha comenzado a promocionar al pais
como, nada mas y nada menos, un paraiso del golf.
 &HT;    Aunque la imagen del Che Guevara adorna todo tipo de souvenirs,
la flagrante promocion del pasatiempo favorito de la burguesia
refleja un paradojico cambio de rumbo. A fin de cuentas, una de las
primeras cosas que hicieron Fidel Castro y el Che Guevara a raiz
del triunfo de la revolucion de 1959 fue destrozar casi todos los
campos de golf de Cuba y construir escuelas en su lugar.
 &HT;    ``No veo un choque de ideologias, porque el golf no proviene de
los paises capitalistas, sino de Escocia, donde se invento hace mas
de 400 anos,'' dice Jose Tovar, director del Varadero Golf Club.
Senala una foto fsa del Che y Fidel, ambos con barba y vestidos de
uniforme militar, jugando la ronda final de un partido de golf
antes que las aplanadoras iniciaran su tarea.
 &HT;    Ahora que el gobierno ha recurrido al turismo para generar
divisas, no esta dispuesto a dejar pasar el auge del golf en el
Caribe. Al igual que en la Republica Dominicana y Jamaica, Cuba
planea un despliegue estrategico de campos de golf. Rumbos, la
empresa estatal que administra el Varadero Golf Club, comenzara a
construir en Cayo Coco, la principal isla turistica del
archipielago de Camaguey, a principios del 2001. Planea tres campos
mas cuando consiga financiamiento extranjero.
 &HT;    Otras empresas estatales tambien quieren su parte del pastel y
libran una especie de guerra interna de licitaciones. Gran Caribe,
compania que se especializa en hoteles de cinco estrellas,
comenzara a construir en Jibacoa, 69 kilometros al este del centro
de La Habana, en septiembre. Entretanto, Gaviota planea un campo en
Guardalavaca, un centro turistico playero en la provincia de
Holguin, y Cubalse tiene luz verde para remozar el antiguo Rovers
Club (hoy Havana Golf Club), el unico campo que se salvo de las
aplanadoras. Tambien se proyecta agregar nueve hoyos y restaurar el
descuidado y mustio cesped.
 &HT;    El objetivo a corto plazo es construir un campo de golf en cada
una de las nueve zonas turisticas, segun Raul Martin, gerente de
Rumbos. Los planes a largo plazo es tener 28 campos. El
aprovechamiehnto de las posibilidades de un turismo masivo se
reflejan en los carteles que abundan en la carretera de La Habana a
Varadero. ``Proximamente, el Hotel Sol y Mar, de 444
habitaciones,'' promete una valla.
 &HT;    Los centros turisticos cubanos son una inversion atractiva.
Aunque antes los extranjeros no podian tener una participacion
mayor del 49 por ciento en una empresa conjunta, las modificaciones
que se hicieron a las leyes de inversion foranea permiten una
participacion del 100 por ciento, a la vez que se garantiza a los
inversionistas la proteccion plena de sus activos y el derecho de
sacar sus ganancias en divisas. Los inversionistas de casi
cualquier pais menos Estados Unidos, inyectan capital con vistas a
colocarse en una posicion favorable cuando se produzca el esquivo
regreso a una economia de mercado.
 &HT;    Hay un potencial de ganancia. El turismo crece al saludable
ritmo del 20 por ciento anual. La cantidad de camas de hotel se
duplica cada diez anos. El ano pasado, 1,6 millones de turistas
visitaron Cuba, generando ingresos ligeramente superiores a
US$2.000 millones. Para este ano, el gobierno calcula que llegaran
dos millones de visitantes. Pero los ingresos per capita no
aumentan al ritmo proyectado, dice Martin. Se espera que el golf
atraiga a un mercado generoso.
 &HT;    Pero vendran los golfistas? ``Hay tres posibilidades,'' dice
Martin. ``Una, que el bloqueo se mantenga. Otra, que el bloqueo se
mantenga pero se levante la prohibicion a los viajes. Y otra que el
bloqueo se levante por completo. Segun un estudio que encargo el
gobierno para analizar las necesidades de infraestructura, harian
falta unos 100 campos.'' Tovar agrega: ``Hemos aprendido a vivir
sin el mercado norteamericano.''
 &HT;    Sin duda, la experiencia del Varadero Golf Club es un buen
pronostico para Cuba. El campo, de 72-par y estilo Robert Trent
Jones, disenado por Golf Design Service of Toronto, atrajo a 14.000
visitantes el ano pasado, que generaron ingresos de US$1,8
millones, dice Tovar. Pero no hay que dejarse enganar por el
atuendo informal: el campo no tiene nada que envidiar a los de
otros paises, agrega el britanico Jimmy Burns, instructor de golf
en el cercano hotel Melia Las Americas, de 400 habitaciones, y
miembro de la Asociacion de Golf Profesional de Gran Bretana.
 &HT;    En abril se modifico el campo a peticion de la Asociacion de

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (moving in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-NEW-SEASON (New York) _ Ben Brantley surveys the
upcoming Broadway season, which includes the return of Edward
Albee, one of the handful of working American playwrights to whom
the word ``great'' adheres easily and a dramatist who rarely fails
to exasperate and never fails to intrigue, as well as the return of
Alan Bates in ``The Unexpected Man.''
</P>
<P>
   SEUSSICAL-THEATER (New York) _ Broadway is becoming more
preoccupied with the needs of an age group that in the past it
rarely catered to _ children _ while holding on for dear life to
the adult audience that has sustained it. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SEASON (Undated) _ Elvis Mitchell surveys the upcoming film
season, which he says will be a season of radical departures, with
an astonishing number of musicals from directors new to the genre
and an action film from a director who made his name with finely
tuned pictures based in the comedy of manners.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-LEAN-SEASON (Undated) _ The film industry's autumnal hopes
seem to be pinned, for the moment, on a live-action adaptation,
``Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' and an updating of
the '70s television show ``Charlie's Angels,'' which not even those
of us who decorated our bedrooms with pictures of its
crime-fighting stars ever considered a work of art. And there are
further signs that cinematic seriousness has fallen on hard times.
By A.O. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-ZELLWEGER (Los Angeles) _ Renee Zellweger has all the
trappings of a rising Hollywood starlet: the blond hair, the thin
frame, the bee-stung lips, the homespun childhood in Texas, no
formal acting training and a boyfriend who gets $20 million per
picture. But Zellweger is not simply another actress who has
succeeded by perfecting the art of playing herself. By Dana
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   AFFLECK-FILM (Hollywood) _ Since wafting into the public
consciousness three years ago in ``Good Will Hunting'' _ a film for
which he shared a screenwriting Oscar with his co-star and Little
League teammate, Matt Damon _ Ben Affleck has emerged as one of
Hollywood's major heart flutters. When his new romantic drama,
``Bounce,'' is released on Oct. 13, cardiologists across the
country will be on call. By Franz Lidz.
</P>
<P>
   BLAIRWITCH-FILM (Los Angeles) _ No matter who does it, making a
sequel to a hit film is one thing; making a sequel to a phenomenon
is another. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   DEVIL-FILM (Los Angeles) _ Lately, and almost unnoticed the
Devil has been getting his due on the silver screen. By Jamie
Malanowski.
</P>
<P>
   VAMPIRE-FILM (Undated) _ When E. Elias Merhige's ``Shadow of the
Vampire,'' with its attention-snagging stars John Malkovich and
Willem Dafoe, opens Dec. 29, it will mark at least the fourth time
that filmmakers have resuscitated this particular version of the
vampire: Nosferatu, that disturbingly peculiar and apparently
iconic figure created by an odd little group of Germans 79 years
ago. By Jim Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   CROWE-FILM (Santa Monica, Calif.) _ For Cameron Crowe, it has
always been about rock 'n' roll. That has been the story of his
life and work, starting with his precocious stint as a teenage
journalist with Rolling Stone magazine in the '70s, right on
through his current filmmaking career as a writer and director. By
Bill Desowitz.
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS-FILM (Undated) _ Presumably, with the blurring of
once-rigid boundaries between male and female roles, the action
heroine is no longer the anomaly who has to be softened, made
acceptable, by precisely those ``feminizing'' qualities that
undermine her plausibility, threaten to turn her into a harmless
joke. ``Charlie's Angels,'' the movie, will no doubt give us the
real thing: powerful, enterprising women who haven't got time to
look perfect, whose fingernails crack and whose roots grow out, who
give their Bosley (Bill Murray) not girlish giggles but power-grrrl
guff. By Molly Haskell.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HENRY-JAMES-(Undated) _ Transferring Henry James to the
screen has never been easy. Still, Hollywood keeps trying. By Lisa
Zeidner.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-FOOD-FEASTS (Undated) _ In the scentless, flavorless
language of film, the dinner table is often used as an excuse to
assemble the cast: It becomes the stage for spilling secrets, for
acting out ancient dramas and measuring loyalties by shifts in
appetite. By Kristin Hohenadel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-SEASON (Undated) _ The cleft dividing the composers of the
19th century from those of the 20th is arguably the most prominent
geographical feature of our musical landscape. Two attitudes _ on
how music should sound, how it should feel and what its purpose
should be _ have split audiences, musicians and commentators so
decisively that in still a third century, the 21st, the gap is only
marginally narrower than it was 100 years ago. On consecutive days,
March 2, 3 and 4, 2001, at Carnegie Hall, the sides face each other
in a format of rare concentration and potency. The Vienna
Philharmonic plays; Pierre Boulez conducts. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   SERKIN-MUSIC (New York) _ Peter Serkin has never been an
ordinary virtuoso. His deep concern with the music of living
composers has brought him to work more than most solo pianists in
collaborative contexts and encouraged him to be unconventional in
his programming. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ The paradox of pop is that intentions
rarely correspond to results. The most carefully thought out,
elaborately realized musical opus may well be ignored or
repudiated, while a casually tossed off ditty can turn out to be
timeless. Listeners, not musicians, will make the final decisions
about what's worth saving. And in the meantime, fleeting pleasures
will do just fine. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   JOAN-OSBORNE-MUSIC (New York) _ The music business has a long
tradition of making over its female artists, whether it's the
Supremes in finishing school or just the latest battery of stylists
dispatched to a video shoot. What's odd about Joan Osborne's
situation is that she seems to have forced this transformation upon
herself. By Karen Schoemer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-SEASON-HIGHLIGHTS (Undated) _ Highlights of the upcoming
season, in capsule form: Ken Burns, Napolean and plenty of pseudo
sex. By Bill Carter.
</P>
<P>
   TV-NEW-SEASON (Undated) _ In a television season whose big names
include Bette Midler, Geena Davis and Gabriel Byrne, all starring
in sitcoms, the most promising series belong to Andre Braugher,
David E. Kelley and some guy who looks like David Letterman. Their
shows are not entirely original; let's be realistic, that is not
what most television series do. Yet they accomplish something
equally good, breathing fresh life into traditional genres. By
Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-TV (Undated) _ Two gentle, unobtrusive voices unite the
many seemingly disparate threads that are woven into Bill Moyers'
magisterial documentary on death, ``On Our Own Terms,'' which
begins September 10 on PBS. The first is the voice of Moyers
himself, the temperate sound of a compassionate understanding that
never treads roughshod on the boundaries of another's sorrow. The
other voice is one unheard and yet heard constantly, the more
powerful for being soundless, the more insistent for not needing
words. By Sherwin B. Nuland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PIERRE-GILLES-ART (Paris) _ The French artists Pierre and
Gilles, who use fashion, religion and the star system to create an
idealized universe of their own. Over the next year, that universe
is coming to the United States. By Amy Serafin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-DANCE (New York) _ Diversity, thy name is individuality.
That may well be the message of ``France Moves,'' a major festival
of French contemporary dance that will spread some 10 experimental
troupes in New York from April 24 to May 6. By Anna Kisselgoff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RELATIONAL-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ The time has come to speak
of ``relational'' design _ buildings that interact with their
surroundings in full dimension instead of dumbly mimicking the
scale and form of their next-door neighbors. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>

   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;

   MITSUBISHI (Normal, Ill.) _ For a short but trying time a few
years ago, this small town made national headlines. Horrifying
stories had emerged about the Mitsubishi auto assembly plant here.
Its factory floor, some workers charged, was one where some men
felt free to grope female workers, to ask them to bare their
breasts or to aim air guns between their legs. The company, while
vehemently denying the charges, nevertheless agreed in June 1998 to
pay a record $34 million to settle the largest federal lawsuit over
sexual harassment. In reality, however, while the headlines have
faded, the problems have not. By Reed Abelson.

<P>
   UNITED-AIRLINES (Undated) _ To say this summer has been
difficult for Jim Goodwin, the chief executive of UAL, the parent
of United Airlines, would be a grave understatement. Under his
one-year reign, United has been plagued with problems that might
well sink a company. Goodwin is finding that repairing the damage
is no easy task. By Julie Edelson Halpert.

   INVEST-BHAMAN-OPPENHEIMER (Undated) _ Ajeev Bhaman was born in
Bombay, has lived in England and was educated in the United States.
As a teenager, he traveled the world with his father, the captain
of a cargo ship. So he is not fazed by the travel required in his
job, running the $170.8 million Oppenheimer Developing Markets
fund. His travels have paid off. The fund returned 12.7 percent a

   INVEST-INSIGHT-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ For much of the 1990s, Health
Maintenance Organizations were viewed as a way to combat complexity

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: GYMNASTICS  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: ``Andreea'' in 1st graf of ``THE NAMES'' is cq.)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a different look to these Olympics. The compulsories
have been eliminated, and the so-called 6-5-4 rule (six gymnasts
are on a team, five compete on each apparatus and the four highest
scores count) means event specialists are much more important.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Romanian women and the Chinese men enter as the
favorites for the gold medals, the new scoring method makes
determining the winners difficult. Now, strategy is more important,
and a poor routine is more costly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Magnificent Seven surprised the world and won the
first team gold for the United States. But with weaknesses on the
vault and on the balance beam, Bela Karolyi's troops could have
difficulty trying to defend their title.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The women compete on four apparatus: vault, uneven bars, floor
exercise and balance beam. If there are two apparatus that send
shivers down the spine of gymnasts, they are the balance beam and
the uneven bars. For 70 to 90 seconds on a 4-inch-wide beam, using
forward and backward tumbling passes, a gymnast has to have equal
levels of courage and concentration. The uneven bars are made more
difficult because of the precision it takes to execute transitions
from bar to bar and to execute release moves.
</P>
<P>
   The men perform on six apparatus: floor exercise, pommel horse,
still rings, vault, high bar and parallel bars. The one event that
does not allow for a pause or a hiccup in the routine is the pommel
horse, which is considered the most difficult. To most, the pommel
horse requires twice as long to master. The brute strength of the
men will also be judged on the still rings. No matter how talented
a gymnast is, if he does not have the physical might to perform in
this event, his chance for placing in the all-around competition is
remote.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   During team competition preliminaries, gymnasts perform an
optional exercise _ compulsories were eliminated after 1996 _ on
each apparatus. The scores are used to advance individuals to the
all-around finals and the apparatus finals, and to place entire
teams in the team final competition. This puts on the pressure from
Day 1.
</P>
<P>
   Six gymnasts from each of the 12 top nations at the world
championships are entitled to participate in the team finals for
the men's and women's titles. But this year, no more than five
gymnasts (which are selected by the national coaches) may compete
on a single apparatus, and the four highest scores count toward the
6-5-4 team total. The working order of the team is decided by each
country. Once qualifying ends, the team competition begins with the
previous scores discarded.
</P>
<P>
   The top 36 gymnasts from the team competition, with a maximum of
three per nation, qualify to compete in the all-around finals. With
numbers restrictions, this allows isolated gymnasts from nations
that have underdeveloped programs to show their talents. During the
men's and women's all-around finals, each gymnast performs an
optional routine on each apparatus. The male and female gymnasts
with the highest cumulative score win the gold medal and will hold
the sport's most prestigious title as the all-around champion.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of competition, the apparatus finals takes
place. The top eight gymnasts on each apparatus from the team
competition, with a maximum of two per country, qualify. A gymnast
who competes in only one apparatus in team competition is still
eligible to participate in the finals. As in the all-around and the
team finals, the scoring begins anew. Gold medals are awarded for
each apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of hand-wringing over the subjective selection
process for the U.S. women's team. The reason for the procedure
came down to strategy. Until recently, every athlete that made the
team competed on every apparatus, and the lowest score was dropped.
But in 1997, the 6-5-4 format was adopted for men's and women's
international competition. Teams are allowed to use all six team
members in any lineup for the most advantageous team position. A
gymnast does not have to compete on every apparatus to contribute.
For example, a gymnast may be weak on one event but be a specialist
on another.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, coaches will play a shell game with their
lineups from apparatus to apparatus in order to maximizing their
gymnasts' strengths.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect score in gymnastics is still 10.0, but there are start
values for each routine. A difficult routine is worth 10.0, but a
less complex one might be worth only 9.75. However, numbers do not
always add up in judging. In the past, judges tended to score
gymnasts who competed early in the lineup much harder, leaving
themselves room to give higher scores to later competitors. A
typical coaching strategy is to start each apparatus with a gymnast
who is likely to complete a routine flawlessly. As a result, the
gymnast can set the table for less-talented teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a flip side to this, too; often the leadoff
performer cannot gain the top marks and ends up as the sacrificial
lamb for the team.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   If the two remaining members of the Magnificent Seven _ Amy Chow
and Dominique Dawes _ are going to recapture the glory from 1996,
they will have to lead the U.S. team past the strong Romanians,
Russians and Chinese. Romania is the reigning world champion and is
led by the disciplined and spectacular Simona Amanar, Maria Olaru
and Andreea Raducan. The Russians feature the vault champion Yelena
Zamolodchikova, while the Chinese are anchored by Jie Ling on the
balance beam.
</P>
<P>
   To help boost a &UR;  &LR; U.S. team that bottomed out with a poor showing
at the 1999 world championships, Bela Karolyi returned as national
coordinator and began camps to rebuild the team's confidence and
improve the difficulty levels on the gymnasts' routines. Chow and
Dawes, along with the budding Elise Ray and Kristen Maloney, hope
to make Karolyi's return a success by putting the United States in
medal contention.
</P>
<P>
   The men's team from China has been in the position as favorite
before at the Olympics. Four years ago, the Chinese arrived as
world champions but faltered in Atlanta and finished with a silver
behind Russia. China is led by Zhen Dong on the still rings and Wei
Yang on the horizontal bar, while Russia will return with Nikolai
Kryukov and Alexei Nemov from the country's 1996 gold medal team.
Belarus could also be a threat if Ivan Ivankov (Achilles' tendon
injury) is fit to perform. The Americans have a long way to go
before finding themselves among the elite.

   RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS
</P>
<P>
   Judging in this female-only event often seems to be based more
on how eye-pleasing each competitor is rather than on how well she
executes sometimes suggestive routines with five apparatus: rope,
hoop, ball, ribbon and clubs. In the individual competition,
gymnasts perform with four of the five apparatus. In the team
competition, five gymnasts work together as one unit. The favorites
for the all-around title in this sport are from Ukraine: the 1997
world champion, Yelena Vitrichenko, and the 1996 gold medal winner
in Atlanta, Ekaterina Serebrianskaya. Also pushing Ukraine will be
Russia, Bulgaria, Spain and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   TRAMPOLINE
</P>
<P>
   In the sport's Olympic debut, the men's and women's trampoline
competitions will be judged based on two routines: compulsory and
voluntary. Jennifer Parilla is the only American to qualify for the
Olympics. Russia, France and Belarus all have strong teams in men's
and women's trampoline.

INDUSTRIAL SCANDALS FUEL JAPAN'S WORRIES OVER WHETHER NATION IS IN
DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Since a crisis at Firestone over dangerously faulty
tires erupted in the United States early last month, shareholders
of Bridgestone, the large Japanese tire maker that owns Firestone,
have watched in horror as the value of their shares has been sliced
in half.
</P>
<P>
   At virtually the same time, Japanese prosecutors raided
Mitsubishi Motors twice in a single week over its systematic
cover-up of manufacturing defects stretching back 30 years, and
public confidence in a once proud automaker quickly evaporated _ as
did more than 25 percent of its stock value.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi's president resigned Friday, and DaimlerChrysler,
which had agreed to acquire a huge interest in the company,
installed its own executive as chief operating officer and
renegotiated a lower price for its stake.
</P>
<P>
   The German-U.S. automaker plans to send more managers to try to
improve the quality of Mitsubishi's cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Coming so soon on the heels of a another quality control crisis
in Japan this summer _ the sickening of nearly 15,000 people by
contaminated products sold by the leading dairy producer _ many in
this country once credited with perfecting quality control have
begun to shake their heads over what they fear may be the most
worrisome sign of decline yet in Japan: an end to its sterling
reputation in manufacturing after a decade without growth.
</P>
<P>
   Like the latest crises here, the Snow Brand milk debacle has
carried a strong whiff of scandal about it. After the outbreak of a
summer staphylococcus epidemic afflicting consumers of Snow Brand
products, an investigation of the company showed that workers had
routinely recycled milk returned from stores, falsifying the
certificate of freshness that accompanies dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Snow Brand scandal has inspired a wave of consumer
complaints against other food producers, and the press here has
been filled recently with the unsavory details from the discovery
of dead lizards in potato chips to flies in canned juice.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent parliamentary hearing, Deputy Health Minister Yukata
Fukushima deplored the spate of defective products, calling them
the result of ``sloppiness and complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they often disagree fundamentally on the details, other
commentators have begun drawing much broader conclusions from the
decline in product quality controls and safety, saying that they
reflect profound changes at work in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The theories about declining standards in industry here range
from simple smugness, to a lingering managerial inability to
negotiate the transition from the dizzying prosperity of the 1980s
to the era of downsizing and cost controls in the `90s.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most sweeping, though, is the idea, carried in newspaper
editorials and discussed seriously by noted economic experts, that
Japan's prosperity has destroyed its old work ethic, casting things
like the Japanese worker's vaunted attention to detail and
dedication to the task into history's dustbin.
</P>
<P>
   A recent column in the Daily Yomiuri, Japan's largest daily
newspaper deplored what it called the ``disdain for hard work,''
among young adults. Among other facts, it cited government
statistics that show that about half of the country's university
graduates prefer temporary jobs and part-time work to full-time
employment or graduate studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first generation of Japanese are those that rebuilt the
economy amid the postwar confusion,'' wrote the columnist, Norio
Mochizuki, Yomiuri's business news editor. ``The baby boomers are
the second generation. The baby boomer's children are the third
generation, unwilling to work after graduation, and yet strangers
to poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   This generational theme to the hand-wringing over the recent
industrial scandals, and over Japan's economic doldrums has become
almost fashionable here, and comes in as many varieties as flavors
at an ice-cream shop.
</P>
<P>
   With much talk of national drift in Japan, government and
industry leaders have recently begun a huge drive to promote
information technology, with some even saying the goal should be to
quickly surpass the United States. Adherents of the generational
decline theory, however, scoff at this notion, and say it overlooks
basic problems with people that must be addressed first.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the 30 years that we struggled to rebuild the country we
were blessed with high quality workmanship and great discipline,''
said Masao Kamei, the 84-year-old chairman of Sumitomo Electric
Industries, and a senior adviser to past governments. ``If we want
to recover, we will have to recover these virtues. Without them,
information technology cannot save us.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from simply a problem of workers, Kamei said that success
had made Japanese managers arrogant, and caused them to lose all
sense of accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a motto, `visit the manufacturing floor often,''' he
said. ``If this kind of principle is established, the kind of
incident that happened at Snow Brand would never have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, however, dismiss the theory of a generational
decline. To them, the problem lies in Japan's failed adjustments to
its changed circumstances, dating back to the explosion in the
value of the yen in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For these experts, blame for the country's steady decline lies
at the feet of the managerial class and the government. Supposed
changes in social values, or the work ethic are merely excuses.
</P>
<P>
   According to this view, Japanese management put a heavy emphasis
on cost controls during the yen's steep rise in the mid-'80s, more
often cutting corners on the shop floor than paring back
increasingly lavish corporate spending.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly, during the wildly speculative ``bubble'' period
when land and stock prices soared in the late 1980s, management
practices became as loose as the period was overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Facing unexpectedly intense economic competition from a revived
United States during Japan's last 10 years of drift, the focus has
again turned to cost-cutting, with the worker and the workplace
suffering the sharpest cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overemphasis of cost reduction over so many other things a
firm has to think about is the common thread linking all of these
recent crises,'' said Hiroyuki Itami a professor of management at
Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi, he said, was seeking cost savings by avoiding
expensive recalls. Snow Brand was recycling old product and passing
it off as new. And Bridgestone was trying to revive the Firestone
brand and recuperate its investment at the lowest possible cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen so many examples of false cost reductions in
quality control circles recently,'' said Itami who is writing a
book on Japanese corporate governance. ``The end result of this
kind of thing is the kind of abuses that no engineer would
advocate. This is about a failure of management; a failure to weigh
cost and quality considerations in the right perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another view of Japan's recent industrial scandals holds
that things were never as good as the country's manufacturing
reputation would have had it in the first place. Instead, only now,
for the first time, given a coincidental spate of product quality
crises, consumers are stepping forward in large numbers demanding
accounts from companies for a broad range of defective products.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Japanese consumers have been patient and accepting.
And without a strong consumer movement, companies have been able to
get away with things like discriminatory pricing or quality
controls that favor export markets, and handle consumer complaints
as individual grievances, ignoring systematic problems with
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that people are finding things in their food and
complaining doesn't mean that these kinds of problems have suddenly
skyrocketed,'' said Hiroko Mizuhara, secretary-general of the
Consumers Union of Japan. ``There have been these problems all
along. It is just that in the past, the companies would replace the
products to the individual consumer and put a lid on it.
</P>
<P>
   `` The consumer is getting stronger, and now the companies
cannot avoid acknowledging these crises.'' he continued.

BUSH SHOWED RELUCTANCE TO DEBATE IN 1998 TEXAS RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ His Democratic opponent needled George W. Bush for
months about being ``afraid'' to debate. The opponent said he would
debate the Texas governor anytime, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hemmed and hawed. When the governor finally offered to
debate, his opponent accused him of trying to dictate terms that
would reduce the size of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   If the plot sounds as if it had been lifted from the debate
squabbles between Bush and Vice President Al Gore, think again.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic opponent in question was Garry Mauro, and the
election was the 1998 governor's race in Texas. ``Bush's position
was he'd do it when the time was right,'' recalled Mauro. ``And the
time was never right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides now say that the governor always intended to debate
_ a point that seemed less clear at the time _ and agreed to a
single event late in the race when voters would be paying
attention.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush did so only after his campaign was allowed to control
when, where and how it was conducted, choosing the most remote city
in the state on a night when many people were attending high school
football games.
</P>
<P>
   His staff also dictated the format, choosing to have a single
moderator rather than taking questions from an audience or the
capital press corps, and rejecting a large auditorium in favor of a
small television studio.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Bush was simply playing the role of a popular
incumbent reluctant to share a stage with a long-shot challenger.
Despite leading in some polls by over 50 percentage points, Bush
showed the same cautiousness toward debating that he does today, an
approach that some now regard as a missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Before the presidential campaign, Bush had participated in only
two major debates, against Mauro in 1998 and against Gov. Ann
Richards in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was curious that he didn't take advantage of this
to prepare for the presidential race,'' said Richard Murray, a
University of Houston political science professor, of the 1998
race. ``Mauro would have been a good sparring partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people believed that Mauro, a former Texas land commissioner
who became the Democratic nominee for governor, had any chance of
winning. Bush was extremely popular and had raised nearly 10 times
more money. Mauro could afford little campaign advertising and
pushed for debates, even accepting an invitation to meet the
governor inside the ball park of the Texas Rangers, the baseball
team once run by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejected invitations from every major media outlet in the
state, leaving doubts about whether a debate would even occur. Five
weeks before Election Day, he agreed to an hourlong debate in El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Moore, managing editor of The El Paso Times, said Bush
accepted the newspaper's invitation only after it had held months
of meetings with the governor's top political adviser, Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that we pushed was that if the governor planned
to run for president, it would benefit him to have more than one
debate under his belt,'' Moore said, referring to Bush's 1994
debate with Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro accused Bush of trying to orchestrate a debate that no one
would watch. El Paso, he noted, was the only city in Texas in the
Mountain Time zone. And by picking a Friday night roughly three
weeks before Election Day, Bush had chosen a time that conflicted
with high school football, an ardent passion across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush, said the governor chose El
Paso because it had never hosted a debate, and he wanted to
emphasize the importance of voters in West Texas. Bush also was
aggressively courting Hispanic voters in El Paso.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moore said the Bush campaign made several demands. First, he
said, they rejected the format used in the lieutenant governor's
debate in which the candidates were asked questions by members of
the audience, by a panel of journalists and then by each other.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Bush campaign insisted on a single moderator and
asked Moore to fill that role. Moore said the campaign also
insisted that the two candidates be seated at an oval table with
Moore in the middle. ``They wanted a very controlled environment
for the debate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said the Bush campaign also required that the cameras only
be allowed to focus on the moderator and whichever candidate was
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said any prohibition on the cameras ``doesn't ring a
bell with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the debate itself was considered something of a dud.
Few people watched. Some political scientists, including Murray,
considered Mauro the winner. Nearly everyone agreed it did not
matter, and that, Mauro contended, is what Bush wanted all along.

BRAZILIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC HAS LIVELINESS OF POP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As anyone who has spent time in Brazil can attest,
Brazilian celebrations don't usually require elaborate
justifications. Still, several were offered as reasons for the
concert of Brazilian orchestral music that the consulate general of
Brazil sponsored at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Most immediately, Thursday was Brazil's Independence Day. The
concert also honored the 500th anniversary of the country's
discovery in 1500. The Millennium Summit meeting at the United
Nations was also cited.
</P>
<P>
   In more purely musical terms, the concert was a way to put the
spotlight on a side of Brazil's culture that is generally
overshadowed by its success in the world of global pop.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, the program was slightly disappointing. Although
it included U.S. premieres of a 1934 work by Francisco Mignone and
a 1959 score by Heitor Villa-Lobos, the Villa-Lobos was the most
recent work on the program. There were no works by living
composers, nothing to show what Brazilian composers have been up to
for the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Nirenberg, a Brazilian who divides his time between Rio
de Janeiro and Montclair, N.J., conducted the New York Chamber
Symphony. He opened the program with the Sinfonia from ``Fosca,''
an opera by Antonio Carlos Gomes.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes, a contemporary of Verdi, was in vogue in Italy in the
late 19th century. He assimilated the Italian opera style
completely, and this overture has it all: gracefully winding
woodwind themes, big ominous brass chords, a section given to
quietly haunting string writing that bowed to ``La Traviata,'' and
tub-thumping bombast in the final pages.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the short first half was devoted to Mignone's
``Fantasia Brasileira'' No. 3, a compact, sparkling work for piano
and orchestra. Unlike the Gomes, which is a thoroughly European
work, the Mignone draws on quintessentially Brazilian elements _
the same ones, in fact, that continue to make Brazilian popular
music and jazz so lively and so easily placed.
</P>
<P>
   Syncopated rhythms and playfully dissonant harmonies drive the
piano part, and the orchestral fabric has the kind of distinctive
coloration that Copland and Bernstein borrowed when they wanted to
evoke a Latin American atmosphere. Not quite a piano concerto, it
nevertheless offers some dazzling moments, and Linda Bustani, the
soloist, made the most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Nirenberg closed the concert with two works by Villa-Lobos. The
Preludio from the ``Bachianas Brasileiras'' No. 4 is steeped in
rich, deep string sonorities that evoke a 1940s vintage view of
Bach.
</P>
<P>
   The belated premiere was the Suite No. 2, a five-movement work
composed a few months before Villa-Lobos' death in 1959. It has its
dark moments, not least in the opening ``Lamento.'' But this is
hardly a deathbed rumination: The Scherzo is bright and
cosmopolitan, and the ``Macumba,'' with its sweeping strings, vivid
brass writing and insistent percussion, closes with a grandly
cinematic flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra was in fine shape for much of the program. Moments
of ragged ensemble and strident string tone marred parts of the
Villa-Lobos Suite, but in the work's finale the orchestra's playing
was bright and energetic, and it brought an appealing warmth and
suppleness to the Gomes and the Villa-Lobos Preludio.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Death warmed over: That is how one analyst has described the
battered long-distance and local telephone sector of the
telecommunications industry. In a sharp reversal, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 communications services index, which rose 18.2 percent
last year, has dropped 28.9 percent from a mid-December high to
173.55.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone stocks climbed last year, and a bit this spring, on
excitement about mergers and the entry of local carriers into
long-distance service. But Wall Street has done an about-face on
the sector, focusing on the dilution caused by acquisitions, on
higher-than-expected capital needs and on fear that competition
will put pressure on profits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many analysts say, the sector's hammering has been overdone
and indiscriminate. ``Investors tend to machine-gun the whole
group,'' said Drake Johnstone of Davenport &AMP; Co. That means that
there may be good buys among the injured. And for those who already
own some of these stocks, it may be wise to hold on.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-changing playing field can be difficult to follow.
Qwest absorbed U S West, a Baby Bell, this summer, but not before U
S West's cable arm, the MediaOne Group, was bought by AT&AMP;T, which
shed the Baby Bells in 1984. AT&AMP;T, now the long-distance giant, has
moved heavily into cable, while would-be competitors are forming
joint ventures. BellSouth and SBC Communications, meanwhile, are
combining wireless operations in a new stock.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can no longer distinguish companies by services _
long-distance and local telephone, wireless service and land lines,
digital data and video. Each company wants to provide the whole
package. ``These folks are trying to hang onto as much of the old
business as they can and get as much of the new,'' said Thomas
Wolzien, who follows the cable industry for Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP;
Co. ``Everyone is trying to eat everyone else's lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will end up with big lunches? Bruce Behrens, co-manager of
the $2.3-billion Flag Investors Communication fund, favors
companies that were traditionally in local service. ``The idea of
long-distance versus local is an artifact of regulation,'' Behrens
said. With fiber optics, phone companies pay little more to carry
calls for long distances than short, he added, and local carriers
are better positioned to woo new customers.
</P>
<P>
   He and his co-manager, Liam Burke, along with other analysts,
like SBC. In the first six weeks that the company offered
long-distance service in Texas, it signed up a half-million
customers, and it may hit a million by the end of the year. The
company is aggressively rolling out digital subscriber line
technology, or DSL, to transmit high-speed Internet data over phone
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Burke likes SBC's strategy of using joint ventures to get into
cellular and long-distance services. ``It shows sensitivity to
capital expenditures,'' Burke said. SBC is trading at $45.06, 18.8
percent off its 52-week high of $55.50, and at 17.3 times next
year's projected earnings of $2.60 a share. That compares with a
price-to-earnings ratio of 29.9 for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, meanwhile, has generally retained analysts'
confidence, but it has raised some concerns, with a failed bid for
the Sprint Corp. last fall, for example. And the company's slow
rollout of DSL has troubled analysts, too. Johnstone advises
holding BellSouth, to see if it can accelerate DSL installations.
The stock is trading at $40.
</P>
<P>
   He also advises holding Verizon Communications, although some
fund managers call it an attractive buy. Verizon, the combination
of Bell Atlantic and GTE, is also slow in rolling out DSL, he said.
``Part of the game is how quickly you can provide these services,''
he said. When consumers have no DSL alternative, cable companies
jump in to offer cable modem Internet service along with video and
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon is under attack from competitors in its business-laden
territories in New York, Washington and Baltimore. It recently
raised its expected capital needs for this year and next to $18
billion, from $13 billion. The stock, which traded at $66 in April,
is now at $44.31.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens and Burke say the big long-distance players _ AT&AMP;T,
Sprint and WorldCom _ face fundamental problems as boundaries
disappear between long-distance and local calling. But they are
worth more than their current severely depressed stock prices,
Behrens added. ``All these companies do have assets that can work
for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's residential long-distance revenue was down last quarter,
and revenue from its business segment was also weak. Standard &AMP;
Poor's warned last month that it might cut the company's gilt-edged
credit and debt ratings because of ``concerns regarding AT&AMP;T's
cable television strategy, long-term prospects for AT&AMP;T's core
long-distance business, a more aggressive wireless expansion plan,
and its overall strategic direction.'' AT&AMP;T recently began offering
five months of free cable service to meet year-end goals for new
customers, but the question is whether those customers will stay
after the free period, Johnstone said. He recommends a wait-and-see
approach.
</P>
<P>
   However, David Goldsmith at the Buckingham Research Group said
investors should be focusing on AT&AMP;T's long-term picture. ``The
company is undervalued because people are focusing on the short
term,'' Goldsmith said.
</P>
<P>
   The shares closed Friday at $30.25, down 39.8 percent for the
year. AT&AMP;T Wireless, which trades as a separate stock, has been
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom, thwarted in its attempt to acquire Sprint, wants to
turn its focus to business customers. The company, aiming to expand
into Web hosting _ services and infrastructure to support Web sites
_ said last week that it had agreed to buy Intermedia
Communications, which holds a majority of Digex Inc., a Web hosting
company.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, WorldCom executives warned that revenue for the
next few years would drop below forecasts. In light of the
announcements, Johnstone changed his recommendation from buy to
hold. He favors Qwest among long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom hit a 52-week low of $32.56 in August and now trades at
$29.94, 16.1 times projected earnings for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts favor challengers like Global Crossing _ but
expect the entire sector to pick up soon. ``I can't imagine it
going much lower,'' Burke said.

 &HT;    The children of the civil rights movement
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ericka Brown-Abram says she had a typical childhood. Her
mother's friends were killed in police shootouts. Her family lived
under FBI surveillance. She was constantly shadowed by a bodyguard,
even when she ran to the neighborhood ice cream truck.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Abram, 30, the daughter of a Black Panther Party leader,
grew up in a communal home and attended a Panther-run grade school
where students read Mao Tse-tung's Little Red Book.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people had this swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,''
she says. ``But when you're a child it all seemed normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was normal, though, about growing up in the 1950s and
'60s as a child of the civil rights movement. The leaders of the
movement led dramatic lives _ and so did their kids. These children
of the struggle _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. Some
are still grappling with their parents' legacies.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights movement unleashed waves of change that are
still being felt, says Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
author of two books on the movement. The protest that paralyzed
Seattle this year during a World Trade Organization meeting, the
Million Man March on Washington, even freedom struggles abroad _
all owe a debt to the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were singing `We Shall Overcome' when the Berlin Wall
came down,'' Branch says. ``They were singing it in Prague. They
were certainly under its influence in South Africa when it became
democratic. Even in China, Tiananmen Square was more or less
modeled on a sit-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who joined the movement still miss the adrenalin rush of
being a part of something so monumental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was invigorating,'' says Elaine Brown, Brown-Abram's
mother. ``It made life important. It made it bigger than you. Even
the notion of dying for something bigger than you was far more
powerful than living out a life of quiet desperation. I was the
happiest in my life when I was in the Black Panther Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the activists didn't commit as vigorously to parenting
as they did to protesting. Changing diapers didn't hold the same
allure as changing the world. Some of the leaders, in fact, simply
weren't suited for parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movement had a number of people who, by
conventional definitions, were crazy,'' says Clayborne Carson, a
Stanford University professor who has written about the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
``But those were the people who saw through conventional truths and
saw other possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CHOSEN ONE: Warith Deen Mohammed
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Muhammad Sr., a frail asthmatic with only a fourth-grade
education, could make hardened ex-convicts and tough street
hustlers tremble in his presence. The founder of the Nation of
Islam, he spread the message that white people are ``blue-eyed
devils.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his children feared him. They thought he had divine powers,
says Warith Deen Mohammed, his youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be afraid to think in extremes that would anger
him,'' he says. ``We would be afraid that he would hear our
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Muhammad frightened much of America as well. He
personified black rage. While the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
preached nonviolence and integration, Muhammad preached ``an eye
for an eye'' and racial separation.
</P>
<P>
   Warith Deen Mohammed, now 67, was initially groomed to succeed
his father. Born in Chicago, the youngest son of Muhammad's eight
children, he was the chosen one, the heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was a teen-
</P>
<P>
   ager, however, he had begun to doubt his father's faith. Tutored
by orthodox Muslims from the Middle East, he had become a student
of the Koran. He saw no mention of ``blue-eyed devils'' or his
father in the holy text. When he shared his doubts with his father,
the elder Muhammad told his son that his way was the way. End of
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   But Warith Deen continued to question his father's beliefs. He
became even more disillusioned when he learned that Nation of Islam
members had been beaten and even killed for questioning his father.
</P>
<P>
   Warith Deen publicly opposed his father. And by 1964, when he
became close friends with one of his father's enemies, Malcolm X
(who had left the Nation of Islam that year after embracing
orthodox Islam), his father banned him from the movement.
</P>
<P>
   After Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, Warith Deen lived
virtually underground. The FBI tapped his telephones. He worked as
a baker, welder and cabdriver to make ends meet. And he constantly
received death threats from anonymous callers _ one of whose voice
he recognized. It was his older brother, Elijah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood why,'' says Mohammed, who has since reconciled
with his brother. ``We were all trained to be prepared to sacrifice
everything to protect the honorable Elijah Muhammad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Warith Deen Mohammed eventually became the chosen one again.
In 1975, his father died and the Nation of Islam, reeling from
internal blood feuds and corrupt leadership, picked him to be its
leader. He accepted and set about reforming the group. He removed
its anti-white theology, changed its name to the Muslim American
Society and declared it part of the worldwide Sunni Islamic
community. (Louis Farrakhan broke from Mohammed three years later
to form another version of the Nation).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to stop calling white folks the devil,
because there's some black devils, too,'' Mohammed said after
taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Warith Deen Mohammed is a Muslim elder statesman. He has
met with President Clinton and Pope John Paul II and was the first
Muslim to open the U.S. Senate with a prayer. He still lives in
Chicago, with his fourth wife and three youngest children (he has
nine altogether).
</P>
<P>
   And he has a new appreciation for his father. Elijah Muhammad
wasn't a racist, he says, but rather an uneducated man who patched
together a religion that taught black people self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He preached separation of the races, but he was not racist in
that ugly sense,'' Mohammed says. ``He hated the evils of white
people. He was not a racist. He was a nation builder.''
</P>
<P>
   LIFE WITHOUT FATHER: Chevara Orrin and Bacardi Jackson
</P>
<P>
   Chevara Orrin has her father's high cheekbones, caramel-colored
complexion and rapid-fire speech. She also has nothing but contempt
for him as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Orrin, 32, is the daughter of the Rev. James Bevel, a key aide
to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and a legendary leader of the
student sit-in and Freedom Ride movements. He also is the man who
persuaded Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan to hold the 1995
Million Man March on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Bevel is no hero to Orrin or her sister, Bacardi Jackson,
29. Both say that Bevel never provided for them while they endured
a childhood marked by homelessness, welfare and hand-me-down
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know my favorite food,'' Orrin says. ``He doesn't
know where I went to high school. He doesn't know what my college
degree is in. He doesn't even know when I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Orrin's mother, Susanne Jackson, met Bevel in 1965 in Chicago.
He was working with King in the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference; she was an anti-apartheid activist. They worked
together as anti-war activists and had an on-again, off-again
six-year relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Bevel offered to raise Orrin, but Jackson didn't think he would
be a responsible parent. So Jackson raised her daughters as a
single mother, working several jobs at once but still having to go
on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi Jackson says her father would visit occasionally but
showed no interest in her personal life. Instead, she says, he
seemed interested only in lecturing her about his greatness,
frequently comparing himself to Jesus and Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   Bevel has long been known as one of the movement's most
eccentric characters. ``He's like an Old Testament prophet,''
author Taylor Branch says. ``He hears voices. Sometimes they are
the voices of genius and sometimes they are the voices of lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1999 memoir, ``Walking With the Wind,'' Rep. John Lewis
(D-Ga.) wrote that Bevel changed after King was assassinated in
1968. According to Lewis, the SCLC barred Bevel in 1970 after it
heard that he had locked himself in a hotel room with a group of
Spelman College students, declared himself a prophet, urinated in a
glass and ordered them to drink its contents to prove their
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bevel had so much hope, so much optimism,'' Lewis says. ``I
think it was too much for him and many others when King died.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi Jackson finds great irony in her father's leadership
role in the Million Man March. She estimates that he has at least
16 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never said he was sorry once,'' she says. ``He's told a
million black men that they need to atone and take responsibility
for their families, but he hasn't done either in his personal
life.''
</P>
<P>
   She still struggles with forgiving her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had been simply an absentee dad,'' Jackson says.
``We could have easily gotten over that. In fact, if he had been
completely absent, our lives wouldn't have been so traumatized. The
two or three times we spent any significant time with him as
children were extremely painful and continue to haunt us to this
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevel, 63, says he would have given more support to his
daughters if they had been more dedicated to the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand my vocation,'' he says. ``My vocation is
to deal with the salvation, education and liberation of American
people. That's all I worked on. Apart from this, I don't exist. In
order to be with me, you have to work on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevel remains in Chicago, where he runs a program to help
at-risk youths and to teach effective parenting. When asked how
many children he has, Bevel smiles. ``Well, the computer broke
down,'' he says. ``I don't get into counting things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevel's daughters, meanwhile, say they do admire their father's
dedication to the movement. But everything they personally learned
about activism came from their mother, who works with the National
Urban League in Memphis. She encouraged them to become activists in
college and in their community.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Orrin, who graduated from the University of Memphis, is
an account manager with Docupro, an Atlanta printing company. She
volunteers at two child abuse prevention organizations. Jackson, a
graduate of Yale University Law School, is a corporate attorney who
volunteers and provides free legal services for organizations that
serve poor families. They share a home in Marietta and rarely talk
to their father. Orrin is a single mother herself, with two sons,
12 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   Orrin says that, while people may admire her father for his
activism, his legacy for her is pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a reason to be proud of him,'' she says as she
stares at a picture of her father prominently featured in a book on
the civil rights movement. ``I'm always struck by how much I look
like him. But it bothers me because I don't want the resemblance to
be anything more than skin deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says the real hero in their family is her mother. ``She
showed us that you don't have to choose between being a parent and
serving humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   SON OF A SEGREGATIONIST: Ross Barnett Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Barnett Jr. can't escape his father's name or reputation.
On Sept. 20, 1962, Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett Sr., a staunch
segregationist, blocked the admission of James Meredith, a black
man, to the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi would not ``drink from the cup of genocide,'' the
governor declared, defiantly setting off a deadly chain of events.
President Kennedy dispatched 500 federal troops to the university,
where they were attacked by a mob of 2,000 white people. Two people
died and 188 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   That tragedy still touches the Barnett family.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's son believes he is still judged by his father's
actions. Recently, a black journalist refused to shake Barnett's
hand when he learned who his father was.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are racists in all races,'' Barnett, 65, says of the
incident. ``It didn't bother me. I felt sorry for the man. He has a
small viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett was 27 when his father confronted Meredith, and at the
time he supported his father's segregationist stand. ``That was the
plank in every Southern politician's platform,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But he has changed with the times, he says. Married 44 years and
the father of five children, he still lives in Jackson, where he's
a lawyer specializing in criminal and personal injury law. Many of
his clients are black. So, too, he says, are some of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   But some things haven't changed. His father, who died in 1987,
will always be remembered as a segregationist.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior Barnett was much gentler than his public image,
his son says. ``If you spent five minutes with him, you would like
him.'' He loved to tell funny stories and give money to people in
need, the son says. And he wasn't a racist, Barnett insists: He had
black friends and even left money in his will for two
African-Americans, a quail-hunting companion and a masseur.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four decades after the violence spawned by Meredith's
enrollment, Barnett attributes it to a basic human trait: People
are scared of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Segregation was the order of the day,'' he says. ``When you
grow up with something and that's all you know, when something
different happens, it's a mind-boggler.''
</P>
<P>
   CHILD OF THE PANTHERS: Ericka Brown-Abram
</P>
<P>
   Bullets, berets and black leather jackets. Throughout Ericka
Brown-Abram's early life, whether she was attending high school in
Beverly Hills, Calif., or Spelman College in Atlanta, those were
the images people focused on when they discovered that her mother
was a leader of the Black Panther Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expected me to wear a beret,'' says Brown-Abram, 30.
``Some would ask, `Do you own a gun? Do you know how to break one
down?' It made me feel like I should whip out a gun and start
cleaning it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Abram is the daughter of Elaine Brown, who took over the
Black Panthers in 1974, when its founder, Huey Newton, went into
exile in Cuba. The organization was about to implode _ many of its
leaders had been wounded or killed, and it was riddled with FBI
informers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brown-Abram doesn't recall growing up in an environment of
tension, but rather in the nurturing
</P>
<P>
   atmosphere of a communal home in Oakland, Calif. Panther members
did an amazing job of sheltering their children, she says. She
attended a Panther-run school where traditional teaching mingled
with Marxist ideology. Students wore black berets and called
playmates ``comrades,'' but they were forbidden to play with toy
guns. And the school's test scores consistently ranked among the
highest in California, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Panther children were taught to serve the community. Brown-Abram
recalls taking part in programs that provided free breakfasts and
health screenings, and even working alongside migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a demanding childhood, and at times she craved simple
childhood diversions such as watching cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I didn't want the responsibility of being awake,''
Brown-Abram says. ``I just wanted to be like the other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother didn't cook for her, because she didn't have time.
The daily rituals that bond many mothers and daughters _ shopping
and combing hair together_ were absent. Yet Brown-Abram doesn't
resent the time her mother spent leading a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I don't have the same courage my mom has,'' she
says. ``I'm extremely proud of her, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed,
because I don't know what would make someone that dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Brown, an author and lecturer who lives in Atlanta, is
mystified by her daughter's devotion. She still experiences guilt
over the time she missed with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fiercely loyal to me,'' Brown says. ``I almost don't
understand it in her. I didn't know when her teeth came in. She
walked three weeks before I first saw her walk. What does that tell
you of me?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Abram lives in Macon with her husband, Malcolm, and is a
disc jockey and a tour guide for the Harriet Tubman African
American Museum.
</P>
<P>
   She says she is often struck by modern-day reminders that the
Black Panthers' agenda remains relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can assimilate and become this sparkling race,'' she says,
``but there are still going to be people who will tie us to a truck
and drag us to our death.''
</P>
<P>
   IN HIS FATHER'S STEPS: Albert Vivian
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Albert Vivian saw his father get punched in the face on
national television. It's one of his fondest childhood memories.
The confrontation arose as the Rev. C.T. Vivian was attempting to
register as voters a group of blacks turned away from the
courthouse in Selma, Ala. The local sheriff hit Vivian, knocking
him to the ground. But Vivian, his mouth bloodied, stood up to the
sheriff and compared him to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans saw the punch _ and Vivian's courageous
response _ on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It filled me with a gush of pride,'' says the younger Vivian,
who grew up in Atlanta. ``I remember kids picking at me in school,
saying, `I saw your dad get beat up.' My response was, `If he
didn't do that, you wouldn't be in the school you're in now.'''
</P>
<P>
   C.T. Vivian, a leader in the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, took part in voter registration drives throughout the
South. As a result, his family watched the evening news with a
sense of dread. Albert Vivian's mother, Octavia, eventually
instituted a rule that none of her six children could watch the
news unsupervised.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never knew what they might see,'' says the elder Vivian,
now 76. ``What if I had been killed?''
</P>
<P>
   The activists' wives are the unknown heroes of the movement, he
says. They kept the families together; many of the men traveled so
much that they became virtual strangers to their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being tired and going home to sleep,'' the elder
Vivian says. ``I awoke in the morning and all the kids were sitting
in the room looking at me. It was as if to say, `I wonder what he's
about.'''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Vivian, 38, is following in his father's footsteps,
taking over a consulting business that offers racial sensitivity
workshops for corporations and city governments. He lives in
Atlanta with his wife, DeAna Jo, and two sons, 9-year-old Louis and
7-year-old Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   A former captain in the U.S. Army, Albert Vivian says he was
inspired to carry on his father's work after watching him conduct a
racial sensitivity workshop on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' He
called after the show ended and said, ``Dad, I want to do what
you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm really enjoying,'' he says, ``is the fact that I'm
giving Dad the time to spend with Mom that he didn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER: Peggy Wallace Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   George Wallace was the subject of many photographs in his
turbulent life, but there was one in particular that he cherished.
It was a shot of him driving his right hand into the bloodied face
of a boxing opponent during a Golden Gloves bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved that picture,'' says Peggy Wallace Kennedy, 50, his
oldest daughter. ``It hung in his bedroom, where he could easily
see it from his bed. He said it was the greatest punch he ever
threw.''
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Alabama governor threw many bruising punches in the
political arena as well. With his bulldog scowl, Wallace was one of
the most visible enemies of the civil rights movement. He once
declared that segregation would last forever.
</P>
<P>
   But her father wasn't a racist, Kennedy says. He was simply a
politician, playing to the wishes of his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that he hated blacks. He treated everybody ... who
cooked and cleaned for us at the Governor's Mansion like his own
family. I saw it and swore to it. He would never mistreat one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 8 when her father became governor, and she rarely saw
him. When he was at home, he didn't discuss politics much with his
wife, Lurleen, or Peggy and her siblings, Bobbi Jo, Janie Lee and
George Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's favorite childhood memory of Wallace is of watching
Friday night boxing matches with him.
</P>
<P>
   She never developed an interest in politics. She's a homemaker
living in Montgomery with her husband, Mark Kennedy, a former
Alabama Supreme Court justice. They have two sons, Leigh, 22, and
Burns, 12.
</P>
<P>
   She says that when she married Kennedy _ no relation to the
famous Massachusetts family of the same name _ in the 1970s, her
father received a telegram from Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose brother,
President Kennedy, had sent in the National Guard when Wallace made
his infamous ``stand in the schoolhouse door'' in 1963. The
senator's telegram read, ``I'm so glad we finally got together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad got a big kick out of that,'' the daughter remembers.
</P>
<P>
   What she remembers most about her father is the last years of
his life. He was shot and paralyzed in1972 while running as an
independent candidate for president. The shooting changed him in
many ways, Kennedy says. He renounced his racial politics, began
reading his Bible every day and started seeking forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would call friends he hadn't talked to for a long time and
say, `If we got anything to straighten out, let's straighten it out
now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace died in 1998 at age 79. His funeral drew thousands of
people, white and black.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came full circle,'' Kennedy says. ``When you're man enough
to call people you had problems with and say you're sorry, that
says something about you as a man.''

 &HT;    Dress down backlash; it's all about better dressing
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 10.

<P>
   If it's the back-slashers who first led us into ultra-casual
workwear, it's only fitting that those I.T. professionals are
leading the way back to more polished dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Designers everywhere have tuned into the new affluence,
modernity and versatility of the dot-com culture and produced an
incredibly diverse array of styles that are at once luxurious,
sexy, assertive and wearable. Through innovation, they've succeeded
in making traditional fabrics like tweed lighter and more pliable;
they've luxed up sportswear by rendering it in suedes and leathers,
and they've reinterpreted suits in softer, curvier silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta dot-commers we asked to model the latest fall styles
were ideally suited to the task. They arrived for the photo shoot
in cuff-linked shirts, sport coats, skirted suits and scarf-tied
blouse _ cues they're already part of the backlash against the
corporate casual culture. More importantly, they were comfortable
wearing the clothes we selected.
</P>
<P>
   Dressing up feels right right now.

A VIDEO SO GRAINY: CELEBSPOTTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Calif.)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 10)  
 By GUY TREBAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Britney Spears owes Joey Heatherton a big one, and
let's not forget the unpaid image debt incurred by Christina
Aguilera and Mandy Moore. Heatherton, the older reader may recall,
was a Long Island-born nymphet who parlayed her hooded eyes, blond
shag and husky alto into a long career as a cut-rate Lolita,
playing Las Vegas lounges, episodes of ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'' and
many seasons of Serta Perfect Sleeper mattress ads.
</P>
<P>
   As sex kittens go, Heatherton was no Sue Lyon. But then Lyon
never had Heatherton's staying power as a demicelebrity and sultry
permateen. That, after all, is the hold Spears, Moore and Aguilera
have on the popular imagination, as anyone who saw the MTV Video
Music Awards on Thursday night can verify. As did Heatherton before
them, these women look as if they could get you arrested. Unlike
her, however, they've used that appeal to build major recording
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recording'' may be the wrong word in that sentence. That these
women (Aguilera in particular) can sing is not in question. That
they do sing is probably moot. Their real appeal is probably closer
to that of calendar models. These just happen to move. Anyway,
music of all sorts was weirdly secondary on Thursday to the more
central experience of watching the celebrity machine grind away.
</P>
<P>
   For six hours or so, the Avenue of the Americas became a
red-carpeted conveyor belt on which singing starlets were cranked
past banks of cameras, followed by gangsta rappers and dimpled boy
bands and superannuated rockers who had apparently lost the
directions to the Aged Rock Star Country Home. (Memo to Steve
Tyler: Have you considered a Roth IRA?)
</P>
<P>
   It was a night of limos more extended than some careers.
(Remember Ricky Martin? So hot eight months ago, yet no one seemed
too excited about his shaking bonbon now.) It was a night of cheap
fur, do-rags, statement eyeglasses, fake Gucci, real Gucci,
jailhouse denims, wonderfully bad rock fashions (the rock singer
Pink dressed as if she were the offspring of Sid icious and Poison
Ivy of the Cramps), crimped blond tresses, bleached Afros, platform
boots and compulsory Wonderbras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing looking down at bald spots and cleavage,'' said a
V.J. posted on the balcony inside Radio City Music Hall. Some of
them were on the same people, as he went on to say.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night of journalists' reporting on events by watching
television in Rockefeller Plaza tents, and of fans crammed behind
police barricades a block from the Music Hall, idly hoping to catch
a glimpse of someone, anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trapped, basically,'' said Felicia Buchert, who had
come from Florida just for the show. ``Maybe we'll see Madonna. Who
knows?''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. Madonna was in Morocco plucking her eyebrows
and changing diapers for her infant son, Rocco, as she explained by
satellite phone to MTV's Serena Altschul. Most of the other
notables were sequestered in nearby hotel rooms, their limo
arrivals timed with air-traffic-control precision, their
appearances calculated exclusively in terms of television time.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 100 guys who had been hired to walk behind Eminem
dressed like him in white T-shirts as he sang ``The Real Slim
Shady,'' winner of the Best Male Video award, barely saw the
singer. Parked in the solarium of the Women's National Republican
Club on 51st Street until showtime, they missed most of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically got told some lies,' said Joseph Brugess, 20, of
Queens, who got the job after answering a Web site ad asking for
Eminem look-alikes with bleached blond hair. ``They led us to
believe we were going to be on stage,'' he said. Instead, ``we're
stuck here 8 hours yesterday, 11 hours today, and all we're getting
paid is 80 beans.''
</P>
<P>
   For those lucky few granted media access to a corridor around
Radio City, a few quiet hours at the Calvin Coolidge Library in the
Women's National Republican Club started to seem appealing. There
are limited returns on a middle distance sighting of, say, the
rapper Sisqo, who would be easy to miss even at close range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he 5 feet, even?'' asked Delores McFadden, a tourist who
had miraculously finagled her way past the New York Police
Department, MTV security and the Music Hall guards to find a spot
near the theater entrance. ``I mean, you can barely see the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars tend to be like that, McFadden noted, zeppelin egos in
Napoleonic bodies. ``Well, you could see eye to eye with Sting, at
least,'' she told a bystander who had momentarily mistaken the
wizened singer for the venerable actor Richard Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Even fragments of Sisqo and Sting were more than Javier Perez
got. After waiting since 4 a.m. for a chance to see the celebrity
arrivals, Perez, 17, wound up squeezed into a patch of sidewalk
across the Avenue of the Americas. Standing on tiptoe, he did
briefly catch a glimpse of a mohawk belonging to the Red Hot Chili
Peppers bass player, Flea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was a really cool memory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even this fleeting apparition was more than Christina Peterson
and Stacey Sawaya, of California and Ohio respectively, got as they
sat by a truck bay from which, someone had told them, 'N Sync might
make its escape.
</P>
<P>
   As for this reporter, he finally fetched up outside the defunct
Fashion Cafe, where some of the 26 little people hired to add a
frisson to the evening's Blink 182 finale were hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I almost didn't come,'' said Niki Botelho-Pabros, a
3-foot-6-inch performer who was dressed for the night in a
leopard-print bikini top with leather dominatrix armbands and
combat boots. Dragging on a Marlboro Light, Botelho-Pabros said:
``I thought it would be exploitative, and I tend to stay away from
that stigma type of elf and clown job.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided to stick around, however, when it became clear that
to exploit a bunch of dwarfs and midgets for shock appeal would be
difficult to accomplish on an awards show where Howard Stern once
flew from the rafters baring his behind.

 &HT;    Get the Midas touch; this is the season of Gold
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you care at all about seasonal fluctuations in fashion, by
all means do delve into the new tweeds, plaids, skins, touchy-feely
tops and showy shoes in stores now. They're all hallmarks of what's
currently stylish: looking rich, sophisticated, worldly and
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing sets the new standard in style like gold does.
Nothing looks more precious.
</P>
<P>
   Its essential rarity helps make gold seem so desirable; it
simply hasn't been ``around'' in a while. Suddenly, it's got that
irresistibly tempting and taunting look of new money. Gold accents
the rich, indulgent sensibility coursing through all the top
designers' fall collections.
</P>
<P>
   As fashion houses and e-commerce have converged, collided and
collapsed in the six months since this season's top looks were
first unveiled in the fashion capitals, gold has become this
season's symbol of quests for world domination.
</P>
<P>
   In a startling show of unanimity on the runways of New York,
Paris and Milan, designers appealed to our preternatural attraction
to gold, whether it's the thread woven into sweaters and pinstripe
suits, or lacquered on some exotic animal hide, or spun into silk,
or fused into form-fitting fabrics. And then there's all the focus
now on gold-toned accessories: jewelry, straps, buckles and heels.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion's fixation on gold is the clearest signal that ``power
dressing'' is back in vogue. So, if you don't dip into the pool of
gold clothes and accessories that stores have stockpiled, it'll be
the Achilles' heel of your entire wardrobe.

 &HT;    Five must haves for the Fall season
 &HT;    Eds: Emabargoed for Sunday, Sept. 10.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  Something in leather
</P>
<P>
   Sleek and sophisticated, it's the fabric of the season. Look for
it in jeans, coats, skirts and shirts. Black is a runaway favorite,
but also look for red, camel and brown pieces. Our choice: Anne
Klein's black leather jacket with zip-front ($298). Also shown:
Anne Klein black leather pants ($298) and Via Spiga's black leather
pumps ($155). All at Rich's.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A chunky sweater
</P>
<P>
   Textured sweaters are tops this fall. But that doesn't mean
bulky. Larger-gauze stitches, heavy-ply yarns and funnel necks help
create this cool look for cool days. Our choice: Sleeveless green
sweater from Classiques Entier ($118). At Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Something in gold
</P>
<P>
   The Midas look counts in bold accessories. But if you don't want
to take it to the extreme, opt for simplicity and rush to the
forefront of fashion. Our choices: Bonnie J hoop earrings ($10);
gold bangles from Jennifer Moore (a box of five, $14.99); a shiny
gold belt with studs ($26). All at Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The bowling bag
</P>
<P>
   You will strike the right fashion note carrying this large bag,
in which a cosmetics case, billfold and all your daily necessities
will neatly fit. This silhouette comes in smooth leathers as well
as fabrics and suedes. Our choice: Black/tan leather bowling bag
from Miu Miu ($410). At Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A pretty blouse
</P>
<P>
   It's the logical partner for the new ladylike suits and the
perfect expression of this year's softened femininity. Look for
blouses in prints and solids, in silks, chiffons and blends. Our
choice: I.N.C.'s wine-red blouse with necktie ($59). At Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   Five gotta haves for him
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Something in leather
</P>
<P>
   For a luxurious look and feel, the leather jacket is a must.
Pair it with jeans, flannels, tweeds, even a matching pair of
leather trousers. Our choices: Alfani's black leather blazer
($395). Also shown, Alfani's black leather trousers ($295). Both at
Rich's. Black leather slip-ons from Halogen ($180). At Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A luxurious T-shirt
</P>
<P>
   Cotton just doesn't do it this year. Opt instead for a shirt in
cashmere, silk or merino wool and wear it under blazers or a suit.
Our choice: Perry Ellis' silk-blend T in a textured cream color
($65). At Rich's.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  French-cuff shirt
</P>
<P>
   When a shirt is required for business, think about the
dressed-up look of a French-cuff dress shirt with cuff links. It's
a bit more formal look than a regular cuffed shirt and decidedly
French dressing. Our choice: Giorgio Armani's blue shirt ($185),
John Hardy silver cuff links ($150) and Etro dot tie ($95). All at
Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A techno watch
</P>
<P>
   If you have time on your hands, go for the look of a sports
watch. It's cool and ultra-sleek, especially with a techno band.
Our choice: Techno Marine chronograph watch with a black high-tech
band and yellow face ($300). At Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pair of color wash jeans
</P>
<P>
   The perennial blue denims have faded a bit from the spotlight.
Go for a pair in a black, gray or olive color. Torn, patched and
stamped jeans are also in the jean pool. Our choice: Black wash
jeans from Phat Farm ($78). At Macy's.

 &HT;    At 66, Loretta Lynn remains a `Honky Tonk Girl' in a Nashville
gone uptown
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HURRICANE MILLS, Tenn. _ About 65 miles west of Nashville, not
far off an interstate exit distinguished only by a truck plaza and
a diner with a winking catfish on the roof, country music legend
Loretta Lynn is light-years away from the glass-and-steel office
temples that now line Music Row.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a booth on her purple tour bus, which is parked just
down the road from her home, she looks more like a housewife than a
star, her face dusted slightly with makeup, cotton shirttails
hanging over a pair of jeans tucked into the only accessory that
smacks of show business: a pair of bright blue cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They was made by, oh ... you know ... oh, what's his name ...
uh ... Nudie! That's it. They was made by Nudie,'' she says,
sticking a foot out from under the table to show off the work of
the flashy Nudie Cohen, the late costume designer who pasted
Nashville in rhinestones in the 1940s and '50s. Pointing to a black
heel that juts forward at a cocky 45-degree angle, she wisecracks,
``The only thing is, this darn thing makes me feel like I'm walkin'
on the middle of my foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's idea of being a country star doesn't have much to do with
designer clothes, laminated backstage passes or exclusivity. Hers
is the old-school, approachable kind of country music, the one
where working-class people weep over a beer to your lyrics, then
stand in line for hours to get your autograph or have you kiss
their twitching kids.
</P>
<P>
   Her fans have gathered this evening to catch Lynn in a rare
concert appearance at her sprawling, river-bottom homestead. The
100-acre-plus compound, which she turned into a tourist attraction
in the early 1970s, contains her white-columned plantation house
(immortalized in the 1980 bio-pic ``Coal Miner's Daughter''), a
replica of the ramshackle Kentucky cabin she grew up in, an RV
park, a dirt-bike course, riding trails, a giant statue of a carved
wooden Indian, a hayride wagon, a souvenir shop and the open-air
concert hall where her bus is parked.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's been more than 20 years since Lynn's string of hit
records (``You're Looking at Country,'' ``One's on the Way,''
``Fist City''), her fans sit crowded on bleachers under a sweaty
outdoor pavilion that's not likely to show up on any Ticketmaster
seating chart. They're a blue-collar crowd _ mostly older folks in
shirtsleeves, T-shirts, baseball caps and sneakers, the kind of
people who're more likely to buy their country music at the counter
of a truck stop than at Tower.
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling that if she didn't have to perform her
homecoming show tonight, Lynn would probably shuck off her shoes
and go barefoot across the sawdust floor. Instead, she's angling
for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, four decades into a career that has made her not just a
country superstar but an American icon, Lynn is releasing a new
album _ her first set of original tunes in 12 years. ``Still
Country,'' which hits stores Tuesday, not only has her making some
of her richest music in decades _ songs that sound much like the
hits of her heyday _ but contains older-skewing lyrics about being
``On My Own.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD, which will sit in Wal-Mart racks next to discs from much
younger, pop-oriented acts such as Faith Hill and Shania Twain, is
packaged to make a bit of a political statement as well: On the
cover, the word ``Still'' is italicized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're almost sticking it in people's noses and going
nyahhhhhh,'' says Nick Hunter, the Nashville record executive who
was thrilled to be able to sign Lynn to his upstart independent
label, Audium Records, last year. (For 35 years, she had been on
Decca/MCA.) ``As times change, some people don't think Loretta is
the image they want country to be anymore. But I'm not sure that
people running record companies care about the tradition and image
of country music.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;  Lynn's tin-roof twang may be the stuff of legend, but it's
not exactly the kind of music today's polished country radio
stations want to play. The 12 tracks on the new album don't deviate
one note from the backwoods style Lynn established on her first
record, ``Honky Tonk Girl,'' in thick, mountain dialect in which
``bare'' becomes ``bar'' (as in ``bar-footed''), fingers are
``fangers'' and wash is ``warsh.'' The new single ``Country in My
Genes,'' released last month, delivers fiddle and thick steel
guitar. It is not on the playlists of either of Atlanta's country
superstations, Kicks 101.5 and Eagle 106.7.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a place for Loretta Lynn, but it's not in mainstream
country now,'' says Kicks music director Johnny Gray. ``We have for
years played her music on our `Country Gold Saturday Night'
segments, because we respect her and what she's meant to country
music. But she's still very traditional in her approach to music,
which is fine but certainly doesn't fit country radio now, which is
targeted to people 25 to 54.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn thinks he has it backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never left country music, everybody else did,'' she says,
taking a swipe at the current state of Nashville. ``It's made me a
good livin'. Why should I go in another direction?''
</P>
<P>
   The course that she's taking at this point in her famous life is
one that not many established or wealthy music stars travel. With
six children, 29 grandchildren, money in the bank from a jukebox
full of hit records and even a plaque in the Country Music Hall of
Fame, Lynn could easily settle into comfortable retirement on her
spread near the banks of the Duck River, making guest appearances
at awards shows or in younger artists' music videos. The 1980 movie
about her life, ``Coal Miner's Daughter'' (which seems to air
virtually every week on TBS), based on her autobiographical book of
the same name, secured her fame. She's even working on a sequel,
due for publication next spring. But the spunky mannerisms that
actress Sissy Spacek turned into Oscar gold still define the star
from Butcher Holler, Ky.: oblivious determination, a stunning
bluntness, and confidence that she's still a vital star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people her age are checking out, and here she is checking
in once again,'' says Grand Ole Opry President Pete Fisher. ``Great
country music is, oftentimes, about consistent imperfection, that
artist who presents themselves honestly _ `take me as I am.' You
know once she gets up there and sings those songs, that's who she
is. She's not part of the mass-media machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's producer, Nashville instrumental whiz Randy Scrugg,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't believe she's an artist of the past,'' Scrugg
says. ``She thinks she has something to say now. ... She's so real,
the true essence of the type of artist I've always wanted to work
with. And there aren't many of them left.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;  Lynn was publicly silent throughout much of the '90s, when
she retreated into her white-columned mansion to care for her
ailing husband, Oliver _ better known as ``Mooney'' or
``Doolittle.'' The roughneck Kentucky coal miner who married her
when she was just 13 (Tommy Lee Jones made a sexier version of him
famous on film) battled diabetes, eventually losing both legs, his
eyesight and his hearing. In 1996, the man who helped Lynn climb
out of the harsh mining life of Appalachia, bought her her first
guitar and pounded on the door of every country disc jockey to play
her records died.
</P>
<P>
   She had never lived alone in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember nothin','' Lynn says. ``That first year, I
just don't remember. You know one day you're gonna lose 'em, but
you're never ready for it. ... I lost 12 people in four years: two
brothers, Conway (Twitty), two aunts, four uncles, Tammy (Wynette),
cousins. I just was in denial that anything had happened. I had the
house completely rebuilt, 'cause I could not live there the way it
was. Too many memories.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year later, she was walking in front of a Nashville
department store when she felt herself come back to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this mink coat in the window, and I said, `I'm gonna get
that. I don't care if it fits me or not. So I went in there and
bought me a full-length mink coat,'' she laughs. ``What did I need
it for? Where have I been that's that cold? But I'd never bought
one. I never went noplace. And haven't got to wear it. We've got it
in storage. I don't need it really. I just bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   That act of impulse shopping was, perhaps, the beginning of
Lynn's personal and professional resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;  In the decade she spent in virtual isolation caring for
``Doo,'' Nashville _ both the music scene and the city itself _ had
become virtually unrecognizable. The funky old houses that once
held Music Row publishing companies, where Lynn had knocked on
doors in the early '60s, had been torn down, replaced by high-rise
buildings filled with offices headed by young executives wearing
Armani suits. Without hits on the charts, Lynn's 35-year
association with MCA/Decca Records came to an end. Her longtime
producer, the legendary Owen Bradley, died in January 1998. And,
for the first time in her life, there was no Mooney to manage her
career.
</P>
<P>
   The husband-wife team were a notorious duo, fighting and making
up with the over-the-top emotions mirrored in Lynn's scorchingly
literal songs: ``Don't Come Home a-Drinkin' (With Loving on Your
Mind)'' or ``Your Squaw Is on the Warpath Tonight.'' While Mooney
did much to encourage his wife's career, the resulting riches and
public spotlight were often too much for a man who perceived
himself as more good ol' boy than grandstander. When Loretta drove
120 miles per hour in her big Cadillac (``Shoot, it said it could
go that fast, so that must mean I can drive it that fast''), Mooney
took away the car keys. He also liked his whiskey (hence his
nickname), resulting in an ongoing cat-and-mouse game of
``gotcha!'' with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to her rural mansion after the purging renovations
following Mooney's death, Lynn finally came to terms with the loss
of her powerful husband. Recently, she was even able to laugh about
their life together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never gonna believe what I found today,'' she says,
slapping her hands on the Formica table in front of her. ``I found
the last pint of whiskey I hid from Doolittle! I'd hid it behind
all the pots and pans and stuff that I didn't use unless it was a
holiday. I got down there in all them drawers this week and I found
it. And I said, `This is going in my museum!'''
</P>
<P>
   Just over the hill from the concert pavilion, across the street
from her stately home, Lynn is building a museum, to open next
spring, to house the memories of her life _ that speeding Cadillac,
her first stage dress (a homemade cowgirl suit) and props from
``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' a movie she says she ``hates'' to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many places where I just have to turn my head, it
hurts so much. A lot of stuff went much deeper than what people
know. Some of the bad things in there went much deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mooney's last pint of whiskey will be on display.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect Lynn to become a curator. With the new album's
release, she's scheduled to make the rounds of late-night talk
shows, and she'll commence a book tour when the new autobiography,
``Still Woman Enough,'' is released by Hyperion next spring. It
picks up where ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' published in 1976, left
off. She even has a boyfriend, an Arkansas ``Bible teacher'' whom
she met after listening to his inspirational tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his wife about the same time I lost Doo. ... He sent
me a picture of him on the back of an old mule named Pearl. I
laughed and said, `He's gotta be country'.''
</P>
<P>
   She says they see each other ``about every six months.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;  As for recording success, Lynn's new label plans to market
her new single and album to small country stations rather than the
big guys. While Kicks 101.5 and Eagle 106.7 may not be playing the
new tune, it has made the air on small-market stations such as
WCON/99.3 FM in Cornelia, where general manager Bobbie Foster says
she's playing ``Country in My Genes'' ``about twice a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Audium will also pitch the new record to the growing
``Americana'' radio market of alternative country music, where Lynn
is an icon. But she's somewhat oblivious to the marketing machine,
saying simply, ``What does `alternative' mean? Don't ask me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sun goes down over hazy river-bottom fields planted with
corn and soybeans, Lynn takes the stage as she has a thousand times
before, her hand grasping the cord of a microphone as she belts out
her hits. The plain stage is decorated with red, white and blue
flags that look like they were borrowed from a parade float. The
audience swishes cardboard church fans in time to the music.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the distance, kids are shooting off fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all you folks out there, my gosh,'' Lynn says,
welcoming her fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure do love sangin' for you.''

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: SOCCER  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the grand and sometimes hoary traditions of soccer is
that every tournament no matter how big or small, must have a Group
of Death. That is to say, one bracket is inevitably stronger than
the others.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the Grupo de Muerte is a cliche, but at these Summer
Games it is a fact. The defending women's Olympic and World Cup
champions _ one and the same _ from the United States have been
placed in the brutal half of the draw.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans _ heroes of Atlanta, the stars of Pasadena _ must
play Norway first, then China and then Nigeria, with only two of
those four teams going to the semifinals. The lopsided draw came
about because the host team, Australia _ perhaps the weakest team
in the Olympic tournament _ was automatically seeded first, somehow
winding up in a group with Germany, Sweden and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement is serious business.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Women's World Cup, now a legitimate worldwide
attraction because of U.S. marketing in 1999, the Olympics are the
biggest event for female players. Failing to get to the semifinals
would be a jolt to China or Norway or the United States, and that
is precisely what is going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   THE WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women are now coached by April Heinrichs, a former
star. They are sending 14 of the 18 players who won the 1999 World
Cup _ Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, et al.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been considerable retooling, with Michelle Akers
announcing her retirement. Siri Mullinix may have supplanted Briana
Scurry in goal, and the veteran defender Carla Overbeck will be
more marginal this time around.
</P>
<P>
   THE MEN
</P>
<P>
   The men's tournament is the usual hybrid Olympic affair,
essentially a 23-and-under championship spiced with a maximum of
three older players per team.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil declined to bolster its squad after a team psychologist
deduced that the younger players' egos would be hurt by the
inclusion of older players. The Americans did not publicly voice
such touchy-feely sentiments. Coach Clive Charles picked up Jeff
Agoos, 32; Frankie Hejduk, 26; and Brad Friedel, 29.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the squad consists of decent younger players from
Major League Soccer and European teams, plus one college player.
The Yanks will play the Czech Republic, Cameroon and Kuwait, hoping
to be one of two teams from the group to advance to the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   They will surely insist that they, too, have been placed in the
Gruppo di Morte. Just about everybody claims that.

 &HT;    Spotlight on color
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This fall, fashion's mood has shifted from minimalism to
opulence, and makeup's following suit.
</P>
<P>
   The newest cosmetic colors ooze with an attitude of indulgence
and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women should have fun with makeup this fall. It's very
retro,'' says Iris Ingram-Hopgood, a Stone Mountain, Ga.,-based
makeup artist.
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the focus is on lips and eyes, but never both at the
same time. Like having two divas in the same room, something's
bound to clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the intensity is going to be the lip, go lighter on the
eye, or vice versa. You really want to draw the attention to one
area,'' advises Faith Edwards, an Atlanta makeup artist.
</P>
<P>
   Reds take center stage for nails and lips in a variety of ripe
berry hues. For new lip shades check out ``Lady Danger,'' a
blackened red by M.A.C., ``Chili Thrill,'' a spicy red by Revlon;
and ``Profond Sommeil,'' a blood-red by Lancome.
</P>
<P>
   Deep reds go with all the colors that are happening this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown earth tones are also hot for lips and nails. Most
cosmetics lines have something enticing to offer, from Maybelline's
``Barely Beige'' nail enamel and gloss, to Clinique's ``Pink
Chocolate'' and cocoa-toned ``Sugar Bean'' lipstick, to Estee
Lauder's ``Cinnamon Stick,'' ``Nutty Brown'' and ``Fiery Russet''
lip colors.
</P>
<P>
   Practically anyone can wear brown, but a lip liner in, say, a
red or contrasting brown is essential to make it blend with your
skin tone and provide a hint of color. Deep browns don't do justice
to fairer skin tones, unless you're going for a very dramatic
evening look, says Edwards. Darker skins can wear richer, more
intense browns, especially when a dab of sheer gloss is added to
the center of the lip.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes have it when it comes to dramatic color. See
Maybelline's ``Green Glam'' and ``Berry Chic,'' M.A.C.'s
``Infamous'' deep purple and ``Flammable'' crimson, and Estee
Lauder's ``High Pearl in Khaki Summer.'' Blend shadow lightly with
a professional brush or applicator, to avoid smudging.
</P>
<P>
   Blushes are soft and rosy this fall. Get the look with
``L'Oreal's ``Mocha Rose'' and ``Plume.'' For something more
intense, try Maybelline's pinkish-red ``Wild Fire,'' M.A.C.'s
goldish-yellow ``Honour'' and Lancome's deep red ``Potion
Magique.''
</P>
<P>
   A little blush goes a long way, and blending is key, unless you
want Betty Boop cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When applying blush, start in the apple of the cheek and blend
back. You just want a hint of color,'' says Edwards. ``At night,
it's OK to go heavier, but again, go with balance. Adding a little
silver or gold (powder or blush) on top makes it kind of funky for
evening.''

 &HT;    Holding fast to the _ and reaping its rewards
 &HT;    By Gayle White

<TEXT>
<P>
   You didn't see anchorwoman Brenda Wood on WXIA's 11 p.m.
newscast last night.
</P>
<P>
   Wood insists on a provision in her contract that guarantees
Friday nights off.
</P>
<P>
   But you probably didn't see her at the mall, the grocery store
or latest trendy nightspot, either.
</P>

   Wood, a lifelong Seventh-day Adventist, observes the Sabbath
from sundown Friday until sundown Saturday with her husband and two
teenage daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful thing to be able to put everything down and
just rest _ to put away the things of your secular world, all your
worries and responsibilities outside of the home, and really have
time to reflect, spend time with your family and worship God,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken sandwich king Truett Cathy says amen.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy, founder of Chick-fil-A and a faithful member of First
Baptist Church in Jonesboro, has closed his restaurants on Sundays
for 53 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our leases in shopping malls are written that we close on
Sunday,'' Cathy said. ``To me, Sunday has always been a very
special day. As a kid, I didn't have to go to school, I didn't have
to do much work around the house, and I got to go to Sunday school
and church.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cathy teaches a Sunday school class of 13-year-old boys
and includes an occasional lesson on keeping the Sabbath, or as
many Christians call Sunday, the Lord's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have the reputation of being a hypocrite,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an Orthodox Jew, joined
the Democratic ticket as the vice presidential nominee last month,
he made it clear that he does not intend to campaign on the Jewish
Sabbath. Lieberman's public acknowledgment of his tradition serves
as a stark contrast to the bustling commercialism that has engulfed
many other professing Jews and Christians, who seem to overlook the
commandment to ``remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy,''
although they wouldn't think of violating the ones against stealing
or killing.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are not worried about Lieberman neglecting his
job one day a week if elected, however. Asked by an ABC News poll
whether they were ``concerned his religious practices would
interfere with his duties as vice president,'' 89 percent of those
questioned said no.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bible, the idea of keeping a Sabbath dates back
to the beginning of time _ or at least the first week. The book of
Genesis says, ``And on the seventh day God finished the work that
he had done, and he rested on the seventh day. ... So God blessed
the seventh day and hallowed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers and their parents can remember a time when,
especially in the traditionally Christian Bible Belt, there was not
much choice of activity on Sunday. Stores were closed. Athletic
leagues wouldn't think of scheduling games. And a neighbor caught
doing yardwork was the subject of whispered gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition was firmly established in North America in the
17th century when Puritans wrote Sunday observance into law. The
blue binding of their legal code may have given the restrictions
the nickname ``blue laws.'' The laws lasted in many places until
the second half of the 20th century, when state legislatures,
bowing to business pressures, began repealing them or making them
local options.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, Sunday became just another day for running
errands, finishing up work, or getting a head start on the next
week. But now, with Sunday commerce fully entrenched, some people
are mourning the passing of an enforced day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American culture has clearly made so much of business
success and making money that the whole Sabbath concept has gotten
lost,'' said Tim Norton of Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   As executive director of the Atlanta-based Lord's Day Alliance
of the United States, Norton now makes his living promoting Sabbath
observance. Since April, when he took the job as head of the
national, interdenominational organization, he has been practicing
what he's preaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a crazy working kind of person,'' Norton said.
``Practicing the Sabbath concept has made an unbelievable
difference in my life. I do rest. I use the day I worship, Sunday,
to be renewed and refreshed. The whole week is a different week for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton attends church and spends time with his wife and son.
Sometimes they entertain friends for meals.
</P>
<P>
   For much of its 112-year history, the alliance fought in
legislatures and courts for laws that ensured the right of workers
to a Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Although the organization still supports some legislation,
Norton said, the focus is evolving into convincing people of the
need to observe a day of rest and worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to turn our organization to focus on the Sabbath as
a gift of God,'' he said. ``When he created the world in a six-day
frame, whatever those units mean, then he took a day of rest for
himself. He was refreshed spiritually. We are trying to reclaim
that concept.''
</P>
<P>
   So are a couple of Protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 300 regional and national staff members of the 1.5
million-member American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A., the
so-called northern Baptists, gathered in March for a five-day event
called ``God's Servants Together: Keeping Sabbath.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David Wheeler, senior minister of First Baptist Church
in Los Angeles, set the tone by telling the group that Sabbath ``is
part of the very nature of God ... the renewal and restoration of
original creation, part of the original rhythm ... part of the very
nature of time.''
</P>
<P>
   At its annual meeting in Long Beach, Calif., this summer, the
General Assembly of the 2.6 million-member Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) adopted a document called ``An Invitation to Sabbath:
Rediscovering a Gift,'' which will be sent to all the
denomination's congregations and seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Haig, the Louisville-based church's coordinator for
spiritual formation, said the document was the result of a two-year
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are recognizing that we cannot continue
to live as we're living, that we're exhausted, we're burned out, we
have lost joy in our lives, and we feel driven,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before its official distribution, the document is receiving
overwhelming response. Haig's workshops on Sabbath observance fill
to overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally try to take as many Sabbath moments as I can, and
if I'm working on Sunday, I take another day during the week as my
Sabbath,'' she said. ``The sense that we are only entitled to be
breathing air if we're producing something that somebody else says
is worth it, that's demonic. It's evil. It's contrary to what the
Bible teaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, clergy may be among the least likely people to
observe a Sabbath. With services to conduct, they often are their
busiest on their faith's established day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday is the one day a week we work in the minds of most of
our members,'' said the Rev. Bob Setzer, a Southern Baptist
minister in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Psychotherapist Wayne Muller, who lives in Northern California,
came to Sabbath-keeping when he was hospitalized near death with
the same bacterial infection that killed Muppeteer Jim Henson.
</P>
<P>
   During the long, slow recovery process, Muller, ordained as a
Congregational minister, said he considered the ``power of
dormancy'' for plants, soil and human souls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tides rise and fall, seasons go from spring and summer to fall
and winter, the heart expands and contracts,'' said Muller, author
of ``Sabbath'' (Bantam, $14.95). ``Everything in life moves in
rhythm, but we've convinced ourselves we can go in only one
direction _ forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Marva Dawn, a Lutheran theologian living in Vancouver, Wash.,
came to Sabbath observance less dramatically in 1983 as a doctoral
student at Notre Dame. ``I discovered Sabbath-keeping was a
wonderful way not to go insane,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn, author of ``Keeping the Sabbath Wholly'' (William B.
Eerdmans Publishing Co., $15), incorporates both Jewish and
Christian elements, beginning her Sabbath _ which she starts at
bedtime on Saturday _ by lighting candles and praying.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, she enjoys using her grandmother's china, cooking
special foods and having quiet time with her husband or
entertaining friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason for the day is to recapture our relationship
with God,'' said Dawn. ``My love for God deepens when I experience
the grace of God in other people.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a world of cellular telephones, fax machines and the
Internet, people rarely spend time just reveling in relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the habit of taking naps, either,'' she said.
``That's a very good thing to do on the Sabbath.''
</P>

 &HT;    Adviser Gergen sees four presidents in the round, warts and all
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Richard Nixon died in 1994, many Americans mourned the dark
prince of a president whose disgrace was without parallel, while
others bit their tongues out of courtesy. President Clinton did not
know how closely his own fate would flirt with Nixon's when he said
in his eulogy, ``Today is a day for his family, his friends and his
nation to remember President Nixon's life in totality. To them, let
us say, may the day of judging President Nixon on anything less
than his entire career come to a close.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, David Gergen believes, one of Clinton's finest moments,
and one whose irony should be lost on no one. Americans have made a
parlor game of ranking their presidents, one reputation rising
while another slips. The Big Three _ Washington, Lincoln and
Franklin Delano Roosevelt _ are secure in the pantheon. A handful
compete for near-greatness, while most have settled into the
posthumous mediocrity that requires no monuments. Only a few are
judged outright failures, and Nixon was sui generis even in
failure.
</P>
<P>
   But with Nixon as with Clinton _ indeed with most of our
presidents _ there is more than what meets the eye, Gergen
believes, and few have seen so many so closely. He served as
speechwriter and policy adviser for three Republican presidents _
Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan _ and crossed party lines when
President Clinton sought his counsel early in his first term. As a
Republican serving a Democratic White House, he raised eyebrows,
but Gergen's interest has always been the effective exercise of
power. In the modern presidency, that might call for the honorable
art of persuasion or it might call for the newer, hardly venerable
technique of damage control.
</P>
<P>
   Gergen's new book, ``Eyewitness to Power: The Essence of
Leadership _ Nixon to Clinton'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $26), is not
quite a primer on the presidency, not entirely a leadership manual,
but very much the memoir of an insider. Gergen saw power exercised
close up, and came away with an appreciation for the complexity of
the men who exercised it. He is not uncritical _ far from it _ but
he sees his subjects in the round. ``Our culture,'' he writes, ``is
too quick to tear down our presidents once they are in office. All
of the six men I have known in office _ from Nixon to Clinton _
have been patriots who cared deeply about the fate of the country.
Several of them made terrible blunders, but they all struggled and
fought to create a better world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Richard Nixon, who betrayed Gergen's loyalty in the end,
elicits sympathy: ``If Lincoln was justified in suspending habeas
corpus during the Civil War, as many historians believe he was, why
was Nixon _ as commander in chief _ not justified in bending lesser
laws to protect the country's security during the Vietnam War?''
</P>
<P>
   The sufficiently obvious answer is that a civil war was not in
progress, although Gergen believes it was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point here is his portrayal of four very different
men. Nixon was brilliant, paranoid, self-pitying, socially awkward
and the most intellectually serious student of leadership Gergen
has known. ``The tragedy of Nixon's life,'' he writes, ``is that he
could not live up to his own standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Ford was the necessary contrast, a ``safe'' rather than
exceptional man and yet one underestimated even by those closest to
him: ``I have always thought him the most decent man I have known
in the presidency. But there was something else that mattered even
more. Emotionally, he was the healthiest president we have had
since Eisenhower and Truman. He knew who he was, was at peace with
life, and liked people.''
</P>
<P>
   Words so deceptively simple almost leap off the page. Of how
many accomplished people _ to say nothing of presidents _ can the
same be said? And yet Ford was not, in these respects, terribly
different from Ronald Reagan _ ``in my view, the best leader in the
White House since Franklin Roosevelt.'' Reagan, Gergen writes,
``was not just comfortable in his own skin. He was serene.'' At the
same time, he ``had less curiosity about public policy than any
president since perhaps the 1920s,'' and was ``so dreamy and
inattentive to detail that he allowed dramatic mistakes to occur.''
But no one was so clear about what he wanted to do, and no one so
much enjoyed coming to work. His buoyance reassured Americans at a
time when they had been browbeaten by worriers.
</P>
<P>
   To come, then, to President Clinton is to return to the enigma
of intellectual gifts yoked to self-destructive impulses. Clinton's
presidency will not end in ruins like Nixon's, but he can only hope
that it will be seen in its totality. ``When he decamps and the
dust settles,'' Gergen writes, ``we will look back and see that
despite the scandals, he left the country far better off than he
found it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he will never be a model of leadership. He didn't want so
much to lead as to share power _ with his wife, with his vice
president _ and it cost him almost as much as his problems with
women and truth. The real troubles of his two terms, Gergen
surmises, have not been the ones in the headlines, but ``other,
more fundamental problems he brought to the presidency.'' Where
Nixon knew right from wrong, and chose wrong, Clinton ``has
360-degree vision but no true north.'' Few presidents have been his
intellectual equal, but most had a working compass.

   Interactivity: Hear it loud and clear
</P>
<P>
   Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   By Shane Harrison
</P>
<P>
   Radio is radio, whether it's on the Web, in your car or pumping
from your home stereo. It's just an avenue for entertainment or
edification. But there are things that set the Web variety apart.
Aside from the lack of geographical constraints, Web radio has at
least one other advantage: immediate interactivity.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet-only radio outlets have found ways to use the
medium and its immediacy to greater advantage. Many exclusively
online stations are DJ-less musical advertisements, streaming tunes
while the title and artist are displayed on your player along with
a link to order the CDs online.
</P>
<P>
   Sites such as iTurf (www.iturf
</P>
<P>
   .com) and Soundbreak.com (www.soundbreak.com) are taking things
to a higher frequency. Soundbreak.com launched earlier this year,
targeting listeners ages 15 to 35. The playlist leans toward the
alternative/modern rock format, with a more wide-ranging sound than
most non-Web modern-rock stations.
</P>
<P>
   Among Soundbreak's executives is former MTV VJ Mark Goodman, who
is vice president of music programming. ``We're not another Web
radio station; we're a forward-thinking Internet music destination
with live round-the-clock DJs,'' Goodman declares. ``We're all
committed to exposing new artists and being the signpost for new
directions in music.''
</P>
<P>
   Soundbreak listeners can be viewers, too. A camera is positioned
in the studio, sending out video of the DJs, and the chat feature
allows users to interact with the people in the studio and other
listeners 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive element really comes in handy when celebrities
visit the Soundbreak studios. To celebrate the site's launching,
the five original MTV VJs reunited for a chat with netizens in
February. Since then, the site has hosted chats with Ice-T, Fatboy
Slim, Linda Blair and former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash, to name
a few.
</P>
<P>
   Soundbreak's site is graphics-intensive, so a high-speed
connection and a computer of recent vintage make a visit much more
pleasurable. One hint for slower connections: Get rid of the main
window and just keep the pop-up with video and audio feed on your
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Another interactive radio site, iTurf, targets teenagers. It
recently entered the Web radio fray on a more limited basis than
Soundbreak. The site is the home of a network of teen-centric
ventures, including gURL.com, the Spark and Droog, all accessible
via the main iTurf site.
</P>
<P>
   ITurf's radio station is live from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m. weekdays,
with an all-request format and a chat feature that serves as the
conduit to the DJs for song requests. Like Soundbreak, iTurf offers
a video feed for higher-speer connections. You can choose from
three connection speeds, or just listen to one of four non-live
music streams.

 &HT;    `Almost Famous' relives heady days of rock
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can blame Cameron Crowe for kicking off the teen-movie trend
when his book ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' was filmed in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   You can blame him, in 1996, for sticking us with several
maddeningly persistent catch phrases (``Show me the money,'' ``You
complete me,'' ``You had me at hello'') from ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can't blame Crowe for loving rock 'n' roll. It's a love
that started when he was a teenager in San Diego, turned on to the
music by his older sister. Befriended by rock critic Lester Bangs,
Crowe wrote his first cover story for Rolling Stone magazine at age
15, traveling around the country with Led Zeppelin, the Allman
Brothers, the Who and other bands as both fan and chronicler of the
1970s music scene.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Almost Famous,'' which opens Friday, Crowe puts a fictional
spin on his own story. It's the cinematic coming-of-age of
15-year-old alter ego William Miller (Patrick Fugit), who gets on
board the bus of a band called Stillwater, fronted by singer Jeff
Bebe (Jason Lee) and brooding guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy
Crudup).
</P>
<P>
   Just as important to the story are the nonstars, the teenage
muses of the band who reject the term ``groupies'' and call
themselves the Band Aids, led by a child vixen with the adopted
name Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).
</P>
<P>
   The movie's rock credentials are solid. Seventies teen king
Peter Frampton, a longtime friend of Crowe's, served as technical
consultant for the concert scenes and plays a bit role. Crowe's
wife, Nancy Wilson, half of the '70s sister band Heart, wrote the
score and penned, with Crowe, the songs that Stillwater sings. And
Bangs, now deceased, turns up in the movie, played by Philip
Seymour Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent promotional tour, Crowe talked about his love of
music, fond memories of Atlanta, the real ``Penny Lane'' and the
hair-raising experience of screening ``Almost Famous'' for Robert
Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin to get their approval to use
the band's music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you notice that DreamWorks is positioning your movie the
same way it did ``American Beauty'' last year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Really? That's cool. I'm just glad we got to come here and
talk about it. I always loved Atlanta. In 1973, the first day of
the Who's Quadrophenia tour was Atlanta. So I got to come. Lynyrd
Skynyrd were opening at the Omni, and it was an amazing night. I
was covering the Who, and I'd just had my first cover story come
out. Ronnie Van Zant sought me out to say he'd read my story on the
Allman Brothers Band. He just said, ``Man, you're a good writer,
and I wanted to introduce myself, and I hope one day we'll be
honored by you writing something about us.'' That was an amazing
thing to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you were what _ 15, 16?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was 16. I had long hair and I'd always let it hang in my
face, because it would keep people from seeing how young I really
was. I sort of fit in because (the musicians) all had long hair in
their face, so I could walk through lobbies with them and feel like
I belonged, much more than in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Maybe it's a stretch, but I found a common theme between this
movie and ``Jerry Maguire.'' In this case the setting is music; in
that one it was sports. But both are about talent having to battle
the corporate marketing-packaging mind-set. Is that intentional?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah. (Laughs.) Yeah, it's a very similar theme, I guess, and
where humanity winds its way through that story is pretty
interesting to me. I love the effect of fandom, what happens when
you love something, and you follow it through its stages of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You just screened this for Robert Plant and Jimmy Page. What
was that like?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nerve-racking. Elton John (whose song ``Tiny Dancer'' plays
in one scene) never seemed as long as when you're showing the movie
to Led Zeppelin. Their music seemed real skimpily used, suddenly.
We didn't want to overdo it, because we didn't think we had
approval. But they gave us the approval and encouraged us to use
more of it. Which for me was ``the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the movie, William's sister turns him on to rock 'n' roll.
Did your sister do that in real life?
</P>
<P>
   A: She absolutely did. ``Cheap Thrills'' was one of the pivotal
albums that didn't make it into the montage of album covers (seen
in the film). But, yeah, it's about 95 percent true.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did it take so long to settle on a title?
</P>
<P>
   A: The truth is that I was very decisive about the title. I
wanted to call it ``Untitled.'' But after about a year and a half
of trying to convince the studio that it was cool to have a movie
without a title, I finally lost that battle. (He laughs.) Then we
went with the final title, named after the band's tour name. And it
fits because the movie is also about the people on the side of the
stage, outside the spotlight. When you're watching a band, you see
these people that are the guests, and you think, ``Who are those
people?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was there a real Penny Lane, or was she a composite?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both. I always loved her name, and I loved her spirit. She
was a real muse girl, the real Penny Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Q: She used the name ``Penny Lane''?
</P>
<P>
   A: She did. Her real name was Penny Trumble. We named one of the
songs on the soundtrack after her, ``Lucky Trumble.'' We wanted to
pay tribute to her. She lives in Oregon. She never wrote a tell-all
book. She had a name for her crew _ it wasn't the Band Aids, it was
the Garter Girls. She's great. She actually could be the third
Wilson sister. She has similar qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has she seen the movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, she wrote me a letter. She said, ``If I die, I know
this thing has been left behind that explained with a certain
amount of nobility what I was like when I was younger.'' It was a
great letter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're riding the line between fiction and fact, revisiting
your teen self, and incorporating a real figure like your mentor,
Lester Bangs. Did it ever seem overwhelming, trying to keep that
all balanced?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's funny you should say that, ``overwhelming.'' When Philip
Seymour Hoffman first showed up and we started doing his sequences
_ ``overwhelming'' is the word. ... I felt a pressure to get Lester
right. And I still do. That was a tough one. I did think of
changing his name to ``Roger Banks'' or something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your movie touches on the tricky relationship between a
journalist and his subject. When is writing about someone a
betrayal? And you have Lester's advice, ``Be honest, but
unmerciful.''
</P>
<P>
   A: I've now learned what it's like to have that fed back to me.
One of the first times I showed the movie to the studio, they
called me back and they were like, ``Lester Bangs says to be honest
and unmerciful. Can we be honest and unmerciful with you?'' And I
thought, great. This is not how I wanted Lester to be quoted. It
gives people license to be needlessly brutal sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have a take on the music scene now vs. when you
started out in the '70s?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's so much more accessible now. One of my first concerts
was going to see the Who. I still love the Who. I stick them into
every movie. So I go to see the show in '71, I had the cheap seats
and I was milling around by the floor. The lights went down, the
crowd smashed us all right against the stage, and the Who came on.
I couldn't breathe. I was right against this wooden barricade. Pete
Townshend came onstage. He had some kind of English crown, and they
started playing ``I Can't Explain.'' He looked 30 feet tall. They
all looked huge. If anybody had told me on that night that soon all
of these people were going to be reduced to television size, I
would have said no way. But now they are. Everybody is accessible,
everybody is a TV star. The thing that movie stars always tell you,
which I never knew, is that you're untouchable until you go on TV.
When you're on TV, people on the street feel like they know you.
The mystique takes a hit. And the mystique of rock has taken a hit,
for better or worse.

 &HT;    Set sail with travel agents' expertise
 &HT;    Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 10.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A cruise can be like your favorite TV show _ it can carry you
away to a ``Fantasy Island,'' introduce you to new ``Friends'' and,
just maybe, help you find someone who's ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   But a cruise can also be a comedy of errors if you don't do your
homework _ choose one that's not your style and you might feel
you've set sail with a bunch of ``Freaks and Geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, an experienced travel agent can help you tune in to the
right cruise for your needs. We asked three local agents, who
collectively have sailed on more than 150 cruises, to pick the top
trips for different types of travelers. Follow their advice and
your next cruise should bring you ``Good Times.''

   Reinke opened his agency 20 years ago in Atlanta, catering to

for seven metro Carlson Wagonlit locations.
</P>
<P>
   ALL IN THE FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich: Although most major cruise lines offer children's
programs, Royal Caribbean is the best. Its ``Adventure Ocean''
program, combined with large youth facilities, large suites, a
baby-sitting service and exciting ports, makes it a winning family
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Moses: For three-, four- and now seven-night family cruises,
Disney Cruise Line's well-planned vessels allow children and adults
to have uncrowded vacation experiences each will enjoy. For seven
nights or longer, Carnival, Holland America Line, Princess and
Royal Caribbean all offer wonderful kids' programs, especially
during family travel periods (holidays, summer, spring break).
</P>
<P>
   Reinke: Carnival and Disney remain the frontrunners in onboard
activities for children. While both now offer three-, four- and
seven-night cruises, Carnival's much larger fleet encompasses a far
greater variety of itineraries. Each vessel is equipped with a
``Camp Carnival,'' providing all-day activities for kids. Disney's
spacious family staterooms are very popular, so expect few
discounts in the peak vacation months.
</P>
<P>
   THE LOVE BOAT
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich: What's more romantic than getting engaged or married
on a cruise? Royal Caribbean and Princess have wedding chapels on
some of their ships. For ladies traveling alone, Crystal and
Holland America offer the companionship of gentleman hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Moses: For couples, few experiences duplicate sailing aboard the
vessels of WindStar or Star Clippers. Billowing sails, exotic ports
of call and intimate vessels combine to make these ``can't miss''
romantic vacations. For singles, we advise sticking with larger
vessels, which may offer singles programs and active nightlife.
</P>
<P>
   Reinke: If a first or second honeymoon is in your future,
consider booking one of the luxurious 300-square-foot suites with
private verandah on Radisson Sevens Seas' Paul Gaugin. Its romantic
seven-night itinerary in French Polynesia includes two days in Bora
Bora and Moorea _ ahh, paradise found. If you're single and
searching for a little romance afloat, you will probably appreciate
the nonstop activities onboard Carnival's Fun Ships.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDEN GIRLS _ AND GUYS
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich: Cruising offers seniors the opportunity to enjoy the
amenities of a luxury vacation and exciting ports of call at
whatever level of activity the individual chooses. Most ships have
numerous elevators and ramps for ease of movement onboard, some
staterooms are equipped for the disabled, and special-diet menus
are available. Best of all, there are discount rates for seniors on
many Celebrity, Royal Caribbean and Carnival sailings.
</P>
<P>
   Moses: Most seniors typically enjoy the luxury of traveling
either on short notice or for extended periods. With this in mind
we like to recommend some of the more interesting itineraries
(South America, Africa, Australia/New Zealand, etc.). The ships
that sail these itineraries tend to be somewhat older and a bit
smaller, which provides for great value. Orient Lines, Holland
America Line, Crystal Cruises and Princess Cruises should be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Reinke: I find that seniors are more drawn to the Old World
decor of Holland America's fleet than any other age group. With
greater flexibility in their vacation schedules, this group of
travelers should never want for a good value. Seniors with greater
than average disposable income will appreciate the pampering and
unique itineraries available on Radisson Seven Seas and Crystal
Cruises.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVORS AND OTHER ADVENTURERS
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich: Royal Caribbean's Voyager and Explorer boast
rock-climbing walls, ice skating and in-line skating onboard, along
with numerous other activities. The line's warm-water cruises offer
snorkeling and diving excursions. Trips to Alaska on Royal
Caribbean, Princess, Crystal, Holland America and Norwegian Cruise
Lines may include glacier hiking, dog sledding and whitewater
rafting.
</P>
<P>
   Moses: In addition to offering adventurous itineraries (Costa
Rica, Africa, Australia/New Zealand, Amazon River), several lines
now offer pre- and post-cruise packages and shore excursions
incorporating adventure travel. Examples include African safaris as
part of cruises offered by Crystal and Silversea Cruises. Shore
excursions offered on many cruise lines include America's Cup
sailing, mountain biking, hiking and whitewater rafting.
</P>
<P>
   Reinke: If your idea of adventure includes a rain-forest hike in
the morning and scuba diving in the afternoon, I recommend the
100-passenger Temptress Explorer, offering seven-night itineraries
along Costa Rica's Pacific shore. Onboard naturalists offer evening
briefings detailing the following day's activities. For a less
strenuous taste of jungle adventure, the new Carnival Spirit will
offer eight-night cruises out of Miami that call at Belize, Costa
Rica and Panama beginning in November.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRICE IS RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich: Carnival and Costa cruise lines offer the
budget-minded traveler good value without sacrificing the basics.
But don't forget that you get what you pay for. Small price
variations can mean the difference between a great vacation and a
not-so-great one.
</P>
<P>
   Moses: Perhaps one of the best values in cruising is Regal
Cruises' Regal Empress. It does some excellent itineraries and
offers a warm crew and very comfortable accommodations. Another way
to save money is to look for off-season time periods _ usually
between Labor Day and Christmas and April through May.
</P>
<P>
   Reinke: The fF
</P>
<P>
   Fall 2000 may well be remembered as the season of unprecedented
cruise bargains. Ships fleeing the onset of cool weather in Europe
and Alaska will be competing with the burgeoning fleet in the
Caribbean to push seven-day cruises down to prices as low as $499
to $549 per person. Carnival, Holland America, Norwegian Cruise
Lines, Princess and Royal Caribbean all share one thing in common:
bargains galore.
</P>
<P>
   DIFF'RENT STROKES (specialty cruises)
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich: Specialty cruises featuring music, sports, personal
finance, food, wine and other special interests are available in
the midprice range on Holland America and Norwegian Cruise Line, as
well as on the upcale Crystal and Radisson Seven Seas.
</P>
<P>
   Moses: Theme cruises are best located via a related magazine or
through an organization. Perhaps the best part of these cruises is
traveling with like-minded individuals who share your enthusiasm
for a given topic or activity. Many cruise lines, including
Crystal, Norwegian Cruise Lines and Cunard feature general theme
cruises on cooking, sports, art and history.
</P>
<P>
   Reinke: Bird watching, dogsledding, swing dancing, rock
climbing, ice skating, you name it _ it's available while afloat,
on ships big and small. Always the innovator, Carnival will offer
an itinerary tailor-made for island addicts starting in May 2001.
Starting in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the refurbished Holiday will
visit seven islands in seven days, including unspoiled St. Kitts,
St. Barts and Tortola.

 &HT;    Survival at sea, in an ocean of calories
 &HT;    By Amanda Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Take two pairs of pants,'' friends who are cruise veterans
advised when they found out about my plans for a seven-day
Caribbean voyage. A pair you can wear now and one the next size up
for after you cross the sea of indulgence, they said.
</P>
<P>
   No way, I replied. Weigh, they said. Weigh before you go. Weigh
after you come back. You'll be 5 pounds heavier.
</P>
<P>
   And I thought you were supposed to leave your cares behind on a
cruise. Would this be the diary of a disaster at sea?
</P>
<P>
   Day 1
</P>
<P>
   Barely aboard the MS Veendam, a modern and elegant Holland
America ship, not even out of port in Fort Lauderdale, and already
I am gazing longingly at a friend's two extra-large scoops of
chocolate ice cream. They are floating in hot fudge sauce, nestled
in a valley of chocolate chip cookies. I don't even like ice cream,
and rarely eat dessert. What's going on here, some sort of
cruise-induced trance?
</P>
<P>
   There are six of us traveling together, all two-time cruisers
except for the ice cream mogul and moi, the Miss Piggy wannabe. Two
have Veendam experience. ``Wait'll she sees the Midnight Chocolate
Extravaganza,'' one says with a knowing smirk.
</P>
<P>
   They've taken bets, it turns out, on how soon I'll break. The
most cynical of the group gives me four hours; another guesses a
day.
</P>
<P>
   After a sensible lunch _ a spoonful of shrimp salad, a spoonful
of cabbage salad, broccoli soup, a roll, iced tea _ I go for a
scoop of the vanilla bean ice cream with strawberries and
blueberries (250 calories). The first hour aboard ship. The first
meal. Everybody loses their bet. The battle of the bulge has begun
in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   I take eight brisk turns around the deck _ two miles _ to
contemplate my possibly flawed theory: With enough exercise and
portion control, I'd told the doubters, you don't have to come back
blown up like an inflatable raft. It seemed so plausible on land.
</P>
<P>
   Up ahead is Cheryl McKenzie, one of the ship's two fitness
instructors, out looking for walkers and handing out ``fitness
passports'' to encourage them. She's 25 _ slender, of course _ and
enthusiastic about the ship's efforts to keep people active.
</P>
<P>
   Passports are stamped each time a passenger completes an
activity _ walking around the deck, shuffleboard, line-dance
classes, using the weight room _ and can be redeemed for ship's
merchandise at the end of the cruise. About half of all passengers
get a passport, and about half of those redeem it, McKenzie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big eater,'' she confides, maybe because she's from
Yorkshire, England, not particularly noteworthy for culinary
delights. ``But some of the staff puts on weight during the cruise.
It's that chocolate buffet and all the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, I stick to my plan for dinner: an appetizer of
mussels, some vegetable soup, baked melt-in-your-mouth prawns, a
glass of wine, plus low-fat yogurt with fruit compote for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   The chocolate-loving companion settles on Fudgie Espresso, an
incredible 500-calorie-plus wedge of cake with ice cream on the
side. He intends to gain 10 pounds on the cruise, he says, so he'll
have an even 50 to lose back home.
</P>
<P>
   Day 2
</P>
<P>
   Up and walking at 7 a.m., I decide to do six miles to compensate
for the 500 calories above my norm I had on Day 1 and the 500 extra
I'll likely consume today.
</P>
<P>
   Others have the same idea, though nobody's going that Olympic
distance. Some are wearing unscuffed, ultrawhite shoes and walking
as if they've just discovered they have legs. As the week wears on,
they'll drop out one by one, yielding to the higher power of fork
and knife.
</P>
<P>
   Mikki Ricker isn't among the neophytes. A fit 72, and an avid
cruiser from Goodland, Kan., she's hustling around the deck. ``My
first cruise, I lost four pounds,'' she recounts. ``They had dance
hosts, and I stayed up till 2 a.m. dancing every night.''
</P>
<P>
   On this cruise, she's taking the stairs, walking around the deck
and having fruit for lunch. ``Then you're hungry for dinner, and
can eat all six courses if you wish,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is easy to keep light, and delightful, but it's still
higher-calorie fare than my usual two pieces of wheat toast and
coffee. I choose toast, fruit, a thin slice of Nova salmon, coffee,
a small glass of fruit juice, water; I stick to that for the entire
cruise, varying only the type of fruit or fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   For the buffet-style lunch, I decide to limit myself mostly to
sandwiches, salads and soups, whatever looks interesting that I
wouldn't trouble to make at home, and to keep the portions small.
And no dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's hope, I think, relaxing on the beach at our first
port, Half Moon Cay, a Holland America-owned island in the Bahamas,
and sipping a late afternoon margarita (200 calories), reading, and
contemplating nothing, except ... what's for dinner?
</P>
<P>
   One of my companions orders two entrees, a filet mignon and
scallops over linguini in marinara sauce. Another samples _ OK,
consumes _ a chocolate tulip and a piece of raspberry cheesecake, a
combination that makes Fudgie Espresso look like the Weight
Watchers special. The chocolate-lover friend starts to talk about
his baby, that belly beginning to drift over his belt. He hopes to
give birth after the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   I settle on a salad, scallops and linguini, a glass of wine, and
fresh strawberries with frozen yogurt for dessert. Still, the day's
total calories are well above my norm.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling stuffed, we all take two turns around the deck, about a
half-mile.
</P>
<P>
   Day 3
</P>
<P>
   Up and walking at 8 a.m., and the herd has thinned. About half
the white-tennis-shoe set is sitting this one out. Some of the
overweight men who'd huffed around on Day 2 appear to have lost
their sea legs.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and sweaty after an hour and a half, I wander up to the
exercise room. A dozen people are using the treadmills, bikes or
weight machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifting weights helps to shape your body, and it's very
relaxing,'' says Lucano Cammarota, 41, of Milan, Italy, whose bod
is in such good shape that heads often turn when he enters the
ship's dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Overeating, he admits, is tempting on a cruise. ``You don't see
all this food in your everyday life.'' A former model and now a
tour guide, Cammarota counters the cruise calories with a two-hour
workout every day.
</P>
<P>
   A menacing piece of equipment glints in the sun and catches my
eye. The scales, tucked in a corner of the workout room, are
winking at me. I decide not to weigh again until after we dock.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner, I go for a high-fat appetizer, hazelnut Brie cheese
too wonderful to pass up, but balance it _ or so I tell myself _
with a salad and crab legs (no butter, the way I prefer them).
Dessert is low-fat frozen peach yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   Day 4
</P>
<P>
   Off the ship early for the day on St. Thomas, walking and
shopping, shopping and walking, eating a tuna sandwich at a cafe.
We sample and buy some flavored rums. Then back aboard ship, we all
take a strenuous nap before supper. Waking refreshed, I do a
five-mile walk around the deck.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing: Dinner is a sensible fillet of sole, salad
and vegetables, but I have two glasses of wine (100 calories each),
and finish with a buttery apple tart and not one, but two, scoops
of ice cream (easily 500 calories).
</P>
<P>
   My companions scoff at my excess, and in the context of our
table, I suppose I am a model of moderation. One of our group has
ordered two entrees (broiled New York steak with sauteed mushrooms
and fried potatoes and the fillet of sole) and two desserts (the
apple tart and a brownie with ice cream).
</P>
<P>
   Day 5
</P>
<P>
   Off the ship early again for St. Croix, and no exercise today
beyond walking, and walking, through quaint shops, picking up
souvenirs. Lunch is a grilled-cheese sandwich and tomato bisque
soup at a cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner, of course, is much more elaborate: minestrone soup,
orange and walnut salad, an entree of shrimp, salmon and orange
roughy on a bed of pasta, a glass of wine. And dessert: what to
choose? Fresh strawberries would be sensible ... but Key lime pie
it is.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, we head for the Ocean Bar for a drink (another 100
calories) and to stay up long enough for the Midnight Chocolate
Extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   On the dance floor, Mac and Karen Wiener are at it again: a
cha-cha, a rhumba, a swing, some fox trot. The Elmhurst, Ill.,
couple met dancing more than 30 years ago and haven't stopped
since. They've danced an hour or two every night of the cruise,
their fourth trip on Holland America ships, and they haven't gained
an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrific, pleasant aerobics, but lovely with your own
husband,'' says Karen, 57, an antiques dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do it with the primary motivation not to gain
weight,'' says Mac, 60, a stockbroker. ``It's just romantic and
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the ship's cafeteria, hordes of people are dancing
impatiently from foot to foot, awaiting the signal to dish up and
demolish 500-calorie slices of cake. Nobody plans to eat just one.
</P>
<P>
   I duck to the head of the line for photos. You can look and
photograph, and even salivate, but not touch, until 11 p.m. Some of
the chocolate is sculpted in elaborate carvings _ a Chinese dragon,
a sailing ship. The rest is in more edible forms: chocolate cakes,
puddings, pies, brownies, cookies, chocolate-covered strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   When the masses cross the starting line, I watch in horror. Oh,
the humanity. Most succumb to three or four desserts, some load
their plates with as many as six or eight. I'm tempted, but too
stuffed to act on the impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Day 6
</P>
<P>
   The last two days are at sea, and, surprisingly, the biggest
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Day 6 begins well: Six miles around the deck at 8 a.m. with
virtually unimpeded walking and even a little jogging _ most
everyone must be sleeping off their chocolate overdose.
</P>
<P>
   I shower, then head for the usual breakfast, and the deck chairs
to relax and read. Disaster awaits.
</P>
<P>
   We start talking about lunch at 11 a.m., and by noon, we've
worked up an appetite. Though I keep the portions small, I sample
everything on the buffet that looks remotely interesting _ a salad,
slaw, grilled chicken, some veggies, incredible black bread. Then
top it off with cookies and ice cream (300 empty calories).
</P>
<P>
   We return to the deck chairs and take a nap. At 5 p.m., a
companion insists on a particularly low-cal treat: pina coladas
(300 calories) from the poolside bar. We all go along. At 6:30, we
meet for champagne and hors d'oeuvres before the Captain's Dinner.
</P>
<P>
   At 8, we decide we can't disappoint the captain. Our host would
want us to sample everything on the menu, wouldn't he? I indulge in
an orgy of excess: a trio of smoked fish appetizers, Caesar salad,
broiled lobster tails, asparagus spears, another glass of
champagne. Topped off by a huge slice of baked Alaska. Enough
calories for the entire week. The chocolate-lover friend swears
he'll give birth within a few hours. Our waistbands groan in
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Day 7
</P>
<P>
   I drag myself out of bed at 9 a.m. and walk, but my pace is off.
The morning walks have been an easy and delightful way to start the
day, with a breathtaking view of clear skies and endless sea. But
not this day. Too much food and alcohol the day before, and I'm
feeling like an out-of-shape recruit in Army boot camp, stumbling
ahead because the drill sergeant in my head won't let me quit. Five
miles later, I shower and collapse in a deck chair.
</P>
<P>
   Our group is in a funk. Land is nearly on the horizon, and so is
work. I head to the sauna, running into Odette Amyx, who's
practicing tai chi, a mind and body exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Onboard with a group of more than 100 bridge players, she's been
sitting a lot, engrossed in two or three two-hour games every day.
Amyx has been playing bridge since age 12, but only took up tai chi
five years ago at age 75. Along with walking 30 minutes a day
around her high-rise in Houston, tai chi has kept her fit and trim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have gained a little weight on board,'' she
acknowledges, ``but I've done so much walking, maybe not. And if
you're careful for the next week when you get home, it will drop
right off.''
</P>
<P>
   With that encouraging thought, we order martinis (155 calories)
before dinner. Still stuffed from the night before, all of us end
the cruise on a more moderate note: one entree apiece. I settle on
marinated mushrooms Greek style, a salad, and grilled tuna steak,
accompanied by a glass of wine. No dessert.
</P>
<P>
   After a turn or two around the deck, we regretfully acknowledge
the cruise is over and retire to our cabins to mourn and pack.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, I put on the jeans I wore from Atlanta for the
return trip. They don't seem any tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Back on land, it's time to tally the score:
</P>
<P>
   MS Veendam: 50,000 gross tons.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate-lover friend: Five pounds heavier.
</P>
<P>
   Me: Two pounds lighter.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: TENNIS  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  For some reason, patriotism didn't motivate some of the top men to
rearrange their schedules and accommodate a trip to Sydney.
<TEXT>
<P>
   An uninspired Pete Sampras, for one, decided to turn down the
opportunity to win a gold medal, something most athletes dream
about. If Sampras had been watching in Atlanta, he would have seen
a very moved Andre Agassi (who recently withdrew from the Sydney
Games to be with his ailing mother and sister) treat the gold medal
as something every bit as precious as a Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   The top U.S. women are capable of sweeping the medals with
Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams and Monica Seles playing singles
and Serena Williams joining the team for doubles.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   There is a 64-player draw, with 32 pairs in doubles. On July 10,
the top 48 players in the world automatically qualified for the
Olympics, but no country may enter more than three singles players
and one doubles team per men's and women's teams. The
single-elimination tournament will take place on a hard-court
surface.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   All matches are best-of-three sets except for the men's singles
and doubles finals, which are best-of-five-set matches. The winners
of the semifinals will determine the gold and silver medals, while
the losers of the semis will play for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men will have to decide who will play doubles with the
acerbic Jeff Tarango, and the women will have to guard against
overconfidence. The doubles team of Venus and Serena Williams,
which went on a 28-0 streak after the 1999 French Open, looks
dominating even though Serena pulled out of the U.S. Open doubles
because of a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will face a very tough Australian team. Playing in
front of the vocal Aussies, Patrick Rafter and Mark Philippoussis
will have the home-court advantage. Carlos Moya of Spain, Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia, Tim Henman of Britain and Richard Krajicek of
the Netherlands could also make some noise. Davenport is also a
defending gold medal winner but may have to get by one of her own
teammates to return to the podium.

 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11)  
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Popular in Europe but largely off the U.S. radar screen between
Olympic years, track and field continues to be the flagship sport
of the Games. This year there is added spice as Marion Jones
attempts to become the first woman in track and field to win five
gold medals in one Olympics. Cold, windy weather may prevent any
world records.
</P>
<P>
   THE WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   Jones will attempt to win golds at 100 meters, 200 meters, the
long jump, the 400-meter relay and the 1,600-meter relay. The
record for women is four golds won by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the
Netherlands in 1948. Jones' weakest event is the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   Her top competition in the sprints is her fellow American Inger
Miller, whose father, Lennox, won two sprinting medals for Jamaica.
Miller came within a hundredth of a second of defeating Jones in a
100-meter sprint in Stockholm this summer. Otherwise, she has not
seriously threatened her. Last year, after Jones was injured,
Miller won the world championship at 200 meters in 21.77 seconds,
faster than Jones ran all season.
</P>
<P>
   Others who could spoil Jones' sprinting hopes are Merlene Ottey
of Jamaica, Christine Arron of France and Zhanna Pintusevich-Block
of Ukraine. But Jones hasn't lost a sprint final in three years,
and it seems unlikely she will lose the 100 or 200 in Sydney. But
she is hardly the favorite in the long jump. Fiona May of Italy and
Tatyana Kotova of Russia have jumped farther than a struggling
Jones has this season.
</P>
<P>
   The women's pole vault will be contested for the first time in
the Olympics, and Stacy Dragila of the United States is the world
record-holder at 15 feet 2\ inches.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance events, Regina Jacobs and Suzy Favor Hamilton
will attempt to become the first U.S. woman to win the 1,500
meters. But Svetlana Masterkova of Russia, the reigning Olympic
champion, is back to defend her title after surgery on both
Achilles' tendons. This is the only distance longer than 400 meters
where a U.S. man or woman is considered a medal candidate. Maria
Mutola of Mozambique, who lives in Springfield, Ore., will try to
win the 800 meters against the Clark family _ the sisters Hazel
Clark and Joetta Clark-Diggs and their sister-in-law Jearl
Miles-Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The women's marathon should be one of the most engaging events
at the Summer Games, featuring the world record-holder Tegla
Loroupe of Kenya and the defending champion, Fatuma Roba of
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   THE MEN
</P>
<P>
   The luster of the sprints has been dulled by cramping injuries
to Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene that caused both of them to
withdraw during the 200 meters at the Olympic trials in July. But
both sprinters have recovered and are still favored to win two gold
medals apiece. Greene, the world record-holder in the 100 at 9.79
seconds, has regained his dominance on the European circuit and
will anchor the 400-meter relay, which should bring a gold medal.
Barring another injury, Johnson appears unbeatable at 400 meters.
He holds the world record of 43.18 seconds and has lost the event
only three times in 11 years. If the early spring weather
cooperates, Johnson believes he could run 42 seconds at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most redemptive moments of the Sydney Games should
occur in the men's 1,500 meters, where the world record-holder
Hicham Guerrouj of Morocco is heavily favored. Entering the final
lap of the metric mile at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Guerrouj
prepared to make his move into first place, only to tangle with
another runner and fall. He has lost only one race since.
</P>
<P>
   The 800 meters will finally have Wilson Kipketer of Denmark in
the field after a long saga. A native of Kenya, Kipketer moved to
Denmark a decade ago. He would have been favored to win in Atlanta,
but he was not yet a Danish citizen, and he declined to run for
Kenya. He has since set the world record but may not be fully
recovered from a bout of malaria that ruined his 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   In the shot put, the world champion C.J. Hunter, Jones' husband,
may not compete after recent knee surgery. The Dartmouth graduate
Adam Nelson is the favorite.

RARE BONE DISORDER FOUND IN HIV PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An uncommon disorder that destroys bone is turning up with
surprising frequency among people infected with the AIDS virus,
federal researchers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the National Institutes of Health, said
they did not know precisely what was causing the bone destruction
among individuals infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Nor do they know why the disorder, which has led to hip replacement
for some patients, is being detected only now.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder is known as osteonecrosis, or avascular necrosis,
because the death of bone results from a lack of blood supply. The
disorder can be painful and affect bones in many areas. The type
found among people infected with HIV involves the hip, and it
affected 4 percent of such people in a study conducted at the
clinical center of the health institutes, Dr. Joseph Kovacs, one of
the researchers, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about this because it is potentially a
very debilitating problem and we think its prevalence will
increase,'' Kovacs said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was at first thought to be related to anti-HIV drugs
like the protease inhibitors that were first marketed about four
years ago, but the researchers say that so far this link has not
been proved. They presented their report at a meeting of the
Infectious Diseases Society of America in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Also under investigation as a possible cause is the use of
hormones like testosterone and short-term steroids, as well as
cholesterol-lowering drugs, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The bone problem is not related to the degree of immune
deficiency from AIDS or any particular pattern in the use of
anti-HIV drugs. Those affected were more likely than others in the
study to have been involved in weight training and body building.
</P>
<P>
   Osteonecrosis is a different condition from osteoporosis, or
thinning of the bones. Last February, scientists reported that many
infected people had developed osteoporosis as a complication of
anti-HIV therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Osteonecrosis is also different from another recently detected
problem known as lipodystrophy, in which fat is redistributed so
that HIV-infected people develop disfiguring cosmetic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The institutes' researchers first noted the osteonecrosis
problem during a four-day period in May 1999 when two HIV patients
complained of pain deep in the groin. One, a bicycle rider, said
that he felt as if he had pulled something, but that the condition
did not get better with time the way a pulled muscle would. Other
patients limped from pain in the hip and groin.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacs, one of those who detected the first cases, said his team
performed magnetic resonance imaging tests confirming that the pain
resulted from avascular necrosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two cases focused our attention,'' he said, ``because
until then we had never detected a case'' in the 17 years the
institutes' clinical center has cared for HIV-infected patients.
</P>
<P>
   The institutes' doctors then found two more cases. All four
patients needed hip-replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Kovacs said, his team learned that
doctors in Washington, San Francisco and elsewhere were detecting
the bone disorder in a small but increasing number of people with
HIV.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The team checked with the Food and Drug Administration and
learned that it had also noted a small but increasing number of
reported cases of osteonecrosis, Kovacs said. The cases reported to
the FDA were not linked to any product.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacs' team then conducted a study of about two-thirds of the
HIV-infected patients cared for at the health institutes. Of the
339 who volunteered for the study, 15, or 4.4 percent, were found
to have avascular necrosis of one or both hips. None of the 15 had
symptoms, but many had large areas of bone destruction, raising the
possibility that the condition had been detected in an early stage,
Kovacs said.
</P>
<P>
   For purposes of scientific comparison, the team did MRI scans on
118 noninfected volunteers. None had the bone disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The health institutes are conducting larger studies to determine
how many HIV-infected people will develop osteonecrosis and how
many will need surgery for a total hip replacement. The studies are
also aimed at finding what is causing people with HIV to develop
osteonecrosis, with the hope that the answer will lead to
prevention and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that this is going to be getting worse with
time,'' Kovacs said. ``But we're hopeful that it won't be as bad as
we think.''

MARKET INSIGHT: CHECKING UP ON PROGRESS OF HEALTH INSURERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If investors followed the advice of Warren Buffett and bought
stocks only in businesses they understood, the market
capitalization of companies that provide health insurance would
probably be anemic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is because there are so many abbreviations. And jargon.
HMO, PPO, co-pay.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, it is because the $1.2 trillion health care
business is dealing with so many of us that things cannot help but
be complicated.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s, health maintenance organizations were
viewed as a way to combat complexity and keep medical costs under
control. No longer. Health insurance premiums are rising, and big
corporate clients are turning away from managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   James Lane, health benefit analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, took
some time last week to discuss recent changes and trends in the
business. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Health insurance stocks over the last year have certainly
been good investments. Would you review the recent record?
</P>
<P>
   A. Financial results since the beginning of 1999 have been very
strong, but before that there were three years of erratic
performance. That erratic performance probably ended with Humana's
significantly disappointing 1999 results. Those followed a $900
million charge taken by UnitedHealth Group in August 1998, and that
followed Oxford Health's implosion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the sector may be viewed as a tough area is that
even with good financial results, over the last year there have
been more than 30 class action lawsuits filed against these
companies. Those cases are in various stages of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, an index of the 12 stocks we follow is up about 35
percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. After a number of years when costs were under control, health
insurance premiums are again rising at double-digit rates. Aside
from higher drug costs, what is driving up prices?
</P>
<P>
   A. Outside of Medicare or Medicaid, underlying cost trends are
accelerating for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, as a result of the Balanced Budget Act, which reduced
Medicare hospital reimbursements, hospitals are getting less money
from the government. They had to get the money from someone.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the expanding definition of disease is driving up costs.
Employees are demanding coverage for more things today. Products
that once were considered lifestyle drugs are now mandated as
having to be covered.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of state governments have put through mandated benefits,
like mandatory 48-hour hospital stays for vaginal births, and
72-hour stays for Caesarean births. Those are important to have,
but they are inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, litigation, which in some cases is warranted, is
inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many big companies are reacting to premium increases by
turning away from HMOs and toward their own self-funded plans. Will
that trend continue?
</P>
<P>
   A. We believe there is a secular trend of employer groups
contracting with fewer and fewer vendors for all human resource
functions, from health insurance to payroll, workers' compensation
and disability. And we strongly believe that on the health
insurance side there will be a convergence over the next five years
of those players.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which companies do you like as long-term investments?
</P>
<P>
   A. Cigna is the company we think is best positioned to take
advantage of employer groups dealing with fewer health benefit
vendors. It is trading at around $95 now. A year from now we think
it will be a $130 to $135 stock.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth Group, which has had outstanding financial results
the last several quarters, is well positioned for the same secular
trend. However, a lot of the good news is priced into the stock.
</P>
<P>
   And our top pick for the year was First Health Group, a midcap
stock which is virtually unknown but has great operating margins
and a blue-chip client base.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We haven't talked about Aetna, the country's biggest health
insurance company. Last week, the company chose Dr. John Rowe,
chief executive of Mount Sinai NYU Medical Center and Health
System, to run Aetna. Can a hospital administrator be expected to
turn around a business?
</P>
<P>
   A. Jack Rowe is a national health care figure, which Aetna needs
because it is a national whipping boy.
</P>
<P>
   But one person didn't create the problems that Aetna has, and
one person isn't going to solve them. His success or failure at
Aetna will be based on his ability to attract more talented people
to the Aetna organization and blend them in with those who stay.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has a lot of upside potential, but this is going to be a
two-year workout period. We suggest investors hold off until there
is more clarity.
</P>

GORE AND BUSH CAMPAIGN THEME MUSIC: SONGS VIRTUALLY THE SAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Some critics have complained that there's no
difference between the two major political parties. If music can be
any indication, they may be right. Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush have picked nearly identical songs as their theme
music for the presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has chosen ``Let the Day Begin,'' a rock number by The
Call. Bush uses ``We the People,'' which was written for his
campaign by Billy Ray Cyrus. Both are anthems to workers and
strivers, drivers and dreamers, Americans of all stripe, leaving no
one behind or out.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics to the Democrats' tune go like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's to the babies in a brand new world. Here's to the
beauty and the stars. Here's to the travelers on open road. Here's
to the dreamers in the bars. Here's to the teachers in the crowded
rooms. Here's to the workers in the field. Here's to the preachers
of the sacred world. Here's to the drivers on the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   And more: ``Here's to the winners of the human race. Here's to
the losers in the game. Here's to the soldiers of the bitter war.
Here's to the war that bears their name.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Republicans' lyrics?
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmers rise every morning at five. The truckers drive
them 18-wheelers all night. The factory workers, they build it with
pride, 24/7 down the assembly line.'' In its attempt to honor
workers of all sorts, it also says: ``Here's to every salesman on
the telephone line.''
</P>
<P>
   And it comes with a warning: ``We pay the taxes, we pay the
bills, so they better pay attention up on Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns said they wanted to reach the common folk. Both
also officially unveiled their theme songs at their conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore fancies himself a music buff, he was not involved
in the selection. He was busy writing his convention speech when a
handful of aides sat down and systematically evaluated the
available repertoire, including Tina Turner's hit, ``You're Simply
the Best.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Simon, a senior Gore adviser and erstwhile drummer with a
band, said, ``It talks about all corners of society _ and you can
dance to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign did not call The Call in advance to see if Gore
could appropriate the tune, but Michael Been, the composer, has
said in published reports that he has no objection.
</P>
<P>
   Tribute to a Son's Surgeon
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in New Orleans on Thursday night, Gore called a Dr.
David G. Kline to join him on the stage. Gore said vaguely that
``one of our children had a health issue'' and that Kline had come
to the rescue. Kline flitted on and off the stage in the blink of
an eye, without further explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Tracked down behind the stage later, Kline said he was the
neurosurgeon who had operated on Gore's son, Albert, in 1989 after
he had been hit by a car in Baltimore and severely injured. ``After
his acute care there, he needed reconstruction of the nerves in the
right arm,'' said Kline, who is chairman of neurosurgery at
Louisiana State University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Kline used a procedure he pioneered to examine the nerves by
putting electrodes on them. The testing told them that the nerves
were slowly growing back, something that was not otherwise visible.
``If you looked at him clinically, you probably would have gone in
and chopped them out and that would not have been good,'' he said.
``We were able to clean them up, and God and Mother Nature and
Albert Jr. re-grew them.'' Albert, a senior in high school, has
fully recovered and plays vigorous sports.
</P>
<P>
   Kline kept up with the Gores when their oldest daughter,
Karenna, worked as an intern at The Times-Picayune. When Gore aides
called him earlier this week to invite him to the rally in the
French Quarter, Kline was not surprised. But he was when Gore
called out his name to come up on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea about this,'' he said. ``I'm not sure I would
have come if I had known that. I thought it was very unusual. It
was very nice of them to do that. It's hard to talk about, but I'm
very busy and in my own little field, very well known, so I don't
need publicity. But it was very, very nice of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he generally votes Republican and had contributed
money to the Republican Party, but this time he plans to vote for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Big Fund-Raisers for Party
</P>
<P>
   With a new Republican commercial lambasting Gore for attending a
fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in 1996, Gore was asked in
a radio interview Friday what lessons he might have learned from
that experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you learned anything?'' he was asked by WBRZ, the ABC
radio affiliate in Baton Rouge. ``Oh sure,'' Gore responded. ``I
support campaign finance reform, and I think it's obvious to one
and all that it's needed now more than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then headed to two fund-raisers for the Democratic National
Committee in Atlanta, where he planned to raise $1 million. His
first event was a reception with 250 people paying $1,000 each. The
second was a dinner at the home of Ann Cox Chambers, who held a
similar event for Gore after the 1992 convention. Chambers was not
on hand, but the stand-in host was Michael Coles, the cookie heir,
who ran unsuccessfully for Congress against Newt Gingrich in 1998.
About 150 people attended, raising $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is to attend a string of multimillion-dollar fund-raisers
next week. He hits Philadelphia Tuesday, Boston Wednesday and New
York on Thursday for a star-studded gala at Radio City Music Hall.
Total take should be in the $6 million region.

 &HT;    U.S. Sugar cuts 328 jobs in top-to-bottom shake-up
 &HT;    By Jill Rush and Paul Owers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEWISTON, Fla. _ More than 300 workers lost their jobs Friday
at U.S. Sugar Corp. in a top-to-bottom shake-up that comes just one
week after two of Florida's major growers forfeited $17 million in
sugar to repay government loans.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts, described by experts as a sign of the sugar
industry's tough financial times, were announced in morning
meetings with supervisors. The moves will save the company about
$20 million, spokeswoman Judy Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 217 full-time and 110 seasonal workers were let go
immediately, while others will hang on until the Oct. 10 start of
harvest season. The layoffs had been rumored at the Clewiston-based
company for weeks, after an independent consulting firm was hired
to restructure operations and slash spending.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held U.S. Sugar employs about 3,500 full-time and
seasonal workers during the peak of the season. That number is a
combination of citrus and sugar operation employees.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts _ from vice presidents to tractor drivers _ come under
the leadership of newly hired President Robert A. Dolson, a former
utilities executive, who came aboard in July with promises to
substantially cut company costs. Dolson replaced longtime Chief
Executive J. Nelson Fairbanks, who retired after 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dolson said the huge influx of foreign imports and the lowest
sugar prices in 25 years made it necessary to streamline U.S.
Sugar's operation. Prices for domestic sugar contracts closed
Friday at 18.6 cents a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange. Growers say they need at least 19.5 cents to break even.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the only prudent thing to do,'' Dolson said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers losing their jobs will receive one week's salary for
every year they have been with the company, plus accrued vacation
pay. They also will get outplacement assistance and special
consideration in applying for future jobs at U.S. Sugar, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to reveal the identities of the employees
losing their jobs, saying it wanted to ``protect their dignity,''
Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   Clewiston City Manager Jeffery Newell said the cuts, which
amount to nearly 10 percent of the company's work force, will hurt
the town of about 6,400 residents on the west-central shore of Lake
Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a one-company town,'' Newell said. ``Anytime you have
something like this, there will be a ripple. We're holding our
breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know who the individuals are (who lost their jobs),
but this is a small town, and by the end of the weekend we'll
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts come as U.S. Sugar is considering forfeiting 90,000
tons of sugar to the government at the end of this month, when
Department of Agriculture loans come due.
</P>
<P>
   The state's two other major growers, Florida Crystals Corp. of
Palm Beach and Belle Glade-based cooperative Sugar Cane Growers of
Florida, forfeited 47,000 tons collectively last week. Both expect
to forfeit tons more within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar's Sanchez said the company's agriculture department _
which plants, grows, harvests and transports the sugar cane crop _
was hardest-hit, with 119 full-time jobs lost. The company's
agricultural equipment shop, which maintains equipment, lost 33
workers. Forty-one salaried and professional positions also were
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks are not expected to slow down U.S. Sugar's ability
to produce sugar as the new harvest approaches, Sanchez said. The
company expects to produce about 800,000 tons of sugar this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping we identified ways to streamline the operations
and that we'll be as productive, just more efficient,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar also announced Friday it is restructuring operations
into two business units: sugar and citrus. Executive Vice President
James Terrill will manage all sugar-related operations, and
Executive Vice President Bob Buker will manage citrus operations.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first major restructuring in U.S. Sugar's history,
Sanchez said. Last year, about 30 positions were cut in the
company's plastics manufacturing operation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the company closed South Bay Growers, a
vegetable-growing and packaging subsidiary, costing more than 1,000
workers their jobs. Several hundred of those workers later went to
work for U.S. Sugar, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, U.S. Sugar moved to eliminate executive perks
as part of a continuing effort to trim more than $10 million in
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cuts were a corporate jet _ a Cessna Citation _ and
cars used by 22 vice presidents and other top executives.
Additionally, U.S. Sugar stopped the college scholarships it gave
out to the valedictorians of Glades area high schools and cut back
substantially on charitable contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs drew immediate response from competitors and
industry followers, who said more of this type of belt-tightening
is sure to come as the sugar oversupply continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement made when Mr. Fairbanks retired ... was that
they were going to streamline the company and that changes would be

THE WIRED FACE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By MATT RICHTEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Reggie Sioteco is hearing voices in his head.
They help him find you a pair of well-fitting trousers as
efficiently as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sioteco, a manager at a downtown Old Navy clothing store, wears
a headset while frenetically roaming the sales floor. The headset
is connected to a walkie-talkie, which in turn is connected to Neil
in the fitting room. And to B.J. on the sales floor. And to the
entire stock room staff. In fact, to around 100 headphone-bearing
employees all told.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that if a customer asks for, say, an extra-large red
polo shirt, Sioteco or anyone on the sales staff can radio three
floors up to the stockroom to see if one is on hand. A trip
upstairs is saved, time and energy are conserved, and customer
service is maximized _ with one small hiccup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a confusion to customers who think you're talking to
them, but you're not,'' Sioteco said.
</P>
<P>
   So the only drawback of the customer service-maximizing headsets
is that they can be disorienting to customers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang on,'' he said, tuning into the headset. ``One of the
other managers is trying to get a hold of me.''
</P>
<P>
   In this bustling technology nexus by the bay, thoroughly modern
retailers like Old Navy, Gap and Virgin Records are putting
technology to work, enhancing the buying experience by keeping
waiting time to a minimum. With the headsets, employees can stay
close to their posts _ where customers can find them _ instead of
disappearing to another part of the building to confer with
colleagues face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to leave the customer to go ask a question in the
stockroom,'' said Arrickco Bell, manager of the American Eagle
Outfitters store here.
</P>
<P>
   Is that such a problem at American Eagle Outfitters, whose
stockroom is only a few feet away from the compact, single-story
sales floor? Bell said that no distance was too short for
communication over headphones _ he has used his at a range of less
than 10 feet. The deciding factor is the situation, he said, not
the proximity.
</P>
<P>
   Using a radio headset to communicate with someone within
loud-talking distance may seem extreme to the uninitiated, but Bell
said that you have to think of the bigger picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the flagship store,'' he said, explaining that the
headsets also had a symbolic purpose. ``We even use them in our
smaller stores, which have two or three employees.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the rank and file at headset-forward retailers, some
swear by the electronic addenda to their uniforms. Others don't. A
security guard at the Virgin Megastore who would give his name only
as Buddy said he tried wearing the headsets for a while, and
allowed that they had their advantages. But in the end, he said, he
asked his supervisor to relieve him of his, because of the possible
disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll get you killed,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   His point was that if he were to give chase to a thief, the
thief could easily grab the headset and use it to strangle him.
``It's the first thing they'll go for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from risking violent death, some employees say they get
periodic headaches from the constant chatter they hear on the
headsets. And at especially busy times, like weekends, when the
headsets would seem to be most useful, they turn out to be, well,
too useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking to a customer, and I hear in the background:
`Reggie, are you on? Reggie, are you on?''' Sioteco said. He tries
not to answer radio calls, he said, if it would mean interrupting a
customer. He has an ironclad rule that the customer comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the headset come?
</P>
<P>
   Third, he explained _ after the customer and then the employee.
At the moment, three employees were demanding his attention _ two
of them on the headset.
</P>
<P>
   One is calling from the stockroom. The second, a fellow manager,
calls to interrupt the first conversation, saying he needs to chat
with Sioteco privately, which means that Sioteco will have to find
a phone. The third employee is also wearing a headset, but she has
walked over to talk to Scioteco in the flesh, and evidently has
gotten close enough to be eligible for person-to-person contact
wholly unaided by technology _ about a foot away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many conversations,'' he says, laughing at the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   True, but look at the upside: He isn't being strangled to death.
</P>

HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS IN A MITSUBISHI PLANT RESONATE FAR AND WIDE

<P>
   NORMAL, Ill. _ For a short but trying time a few years ago, this
town made national headlines. Horrifying stories had emerged from
the Mitsubishi automobile assembly plant that sits amid the fertile
cornfields here. On its factory floor, some workers contended, some
men felt free to grope women or to ask them to bare their breasts.
Men would display lewd photographs and commonly refer to women in
the crudest of terms, workers said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi was accused by some of its own workers of ignoring _
even encouraging _ such behavior. In 1996, the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission brought the largest harassment
suit in its history against the company, contending that hundreds
of women were victimized, going back to at least 1990. The Rev.
Jesse Jackson later led a consumer boycott, and the National
Organization for Women organized pickets at Mitsubishi dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had vehemently denied the accusations, agreed
in June 1998 to settle the suit by paying $34 million to women who
said they had been harassed. That followed its settlement a year
earlier of a private suit, involving similar accusations, for about
$10 million. The settlements were supposed to have started a new
chapter at Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, which agreed
to take a series of steps to stop harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the headlines have faded, many problems have not. In
interviews, current and former Mitsubishi workers painted a
disturbing portrait of a factory that often remained deeply hostile
toward women. Some workers said harassment remained a serious
problem, despite a ``zero-tolerance'' policy against sexual
harassment that Mitsubishi said it had in place even before the
settlement. Many other workers declined to talk about the issue,
and few employees were willing to speak on the record about life at
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Those who agreed to interviews did say that the most extreme
forms of harassment had apparently ended, and that the number of
incidents had declined sharply. But disturbing events have
continued, according to these employees. One woman, who had been
involved in the government's settlement, was the target of
offensive drawings, a co-worker said. Another woman accused a male
co-worker of tampering with cars on the assembly line just before
they reached her. The rude language continues unabated, employees
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers were also harshly critical of how Mitsubishi
handles complaints, despite the company's promises to make it
easier for employees to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Burmaster is one of several workers who expressed bitter
disappointment. Women still worry about retaliation, she said,
asserting that the department that handles harassment accusations
is largely ineffective. ``We thought we were making a difference,
and we didn't,'' said Burmaster, who is on disability leave from
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsubishi experience resonates far beyond this town. The
size and notoriety of the case could be seen as a test of how
effectively the federal government and private lawsuits can force
change on recalcitrant corporations. If Mitsubishi is unable to
address fundamental tensions at its plant, despite the government's
insistence on specific changes and monitoring, what hope is there
for companies that get less press and government attention?
</P>
<P>
   The question is especially apt now. Last Wednesday, a
three-member panel, chosen by the company and the employment
commission to monitor the plant, issued its second annual report.
The 20-page paper credited the company with making ``commendable
progress.'' Mitsubishi ``has sexual harassment in the plant firmly
under control,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC has also declared victory. ``My sense is that we have
made a dramatic difference,'' said John C. Hendrickson, the lead
lawyer for the commission in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mitsubishi and the commission dismiss naysayers as
unrepresentative of employees at the plant. They say the monitors
held extensive interviews and uncovered no serious problems. Just
30 complaints, sometimes by more than one individual about the same
incident, have been filed with the company from December 1999 to
August of this year, the monitors reported. Six resulted in
recommendations of disciplinary action. The company says a dozen
individuals have made complaints so far this year _ a rate that is
slightly lower than the 22 for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For some employees _ and not just women _ the plant remains a
troubled and uncomfortable place to work. In January, Patricia
Benassi, a lawyer who represented women in the private lawsuit,
filed a suit contending racial discrimination. She now represents
about 40 former and current employees who are black.
</P>
<P>
   The company has ``made it clear that African-Americans were
unwanted and despised,'' the suit contends. It describes instances
of racial taunts, of ``KKK'' being scrawled on walls and of nooses
on display. Because the suit is in mediation, both sides declined
to comment, although Mitsubishi has said that it does not tolerate
harassment of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Why do some employees still describe the plant as an unfriendly
place to work, despite the company's oft-stated policies against
offensive behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Changing any corporate culture, whether in management offices or
on the factory floor, is extraordinarily difficult. Too often,
companies ``fail to follow up,'' said Ellen Bravo, the co-director
of 9 to 5, National Association of Working Women. They fail to
ensure that their workplace no longer fosters or permits offensive
behavior, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of atmosphere where sexual harassment flourishes is
not only where there is a general atmosphere of hostility and
problems,'' she said, ``but where workers do not trust top
management.'' In Mitsubishi's case, Bravo faults the company for
not fully acknowledging the depth of its problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitsubishi says its focus is on the future. ``We're trying
to move on. That was then; this is now,'' said Gloria-Jeanne Davis,
who heads the Mitsubishi plant's opportunity programs department,
which was created in 1996 to oversee complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The company's employees do say that Mitsubishi has put an end to
much of the most blatant harassment. It has fired workers that it
concluded were harassing women, and it is doing what it can to
prevent incidents, according to one employee whose wife had
complained of harassment when she worked there.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials at the plant also say that there has been
significant progress. ``It's definitely changed,'' said Justin
West, the president of United Auto Workers Local 2488, which had
been criticized by employees a few years ago as being slow to
address sexual-harassment concerns. ``Are there still pockets of
some resistance? It goes on,'' he said, but he emphasized that both
the company and the union wanted to put an end to that kind of
behavior.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   What is troubling to some Mitsubishi employees is not that there
are incidents _ few, if any, workplaces are free of them _ but that
they feel as powerless now as they did before the settlement. They
say that investigations are not kept confidential and that little
effort is made to get to the source of problems. After making
complaints, they say, they are often transferred to other areas of
the plant _ where they must learn new, sometimes more difficult,
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi, they contend, focuses only on the most obvious
outbreaks of hostility rather than tackling an environment that may
foster it.
</P>
<P>
   If a company does not address underlying reasons causing trouble
in its workplace, ``you could expect other problems; you could
predict it,'' said Robert Bruno, a labor relations professor at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who has studied the
Mitsubishi plant.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi officials, who defend their handling of complaints,
say women workers are moved permanently to other areas only with
their consent. They denied that there was a systemic problem at the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to have a good-quality product, we have to have a
quality environment,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years since Mitsubishi joined with Chrysler, now
DaimlerChrysler, to plan operations here, the plant has become
integral to life in both Normal and Bloomington, which are known as
the twin cities. Mitsubishi bought out Chrysler's 50 percent stake
in the plant in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi is a leading employer in the area, which also boasts
two universities and the headquarters of State Farm Insurance. Even
after letting go of about 750 workers last year as part of a
downsizing, the plant employs roughly 3,100 people.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs at the plant pay well: even without much overtime, a
line worker, earning about $24 a hour, can easily make $50,000 a
year, which goes far in central Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The twin cities bask in pride as the home of Mitsubishi's only
United States plant. The company figured prominently in a recent
manufacturing exhibit at the McLean County Museum of History in
downtown Bloomington, and the local newspaper, The Pantagraph,
closely covers the company.
</P>
<P>
   The plant produces three Mitsubishi models _ the Eclipse sports
coupe, the Spyder convertible and the Galant sedan _ and two
Chrysler models _ the Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring. It
expects to make a record 228,000 cars this year.
</P>
<P>
   Though a money-loser for most of its history, the plant began
turning a profit last year, according to Richard Gilligan, a former
Ford manager who became chief operating officer at Mitsubishi Motor
Manufacturing of America in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the company's Japanese parent, the Mitsubishi Motors
Corp., came to grips with its own problems: After acknowledging
that it had hidden consumer complaints about defects in its
Japanese-made cars for two decades, Katsuhiko Kawasoe, the chief
executive, said he would resign. DaimlerChrysler, which has agreed
to buy 34 percent of the company, said it would it take a more
active management role.
</P>
<P>
   When the plant opened here in 1988 workers were recruited with
promises of high pay and a Japanese-style team approach to building
cars. The employees, called associates, would work side by side
with managers.
</P>
<P>
   The factory floor, built about two-thirds the typical size for
an auto plant, was intended as a model of efficiency. But employees
also describe it as a cramped, noisy place where one worker may
have to squeeze past another to get into a car or to find tools.
The company uses a production system in which workers depend on one
another to complete a group of tasks in an allotted time.
</P>
<P>
   With production on a record pace, employees routinely work
10-hour shifts, six days a week, with every third Saturday off. The
long hours contribute to difficult working conditions. ``There are
hostilities in the plant,'' said West, the union president.
``People are reaching the boiling point.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employees contend that supervisors encourage workers to
give one another a hard time if they do not keep up _ fomenting
antagonistic comments. ``The management actually pits worker
against worker,'' asserted Larry Lehmann, a former union
representative who no longer works at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan denied that the work environment was unusually hostile.
``This is a tough industry, and it's not for everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As in most other auto plants, women and minorities stand out
here as easy targets. In a sea of Mitsubishi maroon shirts and gray
slacks, the uniform worn by all employees on the factory floor, the
faces are mostly those of white men. About one-fifth of the
employees are women, about the same as before the settlement,
according to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the Mitsubishi plant, however, is the
disappointment that workers feel about working there. Despite the
promises made in the early years by management, employees say they
have little involvement in making important decisions about how the
line will be run. While many expected something different, the jobs
here are typical assembly-line work, monotonous and often
physically grueling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really do feel cheated,'' said Bruno, who surveyed the
work force in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, some women complained of sexual harassment,
but employees said that the atmosphere grew worse over the years,
and that management ignored the accusations. As the complaints
became public, first in the private lawsuit filed by about 30 women
in December 1994 and later as part of the EEOC suit, employees were
sharply divided. The company responded aggressively, busing
thousands of employees to hold a rally in Chicago to protest the
commission's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, many employees deny that there was ever a
significant problem. ``There was a lot of teasing going on,'' said
Kathleen McLouth, who has worked at the plant for 12 years. She
described the accusations of sexual harassment as ``blown way out
of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Some white men who work at the plant complain bitterly that
there is now a double standard, asserting that the company ignores
provocative behavior by women and minorities. One man who spoke
only on condition of anonymity said he thought the plant had gone
too far in catering to their demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at, you know what a factory is all about,'' he
said. ``They're trying to turn it into a Sunday school.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 settlement, which involved nearly 500 women at the
plant, appears to have sharpened some of the resentment. The women
were never identified, but when local newspapers said they received
from $11,000 to as much as $300,000 each, there was heated
speculation about which women had received money and how much.
</P>
<P>
   One woman recalled being barraged by questions. Later, she said,
after being overheard talking to another woman about the
settlement, she became the target of harassment by a male
colleague. She said the man interfered with her work by tampering
with a car before it came down the line and tried to intimidate her
by startling her with loud noises. She said that when she tried to
resolve the matter through the opportunity programs department, she
was told that it was partly her fault for making it known that she
was involved in the settlement. The matter is not yet resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The employment commission did advise women not to talk about the
settlement, and Davis said that the company had a strict policy
forbidding employees to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   The company's handling of complaints is also criticized sharply
by some employees, who say Mitsubishi has not made it any easier to
come forward. They contend that investigations quickly become known
throughout the plant, even if inadvertently. One employee said, for
example, that someone who is accused of harassment is removed from
the assembly line to be interviewed on the very same day the
accuser is removed.
</P>
<P>
   With so little effort to disguise what is happening, ``the line
knows you've narked on him,'' she said. Employees also say that the
union members who participate in the proceedings may be indiscreet,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it strives to keep the proceedings private, and
George F. Galland Jr., a plaintiffs' lawyer in the original suit
who is now a monitor, says that there is little else Mitsubishi can
do. The union says its members also understand the importance of
keeping matters confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the employee dissatisfaction is aimed squarely at the
opportunity programs department. Some of that may be based on
prejudice _ the department is staffed primarily with blacks and has
no white men, which some employees say makes them uncomfortable.
Others say the department routinely fails to get to the bottom of
the problems on the factory floor.
</P>
<P>
   The department ``was a smokescreen,'' said Lehmann, the former
union representative, who faulted the department for not doing more
to investigate certain incidents.
</P>
<P>
   One investigation, into a harassment complaint made by a woman
after the government settlement, also resulted in no action. A man
denied accusations that he had drawn an unflattering picture that
depicted the woman's body as made of dollar bills. The matter was
dropped without much effort to learn what had really happened,
according to an employee who was involved in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, said that the department thoroughly investigated
any complaint, and that when a definitive conclusion could not be
reached, the department continued to monitor the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the inability to get beyond a he-said, she-said
recounting of incidents rests too much on Mitsubishi's reliance on
reports of fellow workers, according to some employees. Not much
can be done if there is no witness to a complaint, they say.
Supervisors provide little of the oversight needed to address
problems brewing on the line, especially now that they face greater
work demands as the plant produces more cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to be there and they turned their back,'' one
employee said. ``Now they're not there.''
</P>
<P>
   When co-workers do see problems, they are often reluctant to
become involved, especially if someone might be fired for his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The three monitors _ a former EEOC official who serves as a
consultant to Mitsubishi, the research director of a Chicago
women's organization, and Galland _ have pushed the company to
address complaints even when they are not clear-cut cases.
</P>
<P>
   Women at the plant say they have few places to turn. The union's
ability to handle complaints is limited; the shop stewards cannot
leave the assembly line to look into problems. That leaves the bulk
of the responsibility with union representatives, each of whom
handles the complaints and concerns of several hundred people. The
representatives are also conflicted, some workers said, because
they must protect the interests of the accuser as well as the
accused. Some employees said the monitors failed to pick up on
these concerns because the process of interviewing employees was
flawed. Some employees who want to be interviewed have to notify a
supervisor about their need to leave the line, thus calling
attention to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Galland said the process offered the confidentiality that
employees wanted. By interviewing employees at random, as well as
those who ask to participate, supervisors have no idea who has
volunteered, he said. Workers can also call him directly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the EEOC stated that there would always be some
discontent at any plant. ``We never expected we were creating an
industrial utopia in Bloomington-Normal,'' said Hendrickson, who
added that he was unaware of any complaints directed to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the monitors, few outsiders are paying much
attention. Lynn Martin, the former Labor Secretary hired by as a
consultant about workplace issues after the government sued
Mitsubishi, and her three-person staff spent two years at
Mitsubishi and were paid $2 million for their efforts. She stopped
checking on the status of her recommendations to create a model
workplace once the settlement agreement was reached, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   NOW and Jackson's group say they have not received complaints.
Patricia Ireland, the president of NOW, said, ``The best sign is
that we have not heard cries from women for help there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some workers at the plant have another interpretation of the
situation. They wonder whether anyone is listening hard enough. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    After flawless liftoff, Atlantis heads for space station linkup
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By MARK CARREAU
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The shuttle Atlantis and its crew of
seven sped toward a weekend rendezvous with the international space
station, following a flawless liftoff early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis was on course to close within 10 miles of the orbital
outpost late today. (SATURDAY)
</P>
<P>
   With shuttle skipper Terry Wilcutt at the controls, Atlantis
will then maneuver gingerly toward an orbital linkup Sunday shortly
before 1 a.m. CDT, and will remain joined for five and possibly six
days.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew plans to equip the station's new Russian-built
Zvezda crew habitat module with an air generation system, a toilet,
exercise devices, fire extinguishers and other gear for the first
resident crew.
</P>
<P>
   American commander Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko
and Sergei Krikalev are to arrive in early November.
</P>
<P>
   Their four-month stay is intended to kick off at least a decade
of continuous occupation as the station is expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Skirting coastal rain showers that threatened to force a launch
scrub, Atlantis roared into orbit from NASA's Kennedy Space Center
at 7:46 a.m. CDT. The shuttle climbed steeply through partly cloudy
skies on a northerly trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the station sailed 220 miles over Eastern Europe,
nearly 7,000 miles in front of the ascending space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcutt's crew includes pilot Scott Altman, flight engineer Rick
Mastracchio, mission specialists Ed Lu, Dan Burbank and two Russian
cosmonauts, Yuri Malenchenko and Boris Morukov.
</P>
<P>
   They will be the first to visit the fledgling outpost since the
July addition of the Russian-built Zvezda module, a 43-foot-long
compartment that furnished the station with living and working
quarters for a resident crew of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it will look visually stunning,'' said Wilcutt.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda joined the Russian Zarya and American Unity modules, the
station's first components, which were linked together by a U.S.
and Russian shuttle crew in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the three modules that currently comprise the
station and an unmanned Russian Progress cargo capsule docked at
one end span 143 feet in length and weigh more than 130,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew plans a near seven-hour spacewalk by Lu and
Malenchenko early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The men will scale the length of the station, connecting
communication and computer cables to the new Zvezda module and
installing an external guidance device called a magnetometer.
</P>
<P>
   The fliers do not plan to float into the orbital outpost to
begin their installation chores until early Tuesday. Altogether,
they plan to unload more than 5,000 pounds of equipment from the
shuttle's cargo hold and the Progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission is fairly tight,'' said NASA's Bill Gerstenmaier,
who chairs the Atlantis mission management team. ``The time line is
full.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers have asked the shuttle crew to conserve as much
electrical power as possible by turning off unneeded shuttle
computers, lighting and other instruments to stretch the docked
activities from five to six days and the total length of the flight
from 11 to 12 days.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the extension will likely be made by the middle of
next week, said Gerstenmaier.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis flight is the first of three shuttle station
supply-and-assembly missions planned before year's end, equaling
all previous U.S. station activity.
</P>
<P>
   Russian economic problems slowed the development of the crucial
Zvezda module by more than two years and brought all major
construction to a halt after the first two modules were mated.

JUDGING THE ALLURE OF TRADABLE FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 10) 
 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no question that exchange-traded funds are a hot
investment. Their assets have nearly doubled this year, to $52.6
billion; so has the number of the offerings, which now exceeds 60,
according to Strategic Insight, a fund consulting firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But are these funds good for investors? ``They're cheap to
manage, tax-efficient and easy to get in and out of,'' said John
Markese, president of the American Association of Individual
Investors in Chicago. ``I can't believe that they won't become a
popular product worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Exchange-traded funds are groups of stocks that generally track
popular market indexes. The first were Standard &AMP; Poor's Depositary
Receipts, known as Spiders, which were created in 1993 by the
American Stock Exchange, where all exchange-traded funds still
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Like stocks, exchange-traded funds can be bought or sold all day
long, bought on margin and sold short. In contrast, mutual funds
are priced only once a day.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who place limit orders, buying or selling at specified
prices to take advantage of intraday price fluctuations, may get
better prices in exchange-traded funds, said Albert Fredman,
professor of finance at California State University in Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   Markese said investors ``might see a lot of index-based mutual
funds moving over into ETF form,'' adding, ``I don't think many
companies will be able to compete without doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard Group, the nation's biggest manager of index mutual
funds, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to add
exchange-traded versions of five of its index mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Managers' costs for exchange-traded funds are lower than for
index mutual funds, which provide services like telephone
operations and, sometimes, branch offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard 500 Index, the best-known index mutual fund,
charges 0.18 percent of assets a year _ razor-thin by mutual fund
standards, but almost double the 0.095 percent for Barclays Global
Investors iShares Trust, an exchange-traded fund that also tracks
the S&AMP;P 500. (Exchange funds based on narrow market segments or
foreign exchanges can have expenses as high as 1.5 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   But exchange-traded funds have another cost: Because they are
traded like stocks, investors must pay brokerage commissions.
Professor Fredman recommended using low-cost online brokers, not
full-service brokers, to execute trades. ``You don't need much
advice when you buy ETF's,'' he said, ``because you don't need to
evaluate the stocks or the managers.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the brokerage costs, Fredman added, an
exchange-traded fund makes more sense for someone who wants to
invest a large sum at one time, instead of making smaller purchases
on a regular basis, as many fund investors do.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term investors who reinvest dividends might be better off
in index mutual funds. Dividends in exchange-traded funds can be
reinvested only if a broker offers the service, and then only for
full shares; sometimes a fee is assessed. Mutual funds, by
contrast, allow dividends to be reinvested in fractional shares,
and the service is generally free.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of exchange funds is tax efficiency. Mutual
funds may have to sell shares to meet investor redemptions,
creating taxable gains typically distributed to investors at
year-end. Because exchange funds are traded in-kind by market
specialists, shares need not be sold to meet redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   The more convenient trading of exchange funds can cut both ways,
Professor Fredman cautioned. ``Because it's so easy to jump in and
out,'' he said, ``people may be tempted to day-trade, and that can
be self-destructive.'' But exchange funds could help index mutual
funds by luring away market timers, thus reducing costs for the
index funds' long-term investors, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end funds, which are also pools of securities that trade
throughout the day, are actively managed and often sell for sharp
discounts or occasionally at premiums to the value of their
underlying assets. By contrast, exchange-traded funds, which
generally track indexes, are priced efficiently and are more tax
efficient.

CHENEY GETS ODD THANK-YOU FOR SHOWING UP IN CONNECTICUT
</HEADLINE>
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTON, Conn. _ How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to
share the stump with a thankless congressional candidate, Dick
Cheney learned on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After coming here to campaign at the request of Mark Nielsen, a
Republican who is running for the House, Cheney, the party's
vice-presidential candidate, found that Nielsen had also chosen
Friday to release a new commercial featuring three men as examples
of honesty and integrity: former President George Bush, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona and Connecticut's own Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
Cheney's Democratic rival.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial even appropriates one of Cheney's stock phrases,
which he repeats at nearly every event, about how he and his
running mate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, will ``restore honor
and integrity to the White House.'' In the commercial, as the
announcer intones, ``Today, when America wants leaders of honesty
and integrity ...,'' President Bush, McCain and Lieberman appear on
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was perhaps unfortunate,'' Nielsen allowed,
explaining that his campaign chose to highlight Lieberman in its
commercial because of the senator's popularity in his home state.
``Joseph Lieberman is from Connecticut. He is the local person
whose reputation everyone from Connecticut understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the reference to Lieberman, Cheney said, ``He can
mention anybody he wants. He ought to run his own campaign so he
wins in Connecticut.'
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day for Cheney. It began with him on the
defensive for not voting in 14 of the 16 state and local elections
held since he moved to Dallas more than four years ago. He did not
even vote in the Texas presidential primary on March 14 that
selected his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Morning News reported on Cheney's skipped votes
today, noting that he missed presidential and state primaries,
runoffs, municipal and school board elections, and votes on
constitutional amendments and a school bond issue. An aide to
Cheney explained that he was out of town for this year's
presidential primary and noted that Bush's main challenger, McCain,
had already dropped out of the race by then.
</P>
<P>
   But the report proved something of an embarrassment to Cheney,
who has spent much of the last three weeks traveling the country
and stressing the importance of local involvement and control of
schools. Asked by reporters what his record said about the
importance of school elections, he said: ``I'm sure they are for
people that are connected with them. But I also traveled a great
deal. Dallas was my base, that's where I lived and was
headquartered. But I was not involved in community affairs very
extensively in Dallas. My focus was on global concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's voting record was seized on by the campaign of Vice
President Al Gore. ``Cheney's poor voting record is just the latest
find that Bush's examination of his background, including his big
oil ties, was not too thorough,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a
spokesman for the Gore campaign. Cheney had been in charge of
helping the Bush campaign screen potential running mates before he
agreed to take on the job himself.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a response from Cheney's communications director,
Dirk Vande Beek. ``Secretary Cheney has voted in every general
federal election for over 20 years,'' he said. ``He is a patriot
and an avid participant in the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who visited a center for the elderly here to deliver a
speech on Medicare reform, did not so much as acknowledge Nielsen's
presence during the event, making no mention of him in his remarks
and not shaking his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Cheney's failure to mention him at all during
today's visit, Nielsen put on a brave face. ``I don't think there's
anything to be read into it,'' he insisted.

 &HT;    Famlies of bonfire victims want answersBy Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the families of two victims of last year's
deadly Texas A&AMP;M bonfire collapse looking on, a state engineering
board ruled Friday that A&AMP;M students broke state law while building
the bonfire _ and warned students not to build an unauthorized
bonfire this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Friday also marked the first time families of those killed and
wounded have publicly criticized the university since the collapse,
which killed 12 people and injured 27. One relative even said that
she was warned by an alumnus against questioning a
university-sponsored investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Professional Engineers voted not to punish
the students who built the bonfire, and decided it needs to
investigate further before deciding whether Texas A&AMP;M or engineers
on campus broke state law.
</P>
<P>
   The families, clearly dissatisfied with the findings of a
special commission that investigated the collapse _ but who didn't
hold individuals responsible _ urged the board to take stronger
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The repeated remarks of 'I didn't know' ... is not
acceptable,'' said Nancy Braus of Hallettsville, whose son,
Dominic, fell 50 feet from the log stack and was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite having ample time and opportunity, no one, no person,
no agency, has stepped forward to voluntarily accept the
consequences for this tragedy,'' said John Breen, an Austin
engineer whose son, Christopher, died in the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said they have not decided whether to take legal
action and will wait to see what the board does. So far, no
lawsuits have been filed as a result of the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Breen, Christopher's brother, said his family remains
``cautiously optimistic that the right thing is going to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone remains quiet, if it is all swept (aside) without
any thorough investigation being done, that's not justice,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which spent months debating whether it had
jurisdiction in the bonfire collapse, remained deeply divided
Friday _ first over whether to act, then over what actions to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all extremely concerned about this situation and want
to do the right thing,'' said board member Kathleen Walker of El
Paso, who steered the meeting and argued vigorously that Texas A&AMP;M
should be subject to state engineering laws for its role in the
bonfire tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The board balked on that issue, which now hinges on whether the
university spent $8,000 or more on Bonfire. If it did, the board
could rule that A&AMP;M also broke the law and punish the university,
including leveling fines of up to $3,000 a day or criminal
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M spokesman Lane Stephenson said the university is awaiting a
formal request from the board and ``will fully cooperate with the
(board) and provide any information to the best of our ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The board voted seven-to-one _ with Danny Perkins of Houston
voting no and James Nichols of Fort Worth abstaining _ that anyone
involved in building the bonfire violated the law by practicing
engineering without a license.
</P>
<P>
   But the board decided against punishing the builders, who were
mostly students and former students, because the university has
assumed control of all future bonfires and promised to have
engineers oversee all aspects of the construction.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a special commission found that students and university
officials created an environment that allowed ``a complex and
dangerous structure ...to be built without adequate physical or
engineering controls.''
</P>
<P>
   The university later called off this year's bonfire, saying the
revered tradition cannot start again until 2002 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Board chairman E.D. ``Dave'' Dorchester said the board wanted to
send a message to A&AMP;M students that the board will take action
against any unauthorized bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can and will issue a cease and desist order,'' he said.
Such an order could be followed with a court injunction, which
would bring criminal penalties if violated.
</P>
<P>
   The board postponed deciding whether members of the school's
engineering department broke the law by not reporting their
concerns about Bonfire's design to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, astonished that such a tragedy happened next to the
state's largest academic engineering department, pushed for a
formal reprimand for the entire department, but the board voted to
let a subcommittee investigate the issue and report back at the
board's next meeting in December.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting left the Braus and the Breen family _ Christopher's
brother Sean and sister Mary also attended _ to wait even longer
for answers they say have not yet come.
</P>
<P>
   Braus, who trembled as she addressed the 9-member board, said an
A&AMP;M alumnus warned her that ``I should not ask questions because
there were very powerful and influential men who were angry at me
for doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Braus said her son, a sophomore, is back at A&AMP;M and remains in
the corps of cadets. Dominic Braus suffered multiple injuries and
nearly lost his right arm when logs fell on top of him.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident, she said she has heard stories of
bonfire-related hazing and drinking from students and parents that
have shocked her.
</P>
<P>
   Braus said her son's medical bills have far outstripped the
family's insurance, even with the money they received from A&AMP;M's
insurance and from the fund set up for bonfire victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want something in writing that protects my son's health,''
Braus said. ``This isn't about a lawsuit, this isn't about money,
it's about what's going to happen to my son the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Breen said he was disappointed that the only action taken
Friday was ``a hypertechnical discussion of whether A&AMP;M spent
$8,000 on this event'' and ``to sanction the students, including my
poor deceased brother as well as the other 11 students who died.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he's frustrated that state authorities seem eager to
talk about future bonfires and forget what happened last fall as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no future for my brother,'' he said. ``We have to
look to the past.''

RUNNING FOR HER COUNTRY, HER PEOPLE, HERSELF
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The biggest Olympic stadium in history rises
up all around you at Homebush Bay: 110,000 seats amid gentle sea
breezes that can become gusts in the time it takes for a sprinter
to lean forward and plant splayed fingers and great expectations
behind a thin white line.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Freeman, Australia's most prominent athlete and most
prominent Aborigine, already knows the place well. She came here
shortly after the stadium was finished in February 1999 with Nick
Bideau, who was formerly her manager, boyfriend and mentor. Bideau
had already researched on which part of the new track the women's
400-meter race would begin at the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lap as fast as you can,'' Bideau remembers saying, before
setting her loose on a first training run at Homebush Bay. ``Right
now there is nobody here, and when you come back there will be
hundreds of cameras, tens of thousands of people but it won't
change what you've got to do, and that's start here and finish
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Off Freeman went in the silence, her long legs gobbling up
meters of track and her heels nearly touching her buttocks at the
end of each enormous and beautifully balanced stride. She has been
running fast enough to win medals and generate headlines since she
was 11 and newspaper reporters in her hometown of Mackay dubbed her
``wonder girl.'' A year before that, her stepfather Bruce Barber, a
white railway guard with no track and field experience, sat on a
log and watched her train and decided that she looked like a future
Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time I ever heard anybody say to me that I
could do it,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   She has now done it twice: first in 1992, when she failed to
advance past the second round of the 400, and again in 1996, when
she advanced past everyone except her much taller French measuring
stick, Marie-Jose Perec, and ended up with the silver medal in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But on the evening of Sept. 25, the date of the 400 final in
Sydney, she will be _ barring injury _ the favorite; both on paper
and in the hearts and minds of the Australian fans whose interest
in and connection with Freeman made this the first session of track
and field to sell out. Freeman has not lost a 400 in more than two
years. She has won the last two world championships in the event,
and she recorded the fastest time since 1998 last month in Monaco:
49.48 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If she holds firm _ despite the pressure, despite the specter of
the diminished but potentially still-dangerous Perec, and despite
some painful recent distractions _ Freeman will become the first
Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal. And if
she wins, she plans to reprise the victory celebration that helped
make her reputation here by carrying both the Australian flag and
the Aboriginal flag; just as she did after striking gold at the
Commonwealth Games in 1994 and at the world championships in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a special time,'' she said recently, a touch
of weariness in her voice. ``A once-in-a-lifetime experience, but
you know what? It's just running. That's my coping strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   A Romance Ends, a Business Thrives  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, 27, has had much to cope with recently: First and
foremost her acrimonious and litigious professional split in May
with Bideau, the former Melbourne sports journalist and track and
field specialist who wrote about Freeman's early exploits and began
dating her in 1990 when he was 30 and she was 17.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bideau who persuaded Freeman to move far south to
Melbourne from Brisbane, the capital of the Australian state of
Queensland in northeastern Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bideau, who in Pygmalionesque fashion, took control of
her training, diet and career and helped her develop from a raw
talent into a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Even after their romance ended in November 1996, he remained her
manager for the next 3 1/2 years. Both developed new relationships.
Bideau became romantically involved with Sonia O'Sullivan, the
Irish middle-distance runner and former world 5,000-meter champion.
Their daughter, Ciara, was born in July last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Freeman married the American Sandy Bodecker,
an executive with Nike, which happens to be her biggest sponsor.
The wedding was less than a month after the world championships in
Seville, Spain, where Freeman defended her 400 title and where
Bodecker and Bideau argued publicly _ not for the first time _
about Freeman's pre-Olympic plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to an authorized 1999 biography of Freeman, ``A
Journey Just Begun,'' Freeman had to intervene to put an end to
that dispute. But while outsiders shook their heads in wonder at
the continued intermingling of fractured relationships and shining
goals, Freeman and Bideau continued working together under the
umbrella of the Melbourne International Track Club, which Bideau
and his business partner Peter Jess formed in the wake of Freeman's
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do a job that we know is bigger than both of
us,'' Bideau said in February when asked how they managed to keep
working together. ``What we're trying to achieve has a much more
far-reaching effect than anything we can possibly do in our lives.
If we can do that working together, and I can help her win it, that
will affect so many people and will be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   That same day in Melbourne, Freeman said, ``It was important for
me to have Nick stay part of my sports group because he is so
passionate. He's passionate about track and field and very good at
understanding the sport and athletes and their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But her words and actions were diverging. Later that month,
Freeman reportedly offered Bideau a lump-sum settlement as part of
a separation offer, one Bideau reportedly refused as far too low.
In May, Freeman announced that she was severing ties with Bideau
and the Melbourne track club, although she did retain the coach
Peter Fortune, who had begun working with her at Bideau's
suggestion in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Bideau and Jess retaliated by issuing a writ in the
Victorian Supreme Court in Australia citing breach of contract and
seeking damages on behalf of the Melbourne International Track Club
and an injunction against anyone else managing Freeman. After a
preliminary hearing, the two parties decided to postpone further
action until after the Olympics in an attempt not to further
disturb Freeman's preparations for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Freeman nor Bideau responded to interview requests last
month to discuss the developments, but Freeman did say: ``I thought
it was time to take a bit of control. I wanted to be in a position
where I could do things for myself. From the time I was young,
things were done for me, and I just let people do it for me. I
didn't know anything different.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Fortune, the coach who is the link between a
successful past and an uncertain future: ``The things that have
happened surprised me, but not totally. There are personal issues,
but I've just been impressed with the way she's picked it up and
run with it. Things are certainly different now. She's much more
self-determining. I think her motivation and focus have never been
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's working on a similar program to what she has done in the
past, but the difference this year is that she's taking much more
of a role in it herself, not so much in devising the program but in
executing it and training at a high level. She's doing it without
being in any way pushed, which maybe in the past was not the
case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But then, if Freeman cannot generate self-motivation with her
own nation preparing to play host to the Games for the first time
in 44 years, when will she ever be a self-starter?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's getting nervous; I'm getting nervous; I have to
control my emotions,'' she said shortly before leaving her training
base in Britain and returning to Australia after spending three
months abroad, including a five-week stop at UCLA with the U.S.
coach John Smith and his group of feisty and talented sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   A Runner, an Australian, an Aborigine  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freeman left Australia to avoid the crush of pre-Olympic
attention and to find the best competition available. Australians
have been watching her closely since she was 16, when, with only
one year of serious training behind her, she ran a leg in the
gold-medal-winning 400-meter relay at the 1990 Commonwealth Games.
By 1997, a street had been named for her in Mackay and she had
become, according to some national polls, the most admired woman in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   But this month, the whole world will be watching her closely,
and outsiders will be intrigued for much the same reason
Australians were first intrigued: Because of her ``Aboriginality.''
Indigenous Australians, who represent approximately 1 percent of
Australia's population of 19 million, remain a distinctly
underprivileged minority here, with markedly shorter life spans and
markedly higher rates of child mortality, unemployment, alcoholism
and criminality.
</P>
<P>
   The tattoo on Freeman's right shoulder might read ``Acosda I'm
free,'' but her family has not escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Norman, was an accomplished rugby league player in
North Queensland who later learned that he had diabetes, developed
a drinking problem and separated from Freeman's mother in 1978 when
Freeman was 5. He died at 53. Freeman's older sister Anne-Marie was
born with cerebral palsy, spent most of her life in an institution
and died of an acute asthma attack at 24.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's maternal grandmother, Alice Mero, was one of thousands
of Aboriginal children taken from their parents by Australian
authorities in the first 60 years of the 20th century and handed
over to foster parents or missions in an attempt to increase their
chances of assimilating into mainstream Australian society.
Aboriginal leaders have been pressing the current government for an
apology for the treatment of what is now known in Australia as
``the stolen generation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the conservative government has refused, limiting itself to
an expression of regret and sparking outrage in some segments of
the Aboriginal community. Though seldom hesitant to discuss the
plight of fellow Aborigines, Freeman has customarily been measured
in her criticism, and she made it clear this year that she had no
intention of heeding increasingly faint calls for an Olympic
boycott or of using her celebrity as a political lever.
</P>
<P>
   She has indicated that she is interested in a career in politics
when her athletic career finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time will come when I can be more instrumental in politics
and national affairs, but not now,'' she said. ``I think I'm
playing a big part just doing what I'm doing on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   This Time, Peaking on Her Own
</P>
<P>
   Freeman has never been a rock-steady performer, her weight and
desire fluctuating with her moods. But she has made a habit of
peaking for major events. She ran the fastest time of her career
and sixth-fastest in history _ 48.63 seconds _ in the last Olympic
final. The difference in Sydney is that Bideau will no longer be
there to help her peak; no longer there to harken back to the hard
work gone by with the words, ``One lap as fast as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, it will be up to Freeman. And if she can do it amid
the din, she knows she will feel a great deal more emotion than she
felt after defending her world title last year and slumping wearily
to the track without bothering with a victory lap as if already
feeling the weight of a nation's Olympic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was already thinking about Sydney,'' she said. ``A world
title gold medal is not my dream. An Olympic gold medal is.''

COMMENTARY: MEMBERSHIP HAS ITS PRIVILEGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can understand the young George W. Bush wanting to dodge
Vietnam, as he did by joining the Texas Air National Guard, aka the
Champagne Unit. But what does it say that the middle-aged Bush was
scared to go to Boston?
</P>
<P>
   Among the lame excuses the Bush campaign offered for its man's
doomed effort to duck presidential debates was that one would take
place adjacent to the John F. Kennedy Library. By this logic,
Democrats should be able to veto any debate in the vicinity of
Reagan National Airport, let alone the Lincoln Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   As you read this, Bush is negotiating the terms of his surrender
to the inevitable _ he always folds in the end. But the weeklong
debate about debates has already told us more about him than we may
learn in any subsequent face-offs with Al Gore over prescription
drug plans. Bush's behavior this week is not an anomaly in either
his personal or political histories, but a ringing affirmation of
both.
</P>
<P>
   The man has always ducked debates. In the primaries this year he
pulled the same stunt on John McCain that he did on Gore _
initially turning down a California debate invitation, then
abruptly accepting it once he thought McCain might not be able to
appear. When Bush ran against Ann Richards for Texas governor in
'94, his campaign turned down a debate invitation from ``Larry King
Live,'' saying it was an unfair venue _ the flip side of this
year's charade, when King's show was deemed an ideal forum by Bush
because it suited his shell game. Even in his '98 re-election race,
against a weak opponent nearly 50 points behind in the polls, Bush
was a debate dodger. As Bill Minutaglio writes in his authoritative
biography, ``First Son,'' the Bush people made sure the single
debate was held in remote El Paso, ``the hardest city to get to in
Texas,'' that it was moderated by one provincial reporter, that all
tough journalists were banned from the TV studio, and that it was
``held on a Friday night in the middle of high school football
season.''
</P>
<P>
   It's never bothered me that Bush couldn't pass a pop quiz on the
names of the leaders of Chechnya, Taiwan, India and Pakistan, but
imagine if in a crisis he had to face these leaders in high-stakes
negotiations _ or debate them in the media court of world opinion.
A guy who at one point ducked verbal fisticuffs with Steve Forbes
and Gary Bauer, and even argued for weeks over the format by which
he'd break bread with a few gay Republicans, doesn't exactly
inspire confidence in any High Noon showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The standard rap on Bush's debate phobia is that he's a
lightweight who doesn't do his homework and is fearful of falling
into malapropisms. But the real issue is more of character than
intelligence. The character he has confirmed in the debate about
debates is twofold: that of an entitled, spoiled brat who wants to
play by his own rules or else take his feather pillow and go home,
and that of a man who wants to avoid confrontation at almost any
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's sense of entitlement was woven into his debate strategy:
he assumed every American could afford cable to watch CNN; he
assumed NBC's ``Meet the Press'' would give him prime-time air if
he showed up without Gore. And why shouldn't he make these
assumptions? As many have chronicled, his name and family
connections have always opened doors for him _ from his admissions
to Andover and Yale to his sponsorship in the oil business to his
participation (with relatively piddling capital) in the sweetheart
partnership that bought and then sold the Texas Rangers for an
eye-popping profit. There's nothing illegal or immoral about this,
but, like Bush's decision to opt for the National Guard over
enlisting in the Air Force (or being drafted) during Vietnam, the
pattern reveals a risk-averse, as well as a charmed, life. Whatever
the opposite of battle-tested is, that's George W. Bush. (Brave
fraternity pranks don't count.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll come to the presidency with a lighter resume than
anybody has in at least a hundred years,'' wrote Nicholas Lemann in
his New Yorker profile of the governor, noting that even
20th-century presidents-come-lately like Warren Harding and John
Kennedy had previously served in public office 21 and 14 years
respectively next to Bush's 6. Or as Ron Reagan Jr. scoffed less
charitably to Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post last month, ``What
is [ Bush's) accomplishment? That he's no longer an obnoxious
drunk?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the fabled personal milestones of Bush's biography _
the private sins and contretemps that are supposed to imbue him
with the hard knocks and rough edges missing from his bland resume
_ wilt under close scrutiny. Much has been made, for instance, of
Bush's swearing off alcohol at age 40 while partying at the
Broadmoor resort in Colorado; media hagiographers have inflated
this exertion of will and spiritual forbearance into a profile in
courage equivalent to wartime derring-do. (So much so that last
week Matt Drudge tried to drum up a scandal by publicizing a 1992
wedding video allegedly depicting the governor falling off the
wagon.)
</P>
<P>
   But by Bush's own account _ which is supported by neutral
witnesses _ he was never a clinical alcoholic, never drank during
the day (or every day), never needed to seek out A.A. or any other
treatment. In other words, he was just an occasionally
out-of-control country-club drinker who quit cold turkey after a
bad hangover _ a far cry from those who face the far harsher
challenge of conquering the crippling disease of alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   It also turns out _ according to recent reportage by The Times'
Nicholas Kristof _ that the one fearless confrontation in Bush's
professional past is also inflated: He did not, as legend has it,
fire John Sununu from his father's administration but only gave
Sununu a stiff talking-to in the days before his departure. It's
enough to make you wonder if all those fruitless rumors about
Bush's alleged cocaine use were not floated by Bush enemies after
all, but by his allies _ just to give him an aura of true grit. As
far as I can discern, the only really daring move in Bush's entire
life was to fire Bobby Valentine as manager of the Texas Rangers _
though Valentine has said that his dismissal took the form of an
hourlong love tap rather than a boot administered by a decisive
leader.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that Bush is a nice guy _ which thus
explains why his greatest successes have been as a cheerleader. He
was not only head cheerleader at Andover, but both in oil and in
baseball served the same function: he was the glad-handing
salesman, the schmoozer, the PR front man who hit up investors for
money and roused the fans while other executives actually made the
crucial business decisions and ran the companies. For that matter,
the less-than-powerful job of Texas governor has also been
described as ``a cheerleader and PR person'' by Paul Rea, a Texas
oil business pal of Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   A cheerleader or PR person, by definition, does not want to get
into debates or risk angry confrontations with anyone. That's why
Bush's juvenile wisecrack this week about The Times' Adam Clymer
was completely in character. Though Bush and his campaign tried to
spin the incident as an example of Trumanesque plain speaking,
Truman would have confronted Clymer as directly as he famously did
The Washington Post's Paul Hume rather than do so accidentally by
stupidly speaking into an open mike.
</P>
<P>
   Is a professional cheerleader the kind of leader we want as
president? In this untroubled time, maybe so. The debate debate
behind him, a resurgently upbeat Bush vowed on Thursday that he
would be nicer than ever and start campaigning more with ``real
people'' in such real places as coffee shops and cafeterias. I
assume by ``real people'' he means those of us who haven't had his
easeful career path, who aren't given a free pass when we dodge our
battles, who have had crises in life greater than one too many at
the Broadmoor. To prove how compassionately he feels toward us all,
Bush has of late taken to symbolizing his tax cut by handing out
dollar bills. This gesture, too, is a striking revelation of
character: here is a guy whose entire biography testifies to the
unassailable proposition that money talks.

 &HT;    McKinney has second thoughts
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like a cosmic reminder that he can't afford to get
comfortable when things are going his way, Vice President Al Gore's
landing in Atlanta on Friday was made a little bumpier by the flap
over Rep. Cynthia McKinney's Web site musings about his ``Negro
tolerance level.''
</P>
<P>
   There is less to say about this story than most, since after a
day of controversy over the comments about Gore in a news release
on her site, the combative congresswoman took them all back in a
statement at the end of the day. She ``will not stand for it,''
McKinney added in her statement, if any Republicans try to use the
words ``attributed'' to her, on her own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Which does at least raise new wrinkles in some old journalistic
questions. It has always been the case that if a politician popped
off an unguarded response to a reporter's question, it was
considered fair game, unless there was some agreement the
conversation was off the record.
</P>
<P>
   Should not the same rules apply when the comments are
unsolicited, and offered up on the Web?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known him to have more than one black person around
him at one time,'' McKinney is quoted as saying in her own press
release. In her later statement she ``disclaimed and retracted''
these comments, which would have been especially incendiary coming
from an Atlanta Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has more than once used Atlanta as a launching pad for
African-American support, delivering a fiery oration from the
pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church on Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday and cheering on a pep rally of Southern African-American
Democrats early in his campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore has the potential to upset Bush in Georgia, as many
Democrats believe, it would come from a bigger-than-expected
African-American turnout such as the state has seen in a couple of
recent elections. Retracted or not, then, McKinney's comments were
hardly what the Gore campaign wanted to deal with on this Atlanta
trip.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney did not retract her support for the suit brought by a
group of African-American Secret Service agents last week, alleging
among other things that Gore had limited the number of black agents
on his detail.
</P>
<P>
   As she noted in her press release, McKinney has had a couple of
high-profile run-ins with the Secret Service when she was not
recognized as a member of Congress by security personnel on visits
to the White House. She has been quoted as saying she was
``absolutely sick and tired of having to have my appearance at the
White House validated by white people.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps anger over the Secret Service issue led to the
incautious posting of the press release on the Web. Perhaps Gore
was just a bystander to the congresswoman's own beef with the
service. In any case, his role has been retracted.
</P>
<P>
   While it may seem outrageous to them, Republicans might heed
McKinney's warning not to use her own words against her. Recall
that it was she who issued one of the most passionate denunciations
of Bill Clinton's behavior, and was one of his most ardent
defenders against impeachment.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: MODERN PENTATHLON  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This sport, which goes back to 600 B.C., tests five skills of a
19th century military courier. To make room for women to compete in
the Olympic pentathlon for the first time, the fields were reduced,
and all 24 men and 24 women had to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The five events were once spread over five days, then four. Now
the Olympic competition will be held over one day, starting at 7:30
a.m. and ending between 5 and 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   In order, the pentathletes fire an air pistol 20 times at a
10-meter target, then fence all 23 opponents with an epee, then
swim 200 meters, then warm-up for 20 minutes on a horse chosen in a
blind draw and ride it over 12 jumps on a 600-meter course.
</P>
<P>
   Then the point scores are totaled and converted via a
decathlon-like table to minutes and seconds. The athletes are
placed in scoring order for the final event, a 3,000-meter
cross-country run. The scoring leader starts first, and the others
follow at intervals determined by their scores. The first to finish
the run wins the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   With a point system operating like track and field's decathlon,
the athletes cannot succeed if they have a weak event. So their
training, difficult at best, becomes longer as they try to upgrade
shaky events.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   Hungary, Russia and France have the best men; Poland, Britain
and Hungary the best women.
</P>
<P>
   The individual favorites are Andrejus Zadneprovskis of Lithuania
(men) and Zsuzsa Voros of Hungary (women). Velizar Iliev and Mary
Beth Larsen-Iagorashvili, both of San Antonio are medal contenders.

<P>
   To say that this year has been difficult for James Goodwin, the
chief executive of the UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, would
be a vast understatement. During his one-year reign, United has
been hit with problems that might well sink many a company.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began in April, with the expiration of its contract
with the Air Line Pilots Association. As negotiations dragged on,
pilots began refusing to work overtime. In June, the union voiced
opposition to UAL's planned merger with U S Airways, concerned that
the deal would jeopardize jobs.
</P>
<P>
   From May through August, United canceled 4,800 flights _ 4
percent of its total _ because of worker shortages, leaving many
passengers stranded in airports for hours, sometimes days, with no
easy routes to their destinations. And weather-related delays
compounded the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Though the airline has reached a tentative pact with its pilots,
it faces another potential contract battle with the International
Association of Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   UAL's convoluted corporate structure has not helped matters,
either. The board includes, in addition to insiders and outside
executives, members chosen by union and nonunion workers. Employees
gained board representation and majority stock ownership in
exchange for pay cuts in a 1994 restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Since reaching a 52-week high of $79 in January, UAL's stock has
plummeted; it closed at $46.63 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to repair United? Money &AMP; Business asked nine
experts who track the airline industry to offer their insights; the
advice ranged from improving customer service to canceling the
pending merger.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's officials are scrambling to repair the damage, and
some relief may be in sight. The pilots agreement is scheduled for
a vote in October, and Matthew Triaca, a spokesman for the airline,
said that the negotiations with the machinists union were well
under way and that he expected an agreement soon on that contract,
too, helping to smooth labor relations and get flights back on
track.
</P>
<P>
   United is also trying to win back customers with bonus
frequent-flier miles. And it is banking that a dose of humility
will help, too. In August, Goodwin appeared in a 30-second
television commercial apologizing for United's poor service. The
company has also taken out full-page ads in newspapers. ``We are
working hard to bring the operation back to normal and restore the
confidence of our customers,'' Triaca said.
</P>
<P>
   That is no easy task. No one envies the challenge Goodwin faces
in turning around United. Here are excerpts from the experts'
comments.
</P>
<P>
   SAM BUTTRICK _ Airline analyst at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the problem is the simple fact that labor has
excessive structural leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Any union group has a large bag of tricks it can rummage through
when it wants to express itself. There has been a statistically
significant change in behavior with the unions, which, while
consistent with the letter of the contract and letter of the law,
enables labor to hold management hostage with tens of thousands of
customers daily _ and that's not right.
</P>
<P>
   We're very concerned by the implications that the recent
tentative agreement has on cockpit crew costs. It is total
capitulation by United Airlines management. I wouldn't have agreed
to a contract that gave the pilots the opportunity to work
overtime, but did not require them to take it on. That leaves
management at the mercy of the pilots' willingness to work
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of all this is that labor has significant leverage
over the quality of the operations. Management needs to be
empowered more, to curtail job actions. Managing labor expectations
is a very tricky part of running an airline.
</P>
<P>
   I don't see an intractable problem with customers. Getting
customers back is very easy. An airline business is a network
business, and United has a terrific network. People use the airline
based on its schedule and network.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at the last decade of on-time performance, United
has never been an on-time airline, yet its financial returns are
near the top of the pack. They should have frequent-flier
inducements, and as fall-season loads decline from summer peaks, we
could see fall sales. They could toy around with some performance
guarantees, providing frequent-flier miles for excessive flight
delays or cancellations. It may be administratively tricky, but it
has an intuitive appeal, providing customers remuneration for
substandard operations.
</P>
<P>
   If they made me CEO, I would call off the U S Airways merger.
It's time for United to focus on getting its own act together,
instead of embarking on highly risky operations with integration
issues that will exceed problems that United saw this summer. I
don't think they're up to the task of merging. If they can't handle
their own pilots, they're not up to the task of acquiring another
airline.
</P>
<P>
   GERALD MEYERS _ Professor of organizational behavior, University
of Michigan Business School.
</P>
<P>
   They've got multiple crises going on: Industrial and human
relations. None of them are easy to solve. The first one that is
amenable to treatment is the public perception crisis. They realize
that what customers, the public and regulators think of them
requires a full-blown, singular, all-out initiative, not just
something that tags onto other things. It requires a crisis team, a
crisis plan.
</P>
<P>
   They need training in the organization on how to deal with this
and experts to help them _ an effort by itself. Included in that
are crisis communications people. They should bring them in. In my
view they need to look at themselves from the outside and say
they're going to do better. They have to see themselves as other
people see them. They're in the public service business. They need
to keep customers happy.
</P>
<P>
   United should drop the ESOP (employee stock ownership plan,
created in the restructuring six years ago). It saved the airline,
but it doesn't have a future. They should let the unions see they
will get their money back and return the company to the managers.
You can't change the management if the unions run it. The board of
directors is useless. They can't talk about cost reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ESOP's have their problems, and very few are successful. It's a
source of the current problems. Once the ESOP is dissolved, the
anger begins to diminish and the internal stuff on who's running
the company will be minimized. You will have a schedule for how the
current problems will be resolved over time and make clear there is
a plan to make the company profitable and distribute the wealth.
United is not a backward airline. They've got awful labor
relations. Once that's solved, they will run a good airline and get
people happy and satisfied and excited.
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA BEYER _ President of Avmark Inc., aviation consultants.
</P>
<P>
   They desperately need to rebuild their image. At this point,
everybody's really mad at them, including me. I fly 30,000 to
40,000 miles a year with them. I think what they desperately need
to do is have better control over delays and send their flight
attendants back to charm school.
</P>
<P>
   If you think about it, the airline is a public utility. The only
thing that makes it different is passenger service. When it's bad,
you want to go to another airline. They need to teach employees
manners. They've lost sight of the service attitude.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't practical about the fact that they are having
delays. If there's a delay, they should take full-fare passengers
off the airplane and rebook them. They need more staff at counters.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT ROACH Jr. _ General vice president of the International
Association of Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   We went to a meeting called by Transportation Secretary Robert
Slater, and the one thing that came out of it was that airline
carriers need to better communicate with passengers.
</P>
<P>
   We need to better use technology to better communicate with
passengers at airports. We should advise customers about delays so
the customer can't scream at an agent. Also, if a customer comes to
an airport to get on an airplane and pushes employees, he should be
arrested and not be allowed to fly that aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   And we should make people aware of what they'll confront when
they start their journey from home. There is anxiety built into
flying: Nervousness, packing, the fear people have of flying. The
airlines need to start educating you when you buy the tickets about
the delays. Expect that weather delays are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Agents should make frequent announcements about reasons for
delays, so people won't get mad. Today, people assume that if
anything happens, it's labor's fault. That's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   We are negotiating an agreement with no efforts to disrupt
United. Once the contract is swiftly resolved, it eases the
tension. We need to move the process very quickly and that's what
we intend to do. Then there will be no unsettled labor issues and
no tension between labor and management. There is not a bad group
of employees creating this. The problems are built into the system.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   PAUL HUDSON _ Executive director, Aviation Consumer Action
Project, an airline-passenger advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is they have a credibility gap with their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   They have not been meeting their schedules. If you know you have
no resources to make the flights, cut back the schedule. If you
can't fly planes on time, change published times to be more
accurate and reflect the reality.
</P>
<P>
   We've petitioned the DOT (Department of Transportation) for a
truth-in-scheduling regulation. For flights that are chronically
delayed, there would be mandatory disclosure of on-time statistics
by fax or telephone. If most people knew the on-time statistics for
a lot of these flights, they wouldn't book them. Flights delayed
over 80 percent of the time would need to be scheduled accurately
or wouldn't be flown. They would cancel the flight until it could
be scheduled to run on time.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of spare airplanes and over-scheduling are the biggest
reasons for chronically delayed flights, not labor disputes or
equipment failures or air traffic control or weather.
</P>
<P>
   They are booking more flights than airplanes and crews can
handle. I also feel that the government should require mandatory
reserves of airplanes and flight crews of 3 percent. They are
operating with less than 1 percent now. They're expecting that 99
percent of pilots will show up and that 99 percent of planes will
be operating.
</P>
<P>
   They should also stop overscheduling, especially at their hub,
Chicago O'Hare. They schedule more airplanes to take off than the
airport has capacity to allow. There's no way that can work.
</P>
<P>
   And stop holding people in the airplane for excessive amounts of
time. This is not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It also burns a lot of fuel and causes other problems. Most
passengers would rather be in the airport for excessive waits.
</P>
<P>
   STEPHEN A. GREYSER _ Professor of marketing and communications
at Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the bottom line for the consumer is that
company behavior is far more important than whatever public
relations or advertising the company may put out. I'm not
suggesting that advertising and public relations are unimportant.
But by themselves, they aren't going to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   What the company has to do is improve the reality of the
customer service, and that includes the scheduling. That includes
handling on the telephones. That includes what happens in the
departure lounge, and that includes what they do by way of keeping
their customers who are in the lounge area informed about the truth
of what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Many times they are not forthcoming in terms of providing
truthful information, especially when there's an opportunity for a
customer to go to another airline. Obviously they hate losing
customers, but that's short-term thinking. The customer will
remember she wasn't treated like a customer.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the schedules is complicated, but thinning out the
schedule is something they can do on their own. The first step is
to reduce the schedule overload. Obviously they've got to fly
planes to make money. But having large numbers of passengers
complaining is not good for the company's image or reality.
</P>
<P>
   They also need more people on telephones handling customer
complaints. From a marketing point of view, they have to focus on
frequent fliers. They have to develop a statement of fulfillable
promises backed up by the commitment at all levels of management
and the airline's operating group, a commitment to true customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   RANDY PETERSEN _ Publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, a
publication for frequent fliers.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing I would do is I would probably resign. I believe
they mishandled the crisis control. They thought that if they
ignored it, it would go away. Customers don't go away anymore. I
would hire another crisis control adviser.
</P>
<P>
   I still fly United and think they're a good airline. But I would
get all the people who work for the company on the same page. I
think I would owe an apology to the employees who were put on the
firing line. I would go back to employees and let them know we let
them down as a company and make them happy. If you take care of
employees, they take care of the customers. There needs to be a lot
of healing. I would spend every single day on the job with my
employees and the people on the front line, not giving away miles
or discounts. Those are pacifiers for passengers. It's just
bribery. That doesn't heal what's wrong with United.
</P>
<P>
   United won't be ready for Thanksgiving or Christmas unless they
heal themselves. The guy who works the checkout counter in Denver,
the customer service manager in San Francisco. Those are the people
I think I would talk to, and as CEO, I would not sleep until I
talked to them all.
</P>
<P>
   SANJAY DHAR _ Professor of marketing, the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   The key thing is getting consumer retrial _ the people who left
United for other airlines. Management should feel confident that
problems are being addressed and share information that the pilots
are the highest paid now and that the operations are being
streamlined.
</P>
<P>
   They should continue using Jim Goodwin but use a more solid
message to say ``these are the things we've done'' and come up with
very tangible things, like what Jacques Nasser did with Ford to
respond to the Bridgestone tire crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin has the biggest stake in the company, and he should
communicate the message. United's top brass have a role to play in
building confidence within their ranks. They should say, `This is a
company you should be proud of.' That's reassurance-building among
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Then you have to get people to try the airline. There could be
financial incentives, or ``buy two fares, get the third one free,''
or a sharp discount for flying on major routes. They could figure
out how to recapture a dominant position in routes lost to other
airlines, and offer a steep discount on those routes. That won't
start a price war, because you're only offering it on specific
routes.
</P>
<P>
   ALFRED KAHN _ Professor emeritus of political economy, Cornell
University, and chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, 1977-78,
during airline deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   United's problems are a result of excessive congestion at
particular airports at particular times. There are two major
remedies that are obvious. First, we have to get some system for
providing air traffic capacity that is sufficient. So the question
is whether the FAA and air traffic control system are ideally set
up to respond to needs for additional capacity. And there have been
various commissions recommending corporatization of control.
</P>
<P>
   The second is correct pricing. Excessive congestion at certain
times and places means you are undercharging. All airlines should
charge more when it's more congested and less when it's not.
Charges for phone calls are different at peak times than in the
middle of the night.

AFTER SOME VICTORIES, BATTERED LABOR FLEXES WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a big month for big labor, judging from the bargaining
results at some of the United States' best-known companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone, the embattled tire maker, averted a
strike earlier this week by granting its 8,000 workers raises that
will run from 15 percent to 30 percent over three years _ raises
that are far above the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   At United Airlines, the 10,500 pilots have won an immediate
raise of 21.5 percent or more to make up for lagging wages, and
that does not include annual wage raises, totaling 16 percent over
four years.
</P>
<P>
   And when 86,000 telephone workers ended their recent two-week
strike at Verizon, formerly known as Bell Atlantic, they boasted
that their contract calls for a 4 percent raise each year for three
years, along with stock options and profit sharing expected to be
worth at least 1.5 percent more a year.
</P>
<P>
   Those workers also made major strides on noneconomic issues _
their contract addresses some of the job stress gnawing at workers
in the new economy by, for example, restricting mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are definitely lucrative contracts,'' said Richard Hurd,
a Cornell University professor of labor and industrial relations.
``They are the result of the good economy and of unions becoming
more sophisticated in their negotiations over the past 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   While it remains unclear whether these settlements will set a
pattern for other contracts, what is clear is that labor unions are
doing much better at the bargaining table than just a few years
ago, when much of corporate America was demanding _ and winning _
major concessions on wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And these newly bargained contracts, along with others
negotiated over the past year at auto, steel and aircraft
companies, show that in many unionized industries wages are
beginning to soar after years of relative stability.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in many contracts in which unions obtain major wage
increases, they compensate by agreeing to concessions on fringe
benefits. But in the latest contracts, there were large increases,
not decreases, in benefits as well. In the Firestone contract
negotiated by the United Steelworkers of America, pensions are to
increase by 22 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders assert that these contracts will serve as a
pattern for other unionized workers _ a notion that worries many
economists and corporate executives, who fear that soaring wages
will spur inflation and cut profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be seeing other impressive union contracts,''
said Richard Bank, director of the AFL-CIO's center for collective
bargaining. ``Union settlements are running higher than they were
several years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But some academics and business leaders said the impressive
gains at Firestone, United and Verizon would not be widely
imitated, because they resulted from one-of-a-kind situations that
forced management to be more generous than they otherwise would
have been.
</P>
<P>
   United was in a poor position to withstand a strike, because
many customers were already seething over its many flight
cancellations and delays in recent months. For Firestone, it was
hard to imagine a worse time to weather a strike, because the
company faces a deep crisis over defective tires and needs to
replace millions of recalled tires as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Several labor experts said that because unions now represent
less than 10 percent of all workers in the private sector, it will
be hard for workers throughout the economy to clinch the large
gains made at Firestone, Verizon and United.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the broader work force, the level of insecurity and
uncertainty that was happening in the economy remains substantially
high, so you will not see an explosion of wage increases as a
result of these contracts,'' said Paul Osterman, a professor of
management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But these contracts are already having undeniable effects.
Pilots at American Airlines are suddenly looking less kindly at
their own tentative agreement, and several of them say they are
more likely to vote it down now that they have seen how much better
United's pilots did than they.
</P>
<P>
   And Delta Air Lines pilots, emboldened by the United contract,
plan to begin demonstrating this week because they are unhappy
about long-stalled efforts to negotiate a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders representing 18,000 workers at Goodyear and 4,000
at Uniroyal said they hoped the Bridgestone/Firestone agreement
would serve as a pattern _ and inspiration _ for them.
</P>
<P>
   The impressive Verizon, Firestone and United contracts have one
thing in common: They were negotiated in heavily unionized
industries. In other words, these contracts show that even though
the percentage of unionized workers in the labor force has declined
steadily for four decades, labor still has a lot of clout in
industries where most workers are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all clear, labor experts say, that the strong wage
gains in steel, autos, rubber and airlines will be imitated by
unionized employees in the public sector or by unionized employees
in industries like health care, where only a small percentage of
the workers are organized.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, unions feel emboldened because the unemployment rate
is near its lowest point in four decades and the economic expansion
keeps breaking records for longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, when unemployment is low, unions do well,
because employers realize that the threat of a strike is more
serious,'' Hurd said. ``In that situation it's much harder for
companies to keep operating by hiring temporary or permanent
replacement workers. And in boom times demand is greater, so
companies have more business to lose.''

</P>
<P>
   All this is a far cry from the 1980s, when workers in heavily
unionized industries like steel, rubber and automobiles took it on
the chin _ and made concessions _ because of recession and a deluge
of imports. And in the 1980s many unions were cowed into submission
after Phelps-Dodge miners, International Paper workers and federal
air traffic controllers lost their jobs when their employers hired
permanent replacement workers.
</P>
<P>
   But unions have developed more sophisticated tactics. Even
though Bridgestone/Firestone used 2,300 replacement workers during
a 10-month strike that began in 1994, the steelworkers union was
able to pressure the company into signing a contract, because union
members picketed tire dealers and speedways across the country to
urge drivers to boycott Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kleiman, one of the steelworkers' chief negotiators,
said another reason that wages are rising strongly in the recent
contracts is a social compact between unions and major industries.
He said unions have agreed to cooperate with companies to help them
cut costs and restructure to make them more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In industries like steel and rubber,'' Kleiman said, ``we're
globally more efficient than the rest of the world, and in return
we demand job security and good wages, and that's the responsible
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the low unemployment rate and booming
economy, unionized workers and nonunion workers alike have received
greater pay increases over the past year or two. Employers have
felt pressure to pay more to keep their employees from jumping to
competing employers.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 36 weeks of this year, according to the Bureau of
National Affairs, a research group, union contracts called for 3.7
percent wage increases in the first year, up from 3.4 percent
during the comparable period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists say there may be little need to worry that
the higher wages will translate into inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having greater productivity growth, so I wouldn't worry
so long as these wage increases come in areas where there is nice
productivity growth,'' said Richard Freeman, a Harvard University
labor economist.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: ARCHERY  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There Is no Robin Hood, no William Tell, not even Geena Davis,
although the actress, a nationally ranked archer, promises to try
again to make the 2004 U.S. Olympic team. There is no Justin Huish
because the flamboyant Californian, a 1996 gold medalist, withdrew
after a marijuana arrest. There are no complicated rules, either,
just a matter of shooting arrows at a target 70 meters away.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   There are four events _ men's and women's individual and team.
In the individual competition, after a round to seed them 1 to 64,
the 64 men and 64 women have head-to-head eliminations. In the
first three rounds, each archer shoots 18 arrows. In the last
three, each shoots 12.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   The target is 4 feet in diameter, with a bull's-eye about 4
inches in diameter. A shot in the bull's-eye is worth 10 points,
with lesser scores for the outer rings. The leading countries have
three men or three women or both, and their scores are added to
determine the team medalists.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Each archer needs a shot or two to determine how strong the wind
is and where it is coming from. A difficult crosswind in expected,
so a perfect score in any round would be astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The strongest nations are South Korea, Italy, Turkey, France
and, as usual, the United States. Medal favorites include Michele
Frangilli of Italy and Lionel Torres of France among the men, and
Lee Eun Kyung of South Korea and Alison Williamson of Britain among
the women. The U.S. women expect a team medal.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the U.S. Senate convenes in 2001, a familiar face will be
missing for the first time in 24 years. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
the four-time senator from New York, is retiring, to be replaced by
either Hillary Clinton or Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's political career seemed to break all the rules. He
was a Democrat in the Nixon administration and leaped into the
Senate from the ambassadorship at the United Nations, never before
having held elective office.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been unusual in another respect as well. He is not
only a professional politician; he is also an influential scholar,
a Harvard social scientist with 18 books to his credit. The Almanac
of American Politics calls him ``the nation's best thinker among
politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers
since Jefferson.'' So as the tributes to a long and successful
political career pour in, the question arises: How does Moynihan
stack up as a scholar? What is his reputation among his academic
peers?
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's reputation at Harvard was not high when he arrived
there in 1966. ``He was viewed by many people ... as little more
than a journalist,'' said Phyllis Keller, a former associate dean
of the faculty at Harvard and a co-author, with the Brandeis
historian Morton Keller, of the forthcoming ``Making Harvard
Modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had a doctorate from Tufts University, Moynihan was
not well trained in methodological techniques, and to this day he
has rarely published in peer-reviewed journals.
</P>
<P>
   In a field where thorough data collection, rigorous statistical
methods and careful scrutiny by one's peers are considered the
hallmarks of quality, Moynihan continues to be spoken of as a
flawed social scientist, even a lightweight. His writings on
poverty and welfare, said Frances Fox Piven, a professor of
political science at the Graduate Center of the City University of
New York, are shoddy. He is ``very clever and very wordy,'' she
argues, but his linguistic facility obscures the fact ``that he has
not made a positive contribution to public understanding of those
topics.'' Piven goes further: Moynihan's flaws as a scholar, in her
view, result in large part from his direct involvement in
government. Ever sensitive, she said, to the way the political
winds were blowing, he tailored his analysis to the politics of the
day and hence produced work that, almost by definition, could not
last.
</P>
<P>
   James Q. Wilson, a professor emeritus of political science at
the University of California, Los Angeles, disagrees. He said that
Moynihan's best books were written after he became a senator.
``Pandemonium,'' his study of ethnic conflict, foreshadowed what
would happen in Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism,
Wilson said. A later book, ``Secrecy,'' called attention to the
problem of government obfuscation, long ignored by political
scientists. ``Pat gets engaged intellectually by getting engaged
with real problems,'' Wilson observes. That doesn't happen ``if you
sit around at the Harvard Faculty Club and argue over parking
spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is not impressed by the methodological rigor so often
praised by academic social scientists. ``Take the 20 best books in
the social sciences written in the last 50 years,'' he said, ``and
hardly any got their start as articles in refereed journals.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan first achieved a scholarly reputation in 1963 when he
wrote ``Beyond the Melting Pot'' with Nathan Glazer. Before
ethnicity and race became major subjects of academic concern, these
authors demonstrated the degree to which New York City's politics
and social life resisted assimilation. William Julius Wilson,
Malcolm Weiner professor of social policy at the Kennedy School of
Harvard University, considers the book a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Of all of Moynihan's social science writings, none have proved
as controversial as his report on the black family. Issued in March
1965, when Moynihan was an assistant secretary of labor in the
Johnson administration, ``The Negro Family: The Case for National
Action'' argued that ``the breakdown of the Negro family has led to
a startling increase in welfare dependency.'' Because the report
urged that federal policy be directed toward strengthening the
family (implying that enhanced welfare payments were not the
solution), it stirred anger among liberals and leftists. And
because Moynihan said that measures that ``would work for most
groups ... will not work here,'' he seemed to be saying that the
problems facing the black family were more intractable than those
facing any other group in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Critics immediately denounced Moynihan's reasoning, data and
recommendations. William Ryan, a psychologist teaching at the
Harvard Medical School, attacked Moynihan's methodology in scathing
tones in The Nation. ``No sophisticated social scientist,'' he
wrote about the idea of family breakdown, ``would rest a broad
concept on such crude and simplistic measures'' as out-of-wedlock
births, for there were many forms the contemporary family could
take. He said that Moynihan's methodology was filled with fantastic
errors that led to stupefying statements. Moynihan had cause and
effect backwards, Ryan argued. It was not the Negro family
structure that caused poverty; it was poverty and racism that
caused the absent-father syndrome that Moynihan mistook for family
instability.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Moynihan's critics point to ``The Negro Family'' as
an example of what can go wrong when a social scientist is too
close to power to appreciate what it means to live in a society
that treats its poor and its minorities as second-class citizens.
The report's analysis and findings, Piven maintains 35 years after
its appearance, are ``not academically valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan did not control for other variables that might explain
welfare dependency, she said. The report received so much
attention, Piven said, not because of its discoveries but because
it fit the backlash conditions of the time. Moynihan may not have
been a conservative, but his report, in her view, paved the way for
the conservative attacks on welfare that followed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet precisely because the Moynihan report broke with the
conventional wisdom of its time, others hail it as a milestone of
social science research. ``Moynihan's study of the relationship
between poverty and family structure,'' William Julius Wilson said,
``provided a framework for social scientific investigation that has
_ especially since the mid-1980s, when research on the black poor
was revived _ influenced research ideas and the development of
research topics across social science disciplines.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson calls Moynihan's focus on the black family prophetic.
Indeed, Moynihan, he said, can be credited with several firsts. He
said that Moynihan was the first social scientist to recognize that
poverty had become primarily an urban problem, and the first to
call attention to the increasing gap between middle-class
African-Americans and those living in inner-city conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Moynihan ranks among the most important social
scientists in the country,'' Wilson continued. ``His writings
provide a model for those who want to use social science research
and knowledge to address issues of public policy.'' Wilson cited
not only ``The Negro Family'' as a major contribution to social
science, but also ``On Understanding Poverty,'' ``Maximum Feasible
Misunderstanding,'' ``The Politics of a Guaranteed Income'' and
``Family and Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, neither Moynihan's lack of social science rigor nor his
involvement in the affairs of the day stands in the way of
achieving first-class status as a social scientist. Quite the
contrary. Wilson says that if one wants to understand real-world
conditions, real-world involvement can only be an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   One way to answer the question of how Moynihan's work should be
judged is to turn to a person a generation behind the controversies
that Moynihan generated in the 1960s. Such a person is Theda
Skocpol, the Victor S. Thomas professor of government at Harvard,
who has no evident personal or professional stake in the politics
of Moynihan's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is truly of a piece,'' Skocpol says, noting that Moynihan's
taste for controversy has influenced both his political and his
academic careers. She describes Moynihan's academic work as quirky.
He can, she comments, go off half-baked with an idea. But at the
same time, he has an extraordinary ability to dramatize an issue by
``putting his finger on things.'' That is what Moynihan did with
his work on the black family, Skocpol said. His report ``performed
a national service in dramatizing the issue of family structure,''
she said. ``Lots of people who care about inequality are fully
aware of its contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Moynihan's work qualify him for tenure in today's Harvard?
She replies that it is a myth that the contemporary university has
no place for public intellectuals. Harvard is full of people who do
important scholarly work and who also stimulate wide public debate,
she said, citing two of her colleagues, the political scientists
Robert Putnam and Michael Sandel. ``Quirkiness can be a plus,''
Skocpol said.
</P>
<P>
   Most scholars make their academic careers by contributing to the
gradual accumulation of new knowledge. But Skocpol said that the
academy also needs ``agenda setters'' and ``question raisers,''
people like Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Three days of brainstorming by the leaders of
virtually all the world's nations ended on Friday night with a
brave attempt to agree on a set of goals for the next millennium,
and common values by which to govern.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy, but more than 150 leaders and few stand-ins
tried to mesh the demands for universal democracy, the rule of law
and human rights, including the equality of women _ all important
to the developed world _ with demands by poor nations for better
balance in the world's economy and more benefits from the rise in
multinational private and public power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will spare no effort to make the United Nations a more
effective instrument for pursuing all of these priorities,'' a
declaration issued on Friday said. ``The fight for development for
all the peoples of the world; the fight against ignorance, poverty
and disease; the fight against injustice; the fight against
violence, terror and crime; and the fight against the degradation
and destruction of our common home.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would expect the eight pages of ambitious pledges to be
fulfilled, any more than citizens of any one country would believe
the same promises from politicians. But the endorsement could not
come from any higher authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the mother of all summits,'' Kishore Mahbubani,
Singapore's ambassador to the United Nations, said. ``It also
confirmed that the U.N. provides the only viable setting to develop
a village council for a global village.''
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of the ceremony usually associated with events like
this, the largest gathering of leaders ever held had in the end
turned into an impromptu forum for examining the performance of the
United Nations. There were many who felt that the organization
could be doing more to help the poor and keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The final round of speeches was its own corrective, illustrating
the passions that still run high on both sides of the divide
between the global north and south, the rich and poor. President
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was the most blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the new millennium, like the last,'' Mugabe said, ``remains
an age of hegemonic empires and conquerors doing the same old
things in new technological ways, remains the age of the master
race, the master economy and the master state, then I am afraid we
in developing countries will have to stand up as a matter of
principle and say, `Not again.'''
</P>
<P>
   President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, taking a more optimistic
line, said he thought that a lot of listening was going on and that
the sheer number of government leaders gave the meeting ``the sort
of weight that it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of that kind of participation,'' Mbeki said in an
interview, ``it becomes possible to say what are the matters around
which there is consensus in the world.'' He sees agreement that all
nations have to deal with the challenge of world poverty and an
understanding ``that in fact the resources and the means are there
within the world economy to deal with this matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a very important conclusion, because it gives
the possibility to say what is the next step we then take,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   That step, he said, is to reform the major international
institutions like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might say this is cynical,'' Mbeki said. ``But if
you look at the almost 60 Chinese whose bodies are found in the
port of Dover in England, they traveled all the way from China,
pushed out of China by poverty. So you can't sit in the United
Kingdom and say we're insulated from poverty in China because it's
far away. When those bodies land at the doorstep, then you know
that you actually are not insulated from that poverty, and unless
you do something about it, it's going to come and get you.''

<P>
   In a week of meetings that brought together not only political
leaders, but also corporate executives, religious figures and all
varieties of protestors, many more events took place outside the
General Assembly hall than in it. Roundtables were held for
government leaders to exchange ideas more informally than in set
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan met dozens of leaders privately to
discuss situations confronting the United Nations around the world.
At least 185 meetings between government leaders took place at U.N.
headquarters, to add to the dozens of others held in hotels and
diplomatic missions around New York.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 nations signed or ratified a total of nearly 300
treaties and conventions. The most attention was given to two
conventions, one that bars children younger than 18 from
participation in armed conflict and the other a prohibition on the
sale or use of children, particularly for sex or pornography.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial to child soldiers killed, wounded, missing or taken
prisoner of war on several continents was announced at Unicef, the
U.N. children's fund. An aluminum slab inscribed with the names of
scores of children, the memorial will travel around the United
States to spread awareness of the more than 300,000 children
thought to be fighting in wars in 30 countries. Many are forcibly
conscripted or abducted by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army in
Uganda, the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka and several groups in
Colombia.

<P>
   Inside the iron fence that separated the people riding in
limousines from the ones who were swamped by the traffic jams that
the motorcades left in their wakes, the U.N. headquarters groaned a
little, too. A '50s-era building with vintage elevators and
escalators designed for 51-member nations whose leaders did not
travel with small armies, the complex is under increasing strain,
now with 189 member nations. It was 188 until this week, when the
flag of Tuvalu (population 10,000) was raised.
</P>
<P>
   New York will have a chance on Sunday to bask in some gratitude
for shouldering the inconvenience and expense of security, blocked
intersections, intrusive motorcades and booked restaurants caused
by all of the high-level caucusing. Windows on both sides of the
Secretariat Building, the glass box on the East River, will be
lighted to spell out, ``Thank you, N.Y.'' Annan, who must not have
left the building very often, thanked New Yorkers on Friday for
their ``courtesy, understanding and support.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the meeting, Therese Gasteau, said on Friday
that 8,000 delegates and 5,500 journalists swelled the ranks of
4,500 Secretariat employees who run the United Nations. The final
tally of leaders included 100 presidents or other heads of state,
including the president of Switzerland, which is not a U.N. member;
47 other government leaders; 3 crown princes; and a few vice
presidents, deputy prime ministers and some ``high ranking
officials,'' a category that included Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials, especially the protocol and security staffs,
have abundant experience handling plumed personalities and ruffled
feathers, so there were no major diplomatic incidents that anyone
could think of on Friday. There was only that glitch in the group
picture, which showed a few more faces than expected. Most of them
were quickly identified as invited extras. But one, now known
officially as ``the interloper,'' was not. Fred Eckhard, Annan's
spokesman, said on Friday that it had been a ``diplomatic''
decision not to name the offending face.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While leaders dined in hotel suites, ballrooms and banquet
rooms, many others, from U.N. officials to New York City police
officers headed for the U.N. cafeteria by way of the lobby
newsstand, where Abdul Zani had doubled his order of publications
from 45 countries. His profits went up, too, to $15,000 from
$10,000 in a normal week.
</P>
<P>
   The run on the cafeteria meant long days for Michael Friend, who
manages most of the building's eating and drinking places, except
for the delegates' dining room. He and his cooks had to show up by
4 a.m. to fire up the breakfast grills, squeeze the oranges and
prepare for the daily attack on the espresso corner.
</P>
<P>
   At the sandwich counter, Elaine Rivas and Nicky Glasgow said
they were making 500 sandwiches a day instead of the usual 200. The
summit meeting ate its way through 3,000 pounds of chicken, 2,000
pounds of beef, 300 pounds of pasta and 100 gallons of tomato
sauce. The cafeteria bought 1,500 extra plates.
</P>
<P>
   Friend took a philosophical approach. ``I think of those people
in their offices moving a pile of papers from one box to another,''
he said of the work going on upstairs compared with his. ``What do
they have to show for it? Here people are happy. People are fed.''

WAY CLEARED TO END EU SANCTIONS ON AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A panel of experts assessing human rights and political
life in Austria cleared the way Friday for the European Union to
lift diplomatic sanctions that were hurriedly imposed last January
after the Austrians allowed a far right party into national
government.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's recommendation to end the sanctions, which it said
had become counterproductive, allows the European Union to wriggle
free of measures that have become an increasing embarrassment. In
particular, the sanctions had threatened to strengthen opposition
to the union and the common European currency in a crucial
referendum on the euro in Denmark this month.
</P>
<P>
   The experts handed their report Friday to President Jacques
Chirac of France, the current holder of the union's rotating
presidency and gave high marks to the Austrian government,
concluding that minorities, refugees and immigrants enjoy the same
_ if not greater _ rights and protections in Austria as elsewhere
in the 15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But the report went some way to saving the face of those, like
Chirac, who advocated the sanctions by criticizing the far-right
Freedom Party, whose admission into government prompted the
measures. Without naming the party's former leader, Joerg Haider,
the report concluded that some Freedom Party members were still
using xenophobic language and bombarding critics with libel suits
in a strategy aimed at silencing them.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the sanctions _ which included boycotts of school
trips, cultural exchanges and military exercises _ were hurriedly
imposed last Jan. 31, there were critics who said the measures went
too far. Although they have amounted to little more than a crimp in
the social life of Austrian ambassadors, they represented an
unparalleled intrusion in the internal affairs of a member country
and they infuriated the Austrians, who have been demanding that
they be rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Although the measures were adopted unanimously by the other
European Union members, enthusiasm for them waned quickly. Only a
few countries, including France, have remained adamant.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the European Commission has tried to broker a
face-saving mechanism for backing down. In July, it appointed a
three-member panel to study Austria's human rights record and the
political nature of the Freedom Party before making a
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, however, has repeatedly refused to say that he would
follow the panel's recommendation. On Friday, he accepted the
report from the panel members _ Jochen Frowein, the director of the
Max Planck Institute in Germany, former President Martti Ahtisaari
of Finland and Marcelino Oreja, a former Spanish government
minister _ but offered no further comment. His spokeswoman,
Catherine Colonna, said he would consult with the other member
countries about what ``follow-up steps to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many experts say the sanctions are now firmly on their
way out. For one thing, even France has good reason to want to get
rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   France has just taken over the rotating six-month presidency of
the European Union and faces a difficult agenda. Both its prestige
and perhaps even the timely expansion of the union are riding on
its ability to broker deals on how to overhaul the union's
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a dozen countries heading toward membership, the
European Union must remake its various bodies, or face paralysis.
With such issues to solve before the end of the year, the French
are unlikely to want to be encouraging tensions between members.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many critics have pointed out that Chirac's
enthusiastic denunciations of Austria's Freedom Party played well
at home, where he is already trying to position himself for the
2002 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   But they did not play well in countries like Denmark, something
of a traditional maverick in the European Union and a nation
already wary of the treatment smaller member countries will receive
from the union. Some experts believe that lifting the boycott _ or
at least indicating that it will end _ could help make sure that
Danes vote to adopt the euro when the issue goes to a referendum on
Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   As the report became public, Austrian officials quickly called
for the sanctions to be lifted. Karl-Heinz Grasser, the Austrian
finance minister and a Freedom Party member, said the decision
should be taken before an informal summit of EU leaders in
Biarritz, France, on Oct. 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were imposed in one day,'' Grasser said of the sanctions.
``They can be lifted swiftly.''
</P>
<P>
   The 45-page report concludes that the sanctions have served a
useful purpose by focusing attention on common values within the
European Union and by pushing the Austrian government to take a
hard look at itself and its behavior.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But is also said the sanction now risked causing more harm than
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the measures adopted by the 14 member states are
maintained, the effect will be counterproductive,'' the report
said. ``The measures have already generated nationalist sentiments
in Austria, above all because they have sometimes been wrongly
interpreted as sanctions against the Austrian people.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Austrian government, which is led by Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel of the conventionally conservative Austrian People's
Party, won praise from the panel for ``fulfilling its commitment to
European values'' by taking concrete steps to fight racism,
xenophobia and anti-Semitism. It noted, for instance, that the new
government had adopted a constitutional amendment to protect
minority languages and culture since coming to power.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far more critical of the Freedom Party, which was led
by Haider until he stepped aside in February, in part to ease the
criticisms of Austria. The report described the party as a
``right-wing populist party with radical elements.''
</P>
<P>
   While the report found that there was ``nothing seriously
objectionable about'' most of the party members who were in
government, it said that some members outside of the government had
used xenophobic, even racist, language and had not been reproached
in any way.

RULING OUT THE BALLOT MEASURE; DECISION FAVORS BUCHANAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RULING OUT BALLOT MEASURE
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Supreme Court says that a November ballot initiative
that would have abolished the state's income tax is
unconstitutional and must be stricken from the ballot. The court
ruled Thursday without comment on the measure, Proposition 107,
which would have phased out income taxes and required voter
approval of any new taxes and fees. It also would have provided for
identification on future ballots of all candidates for federal
office who pledged to eliminate the federal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   A written court order on the ruling is to be handed down later.
Opponents of the measure contended that it would have violated the
requirement that amendments to the state constitution cover only a
single subject. They also warned that because income-tax receipts
account for nearly half the state's budget, passage of the measure
would have resulted in cutbacks in services.
</P>
<P>
   DECISION FAVORS BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan moved a step closer toward the $12.6 million in
federal campaign funds awaiting the Reform party presidential
candidate when the audit staff of the Federal Election Commission
recommended to the six commissioners that he, not his rival, John
Hagelin, get the money. The matter now goes before the
commissioners at a public meeting on Tuesday, when they will vote
on the recommendation. But even then, the loser has the right to
ask the commission to reconsider, a process that could take as many
as 15 days. Distribution of the money could be delayed further if
the loser takes the decision into federal court, as Hagelin said he
intends to do. The Buchanan campaign, meanwhile, was ecstatic.
``It's a huge victory for us,'' Tim Haley, the campaign manager,
said of the staff recommendation. ``We're delighted.''

 &HT;    Tests nearly useless as new drugs pop up
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At first glance, Olympic officials appear to have
taken strides to clean up the Sydney Games. They wheeled out a test
to detect the use of the banned synthetic hormone erythropoietin
(EPO), considered the drug of choice for endurance athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But some medical experts suggest that the test is just the
latest ploy by the International Olympic Committee to cleanse its
image _ and that some athletes have moved on to a new drug, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They harken back four years to Atlanta, when the IOC trumpeted
the latest drug-testing equipment, the high-resolution mass
spectrometer (HRMS). The IOC later ignored the five positive tests
uncovered by the lab machines because it feared that the results
could not withstand legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This test is a farce,'' said Dr. Wade Exum, who recently filed
suit after being dismissed as the U.S. Olympic Committee's director
of drug control administration. ``It will definitely be challenged,
if they have the courage to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, the way this often works,'' Exum said, ``is the IOC will
make an announcement they're going to do something, like the case
in '96, and then not follow through. I guess they assume that it is
going to scare some people off. My speculation is that they'll
probably draw some blood or draw some samples. But as far as (using
results) for a sanctionable offense, I highly doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Yesalis is a Penn State University professor and author
of ``Anabolic Steroids in Sport and Exercise.'' Yesalis dismissed
the EPO test as a public-relations exercise and said that officials
short-circuited the necessary peer-review process to have the test
ready for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense lawyers should be licking their chops on this
one,'' Yesalis said.
</P>
<P>
   The test relies on blood and urine analysis, and both tests must
be positive before any action can be taken. A potential shortcoming
is that the blood test can detect EPO weeks after use, whereas the
urine test is effective only if administered within three days. So,
an athlete could use EPO four days earlier and still beat the
system.
</P>
<P>
   EPO, considered to be a real magic bullet, is thought to be
widely used by athletes in cycling, distance running, swimming and
other endurance sports. The drug increases the red-cell count in
the blood and gives athletes a greater capacity to store oxygen and
therefore increase stamina.
</P>
<P>
   It has been in vogue since the late 1980s, after it was
developed to help people with blood disorders by stimulating bone
marrow to generate more red cells. Two years ago, the drug was at
the heart of the doping scandal that rocked the Tour de France
bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the test for EPO proved effective in Sydney, it might be
too late. While researchers were working up tests for EPO, some
athletes were believed to have turned to artificial hemoglobin
products, which can produce some of the same benefits but are
undetectable. They include Hemopure, a drug similar to EPO
manufactured in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific handlers are so far ahead of the curve looking
at this Hemopure and doing tests on their athletes,'' Yesalis said.
``And then for (IOC president) Juan Antonio Samaranch to come out
and say because of these (EPO) tests that the Sydney Games are
going to be 100 percent clean _ that is the most idiotic statement
on drug use I have heard in 10 years.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At the end of an alley on a nondescript street,
a political consulting firm with the unusual name of Aristotle
International has compiled the nation's largest voter databank _
the names of 150 million Americans registered to vote. And it is
selling them to politicians like George W. Bush, Joe Lieberman and
John McCain in ways that many fear removes too much privacy from
the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   Want to contact Democrats in your district between the ages of
45 and 55, who have Hispanic names, children, own their homes and
annual incomes of more than $75,000? That's possible. What about
sending a personalized letter to female Republicans in a specific
precinct older than 65 who have made campaign contributions and
voted in at least three primaries? ``No problem,'' according to
Aristotle's advertising.
</P>
<P>
   How about reaching the rich? Aristotle's ``Fat Cat'' list of
wealthy donors can turn ``your personal computer into a proven
fund-raising machine'' and ``raise more money than you ever thought
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   With promises like that, it is not surprising Aristotle, which
was started in 1983 by two brothers with the same middle name, has
a client list that reads like a political convention: 45 senators,
more than 200 members of the House, 46 Republican and Democratic
state parties, and most major presidential candidates this year _
except Al Gore, whose campaign said it would not hire any firm
whose practices could jeopardize privacy. (Lieberman used data from
Aristotle while running for the Senate).
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern this election season, when electronic
privacy has become a significant issue, is Aristotle's ability to
help transmit ``pop-up'' campaign ads to specific voters using the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are one of the first companies to fully exploit the use
of technology in the political system,'' said William DalCol, a
Republican strategist and manager of the New York Senate campaign
of Rick Lazio, who is not an Aristotle client ``They found a niche
and exploited it dramatically. They built a database and made it
readily accessible. And they market, market, market it.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, John Aristotle Phillips and Dean
Aristotle Phillips have been collecting voter registration lists
from states, towns and counties. While this information is public,
it is not always easy to obtain _ located on ledgers or computers
in town halls, state office buildings or county courthouses, each
with different hours and different rules of access.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the brothers' persistence, Aristotle now has the
nation's largest repository of registered voters, including their
names, addresses, telephone numbers, party affiliation and
frequency of voting. Aristotle blends this data with information
from other sources _ the Internet and commercial vendors that sell
personal data _ to provide office-seekers with even more detailed
voter profiles, including information about their cars, ethnicity,
incomes, employers and up to 25 other factors.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, for instance, where public voter lists do not
include a person's party affiliation, Aristotle can make that
information available. And any congressional candidate can use
Aristotle's software to find out if any donor has inadvertently
given more than the $1,000 allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In a new development, Aristotle's databank to help place ads for
candidates that pop up _ as if by magic _ on the computer screens
of some voters. In Virginia's primary, for instance, McCain used
Aristotle's focused Internet ads to reach only registered
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For campaigns pressed for time and worried about cash, such
precise information is golden, enabling them to identify potential
supporters and not waste money on the unswayable. In some ways,
Aristotle's voter lists simply provide a more modern version of the
information that office-seekers have long used to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the database, it's the data,'' said Steve Grubbs, a
former official of Steve Forbes' presidential campaign. ``If I want
to talk to retirees in Alabama who are registered to vote, I'd go
to Aristotle first. If I wanted soccer moms who are registered
Republican, I'd go there. Lots of states don't keep their voter
files very well. Aristotle does this a lot better than the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   But, information that makes for good business or could be useful
in politics concerns privacy advocates, especially when it begins
to pull back the curtain of one of the most protected locations in
America, the voting booth. Privacy advocates say this scrutiny of
the electorate has brought a Big Brother aspect to politics and
many fear if citizens feel their privacy is being invaded by voting
and donating to campaigns, they may stop going to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the marriage of the information available on the
Internet with voter lists creates a powerful combination of data
that voters may not even know exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned,'' said Ari Schwartz, an analyst at Center for
Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit group in Washington. ``And we
are especially concerned when we are talking about voting and
citizenship, things that are so central to the election process.''
</P>

<P>
   John Aristotle Phillips, the company's chief executive, declined
to comment, citing a pending public offering of the company's
stock. But he provided access to the company's offices and
promotional literature. At the office, a rah-rah attitude was
pervasive among a youthful staff. A hand-written sign offered a
daily update of voters in the firm's databank: 150,811,187.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing upon information from state motor vehicle registrations,
the Postal Service and Census Bureau, among other sources, the
Aristotle databank includes: a person's age, gender, telephone
number, party affiliation, estimated income, whether he or she
rents or owns a home, has children, hase an ethnic surname, the
make and model of their car, whether they are a campaign donor,
their employer and occupation, and how frequently they vote. A
dollar sign pops up next to the name of a voter identified as a
``Fat Cat.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more voting information becomes electronic, the
ability to cross-match that information with other data and build a
voter profile becomes easier,'' said Robert Arena, a Republican
strategist and webmaster for Bob Dole's presidential campaign in
1996. ``Some people are finding it disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally, if not more, troubling to privacy advocates, is
Aristotle's recent foray into those ads that pop up when voters
surf the Web. Since the ads appear only on computer screens of
potential supporters, they require an intimate knowledge of an
individual's web-surfing habits.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 10 days before the Virginia primary, the McCain
campaign hired Aristotle to transmit Internet ads to registered
Virginia Republicans. When a potential voter went on line, if he
were a positive match with an Aristotle list, a McCain banner ad
would appear inviting him to sign and circulate a McCain petition.
</P>
<P>
   `'It was effective in getting McCain on the ballot,'' said Max
Fose, the campaign's Internet manager. ``We needed to pull out the
stops.'' He said Aristotle charged the campaign about $5,000 for
the project.
</P>
<P>
   In Aristotle's filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for its upcoming stock offering, it says that it takes
data only from public records and ``standard commercially
available'' data sellers. It adds that its database ``does not
contain information of a confidential nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle, which has not set a date for the offering, also said
it does not use ``cookies'' _ that is, hidden tracking systems that
could collect data on the Web behavior of those who see its
clients' ads. Use of such devices, which track Web visits, has been
criticized by privacy advocates and government regulators asa
hidden intrusion into private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Still, privacy concerns have caused two big Internet players to
scuttle plans to enter ventures with Aristotle. In the last year,
both Microsoft and America Online backed away from proposals by
Aristotle to mesh its voter data with information Internet users
give to Microsoft and America Online when registering to go online.
The venture would have made it easier for Aristotle to place
Internet ads and would have provided the company with millions of
e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, America Online and Microsoft each recently enacted
policies prohibiting combining data about voter registration with
information collected from their users. ``There's a backlash when
it comes to mixing this data,'' said Cyrus Krohn, director of
political advertising for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle is also raising eyebrows with its ``California Gold
Rush'' and ``Fat Cat'' databases of campaign donors because it is
illegal to sell Federal Election Commission data, which is
available to the public free, for commercial purposes. But Ian
Sturton, a commission spokesman, said, ``If someone thinks there is
a violation, they can file a complaint.'' No one has. Moreover, to
protect itself, Aristotle requires all candidates using its
services to sign a statement saying they will not use this
information for illegal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal election data cannot be used for commercial purposes,
but no one has ever challenged it,'' said Trevor Potter, a former
Federal Election Commissioner. ``These are some fuzzy areas and no
one has really pushed the edges of it.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to selling contributor lists, Aristotle's gushy
advertising either warms the hearts of politicians looking for cash
or is an example to advocates of campaign finance reform of what is
wrong with the system.
</P>
<P>
   The company's promotional material offers breathless come-ons:
``Hit your opponent in the Wallet! Using FAT CATS, you can ferret
out your adversary's contributors and slam them with a mail piece
explaining why they shouldn't donate money to the other side. This
technique is 100 percent legal and especially effective in rough
primary battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be amazed. . . Upon viewing FAT CATS for the first
time, even the most hardened political pros react with awe. Party
bosses and seasoned politicians who think they `have seen it all'
can't get enough of FAT CATS.''
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle is looking for fat cats, too. The company, whose
revenues doubled from $1.7 million in 1997 to $3.9 million last
year, has yet to turn a profit. High costs _ including a hiring
spree and heavy advertising _ have caused Aristotle to rack up
losses, $1.9 million for 1999 and $2.8 million for the first half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But, Aristotle still wants to sell stock to raise $20 million to
$28 million. How would the money be used? According to its SEC
filings, to get more voter names and more information about them.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: SOFTBALL  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago in Atlanta, the U.S. women's softball team, with
one defeat in the previous 10 years of international competition,
was supposed to win the Olympic gold medal in a walkover. Then the
Australians defeated the United States, 2-1, in 10 innings of an
early round game. Then it was up to the Chinese women to press the
Americans in the gold-medal game. The Americans narrowly avoided an
upset when America's fiery infielder Dot Richardson hit a dramatic
game-ending home run.
</P>
<P>
   During these Olympics, the Americans are still heavily favored _
most think this year's team has more power hitters _ but the
Australians and Chinese have improved, too. They are more
experienced, with each team having farmed out its best players to
foreign professional softball leagues between Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   Eight teams play a round-robin tournament, with the top four
teams advancing to the semifinals followed by the gold-medal game.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   It's nine players a side, no extra outfielder. A game is usually
seven innings, but if the score is still tied after nine innings,
each team starts its turn at bat with a runner at second base.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   It's a pitcher's game even if the hitters wield aluminum bats.
Bunting is common, as is the attempt to chop down on a pitch,
hitting a high-bouncing ground ball that either leads to an infield
hit or bounces over the infield. Games that end 1-0 and 2-1 are
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs are rare, but the Americans have developed some pull
hitters who can go deep, most notably Crystl Bustos and Jen
Brundage.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Fernandez, the top U.S. pitcher who also hit .348 in the
Atlanta Summer Games, is back. Michele Smith is the team's other
premier pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who will turn 39 on Sept. 22, is the oldest member
of the U.S. team. Bustos is a newcomer to the Olympic team, but
some believe she will eventually be the best women's softball
hitter in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians are led by pitcher Tanya Harding _ not that
Tonya Harding _ who did not allow an earned run in 222/3 innings of
work during the Atlanta Games and defeated the Americans.

FEDERAL HIGHWAY SAFETY ADMINISTRATOR CALLS FOR MORE FUNDING AND
REGULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   and KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said Friday that she would ask Congress next week
for additional money and new authority to ferret out safety
problems like the ones that have plagued Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else are we not knowing about, and when don't we know
it?'' said Sue Bailey, who took over the agency Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said that the agency might already have a handful of
reports about some larger problem that has yet to be identified,
and likened the situation to a submarine with only its periscope or
conning tower visible.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone, a Japanese owned company, recalled 6.5
million ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires on Aug. 9 after the
Ford Motor Co. analyzed the tire maker's data on crash reports and
found a pattern of property damage and injury claims dating back at
least to 1997. The tires are suspected of coming apart and
contributing to crashes, and particularly rollover crashes for Ford
Explorer sport utility vehicles, that have been blamed for 88
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   To focus resources on analyzing data and spotting trends, Bailey
said the agency might reallocate internal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who is scheduled to testify before the Senate Commerce
Committee on Tuesday, said she would provide details of her
proposals then, but added, ``I for one think when it comes to
safety, you can't have too much control.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Friday morning, which highway agency spokesmen had
billed in advance as a get-acquainted session, Bailey said, ``I'm
sure that's going to be an inflammatory statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bailey made emphatic statements on several steps
she wants her agency to take, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting the legal right to demand warranty data and
information on recalls abroad from car companies and tire
companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reviewing how the agency gathers and organizes data to spot
trends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Re-writing the standard for tires, which was written 32 years
ago for a generation of tires that is not even produced any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous; we need to change the standard,'' said
Bailey, referring to the standard written for bias-ply tires, which
preceded steel-belted radial tires.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate have tentatively set a budget for the
highway agency of $181.9 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1, compared with an request of $286.5 million. Both figures omit
about $213 million that is allocated by Congress to the agency, but
earmarked by law for grants to state safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   But there is considerable sympathy on Capitol Hill for giving
the agency more money and authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult to find someone who would argue against
it right now,'' said one Republican staff member working for a
committee with jurisdiction over the agency. ``You have to have an
incident like this to remind people of the importance of safety and
of funding agencies responsible, '' said the staff member.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, on Friday, said that to make more new tires available for
owners whose car tires have been recalled, it was extending for a
third week the shutdown of three of its factories that make new
Explorers and Rangers, two models which use the same size tires. In
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ford said the
company had tentatively agreed to bear a portion of the costs of
Firestone's recall.
</P>
<P>
   The recall totals 14.4 million tires, of which 6.5 million were
still believed to be on the road as of Aug. 9, but the traffic
safety agency wants the company to expand the recall by 1.4
million, of which less than half are thought to be still in use.
</P>
<P>
   Internal Ford documents continued to dribble out of the
congressional investigations Friday into what went wrong at
Firestone and Ford. A memo to the Ford corporate offices in May
from a Ford dealership in Saudi Arabia, and distributed Friday by
investigators, raised another theory about why the tires failed:
they were too close to the vehicle's exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ford records, there were at least 19 rollovers in
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis by The New York Times of complaints filed with
regulators in the United States indicates that rear tires more
frequently came apart than front tires, but of those, the failures
are about evenly distributed between the left and right rear tires.
There were 457 complaints involving the rear left tire and 460
involving the rear right tire. Rollovers were somewhat more likely
to be caused by the left rear tire than the right, 83 to 62,
according to the complaint. The exhaust is typically next to the
right rear tire, not the left.
</P>
<P>
   Because Explorers depend on the traction of rear tires to help
avoid rollovers during braking, rear tire failures are especially
critical in sport utility vehicles, and thus perhaps more likely to
be reported to regulators, .
</P>
<P>
   Brook Lindbert, General Motors' engineering director for wheels
and tires, said that a little heat from a vehicle's catalytic
converter and engine radiates downward and is blown back over the
rear wheels because of the vehicle's motion. The exhaust pipe gives
off much less heat and poses little problem, he said, adding that
for rear tires as well as front tires, the overall temperature
outdoors is more important than heat from the vehicle.

DAVID SPINA, THE OPERATING GUY BEHIND THE FLOWING CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>

 By LYNNLEY BROWNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ David A. Spina is the corporate incarnation of a soccer
referee. He is also out to change the rules of the game at the
State Street Corp., the financial services company he heads.
</P>
<P>
   At recent employee meetings, Spina waved yellow ``warning'' and
red ``ejection'' slips at executives who discussed their own
projects instead of the company's larger goals. The message: State
Street cannot tackle its long-held technology and global expansion
plans unless it scraps its own turf battles.
</P>
<P>
   The cards, while playful, nonetheless signaled that Spina, 57,
intends to make some changes at State Street, a 208-year-old
institution that has transformed itself from a conventional bank
into a giant back office for the global investment industry. Since
he became chief executive in May, he has made his first goal clear:
As markets and technology systems become more interconnected, his
company, long marked by divisiveness, must undergo a cultural
makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Spina is irked, for example, that his Canadian subsidiary
recently declined to service the local pension plan of a
multinational client. The branch said the plan was too small, but
the client was an important customer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He winces when he talks about the chaotic Internet strategy he
inherited last fall, when he was chief operations officer.
``Nothing was coordinated,'' he complained. Although State Street
is known as a technology heavyweight, it still offers no Web-based
trading at its money management unit.
</P>
<P>
   Even that unit, State Street Global Advisors, has sought to go
its own way, pushing for a separate listing on Wall Street _ an
idea that the parent company has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like actions, recommendations or plans that aggrandize
one part of the company,'' Spina concluded.
</P>
<P>
   State Street is not a household name. Its customers are mostly
financial institutions, not ordinary investors. But over the last
decade, it has become the nation's second-largest asset custodian,
calculating daily values for nearly one-third of the United States
mutual fund industry, providing accounting for institutional
investors and pension funds and settling securities trades.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it keep track of $6.1 trillion in assets, it is
also the nation's third-largest investment firm, managing assets
worth $729 billion, mostly for pension funds and corporate
retirement plans. Although it sold what little remained of its
commercial banking operations last year, it keeps its bank charter
to provide loans to institutional customers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, State Street's world is not sexy _ it is the
land of the humdrum mechanics behind rocket-fire capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   But the company, which has 17,500 employees around the world,
has enjoyed double-digit annual revenue growth for 22 years. Its
stock performance, though often choppy, has far outpaced gains by
conventional banks lately. The shares have more than doubled since
October, closing on Friday at $122.56.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that you can have a vision that endures a long time
is not valid,'' said Spina, sitting in his dark, wood-paneled
office in downtown Boston, his suspenders splashed with suns, moons
and stars. ``The world changes.''
</P>
<P>
   As its domestic market matures, State Street is looking toward
Europe and Asia, where it is growing but still minor participant
among established competitors.
</P>
<P>
   It also wants to branch out from investment accounting and
processing, its core businesses, into running the entire back
offices of financial firms everywhere. So far, only Pimco, a mutual
fund company in Newport Beach, Calif., has signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is its electronic data, research and trading program,
called Global Link. The company wants this system, which investment
managers use for analyzing global markets and trading securities,
to offer market data from competitors. But the move could undermine
the value of State Street's own market data on the system.
</P>
<P>
   The plans are largely the brainchild of Spina's predecessor,
Marshall N. Carter, who often thumbed his nose at Wall Street by
spending lavishly on technology when analysts urged restraint.
Carter, 60, whose retirement in May jolted analysts, was known as a
visionary who turned his company into an investment services
powerhouse but who stayed out of the daily trenches _ a hands-off
approach that some industry watchers say spawned a divisive
culture.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, as one analyst put it, Spina is ``less
presidential, more collaborative.'' Still, Spina often clashed with
his boss, arguing that the core back-office systems needed as much
investment as showy projects like Global Link.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marsh was ready to issue an order and have others carry it
out,'' mused Spina, whose focus on the back-office business and
love of problem-solving are widely acknowledged to have made him
Carter's successor. ``I might check on how they're carrying it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Manhattan, Spina won an ROTC scholarship to the College
of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. He spent five years in the
Navy, at one point serving as the captain of a patrol boat in
Vietnam. In 1969, he joined State Street as a credit analyst. He
later earned an MBA from Harvard. Regarded by many in the industry
as charming and intellectual, he has never worked at another
company. He is a chocoholic (``What kind? Any kind''), and he does
not do casual Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   State Street has long staked its future on technology. Last
year, it put 20 percent of its $2.3 billion in operating expenses
into high-technology projects like Global Link. But ``the stakes
are higher this time,'' said Michael Mayo, an analyst at CS First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his teamwork initiative, Spina recently created an
inner circle consisting of him and his top three executives. Though
the group has yet to take any major steps, its purpose is to ensure
that the arms of the company know what the feet are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've seen where they have to go,'' said Ruchi Madan, an
analyst at PaineWebber. ``David is the operating guy who makes
things happen, but they face some risk of losing momentum.'' &QL;

HAVE FUND, WILL TRAVEL: AJEEV BHAMAN OF OPPENHEIMER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: India, Britain, Mexico, Brazil, Korea)   (For release Sunday, Sept . 10)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ AJeev Bhaman was born in Bombay, has lived in England
and was educated in the United States. As a teen-ager, he traveled
the world with his father, the captain of a cargo ship. So he is
not fazed by the travel required in his job, running the $170.8
million Oppenheimer Developing Markets fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it exhilarating,'' Bhaman said recently from his office
in the World Trade Center in Manhattan. ``Exploring the differences
and similarities among cultures, new places and new ideas is like
being a detective. I'm sort of like Carmen San Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   His travels have paid off for the fund's investors. The fund
returned 12.73 percent a year, on average, for the three years
through Sept. 1, putting it in first place among diversified
emerging-markets funds, according to Morningstar Inc. Over all, the
group had a 3.84 percent loss, annualized.
</P>
<P>
   He has managed the fund since its inception in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bhaman, 36, uses a bottom-up approach to investing, looking for
companies with strong growth prospects in emerging foreign markets.
He screens the 15,000 companies in that universe down to 1,000 by
focusing on market and industry trends that he thinks will fuel
global growth over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   His most important theme is what he calls ``mass affluence,''
which, he said, is grounded in the increasing consumption of
brand-name, personal-care and disposable products, as well as
appetites for entertainment and education. ``It's incredible how
quickly emerging markets have become consumer-driven economies,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Two more key themes are new technologies and restructuring.
``Most of Eastern Europe is a restructuring story, the
transformation of unprofitable, state-owned enterprises to
cash-generating, profitable companies,'' Bhaman said. ``We think of
it as a caterpillar that metamorphoses into a butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   He owns a mix of value and growth stocks of all sizes in many
industries around the world. The diversification helps reduce the
volatility of emerging markets and other risks like currency
fluctuations. The fund's prospectus says it can hedge its currency,
but he said that is unnecessary for long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   His investments are concentrated in Latin America and in Asia
outside Japan (36.6 percent each) and Eastern Europe (14.7
percent).
</P>
<P>
   To pick the fund's 60 to 80 stocks, Bhaman uses fundamental
research to find what he calls ``good companies with good
businesses at good prices.'' A good company, he said, fits one of
his themes and has returns that exceed its cost of capital over the
next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   A good price lets him double his money in three years, Bhaman
said, or triple it in five.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important is a shareholder-friendly environment. ``The
emerging markets are characterized by poorer shareholder protection
laws than in the developed markets,'' he said, ``and less efficient
information flow.''
</P>
<P>
   He spends at least 25 percent of his time on international
travel, he said, visiting more than 300 companies a year. He talks
to local suppliers, distributors and customers to evaluate whether
a company's stock price reflects what he thinks is its potential.
</P>
<P>
   Many investments are in companies with operations focused on
their home countries, Bhaman said, because they are generally
better aligned with local consumer desires and specific cultural
attributes than large multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   He pores over financial statements, particularly focusing on a
company's free cash flow, as well as its ability to generate cash
in the future. He also reviews returns on equity, assets and
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bhaman sells shares when they become fully valued, or when a
company's fundamentals start to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Bhaman's biggest holding is preferred shares of Embraer SA, of
Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil. The company, which makes small
regional jets and was formerly owned by the government, was
privatized and recapitalized in 1995. He bought shares in March
1998 at 1.76 Brazilian reais, or 97 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company's growth prospects are strong, he said, because more
countries are building smaller airports and need smaller airplanes.
``Smaller planes are better suited for lower-volume traffic at
cost-competitive prices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, shares closed at 11.9 reais, or 10.8 times his
projected earnings of 1.1 per share this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Grupo Televisa, a Mexico City television
broadcaster with a substantial Spanish-language publishing
operation and satellite and cable TV businesses. It is also a
leading supplier of Spanish-language programming to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the level of affluence increases, the company is well
positioned to take advantage of increased advertising rates on
television,'' he said, ``and to sell programming to other parts of
the world at higher prices.'' A recent cost-cutting program, he
added, should increase profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in July 1997 at $30. They closed on Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange at $67.25 each, or 44.8 times his 2000
earnings estimate of $1.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes LG Home Shopping, the larger of two Korean home
shopping networks. Although many Koreans are comfortable using the
Internet, Bhaman said, ``most of the people who buy are women over
30, and TV is a friendlier medium than computers for this group.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, he bought shares at 90,000 won ($81.42) each. On
Friday, they closed at 185,500 won, or 37.1 times his 2000 earnings
projection of 5,000 won a share.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: KEY GAMES FOR SATURDAY, SEPT. 9 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No. 1 Nebraska (1-0) at No. 23 Notre Dame (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, improved this year, held favored Texas A&AMP;M to 255
yards last Saturday. The Irish face a stiffer test against
Nebraska, which rolled up 596 yards (505 rushing) against San Jose
State. Still, coach Bob Davie of Notre Dame, said: ``With a young
quarterback and a not-real-confident defense, I think we showed a
solid foundation on which to build.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Miami (1-0) at No. 15 Washington (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Two offensive powerhouses. Washington's quarterback, Marques
Tuiasosopo, passed for 223 yards and ran for 80 against Idaho and
his teammates collected four fumble recoveries, an interception and
a blocked punt.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Florida State (1-0) at Georgia Tech (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Florida State held Brigham Young to minus-2 yards rushing.
Georgia Tech is better than it showed against Central Florida, when
it needed two touchdown passes in the last four minutes to win.
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech (1-1) at Penn State (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   Penn State rushed for only 6 yards against Southern California
and 30 against Toledo. Tailback Larry Johnson says the fault is in
using the same system for years.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College (0-1) at Army (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Both have struggling offenses. Boston College has better talent.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (0-1) at Rutgers (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, with a creative passing game, may become a decent team
yet.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 Georgia (1-0) at South Carolina (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina ended its 21-game losing streak just in time.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt (0-1) at No. 13 Alabama (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Alabama couldn't handle UCLA's blitz. This should be more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (1-0) at No. 19 Mississippi (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Auburn has the weapons to test Mississippi's quick-strike
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri (1-0) at No. 17 Clemson (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   With Woodrow Dantzler's passing, Clemson could reach 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   Oregon (1-0) at No. 5 Wisconsin (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, with 26 players serving NCAA suspensions, must step
up against an aggressive defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rice (1-0) at No. 3 Michigan (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   John Navarre, who had never taken a college snap, threw four
touchdown passes for Michigan against Bowling Green.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall (1-0) at No. 24 Michigan State (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   This figures to be the end of Marshall's 18-game winning streak,
the best in Division I-AA.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse (1-0) at Cincinnati (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse's running game should thrive, even after fullback Kyle
Johnson's surgery for a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   FAR WEST
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (0-1) at No. 11 Southern California (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado offense, which gained 532 yards against Colorado
State, faces a Trojan defense that held Penn State to 10 first
downs.
</P>
<P>
   No. 18 Ohio State (1-0) at Arizona (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's defense (four touchdowns against Fresno State)
appears too strong.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State (0-1) at No. 16 UCLA (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McCann is UCLA's quarterback because Cory Paus separated
his throwing shoulder on the first play against Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   No. 22 Texas Christian 0-0 at Nevada (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   More woes for Nevada, which totaled minus-3 yards rushing
against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   No. 21 Illinois (1-0) at San Diego State (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Should be easy for Illinois, which stopped Middle Tennessee
three times inside the 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   MISMATCHES
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana-Lafayette (0-1) at No. 6 Texas (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   Texas, with Chris Simms or Major Applewhite or both at
quarterback, is a six-touchdown favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Middle Tennessee (0-1) at No. 8 Florida (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Florida was so mediocre against Ball State that the Gator fans
booed their team, leading coach Steve Spurrier to say, ``We won't
be too full of ourselves after this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent State (0-1) at No. 14 Purdue (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Purdue held Central Michigan to 161 yards and could do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas State (0-1) at No. 20 Oklahoma (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   In routing Texas, El Paso, Oklahoma turned seven turnovers into
five touchdowns.

 &HT;    The children of the civil rights movement
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ericka Brown-Abram says she had a typical childhood.
Her mother's friends were killed in police shootouts. Her family
lived under FBI surveillance. She was constantly shadowed by a
bodyguard, even when she ran to the neighborhood ice cream truck.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Abram, 30, the daughter of a Black Panther Party leader,
grew up in a communal home and attended a Panther-run grade school
where students read Mao Tse-tung's Little Red Book.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people had this swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,''
she says. ``But when you're a child it all seemed normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was normal, though, about growing up in the 1950s and
'60s as a child of the civil rights movement. The leaders of the
movement led dramatic lives _ and so did their kids. These children
of the struggle _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. Some
are still grappling with their parents' legacies.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights movement unleashed waves of change that are
still being felt, says Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
author of two books on the movement. The protest that paralyzed
Seattle this year during a World Trade Organization meeting, the
Million Man March on Washington, even freedom struggles abroad _
all owe a debt to the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were singing `We Shall Overcome' when the Berlin Wall
came down,'' Branch says. ``They were singing it in Prague. They
were certainly under its influence in South Africa when it became
democratic. Even in China, Tiananmen Square was more or less
modeled on a sit-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who joined the movement still miss the adrenalin rush of
being a part of something so monumental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was invigorating,'' says Elaine Brown, Brown-Abram's
mother. ``It made life important. It made it bigger than you. Even
the notion of dying for something bigger than you was far more
powerful than living out a life of quiet desperation. I was the
happiest in my life when I was in the Black Panther Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the activists didn't commit as vigorously to parenting
as they did to protesting. Changing diapers didn't hold the same
allure as changing the world. Some of the leaders, in fact, simply
weren't suited for parenthood.

   ``I think the movement had a number of people who, by
conventional definitions, were crazy,'' says Clayborne Carson, a
Stanford University professor who has written about the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
``But those were the people who saw through conventional truths and
saw other possibilities.''

<P>
   THE CHOSEN ONE: WARITH DEEN MOHAMMED
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Muhammad Sr., a frail asthmatic with only a fourth-grade
education, could make hardened ex-convicts and tough street
hustlers tremble in his presence. The founder of the Nation of
Islam, he spread the message that white people are ``blue-eyed
devils.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his children feared him. They thought he had divine powers,
says Warith Deen Mohammed, his youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be afraid to think in extremes that would anger
him,'' he says. ``We would be afraid that he would hear our
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Muhammad frightened much of America as well. He
personified black rage. While the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
preached nonviolence and integration, Muhammad preached ``an eye
for an eye'' and racial separation.
</P>
<P>
   Warith Deen Mohammed, now 67, was initially groomed to succeed
his father. Born in Chicago, the youngest son of Muhammad's eight
children, he was the chosen one, the heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was a teenager, however, he had begun to doubt
his father's faith. Tutored by orthodox Muslims from the Middle
East, he had become a student of the Koran. He saw no mention of
``blue-eyed devils'' or his father in the holy text. When he shared
his doubts with his father, the elder Muhammad told his son that
his way was the way. End of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   But Warith Deen continued to question his father's beliefs. He
became even more disillusioned when he learned that Nation of Islam
members had been beaten and even killed for questioning his father.
</P>
<P>
   Warith Deen publicly opposed his father. And by 1964, when he
became close friends with one of his father's enemies, Malcolm X
(who had left the Nation of Islam that year after embracing
orthodox Islam), his father banned him from the movement.
</P>
<P>
   After Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, Warith Deen lived
virtually underground. The FBI tapped his telephones. He worked as
a baker, welder and cabdriver to make ends meet. And he constantly
received death threats from anonymous callers _ one of whose voice
he recognized. It was his older brother, Elijah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood why,'' says Mohammed, who has since reconciled
with his brother. ``We were all trained to be prepared to sacrifice
everything to protect the honorable Elijah Muhammad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Warith Deen Mohammed eventually became the chosen one again.
In 1975, his father died and the Nation of Islam, reeling from
internal blood feuds and corrupt leadership, picked him to be its
leader. He accepted and set about reforming the group. He removed
its anti-white theology, changed its name to the Muslim American
Society and declared it part of the worldwide Sunni Islamic
community. (Louis Farrakhan broke from Mohammed three years later
to form another version of the Nation).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to stop calling white folks the devil,
because there's some black devils, too,'' Mohammed said after
taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Warith Deen Mohammed is a Muslim elder statesman. He has
met with President Clinton and Pope John Paul II and was the first
Muslim to open the U.S. Senate with a prayer. He still lives in
Chicago, with his fourth wife and three youngest children (he has
nine altogether).
</P>
<P>
   And he has a new appreciation for his father. Elijah Muhammad
wasn't a racist, he says, but rather an uneducated man who patched
together a religion that taught black people self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He preached separation of the races, but he was not racist in
that ugly sense,'' Mohammed says. ``He hated the evils of white
people. He was not a racist. He was a nation builder.''
</P>
<P>
   LIFE WITHOUT FATHER: CHEVARA ORRIN AND BACARDI JACKSON
</P>
<P>
   Chevara Orrin has her father's high cheekbones, caramel-colored
complexion and rapid-fire speech. She also has nothing but contempt
for him as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Orrin, 32, is the daughter of the Rev. James Bevel, a key aide
to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and a legendary leader of the
student sit-in and Freedom Ride movements. He also is the man who
persuaded Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan to hold the 1995
Million Man March on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Bevel is no hero to Orrin or her sister, Bacardi Jackson,
29. Both say that Bevel never provided for them while they endured
a childhood marked by homelessness, welfare and hand-me-down
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know my favorite food,'' Orrin says. ``He doesn't
know where I went to high school. He doesn't know what my college
degree is in. He doesn't even know when I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Orrin's mother, Susanne Jackson, met Bevel in 1965 in Chicago.
He was working with King in the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference; she was an anti-apartheid activist. They worked
together as anti-war activists and had an on-again, off-again
six-year relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Bevel offered to raise Orrin, but Jackson didn't think he would
be a responsible parent. So Jackson raised her daughters as a
single mother, working several jobs at once but still having to go
on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi Jackson says her father would visit occasionally but
showed no interest in her personal life. Instead, she says, he
seemed interested only in lecturing her about his greatness,
frequently comparing himself to Jesus and Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   Bevel has long been known as one of the movement's most
eccentric characters. ``He's like an Old Testament prophet,''
author Taylor Branch says. ``He hears voices. Sometimes they are
the voices of genius and sometimes they are the voices of lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1999 memoir, ``Walking With the Wind,'' Rep. John Lewis
(D-Ga.) wrote that Bevel changed after King was assassinated in
1968. According to Lewis, the SCLC barred Bevel in 1970 after it
heard that he had locked himself in a hotel room with a group of
Spelman College students, declared himself a prophet, urinated in a
glass and ordered them to drink its contents to prove their
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bevel had so much hope, so much optimism,'' Lewis says. ``I
think it was too much for him and many others when King died.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi Jackson finds great irony in her father's leadership
role in the Million Man March. She estimates that he has at least
16 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never said he was sorry once,'' she says. ``He's told a
million black men that they need to atone and take responsibility
for their families, but he hasn't done either in his personal
life.''
</P>
<P>
   She still struggles with forgiving her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had been simply an absentee dad,'' Jackson says.
``We could have easily gotten over that. In fact, if he had been
completely absent, our lives wouldn't have been so traumatized. The
two or three times we spent any significant time with him as
children were extremely painful and continue to haunt us to this
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevel, 63, says he would have given more support to his
daughters if they had been more dedicated to the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand my vocation,'' he says. ``My vocation is
to deal with the salvation, education and liberation of American
people. That's all I worked on. Apart from this, I don't exist. In
order to be with me, you have to work on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevel remains in Chicago, where he runs a program to help
at-risk youths and to teach effective parenting. When asked how
many children he has, Bevel smiles. ``Well, the computer broke
down,'' he says. ``I don't get into counting things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevel's daughters, meanwhile, say they do admire their father's
dedication to the movement. But everything they personally learned
about activism came from their mother, who works with the National
Urban League in Memphis. She encouraged them to become activists in
college and in their community.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Orrin, who graduated from the University of Memphis, is
an account manager with Docupro, an Atlanta printing company. She
volunteers at two child abuse prevention organizations. Jackson, a
graduate of Yale University Law School, is a corporate attorney who
volunteers and provides free legal services for organizations that
serve poor families. They share a home in Marietta and rarely talk
to their father. Orrin is a single mother herself, with two sons,
12 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   Orrin says that, while people may admire her father for his
activism, his legacy for her is pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a reason to be proud of him,'' she says as she
stares at a picture of her father prominently featured in a book on
the civil rights movement. ``I'm always struck by how much I look
like him. But it bothers me because I don't want the resemblance to
be anything more than skin deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says the real hero in their family is her mother. ``She
showed us that you don't have to choose between being a parent and
serving humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   SON OF A SEGREGATIONIST: ROSS BARNETT JR.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Barnett Jr. can't escape his father's name or reputation.
On Sept. 20, 1962, Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett Sr., a staunch
segregationist, blocked the admission of James Meredith, a black
man, to the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi would not ``drink from the cup of genocide,'' the
governor declared, defiantly setting off a deadly chain of events.
President Kennedy dispatched 500 federal troops to the university,
where they were attacked by a mob of 2,000 white people. Two people
died and 188 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   That tragedy still touches the Barnett family.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's son believes he is still judged by his father's
actions. Recently, a black journalist refused to shake Barnett's
hand when he learned who his father was.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are racists in all races,'' Barnett, 65, says of the
incident. ``It didn't bother me. I felt sorry for the man. He has a
small viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett was 27 when his father confronted Meredith, and at the
time he supported his father's segregationist stand. ``That was the
plank in every Southern politician's platform,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But he has changed with the times, he says. Married 44 years and
the father of five children, he still lives in Jackson, where he's
a lawyer specializing in criminal and personal injury law. Many of
his clients are black. So, too, he says, are some of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   But some things haven't changed. His father, who died in 1987,
will always be remembered as a segregationist.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior Barnett was much gentler than his public image,
his son says. ``If you spent five minutes with him, you would like
him.'' He loved to tell funny stories and give money to people in
need, the son says. And he wasn't a racist, Barnett insists: He had
black friends and even left money in his will for two
African-Americans, a quail-hunting companion and a masseur.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four decades after the violence spawned by Meredith's
enrollment, Barnett attributes it to a basic human trait: People
are scared of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Segregation was the order of the day,'' he says. ``When you
grow up with something and that's all you know, when something
different happens, it's a mind-boggler.''
</P>
<P>
   CHILD OF THE PANTHERS: ERICKA BROWN-ABRAM
</P>
<P>
   Bullets, berets and black leather jackets. Throughout Ericka
Brown-Abram's early life, whether she was attending high school in
Beverly Hills, Calif., or Spelman College in Atlanta, those were
the images people focused on when they discovered that her mother
was a leader of the Black Panther Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expected me to wear a beret,'' says Brown-Abram, 30.
``Some would ask, `Do you own a gun? Do you know how to break one
down?' It made me feel like I should whip out a gun and start
cleaning it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Abram is the daughter of Elaine Brown, who took over the
Black Panthers in 1974, when its founder, Huey Newton, went into
exile in Cuba. The organization was about to implode _ many of its
leaders had been wounded or killed, and it was riddled with FBI
informers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brown-Abram doesn't recall growing up in an environment of
tension, but rather in the nurturing
</P>
<P>
   atmosphere of a communal home in Oakland, Calif. Panther members
did an amazing job of sheltering their children, she says. She
attended a Panther-run school where traditional teaching mingled
with Marxist ideology. Students wore black berets and called
playmates ``comrades,'' but they were forbidden to play with toy
guns. And the school's test scores consistently ranked among the
highest in California, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Panther children were taught to serve the community. Brown-Abram
recalls taking part in programs that provided free breakfasts and
health screenings, and even working alongside migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a demanding childhood, and at times she craved simple
childhood diversions such as watching cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I didn't want the responsibility of being awake,''
Brown-Abram says. ``I just wanted to be like the other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother didn't cook for her, because she didn't have time.
The daily rituals that bond many mothers and daughters _ shopping
and combing hair together_ were absent. Yet Brown-Abram doesn't
resent the time her mother spent leading a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I don't have the same courage my mom has,'' she
says. ``I'm extremely proud of her, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed,
because I don't know what would make someone that dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Brown, an author and lecturer who lives in Atlanta, is
mystified by her daughter's devotion. She still experiences guilt
over the time she missed with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fiercely loyal to me,'' Brown says. ``I almost don't
understand it in her. I didn't know when her teeth came in. She
walked three weeks before I first saw her walk. What does that tell
you of me?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Abram lives in Macon, Ga., with her husband, Malcolm, and
is a disc jockey and a tour guide for the Harriet Tubman African
American Museum.
</P>
<P>
   She says she is often struck by modern-day reminders that the
Black Panthers' agenda remains relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can assimilate and become this sparkling race,'' she says,
``but there are still going to be people who will tie us to a truck
and drag us to our death.''
</P>
<P>
   IN HIS FATHER'S STEPS: ALBERT VIVIAN
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Albert Vivian saw his father get punched in the face on
national television. It's one of his fondest childhood memories.
The confrontation arose as the Rev. C.T. Vivian was attempting to
register as voters a group of blacks turned away from the
courthouse in Selma, Ala. The local sheriff hit Vivian, knocking
him to the ground. But Vivian, his mouth bloodied, stood up to the
sheriff and compared him to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans saw the punch _ and Vivian's courageous
response _ on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It filled me with a gush of pride,'' says the younger Vivian,
who grew up in Atlanta. ``I remember kids picking at me in school,
saying, `I saw your dad get beat up.' My response was, `If he
didn't do that, you wouldn't be in the school you're in now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   C.T. Vivian, a leader in the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, took part in voter registration drives throughout the
South. As a result, his family watched the evening news with a
sense of dread. Albert Vivian's mother, Octavia, eventually
instituted a rule that none of her six children could watch the
news unsupervised.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never knew what they might see,'' says the elder Vivian,
now 76. ``What if I had been killed?''
</P>
<P>
   The activists' wives are the unknown heroes of the movement, he
says. They kept the families together; many of the men traveled so
much that they became virtual strangers to their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being tired and going home to sleep,'' the elder
Vivian says. ``I awoke in the morning and all the kids were sitting
in the room looking at me. It was as if to say, `I wonder what he's
about.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Vivian, 38, is following in his father's footsteps,
taking over a consulting business that offers racial sensitivity
workshops for corporations and city governments. He lives in
Atlanta with his wife, DeAna Jo, and two sons, 9-year-old Louis and
7-year-old Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   A former captain in the U.S. Army, Albert Vivian says he was
inspired to carry on his father's work after watching him conduct a
racial sensitivity workshop on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' He
called after the show ended and said, ``Dad, I want to do what
you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm really enjoying,'' he says, ``is the fact that I'm
giving Dad the time to spend with Mom that he didn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER: PEGGY WALLACE KENNEDY
</P>
<P>
   George Wallace was the subject of many photographs in his
turbulent life, but there was one in particular that he cherished.
It was a shot of him driving his right hand into the bloodied face
of a boxing opponent during a Golden Gloves bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved that picture,'' says Peggy Wallace Kennedy, 50, his
oldest daughter. ``It hung in his bedroom, where he could easily
see it from his bed. He said it was the greatest punch he ever
threw.''
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Alabama governor threw many bruising punches in the
political arena as well. With his bulldog scowl, Wallace was one of
the most visible enemies of the civil rights movement. He once
declared that segregation would last forever.
</P>
<P>
   But her father wasn't a racist, Kennedy says. He was simply a
politician, playing to the wishes of his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that he hated blacks. He treated everybody . . . who
cooked and cleaned for us at the Governor's Mansion like his own
family. I saw it and swore to it. He would never mistreat one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 8 when her father became governor, and she rarely saw
him. When he was at home, he didn't discuss politics much with his
wife, Lurleen, or Peggy and her siblings, Bobbi Jo, Janie Lee and
George Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's favorite childhood memory of Wallace is of watching
Friday night boxing matches with him.
</P>
<P>
   She never developed an interest in politics. She's a homemaker
living in Montgomery with her husband, Mark Kennedy, a former
Alabama Supreme Court justice. They have two sons, Leigh, 22, and
Burns, 12.
</P>
<P>
   She says that when she married Kennedy _ no relation to the
famous Massachusetts family of the same name _ in the 1970s, her
father received a telegram from Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose brother,
President Kennedy, had sent in the National Guard when Wallace made
his infamous ``stand in the schoolhouse door'' in 1963. The
senator's telegram read, ``I'm so glad we finally got together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad got a big kick out of that,'' the daughter remembers.
</P>
<P>
   What she remembers most about her father is the last years of
his life. He was shot and paralyzed in 1972 while running as an
independent candidate for president. The shooting changed him in
many ways, Kennedy says. He renounced his racial politics, began
reading his Bible every day and started seeking forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would call friends he hadn't talked to for a long time and
say, `If we got anything to straighten out, let's straighten it out
now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace died in 1998 at age 79. His funeral drew thousands of
people, white and black.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came full circle,'' Kennedy says. ``When you're man enough
to call people you had problems with and say you're sorry, that
says something about you as a man.''

 &HT;    The children of the civil rights movement
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ericka Brown-Abram says she had a typical childhood.
Her mother's friends were killed in police shootouts. Her family
lived under FBI surveillance. She was constantly shadowed by a
bodyguard, even when she ran to the neighborhood ice cream truck.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Abram, 30, the daughter of a Black Panther Party leader,
grew up in a communal home and attended a Panther-run grade school
where students read Mao Tse-tung's Little Red Book.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people had this swashbuckling idea of the Panthers,''
she says. ``But when you're a child it all seemed normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was normal, though, about growing up in the 1950s and
'60s as a child of the civil rights movement. The leaders of the
movement led dramatic lives _ and so did their kids. These children
of the struggle _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. Some
are still grappling with their parents' legacies.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights movement unleashed waves of change that are
still being felt, says Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
author of two books on the movement. The protest that paralyzed
Seattle this year during a World Trade Organization meeting, the
Million Man March on Washington, even freedom struggles abroad _
all owe a debt to the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were singing `We Shall Overcome' when the Berlin Wall
came down,'' Branch says. ``They were singing it in Prague. They
were certainly under its influence in South Africa when it became
democratic. Even in China, Tiananmen Square was more or less
modeled on a sit-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who joined the movement still miss the adrenalin rush of
being a part of something so monumental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was invigorating,'' says Elaine Brown, Brown-Abram's
mother. ``It made life important. It made it bigger than you. Even
the notion of dying for something bigger than you was far more
powerful than living out a life of quiet desperation. I was the
happiest in my life when I was in the Black Panther Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the activists didn't commit as vigorously to parenting
as they did to protesting. Changing diapers didn't hold the same
allure as changing the world. Some of the leaders, in fact, simply
weren't suited for parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movement had a number of people who, by
conventional definitions, were crazy,'' says Clayborne Carson, a
Stanford University professor who has written about the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
``But those were the people who saw through conventional truths and
saw other possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CHOSEN ONE: WARITH DEEN MOHAMMED
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Muhammad Sr., a frail asthmatic with only a fourth-grade
education, could make hardened ex-convicts and tough street
hustlers tremble in his presence. The founder of the Nation of
Islam, he spread the message that white people are ``blue-eyed
devils.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his children feared him. They thought he had divine powers,
says Warith Deen Mohammed, his youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be afraid to think in extremes that would anger
him,'' he says. ``We would be afraid that he would hear our
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Muhammad frightened much of America as well. He
personified black rage. While the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
preached nonviolence and integration, Muhammad preached ``an eye
for an eye'' and racial separation.
</P>
<P>
   Warith Deen Mohammed, now 67, was initially groomed to succeed
his father. Born in Chicago, the youngest son of Muhammad's eight
children, he was the chosen one, the heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was a teenager, however, he had begun to doubt
his father's faith. Tutored by orthodox Muslims from the Middle
East, he had become a student of the Koran. He saw no mention of
``blue-eyed devils'' or his father in the holy text. When he shared
his doubts with his father, the elder Muhammad told his son that
his way was the way. End of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   But Warith Deen continued to question his father's beliefs. He
became even more disillusioned when he learned that Nation of Islam
members had been beaten and even killed for questioning his father.
</P>
<P>
   Warith Deen publicly opposed his father. And by 1964, when he
became close friends with one of his father's enemies, Malcolm X
(who had left the Nation of Islam that year after embracing
orthodox Islam), his father banned him from the movement.
</P>
<P>
   After Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, Warith Deen lived
virtually underground. The FBI tapped his telephones. He worked as
a baker, welder and cabdriver to make ends meet. And he constantly
received death threats from anonymous callers _ one of whose voice
he recognized. It was his older brother, Elijah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood why,'' says Mohammed, who has since reconciled
with his brother. ``We were all trained to be prepared to sacrifice
everything to protect the honorable Elijah Muhammad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Warith Deen Mohammed eventually became the chosen one again.
In 1975, his father died and the Nation of Islam, reeling from
internal blood feuds and corrupt leadership, picked him to be its
leader. He accepted and set about reforming the group. He removed
its anti-white theology, changed its name to the Muslim American
Society and declared it part of the worldwide Sunni Islamic
community. (Louis Farrakhan broke from Mohammed three years later
to form another version of the Nation).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to stop calling white folks the devil,
because there's some black devils, too,'' Mohammed said after
taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Warith Deen Mohammed is a Muslim elder statesman. He has
met with President Clinton and Pope John Paul II and was the first
Muslim to open the U.S. Senate with a prayer. He still lives in
Chicago, with his fourth wife and three youngest children (he has
nine altogether).
</P>
<P>
   And he has a new appreciation for his father. Elijah Muhammad
wasn't a racist, he says, but rather an uneducated man who patched
together a religion that taught black people self-reliance.

   ``He preached separation of the races, but he was not racist in
that ugly sense,'' Mohammed says. ``He hated the evils of white
people. He was not a racist. He was a nation builder.''
</P>
<P>
   LIFE WITHOUT FATHER: CHEVARA ORRIN AND BACARDI JACKSON
</P>
<P>
   Chevara Orrin has her father's high cheekbones, caramel-colored
complexion and rapid-fire speech. She also has nothing but contempt
for him as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Orrin, 32, is the daughter of the Rev. James Bevel, a key aide
to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and a legendary leader of the
student sit-in and Freedom Ride movements. He also is the man who
persuaded Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan to hold the 1995
Million Man March on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Bevel is no hero to Orrin or her sister, Bacardi Jackson,
29. Both say that Bevel never provided for them while they endured
a childhood marked by homelessness, welfare and hand-me-down
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know my favorite food,'' Orrin says. ``He doesn't
know where I went to high school. He doesn't know what my college
degree is in. He doesn't even know when I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Orrin's mother, Susanne Jackson, met Bevel in 1965 in Chicago.
He was working with King in the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference; she was an anti-apartheid activist. They worked
together as anti-war activists and had an on-again, off-again
six-year relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Bevel offered to raise Orrin, but Jackson didn't think he would
be a responsible parent. So Jackson raised her daughters as a
single mother, working several jobs at once but still having to go
on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi Jackson says her father would visit occasionally but
showed no interest in her personal life. Instead, she says, he
seemed interested only in lecturing her about his greatness,
frequently comparing himself to Jesus and Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   Bevel has long been known as one of the movement's most
eccentric characters. ``He's like an Old Testament prophet,''
author Taylor Branch says. ``He hears voices. Sometimes they are
the voices of genius and sometimes they are the voices of lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1999 memoir, ``Walking With the Wind,'' Rep. John Lewis
(D-Ga.) wrote that Bevel changed after King was assassinated in
1968. According to Lewis, the SCLC barred Bevel in 1970 after it
heard that he had locked himself in a hotel room with a group of
Spelman College students, declared himself a prophet, urinated in a
glass and ordered them to drink its contents to prove their
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bevel had so much hope, so much optimism,'' Lewis says. ``I
think it was too much for him and many others when King died.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi Jackson finds great irony in her father's leadership
role in the Million Man March. She estimates that he has at least
16 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never said he was sorry once,'' she says. ``He's told a
million black men that they need to atone and take responsibility
for their families, but he hasn't done either in his personal
life.''
</P>
<P>
   She still struggles with forgiving her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had been simply an absentee dad,'' Jackson says.
``We could have easily gotten over that. In fact, if he had been
completely absent, our lives wouldn't have been so traumatized. The
two or three times we spent any significant time with him as
children were extremely painful and continue to haunt us to this
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevel, 63, says he would have given more support to his
daughters if they had been more dedicated to the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand my vocation,'' he says. ``My vocation is
to deal with the salvation, education and liberation of American
people. That's all I worked on. Apart from this, I don't exist. In
order to be with me, you have to work on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevel remains in Chicago, where he runs a program to help
at-risk youths and to teach effective parenting. When asked how
many children he has, Bevel smiles. ``Well, the computer broke
down,'' he says. ``I don't get into counting things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevel's daughters, meanwhile, say they do admire their father's
dedication to the movement. But everything they personally learned
about activism came from their mother, who works with the National
Urban League in Memphis. She encouraged them to become activists in
college and in their community.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Orrin, who graduated from the University of Memphis, is
an account manager with Docupro, an Atlanta printing company. She
volunteers at two child abuse prevention organizations. Jackson, a
graduate of Yale University Law School, is a corporate attorney who
volunteers and provides free legal services for organizations that
serve poor families. They share a home in Marietta and rarely talk
to their father. Orrin is a single mother herself, with two sons,
12 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   Orrin says that, while people may admire her father for his
activism, his legacy for her is pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a reason to be proud of him,'' she says as she
stares at a picture of her father prominently featured in a book on
the civil rights movement. ``I'm always struck by how much I look
like him. But it bothers me because I don't want the resemblance to
be anything more than skin deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says the real hero in their family is her mother. ``She
showed us that you don't have to choose between being a parent and
serving humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   SON OF A SEGREGATIONIST: ROSS BARNETT JR.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Barnett Jr. can't escape his father's name or reputation.
On Sept. 20, 1962, Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett Sr., a staunch
segregationist, blocked the admission of James Meredith, a black
man, to the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi would not ``drink from the cup of genocide,'' the
governor declared, defiantly setting off a deadly chain of events.
President Kennedy dispatched 500 federal troops to the university,
where they were attacked by a mob of 2,000 white people. Two people
died and 188 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   That tragedy still touches the Barnett family.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's son believes he is still judged by his father's
actions. Recently, a black journalist refused to shake Barnett's
hand when he learned who his father was.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are racists in all races,'' Barnett, 65, says of the
incident. ``It didn't bother me. I felt sorry for the man. He has a
small viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett was 27 when his father confronted Meredith, and at the
time he supported his father's segregationist stand. ``That was the
plank in every Southern politician's platform,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But he has changed with the times, he says. Married 44 years and
the father of five children, he still lives in Jackson, where he's
a lawyer specializing in criminal and personal injury law. Many of
his clients are black. So, too, he says, are some of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   But some things haven't changed. His father, who died in 1987,
will always be remembered as a segregationist.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior Barnett was much gentler than his public image,
his son says. ``If you spent five minutes with him, you would like
him.'' He loved to tell funny stories and give money to people in
need, the son says. And he wasn't a racist, Barnett insists: He had
black friends and even left money in his will for two
African-Americans, a quail-hunting companion and a masseur.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four decades after the violence spawned by Meredith's
enrollment, Barnett attributes it to a basic human trait: People
are scared of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Segregation was the order of the day,'' he says. ``When you
grow up with something and that's all you know, when something
different happens, it's a mind-boggler.''
</P>
<P>
   CHILD OF THE PANTHERS: ERICKA BROWN-ABRAM
</P>
<P>
   Bullets, berets and black leather jackets. Throughout Ericka
Brown-Abram's early life, whether she was attending high school in
Beverly Hills, Calif., or Spelman College in Atlanta, those were
the images people focused on when they discovered that her mother
was a leader of the Black Panther Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expected me to wear a beret,'' says Brown-Abram, 30.
``Some would ask, `Do you own a gun? Do you know how to break one
down?' It made me feel like I should whip out a gun and start
cleaning it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Abram is the daughter of Elaine Brown, who took over the
Black Panthers in 1974, when its founder, Huey Newton, went into
exile in Cuba. The organization was about to implode _ many of its
leaders had been wounded or killed, and it was riddled with FBI
informers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brown-Abram doesn't recall growing up in an environment of
tension, but rather in the nurturing
</P>
<P>
   atmosphere of a communal home in Oakland, Calif. Panther members
did an amazing job of sheltering their children, she says. She
attended a Panther-run school where traditional teaching mingled
with Marxist ideology. Students wore black berets and called
playmates ``comrades,'' but they were forbidden to play with toy
guns. And the school's test scores consistently ranked among the
highest in California, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Panther children were taught to serve the community. Brown-Abram
recalls taking part in programs that provided free breakfasts and
health screenings, and even working alongside migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a demanding childhood, and at times she craved simple
childhood diversions such as watching cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I didn't want the responsibility of being awake,''
Brown-Abram says. ``I just wanted to be like the other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother didn't cook for her, because she didn't have time.
The daily rituals that bond many mothers and daughters _ shopping
and combing hair together_ were absent. Yet Brown-Abram doesn't
resent the time her mother spent leading a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I don't have the same courage my mom has,'' she
says. ``I'm extremely proud of her, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed,
because I don't know what would make someone that dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Brown, an author and lecturer who lives in Atlanta, is
mystified by her daughter's devotion. She still experiences guilt
over the time she missed with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fiercely loyal to me,'' Brown says. ``I almost don't
understand it in her. I didn't know when her teeth came in. She
walked three weeks before I first saw her walk. What does that tell
you of me?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Abram lives in Macon, Ga., with her husband, Malcolm, and
is a disc jockey and a tour guide for the Harriet Tubman African
American Museum.
</P>
<P>
   She says she is often struck by modern-day reminders that the
Black Panthers' agenda remains relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can assimilate and become this sparkling race,'' she says,
``but there are still going to be people who will tie us to a truck
and drag us to our death.''
</P>
<P>
   IN HIS FATHER'S STEPS: ALBERT VIVIAN
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Albert Vivian saw his father get punched in the face on
national television. It's one of his fondest childhood memories.
The confrontation arose as the Rev. C.T. Vivian was attempting to
register as voters a group of blacks turned away from the
courthouse in Selma, Ala. The local sheriff hit Vivian, knocking
him to the ground. But Vivian, his mouth bloodied, stood up to the
sheriff and compared him to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans saw the punch _ and Vivian's courageous
response _ on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It filled me with a gush of pride,'' says the younger Vivian,
who grew up in Atlanta. ``I remember kids picking at me in school,
saying, `I saw your dad get beat up.' My response was, `If he
didn't do that, you wouldn't be in the school you're in now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   C.T. Vivian, a leader in the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, took part in voter registration drives throughout the
South. As a result, his family watched the evening news with a
sense of dread. Albert Vivian's mother, Octavia, eventually
instituted a rule that none of her six children could watch the
news unsupervised.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never knew what they might see,'' says the elder Vivian,
now 76. ``What if I had been killed?''
</P>
<P>
   The activists' wives are the unknown heroes of the movement, he
says. They kept the families together; many of the men traveled so
much that they became virtual strangers to their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being tired and going home to sleep,'' the elder
Vivian says. ``I awoke in the morning and all the kids were sitting
in the room looking at me. It was as if to say, `I wonder what he's
about.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Vivian, 38, is following in his father's footsteps,
taking over a consulting business that offers racial sensitivity
workshops for corporations and city governments. He lives in
Atlanta with his wife, DeAna Jo, and two sons, 9-year-old Louis and
7-year-old Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   A former captain in the U.S. Army, Albert Vivian says he was
inspired to carry on his father's work after watching him conduct a
racial sensitivity workshop on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' He
called after the show ended and said, ``Dad, I want to do what
you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm really enjoying,'' he says, ``is the fact that I'm
giving Dad the time to spend with Mom that he didn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER: PEGGY WALLACE KENNEDY
</P>
<P>
   George Wallace was the subject of many photographs in his
turbulent life, but there was one in particular that he cherished.
It was a shot of him driving his right hand into the bloodied face
of a boxing opponent during a Golden Gloves bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved that picture,'' says Peggy Wallace Kennedy, 50, his
oldest daughter. ``It hung in his bedroom, where he could easily
see it from his bed. He said it was the greatest punch he ever
threw.''
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Alabama governor threw many bruising punches in the
political arena as well. With his bulldog scowl, Wallace was one of
the most visible enemies of the civil rights movement. He once
declared that segregation would last forever.
</P>
<P>
   But her father wasn't a racist, Kennedy says. He was simply a
politician, playing to the wishes of his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that he hated blacks. He treated everybody . . . who
cooked and cleaned for us at the Governor's Mansion like his own
family. I saw it and swore to it. He would never mistreat one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 8 when her father became governor, and she rarely saw
him. When he was at home, he didn't discuss politics much with his
wife, Lurleen, or Peggy and her siblings, Bobbi Jo, Janie Lee and
George Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's favorite childhood memory of Wallace is of watching
Friday night boxing matches with him.
</P>
<P>
   She never developed an interest in politics. She's a homemaker
living in Montgomery with her husband, Mark Kennedy, a former
Alabama Supreme Court justice. They have two sons, Leigh, 22, and
Burns, 12.
</P>
<P>
   She says that when she married Kennedy _ no relation to the
famous Massachusetts family of the same name _ in the 1970s, her
father received a telegram from Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose brother,
President Kennedy, had sent in the National Guard when Wallace made
his infamous ``stand in the schoolhouse door'' in 1963. The
senator's telegram read, ``I'm so glad we finally got together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad got a big kick out of that,'' the daughter remembers.
</P>
<P>
   What she remembers most about her father is the last years of
his life. He was shot and paralyzed in 1972 while running as an
independent candidate for president. The shooting changed him in
many ways, Kennedy says. He renounced his racial politics, began
reading his Bible every day and started seeking forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would call friends he hadn't talked to for a long time and
say, `If we got anything to straighten out, let's straighten it out
now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace died in 1998 at age 79. His funeral drew thousands of
people, white and black.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came full circle,'' Kennedy says. ``When you're man enough
to call people you had problems with and say you're sorry, that
says something about you as a man.''

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: SHOOTING  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This has always been a strong Olympic sport for the United
States, which has won 69 individual medals, 30 gold. The Americans
are solid again with shotguns (skeet and trap), where for the first
time men and women have separate competitions. When women competed
against men, they sometimes won.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   There are 17 medal events: six shotgun, five rifle, five pistol
and one in running target with an air rifle. Seven events are for
women only.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   The shooters get 75 to 150 shots in the shotgun events, 40 to
120 with rifle and pistol and 60 in running target. The rifle
shooting is at 10 or 50 meters, the running target at 10 meters and
pistol at 10, 25 or 50 meters. In skeet and trap, points are
awarded for hitting flying targets. In the other events, the idea
is to hit the bull's-eye.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   It begins with finding a federation or private sponsor because
competition rifles and pistols can cost as much as $7,000 or
$8,000, shotguns as much as $10,000 to $12,000. Almost half of the
U.S. team, including all five male riflemen, are members of the
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   Most of the best shooters come from Europe and Asia. One to
watch is Tavarit Majchacheep of Thailand, who in January set a
world record for air rifle at 10 meters with a perfect score of
600: 60 shots, all down the middle. Two good Americans are Bill
Demarest of Mission Viejo, Calif., in men's free pistol and Kim
Rhode of El Monte, Calif., a 1996 medalist in the women's double
trap.

INDIA ANSWERS PAKISTANI CRITICISM ON KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With U.N.-MILLENNIUM-SUMMIT) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Two days after Pakistan used the United Nations
summit meeting to deliver a blistering attack on India over its
occupation of Kashmir, India's prime minister counterattacked
Friday without mentioning the name of his country's bitter enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many statesmanlike words have been delivered from this high
tribune,'' Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India said when
his turn came to speak Friday. ``Unfortunately, some of them are a
mockery of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world must see the reality as it is,'' he said. ``The acid
test of sincerity of purpose is not words but deeds. Terrorism and
dialogue do not go together.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
told the meeting (without mentioning India, either): ``The people
of Kashmir remain deprived of justice. The consequence of this
injustice has been four wars. The region stands heavily
militarized, even nuclearized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is certainly not of Pakistan's making,''
Musharraf continued. ``We have been obliged to respond to the
compulsions of our society and have merely acted in self defense.''
</P>
<P>
   India has accused Musharraf, who seized power in a coup last
October, of supporting Kashmiri separatists seeking independence or
autonomy for the disputed Himalayan territory. India continues to
dismiss them as terrorists, a perception that Vajpayee built upon
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all threats to democracy, development and peace in our
times,'' the Indian leader said, ``the most diabolic is
international terrorism, with its links to religious extremism,
drug trafficking and commerce in illicit arms. Terrorism feeds on
violence against innocent people and seeks to undermine plural,
open societies.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, who was re-elected last year, delivered his own appeal
for cooperation with the other leaders. ``I call upon the
international community to act against terrorism before it is too
late,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Musharraf proposed for the United Nations the kind
of role in Kashmir that it played in championing the independence
of East Timor from Indonesia. ``If the people of East Timor could
be given their freedom,'' he said on Wednesday, ``why not
Kashmir?''

VIP'S ARE HELPED THROUGH KENNEDY BY A VBP (VERY BUSY PERSON) 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat had deadlines to meet. Take, for instance, the
fact that he was planning to declare an independent Palestinian
state this month. So perhaps such business spurred him to move up
his flight to depart from New York from Friday evening to noon. Or
maybe he just missed home cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get the aircraft in,'' Sgt. Vito Asparro of the
Port Authority police said soon after the Secret Service called to
relay the last-minute change. ``We've got a major situation here.''
</P>
<P>
   By noon, Arafat's motorcade had left Midtown for Kennedy
International Airport. That made Asparro sweat. Since 1986, he has
held the title of VIP coordinator in charge of dignitary
protection. For those who need an acronym refresher, Arafat
qualifies as a VIP, as do the other 150 or so world leaders who
flew into town this week for the United Nations Millennium Summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the airport faces the mass exodus. For Asparro,
that means spending the final days of summer in Hangar 12.
</P>
<P>
   All around him, telephones rang and computer screens spat out
information. To keep him company, lots of dark-suited men paced the
room: Secret Service agents, State Department security personnel,
police officers and Port Authority officials and employees from
federal agriculture, immigration and health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen delegations left on Thursday night, and 80 others were
scheduled to depart over the weekend. The rest had not made plans.
At times like this, having plans and sticking to them could endear
you for life to the sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he went to the United Nations and spoke with
representatives from most of the countries that would be sending
delegates. He began listing the things that he needed the
delegations to do to make his job easier. His spoke for more than
an hour and a half, and he would have kept going if they had not
pulled him off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone heeded the sergeant. For example, he
asked the 50 world leaders who were flying in on their private
planes to bring along tug vehicles to help pull aircraft along the
tarmac. A few delegations showed up empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's delicate, and I would rather not say who it was,'' the
sergeant said.
</P>
<P>
   The private planes ranged from giant Boeing 747s to 15-seat Gulf
Stream 4's. Saudi Arabia came in with a dozen planes. (``You're
talking big, big magnitude,'' Asparro said.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the size, all were parked at nearby military bases.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates who were catching commercial flights had to check
in just like everybody else. Their motorcades had to pull up to the
departure terminals rather than the runways, and they had to have
their luggage X-rayed and tagged. What would happen if suitcases
bound for Congo ended up in Iceland?
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant didn't want to think about that. At the moment,
Arafat's motorcade was pulling up, and he had to find a waiting
area fit for a VIP. After all, a stress-free mind always makes for
better peace talks.

 &HT;    Aussie warmth helps a shivering band
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Fayette County High School band is getting a taste
of Southern Hemisphere hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   Told to pack sweaters, light jackets and long pants for
Australia's late winter, the 160 Fayette students scheduled to
perform at the 2000 Summer Games found occasional sleet and
overnight lows around 38 degrees when they arrived Tuesday at their
practice site in Bathurst, about 100 miles west of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But Bathurst residents quickly put the syncopated shivering to
rest by starting a clothing drive for the Fayette students and the
1,830 other band members practicing in conditions resembling
daytime highs at a Winter Olympics site. The townsfolk delivered
``a small mountain'' of coats, sweaters and hats to Charles Sturt
University, Fayette High band parent Phillip Foster wrote in an
e-mail from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing my daughter had a was a jacket and a
sweatshirt,'' said band parent Donna Thompson of Fayetteville, Ga.,
south of Atlanta, who talked by phone to her daughter, Marly. ``It
is cold. They all had to go out and buy gloves.''

HOMER OFF ACE CLEMENS TOUGH TO TRUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He supposes there can be only one thrill that will
trump the night he reduced the Rocket to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Trot Nixon said, ``one day I can say winning the
World Series was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, this will do, the ninth-inning, game-deciding home
run he hit off Roger Clemens in Yankee Stadium May 28, after
Clemens and Pedro Martinez had spent the entire night matching
zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an amazing game,'' said Sox closer Derek Lowe, who
was warming up in the bullpen when Martinez loaded the bases with
no outs in the bottom of the ninth, but pitched out of it to
preserve a 2-0 Sox win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way I was coming into that game. Hits were so
hard to come by that night, we didn't think anybody was going to
score. Trot's home run was huge. I heard that by the end of the
week, they were selling his jersey in the souvenir shop across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should. He became a local hero that night.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not the last home run Nixon hit this season. It only
seems that way. The Sox right fielder has hit two more after that,
but none since June 23 in Toronto, when he blew out his hamstring
hustling down the first base line in SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, meanwhile, has lost just once in 16 starts since then,
winning his last seven decisions. He was clobbered by the Mets,
departing down, 9-1, on the night he beaned Mike Piazza, then
lasted just an inning June 14 against the Sox, when he left with a
strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   He went on the disabled list, but since his return has been the
best non-Dominican pitcher in the American League, holding
opponents to three runs or fewer in 11 of his last 13 starts. The
13 strikeouts he had against the Sox in May remains his season
high; he has had just one game since in which he whiffed 10 or more
batters, but with 158 whiffs this season, he is the oldest Yankee
pitcher (38) ever to record 150 or more strikeouts in a season.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility existed Friday night that things could turn
personal between Nixon and Clemens. Nixon claimed Clemens shouted
at him after his first at-bat in May, yelling, ``That's a strike,''
after Nixon looked askance at the plate umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I show him a lot of respect,'' Nixon said afterward. ``I give
him a lot of respect. If he doesn't respect me, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon struck out again on his second at-bat, he returned to
the dugout, raging at himself. He tripled in the seventh, gambling
that he could beat the relay into third. His home run was the final
word that night, but Nixon also was unafraid later to condemn
Clemens for beaning Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how other people feel, but I understand what
Piazza said when he said he didn't respect Clemens,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who was fooled badly on a 2-2 splitter to strike out in
his first at-bat, said he wasn't anticipating any carryover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger is the best pitcher I've ever faced,'' Nixon said.
``He's a guy I've looked up to my entire career, his intensity and
the way he goes about his business and prepares for a game. He's a
gamer. It's a privilege and honor to step into the batter's box and
he's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who broke into the majors at the end of the 1996 season,
Clemens's last with the Sox, said he has only exchanged a couple of
words with the Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to play (with the major leaguers) a couple of times in
spring training,'' Nixon said. ``These were guys you saw on TV all
the time, guys that were on the video games that you played.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of nerve-racking. You get the opportunity to be with
these guys and you say, `Geez, that's Roger Clemens on the mound.'
You have to set aside that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He has never seen a better pitchers' duel than the one that took
place that night in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Clemens and Pedro pitched a heck of a game that night,''
Nixon said. ``Roger was hearing a lot of questions about whether he
still had his stuff. Shoot, I'll tell you when he doesn't have his
stuff. He never lost it.''

UNDAUNTED IN TEXAS, LIEBERMAN ATTACKS BUSH'S HEALTH CARE RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Venturing deep into Gov. George W. Bush's home state
on Friday, Sen. Joseph Lieberman painted a dismal picture of Bush's
record on children's health care, and said the governor could not
be trusted with the issue on a national scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas actually ranks 49th of 50 states in providing health
insurance for kids,'' Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential
nominee, said at a forum here. ``In this campaign, Gov. Bush may
say that he has a plan to improve children's health across America.
But I think we have a right to ask, why hasn't he done it in
Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and his running mate, Vice President Al Gore, have
made health care a central issue of the campaign, promising to
provide coverage for all of the nation's 11 million uninsured
children by 2004 and prescription drug coverage for older people
under Medicare. Buoyed by opinion polls showing that the public
sees health care as a matter better handled by the Democrats, they
have charged that Bush would endanger Medicare's financial
stability and that his promises to improve health care are hollow.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's foray into Texas _ along with another he plans to
make on Monday _ are a vivid sign of the confidence the Democrats
have found in the last month. They have remained steadily on the
offensive, particularly on health care, and are sure enough of
their standing in traditionally Democratic states to send Lieberman
into a state that is sure to be a Republican stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's remarks by Lieberman may have been the harshest yet in
this campaign, reinforcing the role he is playing as the Democrats'
leading attacker. He charged that under Bush, Texas had done a bad
job of enrolling children in federally financed health care plans,
and that the state had erected bureaucratic hurdles that make it
hard for qualified people to get those benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a ruling by a federal judge last month that Texas had
failed to provide adequate care for children on Medicaid, the
health program for the poor, in violation of a 1996 agreement with
the Bush administration. The state is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush has just not made children's health coverage and
care a priority,'' the senator said at the Magnolia Multi-Service
Center, in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood here. ``More than 1.4
million children in Texas do not have health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, did not dispute
the figures cited by Lieberman, but he said they stemmed from
problems Bush inherited when he became governor in 1995. And he
argued that the state found it hard to enroll people in benefit
programs because ``there is a belief in Texas to scorn government
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's predecessor, Ann Richards, a Democrat, ``We were
49th then, too,'' Bartlett added. ``The challenges in Texas are not
something that are new in the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the focus of Lieberman's remarks, the Children's Health
Insurance Program, or CHIP, is new. It was created in 1997 by
Congress and President Clinton, providing federal money to the
states to cover uninsured children from low-income families, and
giving the states responsibility for designing their own programs
and enrolling people.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' has been one of the slowest states in signing up poor
children for the program; the Children's Defense Fund ranked its
efforts 45th among the states. Figures compiled by the Health Care
Financing Authority, a federal agency, show Texas had 51,000
children enrolled as of a year ago, about one-third the national
rate, compared to 521,000 in New York, the state with the largest
program.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said that the creation of a CHIP program in Texas was
delayed because the legislature meets only every other year. Texas
officials say the state's enrollment is up to 90,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman interviewed working parents here, some with toddlers
squirming on their laps, who told of being unable to find coverage
for their children. ``We had to choose between transportation and
insurance,'' Rosalinda Camarillo said, adding that she had
postponed surgery for her 9-year-old son for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Several parents said they had been wrongly denied Medicaid
coverage, or had their benefits terminated. ``This state
administration has kept in place a very cumbersome bureaucratic red
tape that has kept 600,000 eligible children from enrolling in
Medicaid,'' Lieberman said. Bartlett said the eligibility rules in
Texas go back two decades, and that the state is reviewing them.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Defense Fund reported last month that Texas was
one of only eight states where the number of children with any form
of health insurance declined from 1997 to 1999, despite CHIP, a
charge Lieberman repeated on Friday.

 &HT;    WB hopes kids get a kick out of Jackie, `Shanghai 'toon'
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're pitching a new animated series
starring Jackie Chan, there's no better way to sell it than by
letting the international martial arts star do it himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie would get up and just demonstrate all the things he
wanted to do,'' recalls Jeff Kline, an executive producer of
``Jackie Chan Adventures.'' ``He scared the hell out of WB
executives. That's why they bought the show. We said, `If you
don't, we'll sic Jackie on you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for WB suits, it didn't come to that. The network did
buy ``Jackie Chan Adventures , `` which producers describe as
Indiana Jones meets David Copperfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the series, Chan is an archaeologist and a special government
agent. With the help of his 11-year-old tomboy niece, Chan travels
the globe to recover 12 talismans _ powerful artifacts that hold
unique and magical powers. Along the way, Chan battles everything
from mystical ninja warriors to an evil crime family known as The
Dark Hand.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each show, a live-action Chan will answer
questions viewers e-mail to the Kids' WB! Web site. So far, kids
want to know if he is ever scared, what kind of ice cream he likes
and why he wanted to be a cartoon character.
</P>
<P>
   The producers say the series will also celebrate Chinese
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put a different spin on the show,'' Klein
explains. ``Jackie lives in Hong Kong, he was born in China, so it
would've been silly of us not to take advantage of that. So we can
tie into some of the more mystical, historical elements of Chinese
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, but just how did Chan get a cartoon in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   His managers have hinted at the idea for some time. Several
American TV producers also found the concept intriguing. After all,
as Klein notes, more of Chan's films (''Shanghai Noon,'' ``Rush
Hour,'' ``Mr. Nice Guy'') appealed to young moviegoers. Turning his
big-screen persona into a TV cartoon was almost a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   But not all bigger-than-life personalities can cut it as a
Saturday morning 'toon. Remember ABC's ill-advised attempt to turn
M.C. Hammer into an animated series? Klein, however, says he's not
that concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie's already a human cartoon,'' he contends. ``He does
amazing things with his body, and he has big facial expressions. We
just took the action further, without losing his very human,
Charlie Chaplin-like quality.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rogers, who helped develop ``Jackie Chan Adventures,'' has
been a huge fan of Chan's work for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get bootleg copies of his martial arts films when I
was a stand-up comic,'' Rogers remembers. ``He was always the
reluctant hero. And he had such physical grace. To get over a wall,
he doesn't just climb over it, he does a stagger step up the
corner, and there he goes. It was hypnotizing to see someone move
that beautifully. Plus, there was that amazing kung fu.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Chan is never a bully in his films, Rogers explains it was
important to make Chan a reactionary character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie will not go out looking for a fight,'' Rogers points
out. ``Trouble just happens to him. That's why we didn't want to
make him a police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does Chan think of the finished product?
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves the idea that he'll never age and that he can do
stuff that won't give him a bad back,'' Klein says, with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Originally Chan was going to do all the voice-over work for his
character. But his hectic film-shooting schedule made that
impossible. His broken English also posed another problem. So the
producers hired another actor to do most of the dialogue. But when
you hear Jackie grunt, moan and yell, that's Chan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spent a few hours recording only sound effects,'' says
Klein. ``It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if ``Jackie Chan Adventures `` will catch
on with viewers. In the age of Nickelodeon, The Cartoon Network,
Fox Kids and the rest, the animated TV market is a crowded one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult,'' Klein admits. ``But Jackie Chan means
so much to kids around the world. There's already a pre-sold
element. We were a little bit scared because there's so much
history. But we think we did it right.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they didn't, Klein can just sic Chan on the WB to get
another chance.

HOUSE OF WILLIAMS SURVIVES TORNADO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Fall of the House of Williams appeared imminent.
Timbers came crashing down Wednesday night as a resident champ,
Serena, got jackhammered by Lindsay Davenport. Now, late Friday
afternoon, the foundation was crumbling. The other inhabiting
champion, Venus, had just plunged through the floor, and was
groping in the dark cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Allan Poe must have been chuckling in his grave. This was
a horror story to warm the heart of the author of ``The Fall of the
House of Usher.'' It was so horrifying that the creator of the
House of Williams _ Papa Richard _ walked out on the show at
Flushing Meadows. He's the one who'd been predicting a unique
Williams vs. Williams showdown for the US Open title.
</P>
<P>
   After all, wasn't Serena the 1999 US champ, and hadn't Venus
just won Wimbledon? But in the third set (while the earlier
semifinal victor, Davenport, kicked back and wished nothing but
pulled muscles and major fatigue for the embroiled Martina Hingis
and Venus Williams), you could hear the walls shudder and the beams
splintering.
</P>
<P>
   Venus, serving, was looking for a way out to daylight. But it
was 15-30, 3-5, and Hingis was buzzing about like a malevolent
termite intent on finishing off the razing of the joint: two points
from the final. Venus seemed like Madeline Usher, buried alive.
There was no indication she would survive, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, and seize
a place in Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was two points away at 15-30 and 30-all,'' Hingis would sigh
later. ``If I would get the next point . . . who knows what would
happen? Still, I served for it at 5-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus knew what would happen. ``I just kept fighting and
slugging. At 5-4 I thought, `Well, you waited till the last minute
to break . . . this is the last opportunity.'' The last tango at
Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   And she danced it, with those endless legs churning with endless
energy _ just as she has for so long that Venus ``can't remember
the last time I lost.'' It was 25 matches, and almost three months
ago, to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the quarterfinals of the French.
</P>
<P>
   She thought she should have broken Hingis's serve in the eighth
game to 4-4 after a roaring backhand upped her to deuce from 40-30.
But Hingis countered with a backhand winner, then skied a lob that
fell short, within the service line. Should have been easy, if
she'd let it bounce. But Venus didn't and butchered the smash. It
was ugly. Papa Richard winced, and Hingis stepped to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis was starting to impersonate the whirlwind that destroyed
Poe's House of Usher.
</P>
<P>
   Match game against Venus. She got the opening point. However,
the house was still tilting and began to disintegrate when she
tried a hackerly drop shot. It was either a Chinese Chop or a
Beijing Bunt, an improvisation worthy of a Sunday morning at a
public park.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was some shot,'' she laughs. ``Heat of the moment.'' It
gyrated, and got up to the net, no farther. Papa got up and
departed, watching no further. It was too much for him to see the
House collapse. Maybe he went looking for a gang of construction
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Did she notice him bugging out? ``Oh, he's up and down and
around. But I don't rely on my parents when I'm playing. I rely on
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-reliance was justified. Though she lost the next point to
Hingis's backhand drive, to 15-30, Venus was about to stave off the
whirlwind and save at least half of the House, her quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she'd made a ton of mistakes, outerring Hingis,
47-23, Venus was about to let her ``pretty big heart'' take over.
``I really didn't want to lose. It was just one break. I felt like,
`I deserve to be in the final, and I just need to go ahead and get
it done.' '' The invincible feeling of a long winning streak
uncovered the bricks and plaster from her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   In a blaze of inspired shotmaking, incredible sprinting and
retrieving, won't-let-you-have-it gumption, Venus was a flash of
lemon, almost outrunning her scanty gown to grab 15 of the
remaining 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis wasn't bending easily as they blasted away at each other,
enthrallingly, at times unbelievably. But bend she did as Venus
raged in the teeth of the whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   Her ripping backhand along the sideline secured the service
break to 5-5. Venus was climbing out of the rubble, emerging from
the cellar. Immediately, she hooked an ace, and was ahead for good.
She kicked away more debris, and the House of Williams didn't fall
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Venus propped it up, and maybe Davenport should pack a wrecking
ball in her racket bag. Is Venus ever going to lose? Edgar Allan
Poe's raven would croak: ``Nevermore.''

DAIMLERCHRYSLER'S INVESTMENT IN MITSUBISHI COMES WITH MORE
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ DaimlerChrysler moved Friday to tighten control over
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Japan's fourth-largest automaker, which
has been reeling from last month's disclosure that it had concealed
customer complaints about auto defects for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors' president, Katsuhiko Kawasoe, will resign on
Nov. 1. Takashi Sonobe, currently the executive vice president,
will replace him. Rolf Eckrodt, the chief executive of Adtranz,
DaimlerChrysler's trainmaking subsidiary, is coming to Mitsubishi
Motors as its new chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Under a renegotiated deal announced here Friday, DaimlerChrysler
will keep its stake in Mitsubishi to the 34 percent agreed to in
March, but to compensate for a tumble in Mitsubishi's shares, which
have fallen a quarter in value since the coverup scandal erupted,
DaimlerChrysler will pay 10 percent less: 405 yen a share, instead
of 450 yen, or a total of $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors retains control over the posts of president
and chief executive, but the new pact gives DaimlerChrysler
increased leverage over the Japanese automaker and a period to
reassess the alliance, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``DaimlerChrysler's intention now is to take firm control,'' of
Mitsubishi Motors, said Koji Endo, an automobile analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The move by DaimlerChrysler echoes a similar one by Renault of
France, which took a 35 percent stake in Nissan Motor last year,
and installed Carlos Ghosn as chief operating officer. Ghosn has
since sold off assets and slashed jobs and costs.
</P>
<P>
   And Mitsubishi Motors will be the third Japanese automobile
manufacturer to embrace a foreign executive, after Nissan and Mazda
Motor. The Ford Motor Co. owns a 33 percent stake in Mazda, whose
president, Mark Fields, is an American.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Japanese auto manufacturers, now only Toyota and Honda
are operating under financially independent management. General
Motors owns stakes in Isuzu, Fuji Heavy Industries, and Suzuki.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the delicate balance between DaimlerChrysler and the
powerful group of Mitsubishi companies like Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries and Mitsubishi Corp., which will hold 34 percent of
Mitsubishi Motors in the deal with DaimlerChrysler, Kawasoe, the
outgoing president of Mitsubishi Motors, is said to have resisted
DaimlerChrysler's demand to raise its stake in the Japanese car
company.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitsubishi Motors did accept DaimlerChrysler's demand to let
it raise its stake in the Japanese auto manufacturer to unlimited
levels three years after the accord, instead of in 10 years as
previously agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had three years, we can recover our performance,''
Kawasoe said Friday. ``Or rather, we have to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   While the incoming chief operating officer, Eckrodt, 58, will be
reporting to Sonobe, 59, his arrival is still sure to be a blow to
the executives at Mitsubishi Motors, which have insisted the
automaker would stay autonomous after entering into the alliance
with DaimlerChrysler, despite huge debts and sluggish sales.
</P>
<P>
   Eckrodt has worked for more than three decades at Daimler, and
was an executive at its Mercedes-Benz unit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here praised the new deal and appointment of Eckrodt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better for Mitubishi Motors to be a DaimlerChrysler
company,'' than a Mitsubishi company, Endo of First Boston said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A foreign executive at Mitsubishi Motors, which sports an
inward-looking, group-oriented culture, could mean a shock to the
car company, which is likely to go through a period of uncertainty
over whether the company will be a truly market-oriented company
with concern for customers and legal compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing president, Kawasoe, had assumed presidency only
three years ago to replace Takemune Kimura who resigned to take
responsibility for a scandal involving a payoff to gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   Sonobe, the incoming president and chief executive who once
managed the car company's operations in the United States, said
that he was eager to see his company transformed culturally and
become a more ``customer-oriented'' company.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he would rethink his company's relationship
with other companies in the Mitsubishi group, he said, ``I want to
see changes at Mitsubishi Motors. Our relations with other
Mitsubishi firms will remain the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have said that DaimlerChrysler means to use
Mitsubishi to fill the holes of its international strategy,
especially in Asia, and that it will try not to become too heavily
involved in Mitsubishi Motors the way Ford and Renault have become
involved with with their Japanese partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes years to restructure a company,'' said Seiji Sugiura,
an automobile analyst with Nomura Securities. ``And share prices of
Mazda and Nissan haven't improved.''

 &HT;    Drug-free Games far from reality
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Edwin Moses, the hurdling icon, looks out on the
Olympic playing field with disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Moses suspects that the drug problem in sports hasn't changed a
bit. All the clues are still there, some more than ever before. The
sudden, drastic change in body shape. The sculpted appearance. The
out-of-this-world performance.
</P>
<P>
   Even the need for braces on the teeth at an older age, a use
that insiders link to skeletal changes brought on by such drugs as
human growth hormone (hGH).
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally have never seen so many (track athletes) get
braces at 30 years old in my life,'' Moses said, snickering. ``I
don't know what that means. But really, everybody seems to have
braces.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wade Exum, former head of the U.S. Olympic Committee's
anti-doping program, said, ``You look at some of these athletes,
and they're just too cut to be regular human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Exum also is suspicious about the number of athletes,
particularly in track, who surround themselves with a cadre of
personal physicians _ some of whom will accompany them to the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   With the curtain about to open on the Sydney Olympics, athletes
and medical experts alike are convinced that the story will be an
old and familiar one: Performers bent on using steroids and other
substances to make themselves stronger and faster will find ways to
beat the system.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what new test theInternational Olympic Committee
unveils, skeptics hammer the IOC for a history of halfhearted
efforts and, in some cases, for coverups of positive results to
avoid embarrassment. Since drug-testing was introduced, in the 1968
Olympics, only 48 positive tests have been recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is there's an innate conflict of interest,''
said Moses, an anti-doping activist since his days as a 400-meter
hurdles champion. ``You're testing your people, and it's not in
your best interest to have your people caught under any
circumstances, because of the level of sponsorship and certainly
the embarrassment. The last place the (IOC) wants anyone to test
positive is at the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC bears the responsibility of drug-testing at the Games,
and the group's credibility never has been lower, because of the
corruption scandals over selection of Olympic hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The use of performance-enhancers in the Games dates back to
ancient Greece, when athletes consumed psychedelic mushrooms to
gain an edge. In more recent times, East Germans and the Chinese
made an art form of doping athletes, particularly female swimmers
and track athletes.
</P>
<P>
   China sports officials since have cracked down and last week
withdrew 27 athletes and at least one coach from its Sydney team
because of ``suspicious'' results from a blood test. The cuts
include controversial track coach Ma Junren and six of his runners,
along with four men and three women from its 17-member rowing team.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say it is impossible to know how many cyclists,
runners and swimmers are doping. Traditionally, tests have been
performed only at competitions, so cheaters dope before and after.
They also are sophisticated enough to take agents such as
diuretics, which increase the production of urine, to mask the
drugs in their systems.
</P>
<P>
   So cheaters bulk up on human growth hormone and boost their
stamina with erythropoietin (EPO), both modeled after naturally
occurring substances. The IOC plans to test for EPO in Sydney, but
it has no reliable way to check for hGH and other performance
boosters, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Exum, director of the U.S. Olympic Committee's drug program
until his dismissal in June, estimates that five of eight Sydney
finalists in such sports as track and swimming have used some
banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, that kind of number wouldn't surprise me at (U.S.
Olympic) Trials, either,'' Exum said.
</P>
<P>
   Exum, who has filed a wrongful-dismissal suit against the USOC,
accuses the sports governing body of having a superficial image
when it comes to being tough on drugs. He does not suggest that
athletes are encouraged to use drugs, but he acknowledges that
performance-enhancing drugs work and thus can lead to winning
medals _ which is good for the Olympic business.
</P>
<P>
   He also chides Olympic officials for a system that allows
athletes to stay ahead of drug-testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my tenure there, the mindset was that it was a
cat-and-mouse game,'' Exum said. ``It was a game of catch-up. You
have to look at it like, `Hey, they have some new blood
substitutes. Let's learn how to test that stuff before they start
using it.' You've got to get out in front, but that's not the
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that is how the athletes are helped to beat the
system. If we tell the athletes and let them know we're not worried
about stuff that is coming along, that we're still struggling with
trying to catch up with stuff used back in the '80s and '90s, it
basically gives a message, whether straightforward or not, that we
can't find out and we're not going to put a penny toward research
of new methods to find the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Exum says corporate America wraps itself in the flag and makes
itself oblivious to the pharmecology games. What could send them
scrambling is Exum's fear about serious health problems to athletes
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern when I got there and saw the amount of drug use
that was going on was that somewhere between 2000 and 2015 we'd
start to see a lot of mysterious illness and fatalities,'' said
Exum, who oversaw the USOC program in the 1990s. ``When that
happens, and happens in bunches, and people start speaking out,
then corporate America will get the word. Until that time, they can
say they're a proud sponsor of the U.S. Olympic team and get
mileage out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug issue casts suspicion over any highly successful
athlete. With so many reports of doping, can viewers really trust
that the extraordinary performances they will see from Sydney are
the result of hard work and athletic talent, not drugs?
</P>
<P>
   If Marion Jones wins her five gold medals or runs the race of
her life, what is the public to think?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that whether we took drugs might be a
question,'' said Jones, whose performance has never been linked to
drugs. ``It's unfortunate because you have athletes who have never
even thought about anything like that. It's frustating at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every track-and-field athlete in the world is very cautious
when it comes to taking anything. Even things that you eat. If you
have go to a doctor because you have a cold, it's always in the
back of your mind: ``What am I taking?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Most athletes do things right. And they also know what is
happening in their sports. Fellow competitors voiced concern about
Ben Johnson long before his positive test at the 1988 Seoul Games.
The same for Irish swimmer Michelle Smith, who blew away the
Atlanta competition, only to flunk a surprise, out-of-competition
test two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if uncharacteristically strong performances raise eyebrows
among athletes, Jones said: ``It happens. I'll keep it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that suspicions run freely within the small
fraternity, especially with so much at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is I don't want people to get the idea that to get
on the Olympic (medal) podium, you've got to take the stuff,'' said
Derrick Adkins, defending Olympic 400-meter hurdles champion. ``I
don't want to see everyone get branded because they run fast. But,
sure, it's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkins said that he is aware of athletes resorting to
performance-enhancing drugs and that he had been approached by
athletes suggesting that he would run better if he used them.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches usually maintain contact with drug suppliers, Adkins
said. However, growth hormone and other performance-enhancers can
be purchased just as easily on the Internet these days.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Gray, a four-time Olympian and American record-holder in
the 800 meters, said he has witnessed athletes ``shoot (drugs) into
their systems'' and then come up clean in testing.
</P>
<P>
   The system is not working, for certain, Gray said, but it is not
his job to rat out cheats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do that to become a better athlete and make money, what
do you really get?'' Gray said. ``How much accomplishment to you
take if you're cheating?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately in Sydney, the reward still might be a medal.

POPULIST PITCH HELPS GORE CONVINCE DEMOCRATIC BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the three weeks since he faced open criticism at
the Democratic National Convention about his centrist platform and
running mate, Vice President Al Gore has silenced much of the
grumbling among core Democratic constituencies and generated an
unexpected level of enthusiasm, political analysts and Democratic
activists say.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week alone, Gore has picked up endorsements from two
groups that had been considering sitting out the race, or even
endorsing Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate: the Teamsters and
the Friends of the Earth, a liberal environmental group. And an
array of polls show that his support among Democrats has risen
significantly in recent weeks, helping to sustain a postconvention
bounce that many Republicans had expected to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Some consolidation of the party's base was inevitable as more
Democrats began focusing on the race after Labor Day. But the vice
president has clearly helped his case among traditional Democrats,
including union members, environmentalists, blacks and liberals, by
heavily spicing his stump speeches with populist anti-corporate
language, and by focusing his message on the concerns of working
Americans and middle-class families.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some of Gore's loudest skeptics a month ago are now
talking about how comfortable they are with his agenda, how
confident they are about his chances and how enthusiastic they are
about getting out his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is clear to me is that our members desperately want Al
Gore to get elected,'' said Amy Isaacs, national director of
Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal advocacy group. ``Partly
it is because they are afraid of George Bush, yes, but it is also
because they believe in the core values Al Gore espouses.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reich, a former secretary of labor in the Clinton
administration who supported Bill Bradley in the Democratic
primaries and criticized Gore in the American Prospect last month,
said of the vice president on Friday: ``He's made all the right
moves. He's shifted in exactly the direction he needed to go to
make people more interested in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's populist style was on full display Friday as he toured a
United Parcel Service warehouse in Atlanta where many of the
workers were blacks and members of the Teamsters. Calling for an
increase in the minimum wage and targeted tax cuts for middle-class
families, Gore told 100 workers, ``I'm in this race for the
families that are trying to pay the bills, the single parents, the
working men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Many polls have shown Gore gaining strength among Democratic
voters in the past month. A New York Times/CBS News survey held
before the conventions showed him supported by 75 percent of
self-identified Democrats, compared with Gov. George W. Bush's 86
percent support among Republicans. But after the Democratic
convention, Gore's backing among Democrats jumped to 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The return of those Democrats to Gore's column has helped him
pull even with Bush in many polls. At the same time, the vice
president seems to be draining away some voters from Nader, in part
because of a growing optimism about Gore's chances, Democrats say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it was, well, he can't win, so we might as well go to
Nader,'' said Gloria Allred, a civil rights lawyer in Los Angeles
who is a leader of the liberal wing of the California Democratic
Party. ``But now that the race is narrowing, people are beginning
to feel Gore does have a chance. And they are saying: `We can make
a difference; it's important to vote for him. And if he loses, it
will be on our heads.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Nader said that the standing-room-only crowds he has
been drawing, particularly in California and Oregon, belie polls
that show him losing support. And they contend, much like the
Republicans, that Gore's postconvention balloon will deflate as the
campaign drags on.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Nader supporters acknowledge that Gore's bashing
of big oil and drug companies has stolen some of the Green Party
candidate's thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his populist message gives him a better chance with
working people than what we've heard before,'' said Dan McCarthy,
the president of a United Auto Workers local in Michigan and leader
of a group called Labor for Nader.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, relations between liberals and Gore, a longtime
leader of the party's centrist wing, are not entirely smooth. For
instance, Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., who has criticized the lack
of black agents on Gore's Secret Service detail, asserted in a
statement last month that the vice president's ``Negro tolerance
level has never been too high.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was issued in response to a civil suit brought by
three black Secret Service agents against the government. Ten black
agents last week called on Gore to show ``moral leadership'' on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the statement on Friday, McKinney disavowed it,
calling it a draft never intended for release.
</P>
<P>
   But such potholes aside, the Gore campaign has been moving
swiftly to consolidate his support among blacks and other core
Democrats. On Saturday, some of his chief aides, including Donna
Brazile, the campaign manager, will meet in Chicago with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson to plot get-out-the-vote strategies in black and
Hispanic communities.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's son, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat from Chicago
who had been critical of Gore during the Democratic convention,
said Friday that the vice president's shift toward discussing
``working-family issues'' had eased liberal concerns about the
ticket and its centrist platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ticket is talking more about expanding prosperity,'' he
said. ``When this campaign focuses on those issues, Al Gore wins.''

<P>
   Some black Democrats and union officials had complained about
Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running mate
because Lieberman has been critical of affirmative action and
staked out centrist positions on school vouchers, military spending
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews over the past two days, many Democrats said
Lieberman has allayed many of their concerns. And they asserted
that his popularity has grown within their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among African Americans, it has given Gore a real boost,''
said Assemblyman Roger Green, a black Democrat from New York who
supported Bradley in the primaries, referring to Lieberman's
selection. ``It demonstrated vision and courage about diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic activists traced the origins of Gore's rise to
his acceptance speech at the convention, in which he staunchly
defended many traditional Democratic values, like workers' rights,
abortion rights and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the speech had a huge effect,'' said
Robert Borosage, co-director of Campaign for America's Future, a
liberal advocacy group. ``There has been an energy from that, and
from a lift in the polls, that excites people.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of those party activists also warned that Gore's
support among traditional Democrats could deflate if he abandons
his populist message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test will come in October,'' Reich said. ``He has to
stay as strong as he can on those themes.''

AS DETAILS OF DELIVERYMAN KILLING EMERGE, SUSPECTS' PARENTS ARE
SHATTERED 
</HEADLINE>
   This article was reported by David Barstow, Sarah Kershaw and
Winnie Hu and written by Barstow.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were parents and grandparents who thought they
had fully grasped the perils facing their teen-agers in the tough
working-class streets north of Kennedy Airport in Queens. They said
that they understood the power of peers, the lure of gangs and
drugs, the impact of movies and music and television that, with
relentless repetition, depicted a culture of casual violence.
</P>
<P>
   And, they said, they believed they had taken the necessary
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   They gave their children beepers and cellular phones to keep
better track of them. They lined up mentors, and set curfews, and
encouraged faith. When there were small signs of trouble _ skipped
classes, foul language, low grades _ they cracked down with more
rules. They had heart-to-heart talks about being leaders not
followers, about making distinctions between friends and
manipulators, and of course they prayed, as parents everywhere do,
that all their efforts, however imperfect, had somehow inoculated
their babies from trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, when the detectives began knocking at their
doors with questions about murder and robbery, many of these adults
said that they began for the first time to recognize with
terrifying clarity the limits of their control over their children.
Five teen-agers, ages 14 to 17 _ each from relatively stable
middle-class homes, and none with a criminal record _ are accused
of luring Jin-Sheng Liu, the owner of the Golden Wok restaurant, to
a secluded, vacant house in Springfield Gardens, Queens, and then,
during a bungled ambush to steal their $60 order of Chinese food,
beating him to death with a brick.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, the teen-agers have confessed to
varying degrees of involvement, and so now _ between waves of
tears, anger and disbelief, between frantic calls to lawyers and
fending off reporters _ five stunned families find themselves
confronting a nightmarish tangle of questions. Where did they fail?
What did they miss? What more could they have done?
</P>
<P>
   ``It just rips you apart,'' said Jean Smith, the mother of James
Stone, the 16-year-old who police officials said threw a sheet over
Liu's head moments before his skull was shattered by repeated
blows. ``It makes you think maybe you failed. But I tell you, I
tried so hard. I tried my hardest. My whole family did.''
</P>
<P>
   The contours of this parental anguish became clear this week
during extended interviews with relatives of three of the
teen-agers and with neighbors, close friends or lawyers for the
other two. Deepening their anguish is an unfathomable reality: An
immigrant who struggled resolutely to build a restaurant business
is dead, leaving behind a wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so terrible for what happened,'' said the mother of
Robert Savage, 14, who police say was the one who hit Liu with the
brick. ``Can you imagine what they are going through? They lost
their father for what? Stupid food. I cannot believe I raised that
child. He knows better than that.'' She added, ``I can't eat, I
can't sleep. I really had no idea my life could get into something
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday night, only hours before Liu's death, all five
teen-agers seemed fully occupied with the usual rhythms of teen-age
life.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the evening, Jamel Murphy, 17, was flirting with girls
at one of his favorite hangouts _ the Foster-Laurie Police Athletic
League building in St. Albans, Queens. A tall, stocky boy who was
obsessed with the notion of playing professional basketball, Murphy
had spent most every day of the summer at the building, coaching a
basketball team of 9- and 10-year-old boys. His supervisors gave
him high marks.
</P>
<P>
   But that night, children were performing dance routines to the
music of Whitney Houston, and Murphy watched some of the
performances with his close friend, Ebony Cheston, 16. He and
Cheston had talked often recently of their futures, of getting out
of Queens. Cheston said they had both become wary of street
violence. Murphy had vowed to avoid confrontation. ``I'll walk
away,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy left about 7:30 p.m., telling Cheston he was going to see
his friend, Darryl Tyson, 17, another student at Hillcrest High
School in Queens. Tyson lived in Springfield Gardens, in a
neighborhood of twisting dead-end streets and single-family homes
just off Merrick Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Stacy Royster, 17, had already caught a bus to
Tyson's home from her grandmother's house in Rosedale on the
eastern edge of Queens. She knew Tyson from high school, and they
remained close friends even after Royster left school and finished
her studies at home.
</P>
<P>
   Royster was about to begin her first semester at Queensborough
Community College. She had just bought her first batch of
textbooks, said her grandmother, Anastasia Brown, who has raised
Royster since the death of her mother nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Brown worried about her granddaughter; she was fragile, prone to
acting out, vulnerable, she said. For several years the girl had
struggled with bipolar disorder, but doctors assured Brown that
Royster would be fine if she took her medication. Around 8 p.m.,
Brown decided to beep her. Royster promptly called her back from
the cell phone her grandmother had given her for just that purpose.
``Stacy, don't get home too late,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a few blocks from Tyson's home, James Stone was
getting ready to say goodbye to his mother, who was leaving that
night for a church bus trip to Canada. Stone moved to Queens only
last spring. He had lived with his father in Atlanta, but they had
been quarreling. His parents decided he should live with his
mother, who had recently remarried.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 49, a senior teletype operator for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said that while her son fit in well at home, he sometimes
struggled at August Martin High School in Queens. He was often
bored by school, she said, and he sometimes cut classes. Nor was
she pleased with some of his new friends. Alarmed, she convened
family meetings. She suggested Bible readings to her son. More
recently, she said, she had decided and he had readily agreed that
he should attend a Catskill boarding school that emphasized
military discipline.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I always worried about Jay,'' she said, ``because he's a boy,
and boys don't like to stay home, and there are so many temptations
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But that Friday night, she felt certain that her son was in good
hands with her husband, Ralph Smith, a maintenance man. Her son,
she said, had grown close to his stepfather _ he called him ``Pop''
_ and she had also taken comfort in a recent conversation. They had
been watching a movie that showed a grisly murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, that's so cold hearted,'' her son had said, prompting
a discussion about the consequences of violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, her main worry was that the two men would eat
right while she was away. She stocked the kitchen with steaks and
hamburgers, gave her son $20, and laid out smothered pork chops,
green beans and corn for dinner that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be good,'' she told her son, giving him a hug and a kiss
before driving off about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Five doors up the road, the parents of Robert Savage were
getting anxious. He had said he would be home by 10, but he wasn't.
So his father went out looking for him. It was a typical response,
neighbors said, describing the 14-year-old's parents as doting but
strict. Recently, they had been warning him to stay away from older
boys, some of whom liked to gather at a nearby dead end and drink
Olde English Malt and smoke marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been fighting about that for months,'' his mother
said. ``I talk to him loud, I talk to him soft, I beg.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear, investigators said, who among the teen-agers
raised the idea of robbing a deliveryman, or how they arrived at
their plan to ambush Liu, a slightly built man, 5 feet 6 inches
tall.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 10 years, Liu had run the Golden Wok, a take-out
restaurant at 192nd Street and Linden Boulevard, in St. Albans, not
far from where the teen-agers were hanging out that night. He made
the deliveries himself.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, the teen-agers had a scheme: Royster was to
order the food from her cellular phone and greet the deliveryman.
When he got there, she would stand up to reach into her pockets, as
if she were going to pay. The four boys, three of them holding a
bricks and one of them holding an old bedsheet to cover Liu's head,
were to wait in hiding, then jump him.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that deliverymen can be suspicious, particularly when
young people order food, they decided that Royster should place the
order because, as a girl, she would be perceived as less of a
threat. Royster placed the first call at 10:52 p.m., ordering
General Tso's chicken, shrimp egg foo yong, chicken with broccoli
and shrimp lo mein _ $60 worth of food in all, according to police
and prosecutors. Murphy told police that he wore a latex glove
because he was going to search the man's car for money, according
to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Having been robbed twice before while making deliveries, Liu,
44, called back to confirm the order and the address, investigators
said. Royster called the restaurant three more times before Liu
arrived, at least once to change the address, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurant workers along Linden Boulevard, a lively
commercial strip dotted with takeout places and Caribbean-style
restaurants, say they have had to take extra precautions when
making deliveries. Several have installed caller-ID to verify phone
numbers; sometimes they call back and cancel orders if no one
answers. Others avoid venturing into rougher neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the change of address, Liu went ahead with the delivery.
And shortly before 11:30 p.m., he pulled up to the house and got
out of his car carrying two bags of food. He walked across a grassy
patch of lawn toward the stoop, and Royster greeted him and
pretended she was going to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The four boys jumped out of the bushes and descended on Liu in a
flash of chaos and violence, punching and trying to choke him and
then eventually killing him by smashing him in the head with a
brick, according to police and court records. Stone, who had gone
to his house around the corner to get the sheet, threw it over
Liu's head, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers gave varying accounts to police of what happened
next.
</P>
<P>
   Stone told investigators that when Liu got to the house, Tyson
started choking him and wrestled him to the ground as he struggled
to break free, before Savage smashed him with the brick, according
to court records. Royster told investigators that after Stone threw
the sheet over Liu's head, all four of the boys were fighting with
him. Savage told the police Tyson first grabbed Liu from behind
while Stone put the sheet over his head, and then Savage hit him
with the brick.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Richard Bellucci, commanding officer of the 113th detective
squad in Jamaica, who oversaw the police investigation, said that
it was hard to sort out exactly how the attack unfolded, but that
he believed Tyson and Murphy had grabbed Liu and started choking
and punching him. The lieutenant said Savage was the only one to
use a brick in the attack, even though two other boys had brought
bricks to the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened all at once,'' he said, adding, ``This went down
very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers then fled, taking one bag of the Chinese food
with them, and going to Tyson's house, a few blocks away on 178th
Street, where, they told police, they hid for several hours,
Bellucci said. They ate the food there.
</P>
<P>
   For a few days, their worlds remained intact. Royster prepared
for her first day of college. Stone's mother returned from her
church trip and completed his application for boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard some Chinese man died,'' Tyson told a friend he met at
Green Acres Mall.
</P>
<P>
   None of their parents suspected a thing.
</P>
<P>
   But by Tuesday, having traced the cell phone calls to Royster
and confronted her, detectives from the 113th Precinct fanned out
to make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   When they knocked on Stone's door at 11:30 p.m., his mother
cried out in panic. She assumed they were there to tell her that
her son was dead.
</P>
<P>
   She said her son at first calmly denied everything.
</P>
<P>
   Today, what makes her most angry is the suggestion that a man
died because her son and his friends wanted a free meal. ``He had a
hot dinner on a stove and a house full of food,'' she said, adding
that she had since given her son her Bible to read in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's father was so angry that a day after the arrest he was
shaking with rage. Meanwhile, the players at the athletic league
were stunned to see their coach on television, head down and in
handcuffs. One of his players, Ebony Cheston's brother, burst into
tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal was his mentor,'' Cheston said.
</P>
<P>
   Savage's mother, who came to this country from the West Indies,
said she could barely bring herself to talk to distant friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so ashamed of what has happened,'' she said, weeping.
``I'm afraid even to let people know. I'm ashamed of it, even
though I didn't do anything.''

 &HT;    Judge: ACLU can sue governor
 &HT;    By Tracie Powell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Protesters who were arrested outside the
Governor's Mansion last fall can continue with their lawsuit
against George W. Bush, a Travis County district judge decided
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Dietz ruled for the second time that the American
Civil Liberties Union could sue Bush, along with the Department of
Public Safety, for violating protesters' freedom of speech and
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were arrested four different times on the
sidewalk outside the Governor's Mansion while demonstrating against
environmental policies that Bush supported. Charges of blocking an
entry were later dropped in each of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU filed a lawsuit in August 1999 against Bush and the
DPS. Assistant Attorney General Paul Matula, who is representing
the governor's office, claimed Bush shouldn't be a party to the
lawsuit because security policies at the mansion were made by DPS
without participation from Bush or his office.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, Dietz decided to allow the lawsuit to go
forward. He later told government lawyers they could file a motion
asking him to reconsider his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dietz on Friday explained that he was more familiar with DPS
rules now than when he made the original ruling and wanted the
record to reflect that. But Dietz said that does not preclude Bush
from avoiding the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   No trial date has been set, although Dietz said no action is
likely until after the November presidential election. Lawyers on
both sides will meet next week to discuss a settlement, Bush
spokeswoman Linda Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   After the decision, civil rights lawyer David Kahne declared
victory, while Bush representatives said it's too soon to say what
steps they will take next.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature for us to make a decision before the
mediation,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights lawyers charge that the governor authorized and
encouraged police to ``exclude people who peacefully express
opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have said they were trying to keep protesters safe.

WHITMAN INTERVENES TO HALT BEAR HUNT IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ New Jersey's first bear hunt in 30 years
appeared doomed on Friday, 10 days before its planned start, after
Gov. Christie Whitman asked the state's Fish and Game Council to
cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she put into place a new state bear control
policy that she called wiser and safer than a general hunt. The new
policy would target bears that break into homes, kill livestock,
attack pets or otherwise threaten people, and would allow specially
trained municipal police officers to shoot them on sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that our bear management strategy will provide a
higher degree of overall safety than the proposed random hunt
targeted at 175 bears of all ages,'' Whitman said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman had been an early supporter of the hunt, citing public
safety. But a coalition opposed to hunting has mounted a steadily
growing campaign since May, prompting Whitman to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four months, opponents of the hunt have flooded
her offices with letters and petitions, prompted the state Senate
to pass a bill prohibiting hunting, and persuaded 25 towns _
including several in bear terrain in the state's wooded northwest
corner _ to pass resolutions seeking the hunt's cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tittel, executive director of the Sierra Club of New
Jersey, which is a member of the coalition, said that many people
opposed the hunt because they viewed it as a sign that the state's
once-dense woodlands were being suburbanized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can save the black bears, we can save what we love about
the uniqueness and the beauty of the area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's office released her letter to the council while she
was attending a luncheon in Manhattan honoring China's president,
Jiang Zemin, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Afterward, as diplomats
meandered through the hotel lobby, Whitman held a news conference
there on bears.
</P>
<P>
   She said that bears in the state had been nearly extinct in the
early 1970s, but that the population had recovered to about 1,000
animals. Some bears, she said, were becoming more and more
accustomed to the growing number of people in the northwestern
towns.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she could not unilaterally suspend the hunt because
the Fish and Game Council was an independent agency empowered to
write the state's hunting rules. But she and aides in Trenton said
they believed that the council would grant her request. If it does
not, she said, she will ask the state's attorney general, John J.
Farmer, to explore ways to get a court order blocking the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   In June, when the antihunt campaign was gathering momentum, the
governor urged the council to reduce the number of bears to be
killed this fall to 175 from 350, and the council unanimously
approved her request.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Division of Fish and Wildlife proposed the hunt
because the number of complaints about the animals had increased to
1,659 in 1999 from 285 in 1995. Among the problems were reports of
29 bears breaking into homes, up from three in 1995, and 28 bears
rummaging around campgrounds and parks, up from five in 1995.
Attacks on livestock and pets also increased sharply in the last
half of the 1990s. But no attacks on people have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Under Whitman's new policy, the state will step up its actions
against problem bears. Those that routinely meander through
backyards or otherwise pose a nuisance will be tranquilized, tagged
and removed to thick woodlands. If they return to populated areas,
they will be killed.

GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE SPEAR, LEEDS &AMP; KELLOGG 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Group, the investment banking firm, is in talks to
acquire Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, the biggest maker of markets in
listed stocks and one of the biggest traders on the Nasdaq stock
market, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on the
possibility, as did executives of Spear, Leeds, a private company.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, if completed would be Goldman's biggest since
going public in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has shown interest in acquiring one of the leading
Nasdaq trading firms to increase its role in electronic trading,
especially technology company stocks, such as Microsoft, Cisco
Systems and WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Goldman paid $531 million for the Hull Group, a
Chicago-based trading firm that buys and sells futures, options and
stocks electronically on 28 exchanges in nine countries.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials considered buying Herzog Heine Geduld, a
market maker based in Jersey City, N.J., before it was bought in
mid-July by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. using about $1 billion of its
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, which earned $846 million
on revenue of $2.7 billion in the nine months ended June 30, could
be worth several times what Merrill paid for Herzog.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Spear, Leeds, the fourth-biggest Nasdaq market maker,
would give Goldman a 21 percent stake in Redibook, one of a new
breed of electronic exchanges known as electronic communication
networks. Earlier this year, Spear, Leeds sold shares of Redibook
to other financial firms, including Fidelity Investments and
Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would make Goldman the biggest specialist firm
on the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.
Specialists operate trading posts on the floor of an exchange at
which they match buyers and sellers for particular stocks and often
use their own money to buy or sell shares. Their numbers have been
dwindling through a series of mergers, and some analysts fear that
with the trend toward more electronic trading, specialists will
gradually lose their value.

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush abandoned his effort to impose
his own schedule of presidential debates on Friday, and his
campaign said it was prepared to sit down with aides to Vice
President Al Gore to work out an agreement for debating under the
auspices of a bipartisan commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers responded that they were willing to meet with
the Bush campaign. The Commission on Presidential Debates, the
bipartisan panel that has been organizing the debates since 1988,
said it had received a call on Friday from Bush's campaign
chairman, Don Evans, and immediately began trying to arrange a
meeting with representatives of both campaigns next week in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's decision did not appear to guarantee that
Bush would sign off on the commission's original plan for three
debates next month on college campuses in Boston, Winston-Salem,
N.C., and St. Louis, all of which Gore has agreed to. Advisers to
Bush continued to insist on Friday that while the campaign might
agree to two of the commission's debates, it remained opposed to
the Boston event and wanted to replace it with a network-sponsored
debate, perhaps with CNN's Larry King as moderator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows there have got to be two commission debates,
and everybody knows there has to be an agreement soon,'' said an
adviser to Bush who spoke on condition of anonymity. Aides to Bush
repeated their position that Boston was not acceptable, because the
debate is to be held on the University of Massachusetts campus
adjacent to the John F. Kennedy Library, which honors a Democratic
president. ``I can't think of any reason in the world why we'd do
that,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign announced the shift in the face of what aides
to the governor described as mounting criticism from prominent
Republicans, and a desire to put a distracting issue to rest. Bush
made the proposal on Sunday night, challenging Gore to two network
debates, one on CNN and one on NBC, in addition to one sponsored by
the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Because the network debates were likely to attract many fewer
viewers than the commission debates, which would be broadcast on
multiple networks and cable outlets, many Democrats accused Bush of
trying to avoid wide exposure.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush tried to used Gore's rejection of the idea to
raise questions about the vice president's credibility, even some
members of Bush's staff suggested the strategy was not working.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bush advisers on Friday sought to shift blame for
the collapse of their proposal on Gore, saying that he had made it
clear he would not attend a debate proposed by Bush for next week
on a prime time edition of ``Meet the Press'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC News has told us that they have received a letter from
Vice President Gore indicating that he will not attend the debate
next Tuesday night,'' Bush's communications director, Karen P.
Hughes, told reporters during a brief campaign layover on the
tarmac of an airport here on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes added that Gore's refusal came ``despite the fact that he
had accepted that debate and said he will debate anytime, anywhere.
NBC News reiterated today that they will not host the debate unless
both candidates are there.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC News and the Gore campaign disputed the suggestion by Hughes
that the letter was breaking news. Gore's aides announced days ago
the vice presidentwould not participate. And Barbara Levin, an NBC
spokeswoman, said the network has had that rejection letter from
William M. Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, since Sunday, the day
Bush unveiled his debate plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent that letter within an hour of Gov. Bush's press
conference,'' said Mark Fabiani, the Gore campaign communications
director. ``We faxed it to Tim Russert at his home and at his
office.'' Russert is the host of ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning on Friday that Bush had abandoned his plan, Daley
said he welcomed the opportunity to meet with the governor's staff,
but he seemed inclined to stick with the commission's original plan
of three debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go in and hear what they have to say,'' he said. ``Right
now our attitude is three. It's only four and a half hours in a
campaign that lasts thousands of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's had contended his proposal, which included the 90-minute
debate in St. Louis sponsored by the commission, plus two 60-minute
debates, on ``Meet the Press'' on Tuesday and on ``Larry King
Live'' on Oct. 3, was an effort to invigorate the debates by
providing a variety of formats. Gore, however, sought to
characterize the proposal as an effort to limit viewership. Two
major networks left out of the Bush plan, ABC and CBS, announced
that they would not carry debates on rivals' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Debate commission officials have said repeatedly that they are
willing to negotiate over the formats of the debates, and would
even entertain the campaigns' suggestions for moderators. But they
have been less willing to forgo the debate sites, which were chosen
from proposals submitted by dozens of institutions around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for holding only two debates. Four years ago,
one of the three commission debates was canceled because President
Clinton had a scheduling conflict.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: WRESTLING  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Controversy surrounded selection of the U.S. Greco-Roman
wrestling team when welterweight Matt Lindland protested the third
match of his 2-1 loss to Keith Sieracki in the 167.5-pound class at
July's Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   An arbitrator ruled that the match be rewrestled last month, and
Lindland won, leading USA Wrestling to name him to the Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute eventually hit the courts. Last week, the Supreme
Court Justice John Paul Stevens rejected a request by the U.S.
Olympic Committee to keep Lindland off the team.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   Freestyle wrestlers can use their arms and legs for holds, but
Greco-Roman wrestlers cannot use the legs to attack their
opponents. Wrestlers are divided into eight weight classes for each
style, from 119 to 286 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of two three-minute rounds, wrestlers can score
technical points for various holds, maneuvers or throws. A wrestler
wins with a pin _ holding his opponent's shoulders to the mat for
half a second, or by scoring 10 points more than his opponent. A
winner must score at least three points to win a match. If there is
a tie, the match enters a three-minute overtime. If the score is
still tied, or neither wrestler has reached three points, a
majority vote is taken by the referee, judge and mat chairman.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   There is one dominant wrestler: Alexsander Karelin, the
286-pound Russian who has won three consecutive gold medals and
nine world championships. In his trademark maneuver, he lifts
opponents off the ground and throws them over his head. Karelin
beat the American Matt Ghaffari for the 1996 gold.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, his leading opponents include Hector Milian of Cuba,
Sergei Mourieko of Bulgaria and Giuseppe Giunta of Italy. Rulon
Gardner, the U.S. entrant in this weight class, is a two-time Pan
American champion and three-time U.S. nationals winner.

 &HT;    University turns down $12.5 million giftBy Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After being courted by his alma mater for three
years, Wayne Reaud, one of the state's most prominent trial
lawyers, agreed to give Texas Tech University's law school $12.5
million, easily the largest such gift ever to the law school.
</P>
<P>
   But the university board wouldn't take it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gift had been solicited and negotiated by the
university chancellor, John Montford, and law school dean, Frank
Newton, the board said that under the circumstances, $12.5 million
wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Reaud (pronounced REE-o) had understood that in return for the
donation, the university would name its 30-year-old law school
after him and his wife, Dana. He's a 1974 graduate of the law
school.
</P>
<P>
   But the board said the price tag for naming a university school
after a donor was much higher _ $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Montford said there was a simple, though unfortunate,
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   What Tech was willing to do, Montford said, was rename its law
school building, not its law school. ``I'm sorry if that got lost
in the translation, and I'm not blaming it on him _ I'm blaming it
on me,'' Montford said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaud, who practices in Beaumont and helped the state sue the
tobacco industry, thinks the real reason for the board's refusal
was political, that Gov. George W. Bush or his business and
Republican supporters couldn't stand the idea of the law school
being named after one of their ``enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it didn't work because I was a trial lawyer
that had been targeted by the Bush people, or by Bush and his
people, as a large Democratic contributor and an enemy of the
governor,'' Reaud said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly never considered myself an enemy of the governor,
but I was told he considers me such,'' Reaud said last week. He
previously had declined to comment after the Tech board failed to
accept his proposed gift at its meeting in May.
</P>
<P>
   All nine members of Texas Tech's board are Bush appointees, and
Reaud, 52, has not been a Bush supporter. He contributed $75,000 to
the Democratic candidate for governor, Garry Mauro, in his losing
1998 campaign against Bush, a Republican. Reaud's law firm, Reaud,
Morgan &AMP; Quinn of Beaumont, gave another $5,000 to Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office said it was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's office played no role in this action by the
Texas Tech board of regents,'' said Mike Jones, a spokesman for
Bush. The governor, he said, trusts the regents ``to make decisions
that are in the best interests of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sowell, chairman of Texas Tech's board, said the $12.5
million gift from the Reauds had been welcome but fell well short
of the $25 million threshold previously set for a university school
to be named after a donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very simple, cut and dried _ the gift was not large
enough for us to name the law school after him,'' Sowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Montford said that renaming the law school in honor of a $12.5
million donor could undercut efforts to persuade other wealthy
donors to give $25 million to get a university institution named
after them. Negotiations with at least four such potential donors
are under way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for politics, Montford said he was not pressured by anybody
to reject the gift and noted that he is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Sowell, a construction company owner, also denied that Reaud's
politics or status as a plaintiffs' lawyer was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there are those who don't care for lawyers,'' Sowell
said, ``but shoot, we've got a law school. We're in the business of
training lawyers. So it was certainly no factor from my point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton, the law school dean, said he was embarrassed by what had
happened after he and Montford had worked hard _ Montford said for
three years _ to persuade Reaud to make a big contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Newton said most Tech alumni he had talked with favored the
potential gift as a great opportunity for the law school. But, he
added, the gift was ``not well received locally.''
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers _ also known as personal injury or plaintiffs'
lawyers _ have become a favorite target of criticism from business
interests and Republicans, who say they manipulate the legal system
to force business, insurance and medical defendants to pay
settlements on questionable claims rather than risk even bigger
judgments from a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Reaud has been a highly successful trial lawyer, even before he
helped the state win a $17.3 billion settlement from the tobacco
industry. His Beaumont law firm is one of five Texas firms sharing
in $3.3 billion in legal fees to be paid over the next 25 years for
winning that settlement.
</P>
<P>
   He and the other tobacco trial lawyers also are the subject of
an investigation by Attorney General John Cornyn, a Republican, who
has questioned how they got the contract to represent the state
from his predecessor, former Attorney General Dan Morales, a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact I was a successful trial lawyer operated to my
disadvantage in this deal,'' Reaud said. (He also said that
Cornyn's probe is ``certainly'' motivated by political
considerations.)
</P>
<P>
   Newton said that what Reaud and the university had negotiated
was in two parts. The Reauds would put up $2.5 million, matched
with $2.5 million from the university, to update the law school
building technologically.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they were going to put up $10 million for a special
scholarship program that Dana Reaud had called a Peace Corps for
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarship program would have paid all of a student's
tuition and fees, plus $1,000 a month in living expenses. In
return, after graduation, the student would be required to spend
three years in some sort of public service _ pushing environmental
cases, for example, or representing battered women _ rather than
immediately sign up with a private law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Reaud said that he's looking elsewhere to make major
contributions, but not Texas Tech. ``They're not on my list _ which
is unfortunate, frankly, for them as well as me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Montford, himself a lawyer, said the Reaud situation was ``my
only fumble'' in his hard-charging Horizon Campaign, which so far
has raised $450 million for Texas Tech. And he said he will try
again to get help from Reaud: ``I'm not going to give up that
easily.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Lieberman blasts Bush health care
 &HT;    Democratic VP hopeful visits low-income workers here
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By ALAN BERNSTEIN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman slammed Republican Gov. George W. Bush's record on health
care for Texas children Friday at a Houston meeting with low-income
workers who have fought state agencies for family aid.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have conceded the Texas vote to Bush in the
presidential election, so Lieberman's first trip to the state since
joining Al Gore's ticket was meant to be a message about health
care to undecided voters in states where the contest is close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush may say that he has a plan to improve children's
health across America, but I think we have a right to ask: `Why
hasn't he done it in Texas?' '' Lieberman said at the municipal
Magnolia Multi-Service Center on the east side.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator, criticizing the state's performance on
providing medical insurance for children through Medicaid and the
Children's Health Insurance Program, said Bush ``has just not made
children's health coverage and care a priority.'' His remarks
worked in conjunction with a Democratic National Committee
television commercial _ airing outside Texas _ that trumpets a
federal judge's recent ruling that the state has not kept a 1996
legal promise to improve children's health care.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Lt. Gov. Rick Perry led a counterattack Friday in a
news conference at a southwest Houston clinic run by Harris
County's public health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is using the federal aid programs better than most other
states, Perry said, and any remaining problems should be blamed on
restrictions created by President Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will backfire on Al Gore and Joe Lieberman to come
to the state of Texas,'' Perry said. ``I think Texans are tired of
people using the state as a whipping post for their political
expediency.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were careful, though, to separate the Lone Star State
from the Republican Party's presidential contender. With a Texas
flag displayed to their left, Lieberman and Mayor Lee Brown, who
led off Friday's event, referred to Texas as ``a great state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know Governor Bush very well and as far as I can tell
he is an honorable and decent man,'' said Lieberman. ``But we are
going to talk about (his) record.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Bush was against providing the CHIP to
children of families who earn as much as twice the annual poverty
standard. The Texas Legislature adopted the policy anyway, and
Democrats say it made about 220,000 children eligible for health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also charged that under Bush, the state ``has kept in
place a very cumbersome bureaucratic red tape that has kept almost
600,000 eligible children from enrolling in health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining with Perry, physician and Republican state Rep. Kyle
Janek of Houston said he and Bush had favored CHIP funding for
children of families earning at 1.5 times the poverty rate, rather
than double, to make sure the poorest children got benefits at a
time when the amount of CHIP funding was unknown. Now, with
assurance that the higher earning limit is affordable, Texas is
enrolling children in the program faster than California and other
states, Janek said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Judge Robert Eckels said that regardless of
whether Texas children have health insurance from private or
government sources, they can still qualify for free or discounted
health care from agencies such as the county hospital district.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said that Gore as president would expand health
insurance coverage and options for the working poor. He said his
indictment of Bush's performance was bolstered by the stories told
in a talk-show format Friday by eight adults, some of whom brought
their children to the meeting with the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Landscaper Michael Zamarron said he doesn't earn enough to buy
private insurance for his infant, and had to pay for medical care
with money borrowed from relatives while battling with the state to
get Medicaid benefits for the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a cop in the military, we didn't have to do half
that paperwork,'' Zamarron said.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in the group, which was hand-picked to include
whites, blacks and Hispanics, Zamarron praised the CHIP program in
Texas and offered no criticism of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That may not have supported the points Lieberman was trying to
make. But audience member Garnet Coleman, a Democratic state
representative from Houston who specializes in health care issues,
said the children of the people who spoke with Lieberman might not
have qualified for CHIP funds under the rules favored by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Limas said she had to pawn her truck to help pay for her
toddler son's hernia operation. The state agency that administers
Medicaid disqualified her family for aid, she said, because her
husband had enough money to pay child support to his previous wife.
</P>
<P>
   When Limas explained that her husband wanted the family to
scrape by without help from any other government program, Lieberman
said that ``it's your right'' to apply for benefits and that her
husband has an admirable attitude but ``shouldn't be too proud
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Angela Gehring, a divorced mother of three children who
lacks sufficient income while seeking a master's degree, ``The
responsibility of government is to cover you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is scheduled to return to Texas on Monday with
campaign stops in Dallas and Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Outside his Houston event, about 20 labor union members yelled
support for the Democratic ticket, alongside five Republican
boosters who chanted, ``Bush is the cure.''

   GOLDMAN SACHS IS IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE SPEAR, LEEDS
</P>

   Goldman Sachs Group, the investment banking firm, is in serious
talks to acquire Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, the biggest maker of
markets in listed stocks and one of the biggest traders on the
Nasdaq stock market, according to a person with knowledge of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, if completed, would be Goldman Sachs' biggest
since it went public in May 1999. Goldman has shown interest in

felony counts of conspiracy, money laundering and securities fraud.
Under the terms of his plea, Pace agreed to give $3 million
immediately to the U.S. government. He is subject to additional
fines, to be determined by the court, that will go into a
restitution fund for investors who lost $200 million or more as a
result of the conspiracy, prosecutors said.

being sued by his mother, who contends that he owes her millions of
dollars. Anne Steinberg filed a lawsuit in state Supreme Court in
New York demanding that her son repay almost $5 million that she
says he borrowed from her in 1997 and promised to repay on Dec. 31,
1999.

   CONSULTANTS CORNER VOTER MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle International, a consulting firm, has compiled the
United States' largest voter data bank _ the names of 150 million
Americans registered to vote. And it is selling them to politicians
like George W. Bush, Joe Lieberman and John McCain in ways that
many fear removes too much privacy from the voting booth. Aristotle
has a client list that reads like a political convention: 45
senators, more than 200 members of the House, state parties and
every major presidential candidate except Al Gore, whose campaign
says it will not hire any firm whose practices could jeopardize the
public's privacy.

   SLOW PROFIT GROWTH STALLS MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell as evidence of slowing profit growth prompted
investors to sell shares. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 119.94
points, or 2.9 percent, to 3,978.41. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index fell 8.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,494.50. The
Dow Jones industrial average lost 39.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to
11,220.65.

   VOTE RENEWS CALL FOR ELECTRIC CARS
</P>
<P>
   California regulators voted to keep a rule requiring that 10
percent of cars offered for sale in the state starting in 2003 emit
few or no pollutants, a goal that the industry has said is
unreachable. The unanimous decision by the California Air Resources
Board, which regulates the state's air quality, is expected to
increase the number of electric cars on the road, not only in
California but in other states that have opted to follow California
regulations.

<P>
   CRUDE OIL FALLS FROM 10-YEAR HIGH
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil fell from a 10-year high, after Saudi
Arabia signaled that OPEC would agree to expand production to trim
prices at a meeting this weekend in Vienna, Austria. Ali al-Naimi,
the Saudi oil minister, said Saudi Arabia wanted to bring prices
down to $22 to $28 a barrel for the group's oil benchmark _ the
price was $33.63 on Friday. OPEC is expected to increase daily
supplies 500,000 to 800,000 barrels.

 TOWN-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    In Danville, Ky., the debate spat hits home
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By LYNWOOD ABRAM
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Danville, Ky., loses its moment of fame because of the
squabbling over presidential campaign debates, lots of folks in
Danville will take it personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is not very popular here right now,'' reported
Vicki Glidewell, who works at Danville's Centre College. Centre is
where the debate between Democratic vice presidential nominee
Joseph Lieberman and Republican nominee Dick Cheney is scheduled
for Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   All the debates are up in the air now because Republican
presidential nominee Bush has refused to commit to the debate
schedule, proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates, that
would have included a vice-presidential face-off in Danville.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential nominee, Al Gore, has accepted that
schedule, and said he won't agree to alternatives proposed by Bush
unless Bush accepts the commission's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   John Roush, president of Centre College and the prime mover in
getting the vice-presidential debate scheduled in Danville, is
especially concerned _ though nonpartisan in his comments.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Roush said:
</P>
<P>
   ``As our nation's political leaders talk about the schedule for
this year's general election debates, I want them to remember three
things: 1. Centre College and the town of Danville were chosen by
the Commission on Presidential Debates to host a vice-presidential
debate. 2. We've now been preparing for more than a year, and we've
invested over $700,000 as well as countless hours of labor. 3. This
debate still ought to happen because it represents a historic
moment: the first time in American history that a nationally
televised (presidential) debate would originate in a small town.''
</P>
<P>
   For Danville, with a population of about 17,000 in central
Kentucky, the debate would be big news, said John Davis, editorial
page editor of the local newspaper, the Advocate-Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics, it's the biggest thing that ever happened here,''
Davis said. ``(President Franklin) Roosevelt came here in the
1930s, Ronald Reagan was here but not as a candidate or when he was
president, and Jimmy Carter gave a commencement address here after
he was president. It's a big deal here.''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which has
sponsored the presidential debates since 1968, made a firm
commitment in January to hold the one scheduled vice-presidential
debate in Danville.
</P>
<P>
   Late in August, however, Bush refused to accept the commission's
schedule. He proposed three debates with Gore: on a special edition
of NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Tuesday (Sept. 12) in Washington, D.C.;
on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' and a Spanish-language network Oct. 3
in Los Angeles; and at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct.
17 _ the only one of the three that was on the commission's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore had said he would debate Bush ``anywhere,
anytime,'' he rejected the single-network debates unless Bush
agreed to the others.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign, which had described its debate proposal as
final, renewed negotiations with Gore's camp and the commission
Friday after NBC canceled plans for its debate. The network had
said previously that it would not air the special prime-time
edition of ``Meet the Press'' unless Gore participated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said campaign chairman Don Evans
would lead the negotiations for Bush. Hughes said the 1996
presidential candidates debated only after signing a 40-page
agreement on Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed two debates between Cheney and Lieberman _ one at
Winston-Salem, N.C., and another at a place to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   No mention of Danville.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Ernie Fletcher, a Republican first-termer whose
district includes Danville and Lexington, on Thursday wrote Bush
``encouraging him to make sure that they agree to holding the
debate in Danville, regardless of what they may finalize about the
presidential debates,'' said Daniel Groves, Fletcher's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher is in a close race for re-election with Democrat Scott
Baesler.

 &HT;    Burglaries shock Palm Beach community
 &HT;    By Chris Barker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mara Perkons peered across Worth Avenue in
dismay Friday morning, taking in shop windows smashed by three
carloads of brash burglars who struck three stores before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope that they don't come back,'' said Perkons,
manager of the Louis Vuitton store across the street.
</P>
<P>
   She was just one of many well-coifed denizens who milled around
the renowned retail avenue while police detectives dusted for
fingerprints and crunched through thick pieces of fashionably green
glass left in piles outside Chanel, Gucci and Mystique Created
Gems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked because it didn't look like Worth Avenue
anymore,'' said Mariano Ordenanz, owner of a nearby jewelry store.
He didn't expect to see Worth Avenue bedecked with yellow crime
scene tape and buzzed by police helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a Friday in the off-season, the burglaries
brought almost as much attention to the island as a presidential
visit, complete with closed streets and TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   An organized group of thieves quickly smashed windows and glass
doors and made off with jewelry and designer handbags about 5 a.m.,
Palm Beach police said.
</P>
<P>
   As they fled, a stolen Nissan Maxima became the ultimate party
crasher outside Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club on South Ocean
Boulevard. One carload of burglars crashed into some trees and the
sea wall and ran through neighborhoods of the rich and famous,
sparking a hunt that lasted half the day.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies, off-duty police officers and West Palm Beach
police combed the lawns of estates and golf courses in the wee
hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Along with help of two police dogs, a helicopter and boat
patrols, the 50-strong force nabbed four males within three hours
of the car wreck, Capt. Michael Mason said. None were injured in
the wreck, but one was suffering from an old gunshot wound, Mason
said.
</P>
<P>
   To find the fifth man, Mason said he called back the uniformed
officers and sent out officers in street clothes to monitor the
area. The fifth fugitive was spotted emerging from the Lake Worth
Lagoon about 12:30 p.m., soaking wet. He was arrested about 4 miles
south of Worth Avenue, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The five were booked into the Palm Beach County jail and the
county's Juvenile Assessment Center on charges of criminal
mischief, two counts of burglary, grand theft auto, and eluding
officers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   But two carloads of burglars got away carrying an undetermined
amount of people and loot, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   As police wrapped up Friday morning, shopkeepers surveyed the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Several display cases inside the Gucci store were broken, and
mannequin necks in the Mystique picture window stood empty. At
Chanel, half of the glass front door was shattered, the other
looked as if it had been struck with a sledge hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the retailers put forth their usual positive spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our jewelry looks so good they thought they were diamonds,''
said Sarkis Kalandjian, general manager of Mystique, which
specializes in high-end, man-made jewels. ``These type of criminals
probably thought they had hit the mother lode.''
</P>
<P>
   The burglars stole about $30,000 in gems, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Police wouldn't say exactly what was taken in the burglaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance covers everything but the inconvenience,''
Ordenanz said.
</P>
<P>
   Some shopkeepers said the brazen burglaries should be answered
with more police patrols. Others seemed unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably gives them something to do,'' said Mike Ryytty,
a Federal Express driver who said he makes trips to Worth Avenue
several times a week. ``Most of the time, they're just giving out
parking tickets.''

BROKER PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD IN IPO DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Randolph Pace, a brokerage firm executive charged
with enriching himself through a wide-ranging securities fraud from
1994 to 1997, pleaded guilty Friday in Manhattan federal court to
13 felony counts of conspiracy, money laundering and securities
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In his guilty plea before Judge Loretta Preska, Pace said he had
made $2.86 million in illicit profits through the scheme, which
cost investors $200 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Pace, who was indicted by a federal grand jury in November 1998,
was co-founder of Rooney Pace Inc., a brokerage firm expelled from
the industry in 1987 by the National Association of Securities
Dealers. Pace, 54, was twice censured by regulators and was
ultimately barred from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Having been forced out of the brokerage business, Pace began to
act as a consultant to obscure start-up companies hoping to raise
capital from investors in initial public offerings of stock.
</P>
<P>
   He secretly controlled Sterling Foster, a firm that bilked
investors out of $100 million before it closed in 1997. Two other
brokerage firms, both defunct, were involved in the scheme: VTR
Capital and Investors Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Describing his crime to the judge, Pace said that as small
companies in need of capital came to him for help, he developed a
``deal structure'' that would encourage others to participate. That
structure involved issuing substantial amounts of stock to company
founders and consultants, like Pace, at very low prices before the
public offerings. Pace said he offered these deals to friends and
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Pace described how these insiders arranged to sell their shares
upon the company's IPO even though the company's financial filings
stated that the shares were subject to lock-up agreements
restricting their sale. ``I understood that this made the documents
false and misleading,'' Pace said.
</P>
<P>
   The former executive also admitted that he tried to hide his
involvement in certain deals by arranging for other individuals to
get cheap stock in companies on his behalf before their offerings.
He would then split the profits with these people. ``Regulators
became uncomfortable with my presence in some of the deals,'' Pace
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 companies in which Pace and others made illicit profits
are Lasergate Systems, Advanced Voice Technologies, Com/Tech
Communication Technologies, Embryo Development Corp., Applewoods
Inc., ML Direct, Interiors Inc., Compare Generiks, Perry's Majestic
Beer, Decor Group and Superior Supplements. None of the companies
have been charged with wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Also pleading guilty Friday to nine felony counts was Warren
Schreiber, a broker at VTR Capital who took part in the scheme.
Schreiber agreed to forfeit a property he owns in Westhampton,
N.Y., to pay restitution to investors who lost money.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the court, Pace tried to distance himself
from the fraudulent sales practices conducted by Sterling Foster,
VTR Capital and Investors Associates, which brought the companies
public. He did not apologize for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of his plea, Pace agreed to give $3 million
immediately to the U.S. government. He is subject to additional
fines, to be determined by the court, that will go into a
restitution fund for investors who lost money in the conspiracy,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Pace is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 21. The maximum
penalty he faces is 135 years, but under sentencing guidelines he
will probably receive a sentence of seven to nine years.

AT INDIAN BUREAU, A MILESTONE AND AN APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., N.M., Hawaii)   (subs for some rewriting and additional details; story grows by
about 100 words)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bureau of Indian Affairs marked its 175th
anniversary Friday in a ceremony that blended sorrow, hope and a
remarkable apology from the bureau's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, this is no occasion for celebration,'' said Kevin
Gover, the assistant interior secretary who heads the bureau.
Instead, he said, it was a time ``for sorrowful truths to be
spoken, a time for contrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Gover said he was apologizing to American Indians on behalf of
the bureau, not the government as a whole, though White House
officials saw an advance copy of the statement and did not object.
</P>
<P>
   Gover recounted the bureau's evolution from a War Department
office that dealt with what white Americans regarded as the
``Indian problem'' to an Interior Department agency entrusted with
promoting tribal autonomy and improving the lives of Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In forcing Indians from their land and trying to stamp out their
cultures and languages, ``this agency participated in the ethnic
cleansing that befell the Western tribes,'' Gover said. ``This
agency set out to destroy all things Indian. The legacy of these
misdeeds haunts us.'' Even after its mission changed, he said, and
``despite the efforts of many good people with good hearts,'' the
bureau made little headway against the alcoholism, drug abuse and
domestic violence that afflict Indian life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us begin by expressing our profound sorrow for what the
agency has done in the past,'' he said, then offered a formal
apology to Indians.
</P>
<P>
   What made his gesture remarkable is that Gover is himself a
member of the Pawnee tribe. ``I realized it was partly for me,'' he
said later of his statement.
</P>
<P>
   His voice faltered as he spoke of ``the decimation of the mighty
bison herds, the use of the poison alcohol to destroy mind and
body, and the cowardly killing of women and children.'' Such
suffering, he said, ``made for tragedy on a scale so ghastly that
it cannot be dismissed as merely the inevitable consequence of the
clash of competing ways of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Gover, 45, stood as a bridge between two societies. He
came from a poor family in Lawton, Okla., and went to Princeton
through an affirmative action program and with the help of federal
scholarship aid. He earned a degree in public and international
affairs, then graduated from the University of New Mexico law
school.
</P>
<P>
   Now 45, he is familiar with the corridors of Washington power.
From 1983 to 1986, Gover specialized in Indian and environmental
litigation for a Washington law firm. In 1986, he formed his own
firm in Albuquerque. Before becoming the bureau's director in 1997
he lobbied to get a casino for the Tesuque Pueblo Tribe in the
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt also spoke, calling the bureau
``a work in progress,'' but one that now belongs to Indians, who
make up most of its 10,000 employees. ``May you prosper, grow,
advocate, get under people's skins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who was praised by Gover as being
in the forefront of Indian-rights issues, said the Bureau of Indian
Affairs ``creates the potential for a brighter future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Cutler, a White House adviser on Indian issues, delivered
congratulations to the bureau from President Clinton, who paid
tribute to Indians as ``our country's first people.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau was founded in 1824, so its 175th anniversary was
actually last year. But the observance was postponed to avoid being
overshadowed by the Interior Department's 150th anniversary, also
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony Friday reflected how Indian culture has endured and
how it has been assimilated. Numerous tribal leaders were present.
Some wore traditional jewelry and headbands, but many others wore
dark business suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``By accepting the legacy,'' Gover said, ``we accept the moral
responsibility of putting things right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Gover said he was still moved by the applause he
received, and by the opportunities his still imperfect country has
given him. ``This country is meant to always get better,'' he said.

 &HT;    Study: Drugs tarnish Games gold
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Sydney Olympics don't open until next week, but
talk already has turned to drug use at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   A study financed by the White House and released Friday
estimates drug use to be as high as 90 percent in some Olympic
sports. Wade Exum, formerly drug czar for the U.S. Olympic
Committee, said he thinks five of eight Sydney finalists in such
sports as track and swimming will have used banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at some of these athletes, and they're just too cut
to be regular human beings,'' Exum said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics contend sports leaders have not cracked down
because drugs lead to spectacular performances. They don't want to
bust significant numbers of athletes and sully the Olympic image in
the eyes of sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really are two sides to the drug issue,'' said John
Pineau, attorney for Exum. ``The drug usage problem is bad for
business, but drugs themselves work. And drugs lead to gold medals,
which is good for business.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is responsible for testing at the Games, while the
governing bodies of individual sports oversee it the rest of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aura of secrecy in which these bodies squirrel test
results invites public cynicism about the integrity and the meaning
of record-breaking Olympic performances,'' said Joseph Califano
Jr., president of the National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia University, which conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites the absence of effective policing, which has
created an ``environment that encourages doing anything _ including
doping _ to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House report recommends creating an international
organization independent of the IOC to be responsible for drug
testing and for banning substances.
</P>
<P>
   IOC Vice President Dick Pound, who leads the World Anti-Doping
Agency, established last year, said no one associated with the
study contacted him. Pound said the 90 percent figure for athletes
in any sport seemed ``wildly high.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ First thing Friday morning, Gov. George W.
Bush stared out at a group of workers and said, ``I have a
confession to make. I'm here to ask for your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   He described how he had run for Congress from Texas in 1978 and
``came in second in a two-person race.'' A woman came up to him in
his hometown afterwards and told him she had not voted for him.
``And I said, `Well, why not?''' Bush recalled, ``and she said,
`Because you didn't bother to ask for my vote.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Friday, Bush was asking.
</P>
<P>
   It was the debut of the more accessible style that the governor
had promised as a way of addressing concerns among prominent
Republicans and even some of his own aides that his campaign was
slipping in the polls. For the first time since the Republican
primaries, Bush held a sustained question and answer session with
voters, running longer than some recent campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the Republican National Committee unveiled its
strongest commercial yet against Vice President Al Gore in a drive
to make voters doubt the Democrat's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial a woman announcer speaks of Gore's pledge to
overhaul the nation's campaign finance system and then runs through
a litany of the indictments and unanswered congressional subpoenas
resulting from the campaign finance abuses of 1996 when the
Democratic National Committee returned several million dollars in
contributions because of questions about the money's origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's promising campaign finance reform,'' the announcer
says. ``Can I believe him? Because of Gore's last fund-raising
campaign, 22 people have been indicted, 12 convicted, 70 took the
Fifth Amendment, and 18 witnesses fled the country.'' The
advertisement then goes on to cast doubt on Gore's proposals for
school accountability and ends, ``Just more politics from Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of Bush's new style and the advertisement
showed how the campaign is seeking to move ahead: plant questions
about Gore's credibility and the validity of his promises and then
showcase Bush in informal settings open and accessible and speaking
of ``real plans for real people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director, said of the
commercial: ``I think it highlights a fundamental question of the
election and that is: if you can't trust the vice president's
credibility on an issue like campaign finance reform, how you can
trust his credibility on an issue like education reform?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit to the Marconi Communications company, about a
half-hour's drive outside Pittsburgh, had been planned as a venue
for Bush to speak in a swing state about his plan to divert some of
the Social Security payroll tax into private investment accounts as
a way to refashion the program for the retirement of the baby boom
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being a retirement system gone bust, it's a
retirement system that's robust,'' he rhymed.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his decision to get closer to the people, Bush
headed quickly to the company cafeteria, where he bought a cup of
coffee and began greeting employees who applauded him from their
tables. And after his prepared remarks to a group of employees, he
took an array of questions, talking of his relations with the news
media and with Democrats, his efforts to give the golden cheek
warbler a place to nest on his Texas ranch, his tax policy and
plans for education.
</P>
<P>
   His first questioner was almost inaudible, but it was clear that
he did not think that journalists portrayed Bush fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the media,'' Bush replied, but then he suggested
that he would not dare say otherwise, noting, ``Of course, it's
about 60 days before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do'' respect the news media, he emphasized. ``I think it's
been fair to me. But the best way for me to get my message out is
to speak directly to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   When another man wanted to know about Bush's relations with
Democrats, he spoke about working with Bob Bullock, the late
Democratic lieutenant governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a rocky relationship at times, but let me tell you how
it ended,'' Bush said. He said he had gone on his very first
campaign trip to Iowa and New Hampshire, ``and I came back and this
good man was on his death bed and he asked me to eulogize him at
his funeral. It was one of the most touching moments I've had in my
life, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked at length, gesturing emphatically, about his ideas
to bring more testing and accountability in schools. ``It's kind of
a long-winded answer,'' he said, ``but it's my passion. Thanks for
the question.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, his audience had also learned that he
is keeping a grove of cedars standing on his ranch because the
golden cheek warbler nests in them _ though he said he would not
want the federal government ordering such environmental steps by
fiat. And he also told of his commitment to tax cutting in good
times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever went into a recession _ which I certainly hope we
do not do and I don't think we will _ I'm going to increase the
pace of tax relief,'' Bush said. ``The best way to grow out of a
recession is to accelerate tax relief to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush announced that he had won the endorsement of the
Fraternal Order of Police, and held an airport rally, opposing
Gore's populist cry that the vice president is ``for the people,
not for the powerful'' with some populism of his own. Bush
showcased people who would get substantial tax cuts under his plan
to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion, but little under Gore's tax cut
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you tell me, Who's standing on the side of the people?''
Bush said. ``You tell me, Whose plan is a real plan with real
solutions? It's our plan. It's our plan.''

WOODS BACK IN CONTENTION, SAVING HIS BEST FOR LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKVILLE, Ontario _ In a remarkable span of four holes, Tiger
Woods went from the doldrums into contention Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While Grant Waite made eagle on his final hole to take a
one-stroke lead at the Bell Canadian Open, Woods made a huge move
up the leader board, from a tie for 45th place into a tie for
seventh. Even for Woods, what he did from the 15th through the 18th
holes was extraordinary: birdie, eagle, birdie, eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Woods birdied the par-3 No. 15 with a pinpoint 8-iron tee shot
to within six feet of the cup. He made eagle at No. 16, smashing
his drive 348 yards. He made another birdie at No. 17, hitting a
gorgeous 6-iron fairway bunker shot from 172 yards to within eight
feet of the hole. And at No. 18, he made eagle again, hitting his
drive an astonishing 380 yards. The wind was at Woods' back, but
380 yards off the tee? He had to laugh when he talked about that
one.
</P>
<P>
   How often does anyone shoot six under par over a four-hole span?
But how often does a player like Woods come along? Storming past a
host of competitors and setting up an intriguing weekend at Glen
Abbey Golf Club, Woods shot a seven-under-par 65 and closed to
within four strokes of the lead for the tournament after finishing
at even par in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Waite, a 36-year-old from New Zealand who last won on the PGA
Tour in 1993, was the surprise second-round leader by two strokes.
He was 11 under par (133) after a second-round 64 Friday. Greg
Chalmers of Australia was in second place at 10 under par (69-65),
while Brian Watts (67-68) was in third place.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was not the only prominent player in contention. Sergio
Garcia, who defeated Woods in a made-for-television exhibition last
month, shot 69 and was tied for fourth place at eight under par
with Keiichiro Fukabori, Shaun Micheel and Brian Watts. Davis Love
III, the winner of the 1997 PGA Championship, was tied for seventh
place at seven under par with Woods, Craig Barlow, J.L. Lewis and
Kevin Sutherland, who began Friday with a one-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, instead of running away with the tournament, Woods
will have to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you see Tiger on the leader board, you know that you
can't make any mistakes,'' Garcia said. ``But if you are
intimidated by any player, you are not going to be able to play
your game.''  &QL;

`FAR SIDE OF THE MOON': PEEKING AT SOMEONE WHO THINKS HE'S ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The Far Side of the Moon,'' a theater piece
written, directed and performed by the Canadian theater artist
Robert Lepage, is being offered as part of the Henson International
Festival of Puppet Theater, but it's not puppetry that commands the
stage _ it's Lepage.
</P>
<P>
   The puppets here are decidedly secondary figures, not much more
than props. They're done up as astronauts, and they make only a
handful of brief appearances as dream figures; they're part of the
metaphorical backdrop of this show, which posits the race to the
moon by the United States and the former Soviet Union as a kind of
sibling rivalry, and space exploration in general as a symbol of
the desperate rooting around in the dark that characterizes human
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that is ponderous baggage for what is otherwise a piquant
and simple story about estranged brothers after their mother's
death. But the heavy-handedness of Lepage's connections between
inner and outer space is easily _ and perhaps properly _
overlooked. Partly this is because the rest of his show, with the
visual cleverness characteristic of Lepage and his company, Ex
Machina, is so modest and engaging, and partly it's because of
Lepage's virtuoso acting performance here.
</P>
<P>
   An unimposing presence with a doughy face and physique, he plays
two brothers _ Philippe, a haplessly introspective philosophy
student, and Andre, a television weatherman with the chilly
impatience of the deeply selfish _ as well as host of secondary
characters, and it's a tour de force of unactorlike ease.
</P>
<P>
   As a doctor explaining to Philippe that his mother's death was
no accident; as Philippe, working as a telemarketer and, in a
painful coincidence, reaching a potential customer who turns out to
be a former girlfriend, now married; as Andre, stuck in an elevator
with a bookshelf full of remembrances from his childhood, Lepage is
uncanny in his casual verisimilitude; you'll never see a
performance that yields a more powerful sense of peeking in on
someone who thinks he's alone.
</P>
<P>
   The show (which can be seen at the Joseph Papp Public Theater
for three more performances, two Saturday and one Sunday) is told
in a series of blackout scenes, each with its own bit of theatrics
that please with their unspectacular ingenuity. There's the
laundromat evoked by a couple of chairs, a water cooler, a porthole
in the back wall and a behind-the-wall camera that projects the
inside of a washing machine onto a screen for the audience. There's
a hotel lounge, empty except for Philippe, whose loneliness and
isolation are underscored by the vast stage-length mirrored
tabletop that serves as the bar at which he sits smoking. There's a
whole gymnasium full of exercise equipment suggested by, of all
things, an ironing board.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity of much of this is nearly obscured by the space
race metaphor _ in a kind of accompanying sideshow, the history of
American and Russian space programs is told in vintage film clips,
projections and radio recordings _ and by a weird and beautiful
original score by Laurie Anderson, whose syncopations and vaguely
Asian-sounding dissonances give the show an aura of avant-garde
profundity.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the show _ the conventional realism of the
emotions of the characters _ shines through in Lepage's acting and
in the simple elegance of his visual imagination almost in spite of
these overlays.
</P>
<P>
   Lepage is not known for narrative economy, and the show, which
runs nearly two and a half hours without intermission, proceeds at
a languid pace. But if it asks an audience for patience, the
narrative shape, seemingly indifferent to conventional peaks and
valleys, also contributes to the idea that real lives are being
glimpsed.
</P>
<P>
   The story focuses on Philippe, a shy fellow whose intellectual
pursuits reflect the sort of nebbishy sadness that is played out in
his personal life. (His doctoral thesis contends that ``man's
interest in space travel is motivated not by curiosity but
narcissism.'') He's devoted to honoring the memory of his mother in
tiny ways; the care of her goldfish, for instance, becomes a
crucial issue between him and Andre, a shallow, mercenary fellow
who is driven nuts by his older brother's ineffectuality and
introspection. Much of Philippe's own sense of failure is
communicated through a video he makes for an organization called
SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, a personal
documentary, of sorts, that is to be digitized and sent off into
the void like a message in a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is the contrast: Philippe's eagerness to send the
mundane details of life into the void, as opposed to the vast
technological machinery that America and Russia spent decades
launching away from the earth. The one, the show suggests, is
human; the other merely egomaniacal, creating dangerous
misunderstandings between nations and brothers.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sentimental and not terribly complex idea, and one
wishes it wasn't presented with such gravity. In the end the space
metaphor is best when it is least grandiose, when it isn't so
conscious of its own epic proportions. A climactic scene in which
Lepage, as Philippe, mimics weightlessness in the laundromat
(helped by a wonderful and uncomplicated use of mirrors) is partly
terrific. That's because what it says about a man _ that he's
unmoored even in the most unethereal circumstance _ is moving, but
what it says about mankind _ the same thing _ is merely weighty.
Sometimes a small step is preferable to a giant leap.
</P>

AWARDS FOR POP AND SOUL, SO DIFFERENT AND SO ALIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two awards shows came to New York City on successive
nights this week, and they were as different as the pop moment and
the soul heritage. The MTV Video Music Awards on Thursday night at
Radio City Music Hall had giant production numbers, bared navels,
lip-synching and hype. The Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer
Awards on Wednesday at the Hammerstein Ballroom offered modesty, a
good heart and great unassisted voices.
</P>
<P>
   Both are about music that never went away and that has, in fact,
come back around. The vocal groups and soul belters who were
recognized by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, like Stevie Wonder,
the Chi-Lites and Betty Wright, are direct musical ancestors of MTV
Award-winners like Sisqo, N'Sync and Christina Aguilera. Yet while
they can still sing their hearts out, the seasoned rhythm-and-blues
performers aren't as glamorous as their MTV heirs.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV Awards are a binge of promotion through glitter and
approved mild naughtiness. They're chosen from MTV's limited
offerings by a voting panel that's half music-business
professionals, half fans, and in essence they recognize the
successful application of huge marketing budgets _ for grooming
artists, making videos, advertising and promoting songs to radio
stations _ to reach MTV's squealing, allowance-squandering young
audience. The MTV Awards are the happy face of good returns on a
pop investment, and the show presents itself as one branch of
conglomerated show business, tied in to movies, television and this
year to professional wrestling: Kid Rock and the Rock stood side by
side to give an award.
</P>
<P>
   Well-behaved pop professionals dominated the telecast, which was
more about skin than sin. Sisqo and Nelly bared their chests for
their hip-hop come-ons. Britney Spears, determined to prove the
line in her hit ``Oops ... I Did It Again'' that insists ``I'm not
that innocent,'' stripped down to a glittering skin-tight halter
top and pants, ending her number with a showgirl's pelvic thrust.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit risked losing any semblance of rock
credibility by stepping onstage to rap with Christina Aguilera.
Everyone's antisocial anathema, Eminem, performed ``The Real Slim
Shady,'' which warns about how many people are ``just like me,''
with dozens of quasi-look-alikes. But the best provocation Eminem
could muster in his acceptance speeches was to show pills falling
out of his pockets and to thank critics of his albums for helping
him sell more of them.
</P>
<P>
   MTV promised feuds it didn't deliver. The show had appearances
by Shawn Fanning, who invented the music-sharing program Napster,
and Lars Ulrich of Metallica, which has sued Napster. Fanning wore
a Metallica T-shirt, but MTV gave Ulrich the advantage: a video
skit that equated sharing with theft.
</P>
<P>
   It took Rage Against the Machine, a band that still believes in
a political rock rebellion, to shake up the show. It performed
alongside video screens showing montages of demonstrations and
phrases like ``Are you getting what you paid for?'' and ``corporate
greed.'' Later, as Limp Bizkit collected an award, Rage's bass
player, Timothy Commerford, tried a little anarchy: climbing up a
tower of television monitors onstage, making it sway and
threatening to jump. (He was arrested for assaulting a police
officer when he eventually came down.) It was a true disruption in
a show that prefers any outrageousness to take place on cue.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV Awards, shown live, have a nationwide reach; the Rhythm
and Blues Foundation dreams of being on television someday, said
its co-chairman, the singer Jerry Butler of the Impressions. The
MTV Awards puts a silvery man-on-the-moon statuette next to young
hitmakers' gold and platinum albums, while the Pioneer Awards gives
checks for $4,000 to $15,000 to aging musicians who may well use
them for medical expenses or, as Sylvia Robinson (the voice of
``Love Is Strange'') announced she would, contribute it to buy a
building for her church.
</P>
<P>
   Others who received awards included Huey ``Piano'' Smith, who
wrote ``Rockin' Pneumonia'' and ``Sea Cruise'' and declared
bankruptcy in the 1990s; Johnnie Johnson, who was Chuck Berry's
pianist; and the songwriter and producer Clyde Otis. Wonder,
receiving a lifetime achievement award, vowed to help make a
benefit album for the foundation that would bring together younger
and older rhythm-and-blues musicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhythm and Blues Foundation has been the music business'
nagging conscience. It has given hundreds of thousands of dollars
to musicians in need, and it has pushed recording companies to make
up for past abuses by raising royalty rates on old, exploitative
contracts. Berry Gordy, the founder and former owner of Motown
Records (which is now part of Universal), announced he was joining
on both fronts, contributing $750,000 to help musicians and saying
that he, too, is now in favor of royalty reform, including
revisions to the tough contracts Motown made in its 1960s golden
age.
</P>
<P>
   For its first 10 years, the Rhythm and Blues Foundation made its
awards precede or follow the Grammys, latching on to some of the
current stars who show up for the event. This year Grammy time
became prohibitively expensive, so the foundation slipped in next
to the MTV Video Music Awards instead. Yet while there were
well-known musicians in attendance _ Aretha Franklin, Bonnie Raitt,
Herbie Hancock, Dionne Warwick, Sister Sledge, Brenda Russell _ the
only representatives of the MTV generation were Brian McKnight, who
sang a Marvin Gaye tribute, and Erykah Badu.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting an award to Betty Wright, who had the million-selling
hit ``Clean Up Woman'' in 1971, Badu hinted that current stars had
not eliminated the problems that face their elders. ``I didn't know
what to expect,'' said Badu, whose 1997 debut album has sold three
million copies. ``I thought it was going to be a lot more money.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTV Awards had an appearance by Richard Hatch, the
millionaire winner on ``Survivor.'' But Smokey Robinson, the M.C.
on Wednesday night, called the Rhythm and Blues Foundation ``the
real survivor awards.'' He went on to explain, ``They survived a
tough business where the rats ate you.''

CALIFORNIA UPHOLDS RULE FOR POLLUTION-FREE CAR BY 2003 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California regulators voted Friday to keep
a rule requiring that 10 percent of cars offered for sale in the
state starting in 2003 emit little or no pollution, a goal that the
industry has said is unreachable.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision by the California Air Resources Board,
which regulates air pollution in the state, is expected to vastly
increase the number of electric cars on the road, not only in
California but in New York, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine, which
have opted to follow California pollution regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Automobile companies have argued strenuously that they cannot
sell that many electric cars because such vehicles are too costly
and can travel only about 100 miles before the batteries must be
recharged, a process that takes several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The air pollution regulation agency estimated that under the
rule, 22,000 electric cars would have to be sold in California in
2003, 10 times more than the 2,300 now on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a train wreck waiting to happen,'' Samuel
Leonard, a director of the public policy center at the General
Motors Corp., said of the rule. He said the rule would produce a
minuscule improvement in air quality at tremendous cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the board, whose 11 members are appointed by the governor,
said the rule was needed to cut pollution in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future depends on the continuing march to zero-emission
vehicles,'' Alan Lloyd, the board chairman, said after a day and a
half of public hearings here. ``We need to stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that progress toward nonpolluting cars would
``dramatically decrease or stop completely without a clear
regulatory signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the board instructed its staff to consider modifications
to the plan to deal with the high costs of electric cars, which the
staff estimated to be as much as $20,000 more each than
gasoline-powered cars. Automobile executives held out some hope
that the rule would still be changed by January, when the board is
to consider the proposed modifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train wreck is still a little bit further down the road
and maybe we'll never get to that point,'' said Gloria Bergquist,
spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group
that represents 13 car companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Lloyd said it was extremely unlikely that the overall 10
percent goal by 2003 would be changed. It is more likely the staff
will look at more subsidies to help make the cars more affordable
and desirable, agency staff members said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, meanwhile, hailed Friday's decision, saying
that it would prod the development of pollution-free cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is about as strong a statement as you can get,''
said Roland Hwang, co-director of the transportation program at the
Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   California has been aggressive in air pollution controls because
of the smog problem in Southern California. And because of the huge
size of the California's car market, the California rules have been
instrumental in prodding the automobile industry to develop
vehicles that pollute less.
</P>
<P>
   The original rules in 1990 called for 2 percent of the cars for
sale in the state to be nonpolluting by 1998, 5 percent by 2001 and
10 percent by 2003, with the program to be reviewed every two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous two reviews in 1996 and 1998, the board removed
the deadlines for 1998 and 2001, saying they were impractical. It
also relaxed the rule for 2003.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   For the six largest manufacturers, only 4 percent of the cars
offered for sale in 2003 have to emit no pollution, a standard
current technology make possible only with battery-powered cars.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the 10 percent goal can be met by
near-zero-emission vehicles, like gasoline engines that burn fuel
more cleanly, natural gas engines or gasoline-electric hybrid
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   This year's review, which concluded Friday, was crucial because
it is the probably the last time the rule can be changed before
auto companies start designing and manufacturing the 2003 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Auto companies had hoped for another relaxation of the deadline,
but environmentalists said that one more slip could effectively
kill the program. They said the companies had not tried hard enough
to sell the cars, or had even discouraged sales.

 &HT;    RedHawks focused on Eagles
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   YPSILANTI, Mich. _ Geographically speaking, the road from
Nashville to Columbus does not run through Ypsilanti, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   But it does on the map that plots the season for Miami and the
RedHawks better keep that in mind today as they face Eastern
Michigan, a detour ominously sandwiched between last Saturday's
emotionally draining season-opening win at Vanderbilt and next
Saturday's historic visit to Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win a game the way we did at Vanderbilt,'' coach
Terry Hoeppner said in referring to the comeback that produced two
touchdowns in the final three minutes for a 33-30 victory, ``there
is a natural tendency to let down, to feel too good about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't see any signs of that this week. The players
worked hard and they were focused. And they were focused on Eastern
Michigan. We (the coaches) weren't thinking about Ohio State and we
weren't talking about Ohio State. And I don't think the players
were, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastern also launched the season in dramatic fashion, scoring
with 1:50 left to beat Connecticut, 32-25.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have had only one winning record in the last 10 years
and a win over Miami would trigger an emotional high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, we were the hunters,'' Hoeppner said. ``This week,
we're the hunted. Not to take anything away from Eastern, but
beating us would be a big boost for their program.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami has a 14-4 edge in the series and has won seven of the
last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have been hard to prepare for because of new head
coach Jeff Woodruff, a former assistant at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had only the Connecticut game to study,'' Hoeppner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at Arizona (tapes during the offseason in an effort
to get a read on Woodruff) and he didn't bring anything with him,
offensively or defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Woodruff didn't have to bring was a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He inherited three-year starter Walter Church, who is breaking
all of the school passing records set by Charlie Batch, now a
starter in the NFL with Detroit.

 &HT;    Buckeyes raiding Arizona
 &HT;    By Doug Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Chuck Stobart knows that most college football
coaches travel more than a circus act. But he was certain his
vagabond life was over when he joined Arizona's staff 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to Arizona to retire,'' he said. ``We
re-did a house, and six months later we moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Stobart followed head coach Larry Smith to Southern Cal, then
went to Memphis to be a head coach himself. He hooked on at Ohio
State in 1994 and was promoted to offensive coordinator this
season.
</P>
<P>
   His shining moment with the Wildcats came against current boss
John Cooper, who was coaching Arizona State then. Arizona pulled
the upset, but Cooper's team already had clinched the PAC-10 and
had the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Pasadena,'' Cooper said, ``and they went to El Paso
or someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Stobart is back in Arizona, but he'll be on the other sideline
with the 18th-ranked Buckeyes tonight.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to contend with The Desert Swarm, the decade-old
nickname for the Wildcats' roving defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That name is very apropos,'' Stobart said. ``They bring people
from all over the place, and it looks like a storm coming across
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a defense like that, two things can happen _ the offense
can have bad plays, but you also give up big plays. You have to
have patience on offense and understand you might not block all
their people sometimes. What you don't want is to have a play where
you give the ball over to the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a job for a poised, veteran quarterback. And Stobart
is convinced the Buckeyes have one in Steve Bellisari, who had an
unspectacular but relatively mistake-free performance in the
opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than two quick passes (that were misfires), which can
happen to anybody, I thought he was very good,'' Stobart said. ``He
had no interceptions _ he wasn't even close to having one. We had
the one bad center-snap exchange, but other things he handled very,
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes and Wildcats have been on eerily similar paths.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State went 11-1 in '98, Arizona 12-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State went 6-6 in '99, Arizona 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State finished with three straight losses last season, same
as Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Each is eager to bounce back and has its defense to thank for
season-opening wins. The Buckeyes foiled Fresno State with four
defensive touchdowns, while the Wildcats scored one in a 17-3 win
at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Tomey's team has one of the country's better
quarterbacks in senior Ortege Jenkins, but he went a mere 3 of 15
passing for 11 yards against the Utes, who missed three field goals
from inside 35 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just had a bad night,'' OSU defensive coordinator Jon
Tenuta said. ``He just wasn't on. He's been around since '97. He's
a good football player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got great skill,'' middle linebacker Matt Wilhelm
said. ``Their receivers can jump and catch the ball, and Ortege has
a gun. It's going to be rough. It will be like going against a Big
Ten team.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ortege &AMP; Co. shouldn't expect help from its defense this
week, according to the Buckeyes. The Desert Swarm?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of it, but I'm not impressed,'' center LeCharles
Bentley said. ``We'll show 'em what the Buckeyes can do.''

DAIMLERCHRYSLER'S INVESTMENT IN MITSUBISHI COMES WITH MORE
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Subs to remove second awkward placement of DaimlerChrysler's
34 percent stake, possibly misleading possibly misleading due to
positioning relative to Mitsubishi's other stakeholders.) 
 By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ DaimlerChrysler moved Friday to tighten control over
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Japan's fourth-largest automaker, which
has been reeling from last month's disclosure that it had concealed
customer complaints about auto defects for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors' president, Katsuhiko Kawasoe, will resign on
Nov. 1. Takashi Sonobe, currently the executive vice president,
will replace him. Rolf Eckrodt, the chief executive of Adtranz,
DaimlerChrysler's trainmaking subsidiary, is coming to Mitsubishi
Motors as its new chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Under a renegotiated deal announced here Friday, DaimlerChrysler
will keep its stake in Mitsubishi to the 34 percent agreed to in
March, but to compensate for a tumble in Mitsubishi's shares, which
have fallen a quarter in value since the coverup scandal erupted,
DaimlerChrysler will pay 10 percent less: 405 yen a share, instead
of 450 yen, or a total of $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors retains control over the posts of president
and chief executive, but the new pact gives DaimlerChrysler
increased leverage over the Japanese automaker and a period to
reassess the alliance, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``DaimlerChrysler's intention now is to take firm control,'' of
Mitsubishi Motors, said Koji Endo, an automobile analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The move by DaimlerChrysler echoes a similar one by Renault of
France, which took a 35 percent stake in Nissan Motor last year,
and installed Carlos Ghosn as chief operating officer. Ghosn has
since sold off assets and slashed jobs and costs.
</P>
<P>
   And Mitsubishi Motors will be the third Japanese automobile
manufacturer to embrace a foreign executive, after Nissan and Mazda
Motor. The Ford Motor Co. owns a 33 percent stake in Mazda, whose
president, Mark Fields, is an American.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Japanese auto manufacturers, now only Toyota and Honda
are operating under financially independent management. General
Motors owns stakes in Isuzu, Fuji Heavy Industries, and Suzuki.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the delicate balance between DaimlerChrysler and the
powerful group of Mitsubishi companies like Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries and Mitsubishi Corp., Kawasoe, the outgoing president of
Mitsubishi Motors, is said to have resisted DaimlerChrysler's
demand to raise its stake in the Japanese car company.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitsubishi Motors did accept DaimlerChrysler's demand to let
it raise its stake in the Japanese auto manufacturer to unlimited
levels three years after the accord, instead of in 10 years as
previously agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had three years, we can recover our performance,''
Kawasoe said Friday. ``Or rather, we have to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   While the incoming chief operating officer, Eckrodt, 58, will be
reporting to Sonobe, 59, his arrival is still sure to be a blow to
the executives at Mitsubishi Motors, which have insisted the
automaker would stay autonomous after entering into the alliance
with DaimlerChrysler, despite huge debts and sluggish sales.
</P>
<P>
   Eckrodt has worked for more than three decades at Daimler, and
was an executive at its Mercedes-Benz unit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here praised the new deal and appointment of Eckrodt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better for Mitubishi Motors to be a DaimlerChrysler
company,'' than a Mitsubishi company, Endo of First Boston said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A foreign executive at Mitsubishi Motors, which sports an
inward-looking, group-oriented culture, could mean a shock to the
car company, which is likely to go through a period of uncertainty
over whether the company will be a truly market-oriented company
with concern for customers and legal compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing president, Kawasoe, had assumed presidency only
three years ago to replace Takemune Kimura who resigned to take
responsibility for a scandal involving a payoff to gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   Sonobe, the incoming president and chief executive who once
managed the car company's operations in the United States, said
that he was eager to see his company transformed culturally and
become a more ``customer-oriented'' company.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he would rethink his company's relationship
with other companies in the Mitsubishi group, he said, ``I want to
see changes at Mitsubishi Motors. Our relations with other
Mitsubishi firms will remain the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have said that DaimlerChrysler means to use
Mitsubishi to fill the holes of its international strategy,
especially in Asia, and that it will try not to become too heavily
involved in Mitsubishi Motors the way Ford and Renault have become
involved with with their Japanese partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes years to restructure a company,'' said Seiji Sugiura,
an automobile analyst with Nomura Securities. ``And share prices of
Mazda and Nissan haven't improved.''

NO LOVE SONG FOR BLUE EYES IN BRONZE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A statue it may be, but not a statue of limitations.
This is the large bronze representation of Frank Sinatra that the
administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, in concert with the
Sinatra family, hopes to put in the heart of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Nancy Sinatra badly wants this honor for her
father, the incomparable singer and better-than-fair actor, who
died two years ago. Nancy Sinatra even promises to pay for the job.
One thing is essential to the family: The statue must stand on a
traffic island at Broadway and West 44th Street, opposite the site
of the old Paramount Theater, where Sinatra thrilled 1940s
bobby-soxers and gave rise to the legend of Ol' Blue Eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Great, says City Hall. In its usual fashion, best summed up by
the Sinatra song ``All or Nothing at All,'' it has made the project
its own and is pushing it through the city bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   And what, you may wonder, is the problem with this? Is not a
daughter's devotion worth a price above rubies? Can anyone deny
Sinatra's iconic status?
</P>
<P>
   On that score, you will get no argument here. The singer's
fervent fans include this fellow, who has spent many hours at the
piano running through the ``Frank Sinatra Songbook.'' Truth be
told, some of that time probably should have been spent working.
Call me irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed Sinatra statue does raise serious questions
about limitations and the use of public space for private purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue came up last week with the unveiling of a statue
of Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden, the lovable, bus-driving
schlemiel from the ``Honeymooners'' television series. That
sculpture stands outside the Eighth Avenue entrance to the Port
Authority Bus Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it all seems innocent enough. Hey there, Ralphie
boy. Har-dee-har-har, and all that.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look at the inscription at the statue's base, you
will notice that it says, ``Presented by the people of TV Land.''
And what is TV Land? A Viacom cable television channel that carries
reruns of the 1950s series.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this monument taking up precious space on a New
York sidewalk is really a commercial for a big media company.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial potential of the Sinatra statue may be less
obvious, but the basic issue is the same. Here you have a family
with money, fame and influence, in effect being allowed to snatch
up premier space in this city's central square for its own glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every inch of public space is under assault,'' said Kent
Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society. ``It's forever
being encroached upon.''
</P>
<P>
   His point would seem hard to dispute. In recent years, the sides
of buildings have often become little more than convenient spots
for advertisements. Trucks that are essentially billboards on
wheels are allowed to cruise the streets and pollute the air. Offer
the city enough cash and you can sponsor a concert in Central Park,
with your name slapped all over the place. If you happen to be
Disney, the city streets are yours for a self-promotional parade.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for the Sinatra statue have dispirited Times Square
community groups. Their objections, rehashed with City Hall several
weeks ago, include concerns about extra crowding on sidewalks that
are already jam-packed. Some also doubt that Sinatra is right for
that spot of honor. After all, his links to Broadway are slender.
He made his mark west of the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   As for those glory days at the Paramount, you might as well
erect a statue of the Beatles outside Shea Stadium. They made a
huge splash there in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels a little tacky for a family to propose a statue to
itself in Times Square,'' said one civic leader in the
neighborhood, whose request for anonymity will be honored. Giuliani
may seem a gentler soul these days, but his capacity for vengeance
still inspires fear.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why the anti-statue forces have avoided delicate
points mentioned by some others, like the fact that Sinatra
famously avoided the draft during World War II; if approved, his
statue would share an island with the Armed Forces Recruiting
Station. He was known, too, for hanging out with gangsters,
something that perhaps ought to arch an eyebrow on the mob-fighting
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics suspect that for all their objections, the
project is a done deal. They can almost hear Nancy Sinatra, who
once teamed with her old man for a song called ``Something
Stupid,'' breaking out now in a chorus of ``They Can't Take That
Away From Me.''

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: ROWING  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This has been a big Olympic sport for the United States,
especially in the men's eight-oared competition. This time, the
United States is the only nation to have qualified in all 14 events
(six for women), and it ranks behind Germany and Romania among the
team favorites.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The 550 rowers will compete in eight sculling events (two oars
for each sculler) ranging from singles to quads and six sweep
events (one oar per athlete) ranging from pairs to eights. The
races include two lightweight events for men (160-pound limit per
man) and one for women (130-pound limit per woman).
</P>
<P>
   THE SCORING
</P>
<P>
   The heats are unseeded and based on a random draw, and usually
only heat winners advance to a semifinal or final. First-round
losers get a second chance in a repechage round.
</P>
<P>
   All races are over a 2,000-meter straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   For the favorites, strategy varies from race to race. Faster
strokes are often better, but seasoned crews can win or stay
competitive with fewer but more efficient strokes and high-speed
spurts.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The favorites in the glamour races, the eight-oared sweeps, are
the U.S. men and Romanian women, with the U.S. women's eight a
strong contender.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Redgrave, a 38-year-old Briton in the fours without
coxswain, will try to become the second summer or winter Olympian
to win gold medals in five consecutive Olympics (Aladar Gerevich, a
Hungarian fencer, won six in a row from 1932 through 1960).

 &HT;    Seminoles unequaled in ACC
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Florida State joined the Atlantic Coast
Conference in 1992, league officials confidently predicted that the
Seminoles' presence eventually would raise the level of ACC
football.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Florida State begins its ninth year of ACC play with an
8 p.m. game at Georgia Tech (ABC). Given the results in last week's
openers, some people would argue that the level of ACC football is
anything but up since 1992:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wake Forest, a bowl team last season, lost to I-AA Appalachian
State 20-16.
</P>
<P>
   _ Duke, last in a bowl game in 1994, was embarrassed at home
38-0 by East Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   _ Virginia, in the dedication game of newly renovated Scott
Stadium, blew a 21-0 halftime lead and lost to BYU 38-35 in
overtime. BYU had been blown out the week before by Florida State,
29-3.
</P>
<P>
   _ N.C. State needed double overtime to beat Arkansas State,
rated 102nd among 115 Division I-A teams by one preseason magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia Tech needed two touchdowns in the final minutes to
beat Central Florida 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always like the conference to do well, but there's no doubt
about it. We took it on the chin,'' Florida State coach Bobby
Bowden said. ``There might be a sleeper in (the conference). But
the fact that we've dominated like we have makes people think the
conference is not very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   At 62-2 in eight seasons, Florida State hasn't just dominated
the ACC. It has manhandled it, winning those 62 games by an average
of 29.4 points.
</P>
<P>
   One Orlando columnist suggested recently that Florida State
should give up the charade and join the SEC, where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think that deserves a response,'' FSU athletics
director Dave Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC points out a few things in its defense:
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida State might be beating up on the ACC, but the
Seminoles are doing it to everybody else, too. The defending
national champions have played in the national title game three of
the past four seasons and have finished in the final AP top four 13
consecutive years. They won more games (109) than any other program
in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you simply have to recognize the quality of
Florida State's program,'' the ACC commissioner John Swofford said.
``Nobody has done what they have done.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The ACC was 6-5 against non-conference ranked teams last
season and 14-9 the past two seasons. Only one conference, the Big
Ten, has a better winning percentage over those two years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida State went 8-0 in the ACC last year, but Georgia Tech
(35-31) and Clemson (17-14) were within a play or two of knocking
them off.
</P>
<P>
   _ The financial commitment to football in the ACC is at an
all-time high. Since 1994, the conference members have spent more
than $400 million in improvements to football-related facilities.
Virginia just completed a new stadium renovation. N.C. State has
$100 million in improvements on the drawing board. Clemson is
getting ready to spend $37 million over the next four years on its
stadium and a new building for its team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at everything we're doing and where the programs
in this conference are, you have to say the future looks bright,''
Swofford said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bright spots, many people think the ACC never get
where it wants to be as a football conference until it expands.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the football dollars Florida State has brought to the
ACC table since 1992, some of the traditionalists didn't want to
bring them into the family back in 1990. Some of those same schools
want no part of any further expansion. It comes down to football
versus basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball has held the upper hand since the league was founded
for the 1953-54 school year. That situation might have to change
for the football landscape to undergo another shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have to face the issue,'' Hart said. ``If we want to
do what's best for the conference down the road, we have to
(expand). I honestly believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any question that there is going to be
another round of conference realignment,'' Clemson athletics
director Bobby Robinson said. ``At that point, or before it, you
have to decide where you want to be. We're still open to that
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech athletics director Dave Braine is among those who
think the ACC must add three teams to become a 12-team league with
a conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida State and Georgia Tech have a much different
perspective on the issue'' from the other seven conference members,
Braine said. ``We don't recruit against the other ACC schools; we
recruit against the SEC. Those schools use the 12th game, the extra
bowl games and the television package against us in recruiting.
That's why it's so important for Georgia Tech and Florida State to
get to a 12-team league and have a playoff game.''
</P>
<P>
   Swofford says ACC athletics directors talk frequently about
expansion but right now the issue ``is on the back burner.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, it's much too early to push the panic button
on this year in ACC football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to let the season play itself out,'' he said.
``There is a lot of football left to be played.''

 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was in the thick of the third-set delirium, and a
desperate Venus Williams was churning her sinewy limbs as if they
were oars to reach one sideline of the court and then sprint to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Each lunge produced amazed gasps from the witnesses inside
Arthur Ashe Stadium on Friday. Each swashbuckling stab during this
crucial ninth game only added to the tension. All the while, a
meticulous Martina Hingis kept filling in the corners of the court
as if applying a No. 2 pencil to a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   It was a brilliant contrast of style in an unending rally.
Finally, as the two grew drunk with fatigue, Williams sent up a
shot that arched into the air like a flare from the stranded. This
was Hingis' grand opening, her chance to get to match point in her
semifinal at the United States Open. Trouble was, a bleary-eyed
Hingis could not focus on the fuzzy blob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for the ball,'' Hingis said. ``And I couldn't
really see it. I couldn't believe it. I didn't do anything with
that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of planting an overhead winner, she blocked it back to
Williams. And instantly, Williams uncoiled a backhand passing shot
down the line. It was 30-all, not 15-40, not the end, yet. A
resilient Williams went on to hold her serve. She trailed, 4-5, and
then ran off a string of three more games to deflate a crestfallen
Hingis, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hingis cracked her last shot of the match into the net, an
almost stunned Williams twirled around the court, and uttered the
words, ``Unbelievable, unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Williams, the one who hatched his daughter's career
from his vivid imagination, missed the end of a match that was so
exaggerated in its high level of play, it was more like a tall
tale. He did not get to see his daughter's wild advance into
Saturday's United States Open final, where she will play Lindsay
Davenport, the other semifinalist winner. He did not get to watch
her fight back to win her 25th match in a row and become the second
Williams sister in two years _ right after her younger sister,
Serena _ to have a chance to grab another Grand Slam title for the
family trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth game of the third set, just after Venus Williams
plopped a drop shot into the net at 15-15, a visibly rattled
Richard Williams left his seat. Approached by reporters in the
parking lot, he mumbled a few vulgarities and slipped into a car.
At this point, his daughter had scrambled to go ahead, 6-5. So why
the hostility, why the departure? Did he really have a business
appointment, as one of his associates said, or was he too unsettled
to stay by his daughter's side? Venus Williams didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't rely on my parents,'' she said. ``I have it all
figured out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis thought she had it figured out, too. When she stuck to
her blueprint, the slightly built Hingis had the powerful Williams
in tangles. Repeatedly, Hingis drilled ground strokes to the center
of the court, trying to jam Williams and stunt her wicked windup.
Often, that tactic produced unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   But Hingis could not put enough depth on every shot, and she was
spending too much time stabbing back floaters. With spellbinding
accuracy, Williams moved forward and gobbled up the soft returns by
ripping swinging forehand volleys into the open court.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my swinging volleys were perfect,'' Williams said.
``Mostly winners, except for maybe one.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams pounded an amazing 51 winners in the match. But her
aggression also produced 47 unforced errors. The more patient
Hingis came up with only 13 winners, but had only 23 unforced
errors. And there was one more statistical difference. Hingis, who
had not double-faulted in her run at the U.S. Open, maintained that
form. Williams struggled and hit five double faults.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those double faults were especially critical. On serve in
the first set, with Hingis ahead by 5-4, Williams crushed a double
fault into the net. It was set point. Abruptly, Hingis had the
first set under her belt, 6-4. After blasting her way through the
second set, Williams had another untimely hiccup on her serve in
the third set. Once again, she double faulted on break point. This
one gave Hingis a 3-2 lead and a path to the final.
</P>
<P>
   All Hingis had to do was hold on. If she had, she could have
scored one for the meek against the mighty, and put one in the book
for her alliance with Davenport against the Williams sisters. On
Wednesday, Davenport ruined the possibility of an all-Williams
final by eliminating Serena. On Thursday, Hingis congratulated her
friend and told her, ``One to go.'' But Hingis could not hold up
her end of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Serena say the players don't want an all-Williams
final because they don't like us,'' said Davenport, who survived
the unseeded but battle-tough Elena Dementieva, 6-2, 7-6 (5)
earlier Friday afternoon. ``The players don't want it because they
want to be in the finals. I don't want to see an all-Williams final
when I feel I should be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams dismissed all the tag-team hubbub, and said,
``These days, it's like WWF Wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, her rivalry with Hingis was true theater. There
was nothing phony or scripted about it; the match provided pure
competition between two beautifully different players. Around every
point, there was an unthinkable stroke, an unpredictable end to a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten to have a pretty big heart these days,'' Williams
said. ``I really didn't want to lose. I felt like I deserve to be
in the finals. I needed to get it done.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Gore raises money and support in Georgia
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore collected $1 million dollars
in contributions for the Democratic Party on Friday and told donors
that the November elections were ``a chance to really move Georgia
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is not an award for past performance,'' Gore
said. ``I'm not asking for your support on the basis of the economy
we have; I'm asking for your support and help on the basis of a
stronger, better, fairer economy that we are going to create
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke to about 250 donors at the Hyatt Regency, most of
whom contributed $1,000 for the chance to shake hands with Gore and
listen to his 20-minute speech. Afterward, Gore dined with a
smaller group of 150 donors who contributed a minimum of $5,000 to
the Democratic National Committee at a private home in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's visit was thin on new campaign themes, it contained
several symbolic flourishes. Sen. Zell Miller's appearance at both
fund-raisers _ at the invitation of the Gore campaign _ was
intended to send a signal that Southern Democrats aren't running
away from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are hoping that Miller's place on the ballot will draw
moderate swing voters to Gore, but both campaigns have remained
vague about how much campaigning the two politicians will do
together.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Phillips, Miller's campaign manager, said Miller would
campaign with Gore in the coming weeks whenever it was mutually
convenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zell Miller has his own race to run and will run his own
race,'' Phillips said. ``He's really got to focus on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also stopped by to shake hands with members of Teamsters
Local 728 at the United Parcel Service's Forest Park hub before
attending the two fund-raising events. The visit was a nod to the
Teamsters union, which voted this week to endorse Gore after
holding out support for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   He shook hands with several hundred workers at the UPS
distribution center. At one point, Gore climbed into a brown UPS
delivery truck and mugged for the cameras with several drivers
sitting inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in this race for the families that are trying to pay the
bills . . . the working men and women,'' Gore told them just before
leaving. ``We need to raise the minimum wage a dollar an hour and
have tax cuts for middle-class families. Help me out and we can
make this country what it is supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, in his introduction of Gore at the Hyatt fund-raiser,
called the vice president a friend to the state who had responded
to numerous appeals for help _from disaster relief during the 1994
floods to obtaining federal funds for the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always there _ firm, strong, but with a generous
spirit,'' said Miller, Georgia's governor from 1991 to 1998.
``Every time Georgia has called on Al Gore, he has always
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   While touting the country's strong economic progress over the
past eight years, the vice president acknowledged that the economy
had still left some behind.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his pledges to establish universal pre-kindergarten
for 4-year-olds, boost job training and create life-long learning
accounts for people who want to continue their education or learn
new skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the information age, what you earn depends on what you
learn,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore criticized his presidential opponent, Texas Gov. George
Bush, for failing to be specific about how he would pay for tax
cuts and proposals to privatize a portion of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need specifics now, not when it's too late,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore concluded his remarks with a nod to Atlanta's rich civil
rights history and the work of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta, Georgia, is the place where America's redemption
began,'' Gore said. ``The South is the place where the march had
its first steps. The South is the place where America's rebirth has
begun.''

ADRIAN P. BURKE, 95, EX-JUDGE ON NEW YORK'S HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Adrian P. Burke, a former associate judge of New York
state's highest court who was also New York City corporation
counsel, died Sept. 3 at his retirement home in Lauderhill, Fla. A
former resident of Manhattan, he was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Burke was the New York City's chief lawyer twice, though
briefly, under Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1954 and Mayor Abraham D.
Beame in 1974. In between, from 1955 through 1973, he wrote 252
majority opinions and 146 dissenting or concurring opinions while
on the New York State Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Long before that, as a young, politically well-connected lawyer,
he played a role in a change in state laws known as the ``aid the
needy'' provision of the state constitution. It was adopted at a
constitutional convention of 1938 at the behest of Mayor Fiorello
H. La Guardia.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Paul Burke was born in the Bronx. He graduated from Holy
Cross College in 1927 and Fordham University Law School in 1930. In
private practice, he represented individual and corporate clients
in city, state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Through his activity in charities that aided children, he met La
Guardia, who never forgot his tenement background, and sometimes
the two visited children's shelters together. The mayor, a liberal
and nominally a Republican, believed that government had a duty to
protect the unfortunate. Burke, a Democrat, liked what he heard
from him, as did Sen. Robert Wagner, D-N.Y., a leading New Dealer.
</P>
<P>
   With the three men pushing for the change in the constitution,
the state Legislature, the constitutional convention and the voters
endorsed an amendment stating, ``The aid, care and support of the
needy are public concerns and shall be provided by the state.'' The
U.S. Constitution has no such provision, and few states have one.
</P>
<P>
   As Burke's standing in his party rose, he became the friend,
confidante and campaign manager of the senator's son, also named
Robert F. Wagner. Even before the younger Wagner took office as
mayor of New York City in 1954, he offered Burke his pick of posts
in his administration, and Burke chose to head the city's law
department as corporation counsel.
</P>
<P>
   He led a fight against higher telephone rates and a campaign
against smut, but soon went campaigning for himself as a Democratic
candidate for associate judge of the Court of Appeals. He won, and
among his law clerks in the 1950s were Mario Cuomo and Fabian
Palomino, who later was Gov. Cuomo's special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   (A change enacted in 1977 took the Court of Appeals out of
politics. It mandates that the governor choose judges from a short
list submitted by a selection panel, with the state Senate voting
on confirmation.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Burke wrote the majority opinion in a groundbreaking
case of national significance. Reversing its own precedent, the
court said that plaintiffs could sue for damages purely on the
ground of emotional distress. Another opinion in 1966 overturned a
murder conviction and set standards for judges to determine when
criminal co-defendants are entitled to separate trials in the
interest of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   In a more sensational case, the court in 1970 unanimously
overturned the manslaughter conviction of Alice Crimmins in the
death of her little daughter. Burke wrote that reversal was
mandatory because the case had been flawed by the conduct of some
jurors. (Crimmins was retried and convicted.)
</P>
<P>
   Burke's final opinion, in December 1973, dealt with a case
arising from the 1971 prison uprising at Attica. Burke persuaded a
4-3 majority that the plaintiff could go to trial in a case
alleging that the state used excessive force in retaking the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff's husband, a prison employee, had been taken
hostage and died when state troopers ended the siege. The wife went
on to recover damages for wrongful death.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's wife, Edith Martin Burke, died in 1995 after 60 years of
marriage. The judge is survived by two sons, Adrian Jr., of Bethel,
Conn., and Francis M., of Kingston, Ontario; a daughter, Edith
Burke DeMuth of Howell, N.J.; and 10 grandchildren.

COUNT INSERTS HIMSELF INTO U.N. SUMMIT PHOTO 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It might take a magnifying glass to spot him, a man
in a navy-blue suit, his chest puffed out, among 180 world
dignitaries in the official photograph of the U.N. Millennium
Summit group. But he is there, right next to the foreign minister
of Niger, and he is not supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph was meant to be taken of official delegates
representing nations at an extraordinary three-day summit meeting
called to thrash out problems of poverty and peace at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the upper left corner was Count Carlo Marullo di
Condojanni, of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta _ with no
current ties to the country of the same name _ which claims to be
the smallest stamp-issuing authority in the world. It is based in
Rome, just west of the Spanish Steps. And it is not a nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably got lucky,'' said Hans Grohmann, a U.N. protocol
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph was taken in a council chamber in the United
Nations shortly after a luncheon of world leaders on Wednesday.
Many of them were accompanied to the chamber by fellow delegates,
and that was probably how the count managed to be in the
photograph, Grohmann said. Two countries, Jordan and Norway, also
violated the rules _ by having two representatives each in the
photo.
</P>
<P>
   Di Condojanni was the official delegate from his order to the
meeting. The group has representation at the United Nations, even
though it is not a nation. It was founded in 1048 as the Knights
Hospitalers of St. John of Jerusalem by businessmen from Amalfi,
south of Naples. Their goal was to build a hospital to serve
pilgrims from the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   As of the late 1980s, the group had 3,000 Italian members and
2,000 Americans. It now runs 200 hospitals and clinics worldwide.
Since 1966 it has issued more than 300 stamps with distinctive
designs that chronicle the order's history of military and
charitable works.
</P>
<P>
   The order's mission to the United Nations could not be reached
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But looking closely at the photo, is that a widening grin on di
Condojanni's face?

EAST TIMOR ATHLETES ENJOYING THEIR INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ It was the starting line, not the finish
line, that once seemed beyond the reach of Aguida Amaral in the
Olympic marathon. A year ago, she did not even have shoes, much
less hope, to participate in the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, her island, East Timor, declared its autonomy
from Indonesia, sparking a violent retaliation by militia seeking
to prevent independence. Amaral joined hundreds of thousands who
fled Dili, the capital of East Timor, and when she returned three
weeks later under the protection of United Nations peacekeepers,
her home had been looted and burned, as had countless other
buildings and government offices. Her running shoes were charred,
unusable.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Amaral continued to train in her bare feet, or in
street shoes, with a desperate resolve. When her feet began to
hurt, she ran on the soft sand of the beaches. Running was the one
possession that had not been taken from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud of my running,'' said Amaral, 25. ``It was my
hobby. That's why I continued.''
</P>
<P>
   Her persistence resulted in her being chosen as one of four
athletes from East Timor to compete in the Sydney Games. Because
the former province is still run by the United Nations and has no
independent government, the athletes will compete as individuals,
not as a national team. They will wear white uniforms and march
behind the interlocking rings of the Olympic flag during the
opening ceremony next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, and the Australian
government persuaded the International Olympic Committee to make a
special allowance for the athletes from East Timor _ two marathon
runners, a boxer and a weight lifter _ to participate in the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Kevan Gosper, an IOC delegate from Australia, has taken
particular interest in the East Timor athletes. In June he traveled
to Dili, asked the barefoot Amaral to stand on a white sheet of
paper and traced the outline of her feet with a red felt pen.
Gosper then folded the piece of paper in his briefcase and returned
to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortly thereafter, a pair of running shoes appeared,'' said
Frank Fowlie, a U.N. administrator, who is the leader of East
Timor's Olympic group.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely East Timor story is one of athletic perseverance
and international brotherhood. It recalls the lofty ideals of an
Olympic movement tarnished lately by scandals involving corruption
and the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Even Gosper had been
widely criticized earlier this year for securing for his daughter a
preferred place in the Olympic torch relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these athletes has a chance to win a medal, but they
will go home the richest athletes in what they gained, in what they
were able to accomplish here,'' Fowlie said.
</P>
<P>
   A former Portuguese colony with 800,000 residents, East Timor
was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed. When pro-Jakarta
militia reacted violently to last year's vote for independence,
Victor Ramos, a lightweight boxer, fled into the hills with his
parents and his brothers and sisters, carrying a 130-pound sack of
rice. The family made makeshift tents from the leaves of trees and
foraged for fruits and vegetables to supplement everyone's meager
diet.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sept. 11, with 20,000 other refugees as an informal wedding
party, Ramos, 30, married Domingues in the hills above Dili. But
when they returned home, he found that the boxing club where he
trained had been gutted, and all the equipment was destroyed.
Ramos, who won a bronze medal at the 1997 Southeast Asia Games, was
left to fashion his own equipment, making punching bags from inner
tubes stuffed with sand.
</P>
<P>
   Martinho de Araujo, a weight lifter, also fled Dili during the
violence. When he returned, his equipment, too, was unusable. In
need of barbells to train, he improvised with metal rods stuck into
paint cans that had been filled with cement. Anything came in handy
_ scrap metal, parts from a truck transmission. Now, he is a week
away from his first international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Calisto da Costa will compete in the men's marathon. With a
personal best of 2 hours 34 minutes, he has no chance of winning.
It is enough to be here.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same for Amaral in the women's marathon. She has never
even heard of Tegla Loroupe, the world record-holder from Kenya and
the Olympic favorite. Amaral has run only one race as long as 26.2
miles. Her time was 3:15, nearly an hour slower than Loroupe's best
time. But that does not matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that if I try hard, I will get to the finish line,''
Amaral said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the starting line on Sept. 24 will be an equally
impressive accomplishment. ``We want to tell the world that we are
able to do it,'' she said.  &QL;

FRONT PAGE RAISES ISSUE OF JOURNALISTIC ETHICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The front-page image on The New York Daily News on
Friday captured the moment that almost every newspaper across the
United States wanted to get: Fidel Castro nearly shaking hands with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the photograph was not exactly real. A note at the bottom
right corner of the page read ``Daily News Photo Illustration.''
The image, a composite of two pictures, has officials at the White
House and some in journalism circles questioning the newspaper's
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kosner, the editor in chief of The Daily News, said that
there was ``no effort at misrepresentation'' and that the label for
``the photo illustration was in type that we usually use for
captions.''
</P>
<P>
   The handshake, the first between an American president and the
Cuban leader, became news on Thursday after President Clinton and
Castro met at the U.N. Millennium Summit meeting in New York. The
meeting was not photographed by any news agencies, and news
organizations were unable to obtain a picture from the White House
or the Cuban delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Several news organizations have faced criticism in recent years
for prominently using photographs that have been manipulated. Time
magazine was ridiculed for darkening a police mug shot of O.J.
Simpson, and Newsday was criticized for combining two pictures to
make it appear as if Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan were skating
on the ice together at the 1994 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity
and who worry that the image could cause problems for Vice
President Al Gore, complained that the words ``photo illustration''
could not be read on The Daily News Web page.

JOSEPH LOUIS MARINO, 85, LAWYER AND LEGAL EDUCATOR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph Louis Marino, a lawyer and legal educator,
died on Sept. 1 at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Marino founded a popular review course for the New York state
bar examination in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, he ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for
Congress in Nassau County, N.Y. He sold the bar-review course in
1979 and practiced law with F. Lee Bailey's firm in Manhattan. Then
he moved to Santa Fe and became first administrator of the New
Mexico Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was born in Manhattan and grew up in Brooklyn. He
received a bachelor's degree in 1938 from Fordham and his law
degree from St. John's University in 1946 after World War II
service in the Army Air Forces. In 1947, he married Alma Morotti,
who died in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Laura Marino and Norma Baca,
both of Santa Fe; a son, Joseph Jr., of Manhattan; three grandsons;
and two brothers, Louis, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Julio J., of
Great Neck, N.Y.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As if Hollywood weren't competitive enough, now
8-year-olds can make movies.
</P>
<P>
   A miniature movie studio - complete with a high-resolution color
video camera slightly larger than a matchbox, an adjustable dolly,
an audio system, four action figures, three movie sets, a clapboard
and basic movie-making instructions - is on the shelves exclusively
at Store of Knowledge outlets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Virtual Movie Studio, developed by Curious Toys of New York,
is Store of Knowledge's premier education and entertainment toy for
the holidays, said Robert L. Bassett, vice president of
merchandising, marketing and e-commerce for the 91-store chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expending an awful lot of energy on the Virtual Movie
Studio,'' Bassett said. ``We think today it's probably the premier
product in our assortment.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerritos, Calif.-based Store of Knowledge is affiliated with
public television, and a portion of its sales go to public
broadcasting stations across the country. The store concentrates on
selling mind-expanding, fun merchandise for children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Virtual Movie Studio costs $199 and is recommended for ages
8 and older. Bassett, 56, said he ``had a ball'' making a short
demonstration film.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Warren, 5, was playing with the studio in the Woodland
Hills store. Hand gripping the camera, he said he would like to
have one.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual studio camera and microphone connects to a
television set alone or with a VCR, or to a stationary or laptop
computer via cords about 6 feet long. Children can see their movie
on the screen as they shoot it or record it with character
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The camera dolly looks and works a lot like those in
professional movie studios, and the camera can be removed from the
dolly if creativity requires. Children can use the action figures
and stage sets that come with the kit or create their own using
other toys - dolls and dollhouses, for instance. More prepackaged
sets and accessories are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McFarland, president of toy developer Curious Toys, says
the Virtual Movie Studio is the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in doing 'me-too' items. All of them have
to be unique,'' McFarland said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Willis, store director for Toys `R' Us in Culver City, said
two Christmases ago his store carried a toy version of a full-sized
camera but with no characters or sets. It sold out quickly, and the
store wasn't able to get more.
</P>
<P>
   Toys `R' Us pretty much covers the gamut of toys, and this one
sounds unique, Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we haven't received anything like that and don't expect
to this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds children make when they see a toy version of a hand
camera are entirely different than when they see a miniature world,
said Richard Isaacs, director of product development for Curious
Toys.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youngsters gravitate toward video games, where they find
more variety and excitement. The Virtual Movie Studio has
electronic components, but kids can manipulate the toys with their
hands, write dialogue, design sets and move the movie camera
around, Isaacs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to speak to where the trends are going, but
translate them to values even parents can appreciate,'' Isaacs
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Toy Institute, $23 billion in
traditional toys and $6.9 billion in video games were sold in the
United States last year.

SECURITY COUNCIL PRESSURES INDONESIA TO END TERROR BY MILITIAS
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for complete writethru with new reporting)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council condemned Wednesday's
murder of three United Nations refugee workers in West Timor and
insisted that the Indonesian government take immediate steps to
disarm and disband the militias that are believed to be responsible
for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In a resolution approved by all 15 member countries on Friday
night, the council declared itself ``appalled'' by what it called
``this outrageous and contemptible act against unarmed
international staff who were in West Timor to help the refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   It also told Indonesian authorities to adopt ``immediate and
effective measures'' to ensure the safe return of as many as
100,000 refugees who fled attacks in East Timor last year after its
residents voted for independence from Indonesia. Many refugees now
want to go home but have been intimidated against doing so by the
marauding militias.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. workers could not return to West Timor, the council said,
until the Indonesian government credibly guaranteed their security.
This must include ``real progress'' toward disarming and disbanding
the militias, who have resisted independence for East Timor with
covert arms and backing from supporters within the Indonesian
military.
</P>
<P>
   Moctar Ouane of Mali, who holds the council's rotating
presidency this month, announced that the council would also send a
delegation to Indonesia and East Timor to help carry out its
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The council sent a delegation to East Timor a year ago when a
massacre erupted after the independence vote. As a result, the
United Nations decided to administer the territory's transition to
self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   Remarking on the climate that led to the latest murders in West
Timor, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, Richard
Holbrooke, told reporters that ``directly or indirectly, it is
elements within the Indonesian military who are responsible for
this, who could have been removed a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know exactly who's behind it,'' Holbrooke said. ``If
we know exactly who it is, we'll deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The three victims, who were killed by a mob linked to a local
militia group, worked for the office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees in West Timor. They were Carlos Caceres,
33, who was from from Puerto Rico; Samson Aregehegn, 44, an
Ethiopian; and Pero Simundsa, 29, a Croat.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council adopted its resolution only hours after
Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, conveyed his nation's
``very deep sorrow'' for their ``horrific death.'' He promised to
punish the killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in disbelief and outraged that such unspeakable crimes
were committed against the good people of the UNHCR,'' Wahid said
in a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. ``The people of
Indonesia mourn with the families of those who were brutally
murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now the situation is very good there,'' Wahid said.
``That is according to the full report I got this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his assurances, sketchy reports surfaced of a new
massacre of as many as 20 civilians, in Betun, about 40 miles from
Atambua, on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid said that two military battalions had been sent to Atambua
and that the authorities had detained 19 people there on suspicion
of ransacking the United Nations office. Another man, he said, had
been detained in connection with the killing of a militia leader,
Olivio Mendonca, whose funeral on Wednesday brought militia
supporters together before they attacked the office.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in Atambua, coming after continuous harassment by the
militias, has forced the United Nations to pull its staff out of
West Timor. The last of more than 400 employees of the United
Nations and other aid groups were flown out Friday, with no plans
for their return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more a question of `if' rather than `when,''' said Ron
Redmond, a spokesman for the high commissioner for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond said his office had repeatedly asked the Indonesian
authorities to separate ``these militia thugs'' from the refugees
in the camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the assurances we have been given have been met, and
now we have three people dead,'' Redmond said. ``So far as we're
concerned, the time for words has passed and we want to see some
action on the ground.''

EDWARDS STANDS TALL WITHOUT WNBA 
(FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The overmatched college players wanted to pay homage after
being beaten by more than 60 points by Team USA. They were not
searching for a WNBA player of the week, however. After quickly
shaking the hands of Lisa Leslie and Sheryl Swoopes, the young
players kept moving through the arena corridor.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted something more lasting and permanent, which is why
they sought out T.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bye, baby,'' Teresa Edwards said, waving to each player.
</P>
<P>
   The slew of college players waved and thanked her for competing
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice playing with you guys,'' Edwards said. ``Good luck to
you. I'll be watching you all.''
</P>
<P>
   She tossed her braided locks over the stars and stripes of the
warm-up jacket on her left shoulder, slung her Team USA duffel bag
over her right shoulder and trudged on out to the team charter bus
for another ride back to another hotel.
</P>
<P>
   There is a flight to Australia in the morning and another
Olympics to compete in next week _ her fifth in 16 years. At age
36, and with little left to give the game physically, the veteran
point guard is tired. But Edwards is also unbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I can ride the boat or drive it,'' she said.
``It doesn't matter. I just want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Age, a defunct league (the American Basketball League) and
contractual disagreements with the WNBA have conspired against
Edwards during the last two years. Instead of flying downcourt on
Lifetime television and enjoying the novelty and early popularity
of U.S. women's professional basketball, she is a virtual outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper is lauded as the greatest to play the game.
Michelle Timms and her peroxide-blonde thatch elicits a cult
following. But Edwards drifts further toward retirement and
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in two years Edwards tried to come to terms with a WNBA
franchise, but the teams were unwilling to pay a four-time Olympian
more than a standard player's share.
</P>
<P>
   If female players had more bargaining power and clout, Edwards
would be Norma Rae in high tops. But the NBA umbrella is too large.
In that vein, she is viewed as a troublemaker, ruining a good thing
for the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her country has done a disservice to her,'' said Dawn
Staley, a close friend on the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Hortencia from Brazil,'' Staley said of Hortencia
Marcari Oliva. ``She's the queen of Brazil. And yet T, she's
relatively unknown. And she's played in five Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why? She stands by things she says and does. I take
my hat off to her for not playing in the WNBA and maybe not giving
in to what she thinks she deserves to play the game. That's
probably why people don't embrace her. She's a woman of her word.
And sometimes, people can't handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said, ``I respect my game and myself too much to settle
for what they were willing to pay me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1984 U.S. Olympic basketball team photo, the first woman
on the left standing in the back row looking slightly in awe,
standing next to Lynette Woodard and Cheryl Miller, is Edwards, her
life and career in front of her. At 20, she was the youngest member
of the first U.S. women's team to win a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' teammates have literally intersected eras and
generations. Between 1983 and 1991, the international teams she
played on won 46 straight games. She played professionally for nine
years overseas in Italy, France, Spain and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed,'' Edwards said. ``We didn't have pro
leagues and now we do. You lived overseas, and no one knew who you
were until the Olympics rolled around in those years. Also, we've
been given the opportunity to truly be athletes as well as women.
And that's a new road to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the ABL folded in 1998, Edwards scored 40 points or more
four times in the league's two-plus seasons, when she coached and
played for Atlanta and then Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Against Cuba in the 1992 Summer Olympics, she made seven
3-pointers, and she distributed a record 15 assists against
Australia at the 1996 Summer Games, which were played close to her
hometown of Cairo, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, the most decorated Olympic basketball player, has an
opportunity to win her fourth gold medal at Sydney. She does not
feel forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some shape, form or fashion, I've had something to do with
the WNBA by playing in the ABL,'' Edwards said. ``I don't think it
would have been taken as serious if no one else tried it. I will
always tell myself I had something to do with that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Edwards added: ``They hear about me, trust me. They just don't
hear about me in the same light. It doesn't bother me. I'm getting
exactly what I deserve. There are no expectations on my behalf that
anybody owes me anything based on my accomplishments. That's not
who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards also has no illusions about her value to the league as a
marquee player.
</P>
<P>
   ``My time has come and gone, as far as I'm concerned,'' she
said. ``I wish that the ones with the power and the marketing and
the values on their names, I wish they knew the values of the
players that built this. That's what I wish. Because if they did,
then they would come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' production has waned, but she is not done. Leading the
break during an exhibition in Hawaii last week, she stutter-stepped
downcourt, waiting for Swoopes, her cutting teammate, to come open
for a layup. Edwards fed the Houston Comets All-Star as she once
fed Miller years ago, the ball delivered on the fingertips, in
stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``T is so competitive,'' Staley said. ``We played HORSE today.
And I beat her. And the look she gave me when she lost. I would not
trade that in for anything. Money. Anything. She still has that
drive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, the U.S. women's team will be severely tested by
Australia, Brazil, Russia and Cuba. Another gold medal is not a
certainty. And yet, after the Games are over and Edwards moves on,
there will still be more opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I do feel like I'm on the outside,'' Edwards said.
``The athletes are just sitting on the shelf in the store. We're
the product. That's the way it is. They have to change things like
free agency. The danger is, if they step up too aggressively, will
David Stern and everyone on top say no to the league? You really
have no power. It's a Catch-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``You step up, you don't want to play because of certain issues.
Now, will the public get behind you, because you're a player who
feels as if you're not being treated right? That sentiment isn't
there. If they do step up, they have to have the public behind
them. The right people, the right lawyers, all of that. And I don't
think America is ready for that. It's not a good risk for the young
girls to take right now. But I think if the momentum keeps growing,
they do have to stand up for themselves eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But once again, you're talking about young women who have made
more money than they have ever made in their life, even though it's
a fraction of what the men make.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way out of the arena last week, WNBA stars such as
Leslie, Swoopes and Nikki McCray drew more of a crowd than Edwards.
After acknowledging the awed collection of college players, Edwards
quietly slipped past a small crowd of autograph seekers and onto
the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the right time and in the right place,'' she said.
``Everybody says I'm too late. I feel good. I didn't miss the boat.
I'm the type of player that likes to make waves and be different.
I'm not afraid to be on the battle lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll dig the hole. Everybody else can come through.''

 &HT;    After 18 years, there'll be no more 'Cats' prowling around
Broadway
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This afternoon, Marlene Danielle will once again
climb the steep backstage stairs of the Winter Garden Theatre to
Room 16, the costume, make-up and memorabilia-cluttered women's
dressing room where she has readied herself to go feline eight
times a week for the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that today's matinee is performance 7,485 of
``Cats,'' the final visit of theatergoers to John Napier's
oversized garbage heap environment, the final downbeat to Andrew
Lloyd Webber's faux-operatic and rock score, the final ascension
for one chosen kitty to the Heaviside Layer for spiritual rebirth.
The last chance to buy a coffee mug with the cats-eyes logo on it.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks the end of an era on Broadway, the last performance
for the show that pussyfooted into town in October 1982, launching
a decade of British musical spectaculars that include ``Les
Miserables,'' ``Phantom of the Opera ``and the recently closed
``Miss Saigon.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the last performance for the longest-running show ever on
Broadway, the production which brazenly advertised itself with the
tag line, ``Now and Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know something, somebody was pretty psychic,'' says
Danielle with a laugh. ``For me, I didn't take 'Now and Forever'
seriously. Even though, in the history of Broadway, we came
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Most theater performers, and certainly the chorus dancers that
are aptly nicknamed ``gypsies,'' move from show to show, season to
season, trying to eke out a career. But not Danielle, whose
professional life for the past 215 months has been a single show _
``Cats.'' Married, the mother of a 26-year-old son who is older
than many of the current cast members, and the owner of two homes
``that ``Cats'' built,'' Danielle has managed a life of unusual
stability in her precarious chosen profession.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her mid-40s, Danielle began more typically as a show
dancer with a nomadic resume. She debuted on Broadway in 1979 in
the short-lived musical ``Sarava,'' before landing in a New York
revival of ``West Side Story'' and then moving on to the original
cast of the off-Broadway romp, ``Little Shop of Horrors.''
</P>
<P>
   As that musical was settling in for its own substantial run,
Danielle was beginning to hear about an improbable British hit
called ``Cats'' which was preparing an assault on New York. ``At
the time, my sister was going to school in London and she had seen
it, was aware of its great success over there and she called me and
said, 'You're got to get this,' '' Danielle recalls.
</P>
<P>
   STARTED AS UNDERSTUDY
</P>
<P>
   She auditioned, along with every New York show dancer worth his
or her jazz shoes, but did not get a call-back by the time director
Trevor Nunn began rehearsing. ``I was very disappointed, but
somehow I didn't totally give up,'' she says. ``They were already
two weeks into rehearsals when, sure enough, they called. A slot
opened up.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielle was only hired as an understudy, but it got her paw in
the door. She soon graduated to the role of Demeter, the
high-strung, intense sidekick to the show's scruffy villain cat,
Macavity. After a couple of years at that assignment, she moved
over to play Demeter's party animal playmate, Bombalurina. ``She's
more relaxed, more into her sensuality,'' Danielle says of the part
she has played for the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   She has never had the opportunity to play the featured role of
Grizabella, the Glamour Cat, the has-been who gets to sing the
show's standout hit tune, ``Memory.'' ``There was a time that I
thought I would like to sing that song and do that part, where
you're only out there for total of a few minutes. But really I like
the action,'' she says with a shrug. ``No, the part that I always
thought would be fun to do was (Rum Tum) Tugger, who goes over the
edge to be a bad-boy, fun kind of character that everybody
enjoys.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its record-breaking success _ seen by more than 10
million people on Broadway, who have collectively paid $400 million
for the privilege _ ``Cats'' has long been sneered at by theater
sophisticates as low-brow kitsch. Danielle will have none of that
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day I watched the show from the front. The
(Jellicle) ball started and I got chills,'' she insists. ``When I
listen to that score, I'm sorry, Andrew Lloyd Webber did create
some beautiful music. Every time I come down those stairs to sing
``Macavity,'' I so enjoy the orchestrations, the chords. They're
fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she can philosophize with the best of them over the
show's message of acceptance and understanding, Danielle's theory
of why it has enjoyed such longevity boils down to its widespread
appeal from the littlest tykes to adults.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling a recent performance, she says, ``There was one man, a
young father holding his daughter, who was dancing in the aisles.
And it just hit me _ I don't know that I'll ever do another show
that grabs people that way, that makes you feel so good that you
want to dance in the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``Cats `` also works on another level. ``We're using
our bodies as animals, and we're in these costumes that show every
curve, every muscle, every line,'' Danielle concedes. The
proverbial tired businessman has done his part to turn ``Cats''
into a hit. ``And businesswomen too, because we've got guys with
great bodies too,'' she quickly adds. ``There is something for
everyone to relax into.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the cast was asked to stay onstage for a short
meeting after a matinee earlier this year, Danielle was pretty sure
the show's death knell was about to be sounded. ``I just kind of
sensed it. I was looking at the houses. All week long, and even
Fridays and Saturdays, were really kind of anemic.'' Originally
announced to shutter June 25, the show got an 11-week reprieve by a
boost in business. Last week, the show pulled in $659,000, on an
estimated 97.8 percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle is hardly in a position to complain about the closing.
``Cats `` has been very good to her, allowing her to afford to
build a country home in Pennsylvania and restore a townhouse in
Jersey City. ``It made coming to work that much more enjoyable,
because I had a fulfillment at home,'' she says, then corrects
herself. ``At my homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of prudent investments, she is not desperate to land the
next job nor is she thinking of retiring from show business.
``Well, I'm a workaholic and I do like my creature comforts,''
Danielle says. ``I would like to do a transition into television
and film,'' both performing and getting scripts she has written
produced. ``As far as in front of the camera, I would love to do an
action hero, sort of like a Xena counterpart, using my stamina and
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   SPOILED BY 'CATS'
</P>
<P>
   She had auditioned for other shows over the years, but felt
spoiled by ``Cats.'' ``I was able to say, 'Why just go do another
show where I would be dancing in the background?' Here, I'm
featured. How many shows, unless you're the star, do you have your
own bow? There were a lot of things that I considered, but decided
they weren't going to make me as happy as I was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats `` has been notoriously hard on dancers, but Danielle
almost made it through 18 years in the show without sustaining a
substantial injury. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   She was sidelined for four months this year with torn muscle
tissue. ``They said they could operate, clear it up and get me back
in a few weeks, but I decided to take the time and let it heal more
naturally,'' Danielle explains. ``I'm a natural kind of girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielle, who owns eight cats _ two at her Jersey City home and
another six in the country _ isn't worried about going through
``Cats'' withdrawal. At 8 tomorrow night, when her muscles are
telling her it is time to kick up her heels and prowl, she can
picture where she'll be. ``I'm going to have a bottle of champagne
and I will be working on my projects,'' she says without a trace of
sadness. ``I'm the sort of person that likes to know that I've got
certain things going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hear from some of the other cast members that people
would ask, 'How is that woman who's been there forever? How is she
taking it?' My response is, 'Y'know what? I've had 18 years to
prepare for this moment,'''

 JetBlue Takes a Dot-Com Approach to Flying  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Call it Airline.com.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when airlines are winning no popularity contests among
passengers, an upstart carrier named JetBlue Airways has turned to
the Internet for tips on building customer loyalty, improving
efficiency and, well, just plain being liked.
</P>
<P>
   And just four weeks after launching dirt-cheap, red-eye service
between Oakland (Calif.) International Airport and New York's JFK,
the airline now says the route is its single-busiest run, with all
nightly flights almost fully booked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the dot-com model, there's no question that
there's a lot of good practices out there,'' Dave Barger, JetBlue's
president, said yesterday. ``And we're using them.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, JetBlue, which sprang to life only seven months
ago, has embraced technology to streamline its operations. Along
with plenty of high-tech gear in the cockpits of its fleet of
Airbus A320s, the carrier has sought to automate its reservation
and ticketing process as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 30 percent of JetBlue bookings are made online _
the highest percentage of any U.S. airline.
</P>
<P>
   Taking another tip from the likes of Amazon.com, the carrier
also believes that a happy customer is a loyal customer, and thus
goes out of its way to make flying _ never a particularly joyful
experience _ if not pleasant, then at least tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   All its planes feature leather seats and free satellite TV on
personal 5-inch screens.
</P>
<P>
   But where JetBlue hews closest to the dot-com ideal is with an
acceptance that to make money, you have to burn through money _
lots of it. With $160 million in initial funding, the company has
purchased or leased 41 planes and has options to purchase 42 more.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue now has about 46 flights a day nationwide. Its intention
to buy dozens of additional jets illustrates the ambitiousness of
its expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's pricing. Simply put, JetBlue wants to be the
cheapest alternative out there. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Its same-day fare for a one-way ticket from Oakland to New York
is $249, or about 79 percent less than competing airlines. Advance
tickets are even cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said JetBlue can accomplish this through increased
productivity. He said each aircraft flies 13.5 hours a day,
compared with the industry average of about 10. And because the
planes are all new, they're more fuel-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you keep fares low,'' Barger insisted.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt, though, that privately held JetBlue is not yet
beholden to shareholders and can afford to operate at a loss.
Barger said the airline saw its first profitable month in August,
but he doesn't foresee sustained profitability until next year.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a huge concern to Wall Street analysts, who see
JetBlue positioning itself as a smart alternative to larger
airlines at a time when passengers almost universally gripe about
delays, cancellations, lousy service and too-small seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the big boys do as terrible a job as they've been doing,
of course guys like JetBlue have a chance,'' said Helane Becker, an
airline-industry analyst with Buckingham Research Group in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great time for JetBlue to be entering the market,''
agreed Glenn Engel, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   For Gary Tam, a researcher with the state Department of Health
Services in Berkeley, JetBlue's rock-bottom fares were what caught
his attention when he went shopping for tickets recently for a trip
from Oakland to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price was very good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tam was expecting the trip to be a typical no-frills
experience _ one of those grin-and-bear-it visits to the unfriendly
skies. He was pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leather seating, the little TV screens. It was great,'' he
said. Tam even liked the blue potato chips offered as a snack and
had no problem with his flight's 11:45 p.m. departure time.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue was the brainchild of David Neeleman, the company's
chief executive, and San Francisco venture capitalist Michael
Lazarus, managing partner of Weston Presidio Capital (and no
relation to the writer of this story).
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman already knew his way around budget airlines. An earlier
effort, Morris Air, was so successful that it was acquired by
Southwest Airlines in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as a five-year ``noncompete'' clause expired, Neeleman
hooked up with Lazarus to launch a new carrier, one that would be
as noteworthy for its level of service as for its bargain-basement
fares.
</P>
<P>
   They recruited a management team largely comprising veterans of
Richard Branson's Virgin Airways. Lazarus' own firm invested about
$35 million in the startup and arranged more than $100 million more
from the deep pockets of financier George Soros and Chase Capital
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now in financially wonderful shape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus, who also serves as chairman of JetBlue's board of
directors, said he expects the company to go public next year.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, potential investors will have had plenty of
opportunities to see for themselves whether the airline's dot-com
approach to air travel will keep it flying for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue, based in New York, began service in February to just
two destinations: Buffalo, N.Y., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. It
subsequently added additional East Coast routes and then headed
west, first to Salt Lake City, Utah, and then to Los Angeles and
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   All its flights are in the wee hours of the morning _ and all
are attracting passengers. The average ``load factor,'' as airline
insiders say, is 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers have not been lost on the likes of United Airlines,
the biggest carrier into and out of San Francisco International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be monitoring JetBlue closely,'' said Matthew Triaca, a
spokesman for the airline. ``We take all competitors seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, analysts will be watching to see if JetBlue can
attract lucrative business travelers. JetBlue's planes now have
only coach class, but Goldman Sachs' Engel said this will have to
change as the company grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to have a problem with the leisure
customer,'' he said. ``Their problem is going to be convincing
business travelers to switch. Over time, they're going to have to
expand to that market.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus said JetBlue will face such choices down the road. For
the moment, he said the airline is taking things one step at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at us like a Volkswagen _ great value and
consistently exceeding expectations,'' Lazarus said. ``And the
great thing is, we don't even have to advertise. We're already
loaded.''

 Marin County, Calif., Newspaper May Be for Sale  &HT;     By Carolyn Said  
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Marin Independent Journal, a
40,000-circulation daily newspaper, may be for sale and newspaper
magnate William Dean Singleton, owner of the Alameda Newspaper
Group, is a likely purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters at the Marin IJ, owned by Gannett Co., the country's
largest newspaper publisher, said they were told by a senior editor
at a meeting on Thursday that a deal with ANG might be in the works
and could be announced by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton's ANG publishes a string of suburban newspapers in the
San Francisco Bay Area. The newspapers, in Oakland, Fremont,
Hayward, Alameda, San Mateo, Vallejo, Pleasanton, Milpitas and
Pacifica, Calif., have a combined circulation of about a
quarter-million.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the Marin IJ to that stable ``would give Singleton a
footprint in every county that surrounds San Francisco,'' said
David Cole, editor and publisher of NewsInc., a newsletter about
the newspaper business. ``It gives him the opportunity to sell ads
all throughout the Bay Area with one buy, one bill.''
</P>
<P>
   A purchase also would allow Singleton to increase efficiencies
by combining the Marin paper's back-office functions with those of
his other Bay Area properties, Cole added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such ``clustering'' is key to Singleton's announced
strategy. MediaNews Group, his Denver company, seeks to acquire
newspapers in contiguous markets ``to realize operating
efficiencies and economic synergies,'' the company's Web site
states.
</P>
<P>
   Cross selling advertising among clustered papers produces higher
operating margins than the papers would earn on their own, the Web
site continues.
</P>
<P>
   MediaNews Group owns newspaper companies with combined daily
circulation of 1.5 million, ranking it as the seventh-largest U.S.
newspaper company, its Web site states.
</P>
<P>
   From a journalistic standpoint, Singleton is known for giving
priority to cutting costs over quality. ``ANG treats reporters and
editors as just so much cannon fodder,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1861, the IJ has been owned by Gannett since 1980.
According to Editor &AMP; Publisher, the paper's circulation has
remained flat during the past three years, while U.S. newspapers
overall have experienced circulation declines.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett uses the IJ's presses to print Northern California
editions of its flagship USA Today paper. Any sale of the IJ would
be likely to include a clause covering USA Today printing, said
newspaper observers.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton and Gannett already have a precedent for such an
arrangement. In March 1999, Singleton purchased the San Bernardino
(Calif.) Sun from Gannett, signing a 10-year contract to continue
printing some editions of USA Today on the Sun's presses.
</P>
<P>
   The IJ has been consigned to afternoon delivery (with some
morning editions available in stores and news racks) because USA
Today usurps the morning press run. Cole said it's possible that
Singleton has enough press capacity elsewhere in the Bay Area that
he could still print USA Today and move the IJ to more-desirable
morning publication.
</P>
<P>
   Several top managers have quit the Marin IJ recently. Phyllis K.
Pfeiffer, IJ publisher since 1993, resigned this week to take on a
job with Contra Costa Newspapers. She will stay with the IJ until
September 29. The director of advertising, the head of online
operations and the managing editor have all resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett declined to comment. Singleton and Pfeiffer did not
return calls.

 New Call to Ban Napster On Campus  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista and Kelly Yamanouchi 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The lawyer representing Metallica and Dr. Dre in
lawsuits against Napster Inc. has asked Stanford University, the
University of California at Berkeley and more than two-dozen other
colleges to ``promptly ban'' the popular file sharing program.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles attorney Howard E. King sent letters to the
universities this week after reading a San Francisco Chronicle
story that said most colleges were not restricting student use of
Napster, which he said allows ``piracy on a massive scale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect some universities will take this opportunity to have
a discussion of the issue,'' King said Friday. ``There's been a lot
of public discussion about the morality and the legality of
Napster. I think colleges, being the hotbed of Napster activity,
are the appropriate place to have that discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   King gave the universities about two weeks to respond but said
he is not threatening legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without the threat of litigation from artists and other
copyright owners, I believe that you can easily recognize the irony
of encouraging your students to matriculate in the creative arts
while engaging in behavior which, if unchecked, will make it
impossible for those students to earn an income from their future
creative efforts,'' King wrote in a letter to Harvard University
President Neil L. Rudenstine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pending copyright infringement lawsuits Metallica and
Dr. Dre filed against the San Mateo, Calif., startup in April named
three colleges as defendants and left room for others to be added.
</P>
<P>
   The three colleges named, the University of Southern California,
Yale University and Indiana University, were dropped as defendants
after they banned Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of several colleges notified this week by King,
including the University of Virginia, UCLA, UC Berkeley and
Stanford, said they will discuss the request before deciding
whether to take action.
</P>
<P>
   UC Berkeley ``does take seriously any notification we get of
copyright infringement,'' said Mike Smith, assistant chancellor for
legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Stanford legal counsel Debra Zumwalt said their
universities have received complaints of copyright violations in
the past, usually involving incidents like music, text or photos
posted without permission on student Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy to date has been if there is evidence of copyright
infringement brought to us, we act on that,'' Zumwalt said.
However, she said, the school so far has not banned ``access to any
particular site of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Napster fans are violating copyright law is also a
central part of Napster's defense in a federal copyright
infringement suit filed by the country's biggest record labels. The
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco will hear the case
Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``These letters are a heavy-handed attempt by Metallica's
lawyers to increase university bans as part of their effort to shut
down Napster,'' company Chief Executive Officer Hank Barry said in
a news release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students who engage in person-to-person file sharing are not
copyright infringers, and we hope that, while the litigation is
pending, schools would not be intimidated by Metallica and limit
the freedom of students to participate in the Napster community.''
</P>
<P>
   Students who use Napster or similar programs like Scour said
they shouldn't, and likely wouldn't, be denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Napster were illegal, the school would have the right to
ban access to it,'' said UC Berkeley student Jim Wu. ``But until it
is illegal, I don't think the school has a right to ban access.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think that restricting access to Napster is
going to restrict people's way of getting free music off the
Internet. It might be a little harder, but people will still find
ways to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA student James Papasin says Napster promotes CD sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably don't have a right to restrict access, but of
course they can do whatever they want,'' Papasin said. ``We're
college students; we should have access to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers for the record companies filed a brief with
the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco supporting a lower
court's preliminary injunction that could shut Napster completely.
</P>
<P>
   And the Motion Picture Association of America and 19 other
organizations filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the
injunction against Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one voice, we band together to send a simple and clear
message: It is wrong to build a business that relies on the theft
of copyrighted materials, and we oppose Napster's business model
for doing just that,'' MPAA President Jack Valenti said in a news
release.

NEW YORK SENATE RACE GROWS MORE COMBATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The combative tone of the Senate campaign in New York
has have escalated with an exchange of television and radio
advertisements as the candidates battle to redefine their own image
and that of their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the campaigns and their supporters in the past 10
days have released nearly a half-dozen ads, most of them critical,
in a back-and-forth duel between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep.
Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides promised more to come _ and exchanged blame for
negativity _ as polls continued to show the candidates in a virtual
dead heat, with many people undecided. Although the candidates are
rarely as harsh on the stump, the bitter tenor left campaign
officials wondering Friday what to expect in the first debate of
the race, on Wednesday in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she airs just a whopper of a lie or distortion, we
occasionally have to respond,'' said Lazio's chief strategist,
Michael Murphy. He is the architect of the candidate's ads,
including a new series asking whether voters can trust Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kauffman, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party,
which has run a set of attack ads on Clinton's behalf, countered,
saying: ``The big difference between Hillary Clinton and the
Democratic Party and the ads Rick Lazio is running is each of our
ads are based on substantive issues. When they run an ad, it
attacks Hillary personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Two advertisements were announced Friday, one by the state
Democratic Party and the other by the state Republican Party, the
first it had created on Lazio's behalf. Both commercials take a
pointed look at their respective candidates' opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic television ad, which began appearing Friday,
reprises a ``man in the street'' style that the party used in an
earlier commercial that purported to show everyday New Yorkers
reacting in shock and dismay at Lazio's positions on health care
and other topics. In the new ad, people react negatively as an
off-camera narrator questions Lazio's support for education.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party released a tongue-in-cheek radio ad, to
begin running in New York City on Monday, that attacks Clinton's
move to New York through a compilation of recorded snippets from
her past speeches and news conferences. ``Chicago is my kind of
town,'' she says in a recording from the 1996 Democratic National
Convention, though the ad does not tell listeners that Chicago not
only is her hometown, but was the site of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was each ad released than the other side began to
criticize it. In the case of the Republican ad, the Democrats
seized on the Republicans' decision to use largely unregulated soft
money donations to pay for the commercial. Lazio has criticized
Clinton for collecting millions of dollars in soft money, but the
Republican radio ad gave Democrats ammunition to accuse him of
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns once again followed up the ads with e-mail
messages to reporters and supporters, quarreling over who went
negative first and pointing out what they said were inaccuracies in
the opponent's ads.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the ads will be broadcast statewide; some are having
such a limited release _ a few stations, one or two days _ that
they seem designed more to get attention from television stations
and newspapers doing reports on them.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lazio entered the race in May, he has run 8 television and
radio commercials; Clinton, 11; the Democratic Party, 7; and the
Republican Party, 1. In addition, other groups like the New York
Conservative Party and the Republican Leadership Council, which
support Lazio, and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, which supports Clinton, have released
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates themselves have been a little less acerbic toward
one another on the campaign trail. They flick pointed barbs
occasionally through news conferences, and did so Friday about the
coming debate.
</P>
<P>
   Another debate, in New York City, is scheduled for Oct. 8, and
the campaign staffs are negotiating another.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, speaking to reporters after touring businesses in
Westchester County, said he looked forward to the debate, and
perhaps signaling what is to come, took the opportunity to
criticize his opponent's campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where else the first lady comes from, except for
attacking me and trying to distort my record; that's what she's
been doing for most of this campaign,'' Lazio said. ``It would be
wonderful if she didn't, if she just took a positive tack. But
we'll wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after touring an elementary school in Brooklyn, engaged
in the time-tested strategy of lowering expectations about how she
might do. ``My opponent has debated a lot and he's been on the
floor of the House debating, so you know obviously I've never done
it before,'' she said. ``I'm trying to get prepared but it's a
totally new experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   When the subject turned to the substance of the debate, however,
she began sounding a bit like some of the harsh commercials made on
her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does a lot of talking but he doesn't actually deliver for
New York,'' she said, rattling off a host of votes she contends
Lazio did not support. ``He may score a debating point or two, but
when it comes to standing up for the children of New York, he's
been missing in action.''

JESSE JACKSON CONFRONTS LEADER OF PERU OVER PRISONER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Friday that he intended
to go to Peru to meet with Lori Berenson, a New Yorker who has been
imprisoned on charges of treason for over five years, and to
negotiate with the Peruvian authorities for her release.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's life sentence for treason and terrorism, handed down
in a military court there, was overturned last month. A new trial
in civilian court is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made what he called a mercy plea for Berenson's release
in front of a surprised President Alberto Fujimori of Peru at a
Manhattan luncheon, at which Fujimori tried to review his nation's
economic and social progress before a gathering of New York
investors and bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called on Fujimori, who stood stone-faced on the podium,
to consider the years that Berenson has already spent in prison as
time served and to release her immediately. He told Fujimori that
doing so ``would be a smart thing to do,'' and that it would
represent ``no threat to your sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said that the judicial branch of the government would
handle the trial, ``not the executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he left open the possibility of a visit by Jackson. ``Of
course we are always willing to dialogue,'' Fujimori said, adding
that the discussions could continue when Jackson was in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Mark L. Berenson, the imprisoned woman's father, said in a
telephone interview that he had met Jackson last week in Chicago
after appearing on the Oprah Winfrey program to talk about the new
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uplifting to us and to many Americans who have seen how
Reverend Jackson has worked for the release of prisoners in
Liberia, Kosovo, Cuba, Saudi Arabia and Iraq,'' he said. ``We're
pleased that in the name of humanity, justice and dignity he's
doing the same now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has spoken publicly about Lori Berenson's case several
times since meeting her father in Chicago. But during the
confrontation with Fujimori on Friday, at the St. Regis Hotel,
Jackson made it clear for the first time that he planned to
intervene directly.
</P>
<P>
   It was unusual for Jackson to put a foreign leader on the spot
so publicly. He said later that he wanted to link the issues of
human rights with the kind of economic performance that Fujimori
had been so eager to discuss at the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic growth without human rights is like a bucket with a
hole in it,'' Jackson said. All of Fujimori's attempts to draw
attention to any improvements in his country's economic or social
situation would be ignored, he said, until Berenson is released.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hear any of what he's saying as long as Lori's in
jail,'' Jackson said.

 &HT;    DualCam packs camera and camcorder in one
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The first digital still photograph cameras hit
the consumer market a few years ago and digital camcorders followed
more recently.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's possible to have two digital cameras in one. JVC Co. of
America has a line of what it calls Digital DualCams that can
record moving video with sound and still photographs at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the line is the GR-DVL9800 Digital DualCam introduced
in February. The device has a high-resolution video camera that
records on tape combined with a high-resolution still camera that
records images on a memory card.
</P>
<P>
   The two components can be used separately, or the still camera
can be used to take digital snapshots of the same scenes being
recorded by the video camera.
</P>
<P>
   JVC says the video camera has progressive-scan technology to
capture video with 520 lines of horizontal resolution and 480 lines
of vertical resolution. It's capable of shooting 30 high-resolution
frames per second so each frame is sharp enough to be downloaded to
a computer or video printer.
</P>
<P>
   The lens can be adjusted to magnify images up to 10 times
optically, and the digital brain can increase magnification 200
times. The camcorder also has a fast-speed shooting mode to create
slow-motion effects.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the resolution selected, the camera can store from
12 to 36 images on a removable 4 megabyte MultiMediaCard. The
memory card, which is about the size of a postage stamp, comes with
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   The camcorder itself is equipped to add digital effects such as
fades, wipes and dissolves to mark transitions between scenes.
</P>
<P>
   JVC sets the manufacturer's suggested price for the GR-DVL9800
Digital DualCam at $1,999, but it's available locally at Click
Camera stores for $1,799, according to a clerk at the company's
Englewood area store.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Tuned In &AMP; Turned On
 &HT;    By Bob Batz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Pat Smith is talking as he winds his way through
the mountain of radios, tubes, speakers and other broadcast-related
paraphernalia that fills his delightfully cluttered electronics
shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrill of the chase and taking something that's 50 years
old and bringing it back to life are what this hobby is all
about,'' Smith declares.
</P>
<P>
   Later, gently running his fingers over a rare 1941 General
Electric brass-trimmed ``jewel box radio,'' he says, ``A woman gave
me this one. It was her first radio. She bought it in 1941. One of
these sold recently on the Internet _ for $2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the radio was the most important piece of
furniture in most American living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now those vintage Crosleys, Zeniths and Atwater Kents that
brought us such shows as ``Fibber McGee &AMP; Molly,'' ``Gangbusters''
and ``The Lone Ranger'' are among the nation's hottest
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton area has hundreds of vintage radio enthusiasts and at
least two clubs that enable members to get together on a regular
basis to talk about their hobby.
</P>
<P>
   For radio buffs and others who routinely surf the Internet in
hopes of beefing up their collections or keeping the radios they
already own in working order, Smith _ who makes his living
repairing old radios and selling parts for them _ is definitely a
go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   You name it and it's probably stacked, boxed or strewn about his
three-room storefront shop. Even the name of the business _
Antique, Classic &AMP; Modern Electronics (ACME) _ has a slightly
cluttered ring to it. Smith likes it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this place looks disorganized,'' he says,'' I know
exactly where everything is. Well, almost exactly, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   As vintage radio enthusiasts go, the 32-year-old Smith, who has
about 100 radios in his collection, is one of the youngest in the
Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my first radio in the mid-1970s, and my collection
has been growing ever since,'' he says, noting that his best
sources for vintage radios are flea markets, garage sales and
widows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go on a safari looking for old radios, they just seem
to come to me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The first radios date to the early 1920s. Manufacturers included
Crosley, Atwater Kent and RCA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until 1925 or 1926, all radios were battery-powered,'' Smith
says. ``The radios that are hardest to find are those made from
1921 to 1924. Between 1922 and 1927, radio made huge advances.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to some of the radios in his collection, Smith's
shop holds vintage and newer tubes, speakers in every size and
shape, old hi-fi equipment, radio literature, antennas, knobs and
dials.
</P>
<P>
   Even the two cats who while away the afternoons dozing in the
sun-washed front window of the store have radio-ish names _ Crosley
and Edison.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's collection of classic radios runs the gamut from
A(Airline) to Z (Zenith). He has Crosleys, too, and Philcos,
Admirals, Motorolas, Atwater Kents, Delcos, Silvertones and
Truetones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people collect radios so they can sell them and make
money,'' he explains. ``Others just enjoy showing 'em off. Other
collectors specialize in tubes or literature. One guy even collects
tube boxes, many of which are bright-colored. Collections come in
all sizes. There's a guy in Hamilton who has one of largest
collections in the world. He has thousands of radios.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gray, 69, who stops by Smith's shop frequently to talk about
radios and see what's new _ or old, says radio collectors come in
all shapes and sizes, and from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to get started is an interest in old radios and
the urge to collect them,'' says Gray, who owns 125 radios, give or
take a Philco or two. He has his radios displayed museum-style in
six of the seven rooms of his home.
</P>
<P>
   Gray got his first radio 55 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Zenith Tombstone from the mid-1930s,'' he recalls.
``I paid maybe five bucks for it. And I don't have it any more. In
the last five years it has become harder and harder to find vintage
radios, especially the rarer ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most valuable radios are the Zenith Stratosphere and
the Spartan Nocturne. Both date to the mid-1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four or five years ago, a Stratosphere sold for $40,000,''
Gray says. ``Most bring $10,000 or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage radio tubes can also have big price tags, Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are very expensive, others, including some still in their
original boxes, sell for as little as a dollar,'' he says. ``I just
sold four tubes on the Internet. I got $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is making an impact on the hobby, Smith says,
noting: ``It's both good and bad. It's been good to people like me.
My hobby has turned into my business. On the down side, it has
driven up prices of old radios.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray says the popularity of collecting vintage radios is growing
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll continue to grow, too . . . as long as we don't
all die out. I'd say the average collector is 50.The oldest I know
is 92, maybe 93.''
</P>
<P>
   Do some people think Gray is a little crazy when he tells them
he has 125 old radios?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some do,'' he says, ``but I just ask them, 'What do you
collect?' This hobby is as much about preservation as it is about
collecting. That makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody with an interest in old radios can get involved in the
hobby for a little money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy a Philco cathedral radio in good working for
around $200,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest swap meets for radio collectors are held in Elgin,
Ill. (August), Lansing, Mich. (July), and Rochester, N.Y.
(September).
</P>
<P>
   ``They draw people from all over the world, too,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says the biggest help to a guy who collects radios is a
tolerant and understanding wife.
</P>
<P>
   Smith agrees, adding: ``I know a guy whose divorce was based on
his collection of vintage radios.''

 &HT;    Wine making alive and well in Colorado
 &HT;    By Lori Cumpston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. To hear Erik Bruner talk about the early
days at Plum Creek Cellars winery in Palisade, you can't help but
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell you a story,'' he says, propping himself up
against a stack of wooden barrels in the heart of the winery.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner, clad in worn jeans, a blue-and-white striped shirt and
suspenders, launches into a story about the time he brought in a
load of wine for a local store to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This older fellow was there and his son was the wine buyer . .
. I said, `I've got some Plum Creek wine,' and he looked over and
said, `Who ordered that sh--?' '' says Bruner, 60, his mischievous
eyes twinkling from behind wire-rim glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I persisted and we went to every dog-and-pony-show
winetasting. I'd be in liquor stores signing bottles, kissing
babies all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Plum Creek Cellars is the brainchild of Bruner and his close
friends, Doug and Sue Phillips. The threesome, along with a group
of winetasting friends, founded the winery in a garage south of
Denver in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner had been practicing winemaking for quite awhile before
approaching Doug with the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When were the Broncos in the first Super Bowl?'' he asks.
``That's when I made my first batch of wine out of concentrates ...
that was a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1978.
</P>
<P>
   As Bruner's confidence grew, so did his yard. He transformed his
Front Range home into a Napa Valley vineyard that even
Oscar-winning movie mogul turned wine entrepreneur Francis Ford
Coppola would have been proud of well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put in my own grapes,'' recalls Bruner, smirking. ``My back
yard was a total jungle. My ex-wife wouldn't even go out in the
back yard anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S ALL ABOUT BALANCE
</P>
<P>
   W inemaking is not new to Colorado. In fact, the winemaking
industry was alive and well more than 100 years ago. The demise for
grape growers came in 1916. That's when the state adopted a
prohibition statute forcing vineyards out of business.
</P>
<P>
   That statute was later repealed.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the late '60s that the state's wine industry
started to heat up again.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner's own family hails from the fertile farmlands of West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was a mercenary,'' says Bruner. ``He hid out
with the Pennsylvania Germans and the first son walked from
Lancaster to Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1830 and started the
family farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruner, a geological engineer by trade, began entertaining the
idea of making wine full time.
</P>
<P>
   He relocated to Palisade.
</P>
<P>
   Doug and Sue live in Denver where they practice law. The couple
commute to Palisade on weekends to help run the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balance,'' says Bruner when asked what makes a good wine.
``Ripeness and balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is the most rewarding is to go to winetastings
where your wine is being evaluated and see how pleased people are
and if they're really enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Bruner was diagnosed with Parkinson's, a debilitating
disease that is characterized by rhythmic tremors and rigidity of
the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   His health was further complicated by heart and lung problems as
a result of coronary artery disease. In 1998, he underwent triple
bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner was forced into early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   FROM CELLAR RAT TO HEAD WINEMAKER
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was fate that brought Bruner face to face with Jenne
Baldwin, then a 24-year-old personal trainer from Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has a small mom-and-pop aquarium,'' says Baldwin, a
fresh-faced blonde with an outdoorsy glow. ``We have 14 harbor
seals and over 200 tanks. My grandparents started it over 60 years
ago ... it's a far cry from grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Baldwin, who has a minor in chemistry from Chico
State University in northern California, found herself beating the
grapevines looking for work as a lab assistant.
</P>
<P>
   She began working part-time at Plum Creek as a cellar rat,
eventually working her way up to the office, lab, tasting room and
bottling departments.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner has taken Baldwin under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   His health problems have forced him to step down as head
winemaker but he still holds the title of winemaker emeritus and
lives on the grounds, helping out as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Baldwin was promoted to head winemaker. She is
believed to be one of only three female head winemakers in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   State regulations do not require winemakers to be licensed,
however Baldwin studies yearly at the University of California at
Davis, which is world renowned for its programs on winemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exactly a pioneer,'' says Baldwin, ``but I did see a
lot of wineries start up. Erik took it this far and hopefully I can
take it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no time to reflect.
</P>
<P>
   The grape harvest has begun. Bruner and Baldwin are awaiting a
load of grapes. It's crush time.
</P>
<P>
   The work day starts at 6 a.m. Equipment is cleaned and sanitized
before the grapes can be processed. That's followed by another
three to four hours of clean-up.
</P>
<P>
   Some days the work isn't finished until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Plum Creek Cellars expects to harvest 150 tons of grapes. That
translates into 11,000 cases of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The winery boasts a wonderful array of red wines, including
Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It also has an
interesting selection of white wines, Chardonnay and Riesling, as
well as dessert and rose wines. In fact, the Riesling Ice Wine is
the state's only ice wine made from 100 percent Riesling grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Past vintages have won awards.
</P>
<P>
   Plum Creek's Cabernet Franc for '97 and '98 received double gold
medals in a national wine competition. The 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon
also received a gold medal at the Indy International Wine
Competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think it's a romantic profession,'' says Baldwin.
``Everyone has seen that Lucille Ball episode where she is stomping
grapes with her feet and that's how they think it is ... that we're
just laughing, running around and dancing. It's very intensive
manual labor.''

EDITORIAL: LIEBERMAN'S CAMPAIGN INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman is now running for two national offices at the
same time _ his Senate seat from his home state of Connecticut and
the vice presidency as the Democratic Party nominee. The
Connecticut Elections Enforcement Commission decided this week that
this double campaigning is legal. That still does not make it fair
to Connecticut voters or smart for the state's Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   By staying in both races, Lieberman is hedging his bets in a way
that benefits him, of course. But it hardly sends a signal of
confidence about the future of the ticket he is sharing with Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his dual candidacy could lead to a situation in which
Connecticut chooses a Democratic senator in November but has a
Republican installed by appointment. It could also lead to
legislative contortions as Democrats in the state Capitol try to
figure out a way to prevent Gov. John Rowland, a Republican, from
filling the vacancy from within his own party should Lieberman go
to Washington as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, only a few days after the traditional Labor Day
kickoff of the fall campaign, there is still time for Lieberman to
get off the ballot and let the two parties conduct a fair fight for
his vacated seat.
</P>
<P>
   As things now stand, if Lieberman resigns from the Senate race
before Oct. 27, Connecticut's Democratic State Central Committee
would pick a replacement. The name mentioned most often is the
state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who would be a strong
contender for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee, Mayor Philip Giordano of Waterbury, is
regarded by some as a place-holder against Lieberman, but the
Republicans would have the option of asking him to step aside in
favor of a a stronger replacement.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman wins both his Senate campaign and the vice
presidency, Rowland will pick a replacement who must run for the
office two years later. Rowland can be expected to choose a member
of his own party for the job, giving the Senate one more Republican
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this potential for damage to his own party, Lieberman
has said that he favors a Rowland appointment now because it would
give the political system enough time to work _ with full primaries
and full-fledged elections in the year 2002. If he pulls out early,
he has argued, the process would be chaotic and unfair since a
party committee, instead of a primary, would pick the Democratic
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's spokesman argues that an election this year would be
a hurried affair, without a primary, and that the winner would be
allowed to serve for a full six years. He points out that the
governor's presumed Republican appointee would serve for only two
years at most until facing election. This reasoning is thin and
self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is prompting Democratic leaders in Connecticut to
contemplate a hasty rerigging of election laws. The thought is that
if Lieberman resigns from the Senate to be vice president, the
Democratic legislature can then pass a bill requiring a special
election in three or perhaps six months to fill the empty seat
sometime next year. Rowland, according to this plan, would have
difficulty vetoing such a bill because it would appear undemocratic
to deprive voters of an election.
</P>
<P>
   But the cleaner, fairer solution is to let Connecticut voters
have a choice in the regularly scheduled general election.
Lieberman should resign from the Senate race right away and leave
that contest to candidates who will definitely be available to
serve. That action would also put a ring of confidence into his
predictions of victory on the presidential ticket.

OLYMPIC CAPSULE: BASKETBALL  
 (FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forty And 0. Since the United States was first represented by
NBA players in 1992, Olympic men's basketball has been a coronation
rather than a competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Dream Team moniker should have been done away with after
Magic, Jordan and Bird teamed for gold eight years ago. Still, you
can't bet against a crew featuring Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett and
Jason Kidd. Even with only one natural center, Alonzo Mourning, the
U.S. men is not in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S. women, that's another story. The Australian men
and women could both win a medal, with the women possibly pushing
the United States for gold. A team featuring Lisa Leslie, Sheryl
Swoopes and five-time Olympian Teresa Edwards should be a lock. But
lack of practice time because of commitments for the WNBA and stiff
competition from the host country, Russia, Brazil and Cuba may
prove too much of a task. Unlike the men, they can be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETUP
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men have a virtual cakewalk in first three games of the
preliminary round, opening with China, Italy and a watered-down
Lithuania. Russia, Yugoslavia and Australia will mix it up in Group
B, with the highest-seeded survivor eventually advancing to face
the United States for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one personal setup: Alonzo Mourning is actually leaving
the Games on Sept. 22 for his home in Miami, and is not scheduled
to return to Sydney until Sept. 26. He is flying 9,330 miles
round-trip so that his wife, Tracy Wilson-Mourning, can give birth
by induced labor to the couple's child. Apparently, coach Rudy
Tomjanovich is not too concerned with the inside game of either New
Zealand or France, the two opponents Mourning will miss.
</P>
<P>
   THE WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   The Australians, who won the bronze in 1996, feature not only
the former Olympians Michelle Timms, Carla Boyd and Michelle
Griffiths but also Lauren Jackson, a 19-year-old Wunderkind who
figures to be the first pick in the 2001 WNBA draft.She gives the
host country a good shot at competing for a medal.
</P>
<P>
   She stands 6 feet 5 inches, can post up or play on the perimeter
and her pulled-back ponytail belies her ferocity. Jackson elbowed
Leslie during an exhibition last fall. The two jawed at one
another. Jackson said afterward: ``I'm not going to sit back and
let some Lisa Leslie go at me. I really don't care what she says to
me because one day I'll be as good as her.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Swoopes may have to match up against Brazil's
Janeth Arcain, her Houston Comets teammate.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't falter in the preliminary round and find a way to
claw past Brazil and Russia, the Aussies could find themselves in a
spirited game for the gold against a U.S. team still trying to find
the perfect chemistry over a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   THE MEN
</P>
<P>
   The lack of marquee players stands out. Beyond the absences of
Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Grant Hill from the
United States, neither Rick Fox nor Jamaal Magloire, a 2000 NBA
draft pick, will play for Canada. Vlade Divac is not playing for
Yugoslavia. And injuries to Arvydas Sabonis, Zydrunas Ilgauskas and
star Arturas Karnisovas cripple Lithuania's chances. Croatia, which
could have featured Toni Kukoc, did not even qualify.
</P>
<P>
   France's 7-1 Frederic Weis, whom the Knicks chose with the 15th
pick in the 1999 draft but who has yet to play an NBA game, and
China's 7-foot Wang Zhizhi, taken in the second round of the '99
draft by the Mavericks, will play and make for some good
conversation. Zhizhi, his 7-4 teammate Yao Ming and the 6-11
forward Menk Bater have been christened by the Asian media as the
``Walking Great Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Still after the Vinsanity dunk-a-thon has ended, the quest is
for silver again on the men's side.
</P>
<P>
   A weakened European field could enable the Australian men to
finally win a medal in the sport. Like Teresa Edwards, Andrew Gaze
is a five-time Olympian. Chris Anstey, Luc Longley and Shane Heal
give the Aussie men three more players with NBA experience. If
either team advances to the gold-medal game, expect the Sydney
SuperDome to shake with sound. The United States could be
susceptible to a hot perimeter team that starts knocking down
3-pointers and builds a quick lead.
</P>
<P>
   And if either Mourning or Gary Payton blows a fuse at a key
juncture, who knows? The U.S. men do not have to worry about
overconfidence, but keeping their composure could be a chore.

 &HT;    It's easy to have a hot time in Phoenix
 &HT;    By Ray Marcano
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The first thing that hits you about Phoenix is
the heat. Yes, it's dry heat, whatever that means, but 113 degrees
_ the high during a recent trip _ is still hot by any standard.
</P>
<P>
   But there's some good news. The temperatures will soon start to
get cooler, travelers will look for an interesting place to go, and
Phoenix is a nice, affordable destination with more than enough to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: From the East Coast and Midwest, plan on a 3 1/2-
to 4 1/2-hour plane ride. And, if you catch the right fares, it
won't break you. In two trips to Phoenix this year _ one in April,
the other in August _ the fare from Columbus was $219 round trip
for a direct flight. Beware: That fare fluctuated wildly and at one
point, that same ticket was $435. As always, look ahead, plan and
when you see a great fare, don't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: To do it all, you'll have to come back several
times. The allure of Phoenix isn't just the city, but everything
that's within four hours.
</P>
<P>
   For those that like the great outdoors, there's no shortage of
hiking, and Camelback is a fun mountain to climb. It's right
outside Phoenix and visible from downtown. Plan on spending 90
minutes to two hours on the 2 1/2-mile hike.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's golf. Phoenix has 180 courses in the area, an
incredible mix of public, semiprivate and private courses to fit
most budgets. Summer greens fees can be as low as $25, depending on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're not into hiking or golf, Phoenix is big on the Old
West. Among the attractions: Rawhide, a mix of theater, action
shows, shopping and food, (480) 502-5600) and Tombstone, one of the
country's legendary Old West cities, is a 2 1/2-hour drive away.
And, of course, you can take the four-hour drive to the Grand
Canyon, a true national treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: Like any big city Phoenix has an array of hotels.
The Crowne Plaza downtown is a terrific choice for about $100 a
night, depending on the season. And if you stay downtown take the
75-minute tour of Bank One Ballpark, (602) 462-6543, home of the
Arizona Diamondbacks. For $6 adults, $4 children, it's a must for
baseball fans.

   GETTING BUMPED PAYS OFF
</P>
<P>
   When traveling, try never to be in a hurry. It can really pay
off, and save the savvy bargain traveler hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   My August Phoenix flight was oversold. The attendants asked for
volunteers willing to take a later flight in exchange for a $300
travel voucher and a meal ticket for lunch. That, in an of itself,
is a pretty good deal. But I had to make a few phone calls to tell
people I'd be late, and the airline offered a 10-minute phone card
to take care of that. Then I found out the first-class section
wasn't full, I asked for _ and received _ an upgrade from my coach
seat.
</P>
<P>
   I got to Phoenix three hours later than I was supposed to, but
have a free trip, had a good lunch, got a calling card to make my
calls and flew in style.
</P>
<P>
   So the lesson is: Build in some extra travel time. It could pay
big dividends.
</P>
<P>
   MAILBAG
</P>
<P>
   A few female readers who plan trips by themselves have asked
what precautions they should take when traveling alone. The Web is
full of sites that offer such advice, and a good one is from Travel
and Leisure, whose site offers ``50 Tips for Women Traveling
Alone.'' Go to
http://www.pathfinder.com/travel/TL/tarticles/1132.html and you'll
get right to the page. In addition, most airlines offer tips on how
to handle children traveling by themselves, and there are sites
specifically for seniors.

EMBATTLED COACH FACES NEW ACCUSATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indiana University Coach Bobby Knight Friday night denied an
accusation that he physically and verbally assaulted a student on
Thursday afternoon after the student addressed him by his last
name.
</P>
<P>
   In a live news conference on the school's campus in Bloomington
on Friday evening, Knight said he had had a brief encounter with
the student about ``manners and civility'' but said he never swore
at the student or manhandled him.
</P>
<P>
   One of Knight's assistant coaches, Mike Davis, who said he had
witnessed the incident, said that the accusation was untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The university had confirmed earlier that it was investigating
what Christopher Simpson, a school spokesman, described as an
``extraordinarily serious'' accusation. Four months earlier, Myles
Brand, the president of the university, suspended Knight for three
games in the 2000-1 season, fined him $30,000 and warned him that
any future instances of unacceptable behavior could result in his
immediate firing.
</P>
<P>
   Brand acted after a seven-week investigation by the school's
board of trustees concluded that Knight had displayed a ``pattern
of inappropriate behavior'' that had embarrassed the university.
Among the accusations investigated by the trustees were that the
often-volatile Knight had once choked a player during practice and
had hurled a vase near a school secretary during a fit of anger.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident, Mark Shaw, a former Bloomington-area
radio talk-show host and a critic of Knight, told ESPN that his
stepson _ a 19-year-old freshman _ had been grabbed by Knight and
cursed at after he greeted him on campus at around 2 p.m. Thursday
by saying, ``Hey, what's up, Knight?''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw told the Indianapolis Star that he saw finger marks on his
stepson's arm and reported the incident to Simpson later that
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, his stepson and four other witnesses also reported the
incident to campus police. Shaw asked that Knight apologize and
that the incident be reported to a committee headed by athletics
director Clarence Doninger and charged with devising a code of
conduct for Knight and all university coaches.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Friday night, Knight said he was coming
through a door at Assembly Hall, where the basketball team plays
its games, when Shaw's stepson, Kent Harvey, greeted him by his
last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is not Knight to you,'' the coach said he told the
student. ``It is Coach or Mr. Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight said he had his hand on the inside of the young man's arm
as he addressed him, but said the accusations of any pulling or
spinning of the student were false.
</P>
<P>
   Knight used a blackboard to diagram the encounter and then used
Davis as a prop to demonstrate Knight's version of what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never said a cuss word, he never raised his voice,'' Davis
said of Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Knight noted to reporters that the student is the stepson of a
person he termed his ``most vitriolic critic.'' He also said that
in the wake of his recent sanctions, he would have to be an
``absolute moron'' to get involved in a public confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Jerry Minger of the campus police said that investigators
were scheduling interviews with the younger Shaw as well as other
witnesses but that it was difficult to determine how long it would
take to complete the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw did not return phone calls or e-mail messages to his Web
site, which describes him as a lawyer, author and movie producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if we're talking about Bob Knight, the president
of the United States, or some guy off the street, that kind of
conduct is not tolerated,'' Shaw told the Indianapolis Star.

BRUINS DO HAVE A CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ There will be thousands of fans dressed in red,
enough motor homes parked outside the Rose Bowl to make it look
like a trailer park, and the visiting team lining up in white
uniforms and red helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe UCLA can convince itself that it's playing Alabama again.
</P>
<P>
   That figures to be the biggest challenge for the Bruins,
convincing themselves that this afternoon's hole in the middle of
their schedule _ Fresno State, surrounded by games against then-No.
3 Alabama and current No. 3 Michigan _ is worth getting excited
about.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, UCLA coach Bob Toledo stepped up the intensity in
practice on Wednesday with his coaches barking orders and a sense
of urgency pervading drills. He's even broached a subject with his
players that would have seemed ridiculous a week ago _ playing for
a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realize what's at stake,'' Toledo said. ``I asked them,
`If you're going to pick the BCS now, who would you pick, Alabama
or UCLA?' We've done some nice things. For us to stub our toe would
be a real tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 16th-ranked Bruins are 14-point favorites over Fresno
State, Toledo said it is important just to win, not score a big
victory. However, if the win over Alabama proved that the Bruins
have top-10 caliber talent, this game should be a test of whether
they have national-caliber character.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins can run the ball down the throat of Alabama, why
can't they do it to Fresno State? If the Bruins can smother
Alabama's offense, why can't they do it to the Bulldogs?
</P>
<P>
   There will be no letdown, assured center Troy Danoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for it,'' said Danoff, who with guards Brian
Polak and Oscar Cabrera, tackles Bryce Bohlander and Mike Saffer,
and tight ends Gabe Crecion, Mike Seidman and Bryan Fletcher
dominated Alabama's front seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``In football, you only play 11 games _ 12 if you get the
opportunity to go to a bowl game _ so it's not too hard o,{

CASTRO GETS SYMPATHETIC AUDIENCE AT NEW YORK CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG and CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Fidel Castro of Cuba denounced the American
economic embargo on his country on Friday night and presented a
bleak vision of the world's future before thousands of cheering and
flag-waving supporters gathered in Riverside Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall be entering the 21st century, and that will happen in
extremely hard conditions for the world,'' the Cuban leader said in
a hoarse voice to about 2,400 listeners. ``The world is undergoing
a catastrophic situation. Don't believe the experts who feign
optimism and ignore the cruel realities of the developing world.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro called the United States' economic sanctions against Cuba
a ``criminal embargo'' and ``a violation of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader arrived shortly after 9 p.m., an hour later
than scheduled. Dressed in his signature olive military uniform, he
strode confidently to the lectern, surrounded by guards in dark
suits. Cheers and screams rose to the dark heights of the church,
and hundreds of arms fervently waved Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers called the event ``an evening of solidarity with
the Cuban people.'' Friday night, those political sympathies were
worn on sleeves, collars and T-shirts, as pins of the Cuban flag
and of Che Guevara, the guerrilla leader who became a symbol of the
communist revolution, abounded.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who attended, including Rep. Jose E. Serrano,
D.-N.Y., and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., denounced U.S. policies
toward Cuba. The United States imposed the economic embargo shortly
after Castro took power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people view Cuba very differently from its
government,'' Serrano told a group of reporters in Spanish. He said
he and those present only wanted Cuba to be ``treated equally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cuba discovered oil tomorrow, my country would be its
greatest ally,'' he said. ``If Cuba had, and I don't want it to
have, military arms that could create terror in the world, we would
be allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro was invited to Riverside Church by the New York Welcoming
Committee for the Cuban Delegation for the Millennium. People
wanting to attend were asked to fax requests to the group, which
chose about 2,400 spectators. Friday night, about 2,100 of them sat
in the main chamber, while 300 sat in a side room watching the
event on television.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, made up of various grassroots groups, asked
Riverside if they could use the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are against the embargo, and that is why we are holding
this reception,'' said Aleeka Wade, a spokeswoman for the group.
``We hope to show tonight how many people there are who oppose the
embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bernard Wilson, the executive minister at Riverside,
said before the event that the church was pleased to play host for
the visit. ``Riverside has always been on the cutting edge of what
is happening in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was in New York this week to attend the United Nations
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at the United Nations, he criticized the power
that industrialized countries have over the developing world,
saying wealthy nations have ``only served to make us poorer, more
exploited and more dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for a reform of the United Nations, to transform it
``into a true representative body of all the interests of all the
peoples on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, as she was waiting for Castro to arrive at the
church, Ellen P. Bernstein reflected on the Cuban leader's role in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. people need to hear that he is not a devil, not the
devil he is said to be,'' she said. ``They need to hear he has
important ideas for the same goals we all aspire to: world peace
and security and the proper treatment of the power.''

`ANATOMY': DWINDLING STUDENT BODY, IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Any dummy who didn't already know that dissecting a
corpse is a lot like having sex is instructed to study ``Anatomy,''
the clumsy German horror movie that sneaked into the AMC theater
complex Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The bad girl in this preposterous Germanic imitation of American
teen horror movies like ``Scream'' is a boy-crazy medical student
named Gretchen (Anna Loos), who gives ``anatomy tests'' to her
dates on a dissecting table in the ultramodern lab of a renowned
medical school in Heidelberg.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen discovers to her annoyance that such a setting is not
conducive to sexual ardor, even when she does an aggressive
striptease. And she is eventually punished for her meanness by Hein
(Benno Fuermann), a spurned boy-toy who lurches around like a
glowering caricature of a Hitler Youth recruit transplanted into
the 21st century and divested of his Nazi insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the other students and most of the faculty, Hein
happens to belong to a secret ``anti-Hippocratic'' society whose
members believe that medical research is worth the sacrifice of
human lives.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Anatomy'' is a horror film, that lodge's philosophy has
become a rationalization for the wholesale murder of innocent
students. It is carried out by drugging them, injecting them with a
substance that turns blood into a rubberized plastic and announcing
proudly, ``It's statue time.'' If you wondered why the models in
the anatomy lab are so incredibly lifelike, there's your answer.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's plucky Nancy Drew who smells a formaldehyde-dipped
rat on the premises is Paula (Franka Potente), a brilliant medical
student whose beloved dying grandfather is a university legend. One
of the many sad lessons that nosy, high-minded Paula eventually
learns is that Grandpa wasn't quite the pillar of medical ethics
that she thought he was.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the movie, she gets herself into such a pickle
that she finds herself in danger of literally being pickled. Or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Ruzowitzky, who wrote and directed ``Anatomy,'' has
learned a few things from American filmmakers about setting up
diversionary booby traps and finding the proper camera angles to
show the glint of a concealed knife. But the movie, which is
crudely dubbed into English, lacks the raucous,
anything-for-a-shock carnival humor of its American prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   After it's over, the only question worth asking is whether dear,
cozy old Heidelberg can survive the slander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anatomy'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It includes gory violence and nudity.
</P>
<P>

remembers most about her father is the last years of his life. He
was shot and paralyzed in 1972 while running as an independent
candidate for president. The shooting changed him in many ways,
Kennedy says. He renounced his racial politics, began reading his
Bible every day and started seeking forgiveness. ``He would call
friends he hadn't talked to for a long time and say, 'If we got
anything to straighten out, let's straighten it out now.''' Kennedy

was attempting to register as voters a group of blacks turned away
from the courthouse in Selma, Ala. Albert Vivian, 38, is following
in his father's footsteps, taking over a consulting business that

youngest son of Muhammad's eight children, he had begun to doubt
his father's faith by the time he was a teenager. By 1964, his
father banned him from the movement. Today, Warith Deen Mohammed is
a Muslim elder statesman and has a new appreciation for his father.
``Elijah Muhammad wasn't a racist,'' he says, ``but rather an

children of the struggle -- the offspring of militants, nonviolent
activists and even segregationist leaders -- are now adults. Ericka

the years, the performance of Cuban athletes has been remarkable,
especially in the Olympic Games. Cubans have always been sports
fanatics, with a near-legendary love for baseball. But ever since
Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, they've had the active
encouragement of their government, which early on identified sports
as a key element in its vision for an egalitarian, socialist
society. Cuban baseball players at baseball practice at the

daughter of former Gov. George Wallace of Alabama. What she

was shot and paralyzed in 1972 while running as an independent

Kennedy says. He renounced his racial politics, began reading his
Bible every day and started seeking forgiveness. ``He would call
friends he hadn't talked to for a long time and say, 'If we got
anything to straighten out, let's straighten it out now.''' Kennedy

   (NYT11) HAVANA -- Sept. 8, 2000 -- CUBA-OLYMPICS-COX-2 -- Over
the years, the performance of Cuban athletes has been remarkable,
especially in the Olympic Games. Cubans have always been sports
fanatics, with a near-legendary love for baseball. But ever since
Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, they've had the active
encouragement of their government, which early on identified sports
as a key element in its vision for an egalitarian, socialist
society. Cuban baseball players at baseball practice at the

football fan, they are firmly convinced their team is going to win,
and win big. Despite being one of the world's smaller countries,
with a population of only 11 million, Cuban athletes took home 31
Olympic medals in 1992's Barcelona games, placing fifth among all
nations. Cubans playing soccer at the National Sports City complex

daughter of former Gov. George Wallace of Alabama. What she
remembers most about her father is the last years of his life. He
was shot and paralyzed in 1972 while running as an independent
candidate for president. The shooting changed him in many ways,
Kennedy says. He renounced his racial politics, began reading his
Bible every day and started seeking forgiveness. ``He would call
friends he hadn't talked to for a long time and say, 'If we got
anything to straighten out, let's straighten it out now.''' Kennedy

especially in the Olympic Games. Cubans have always been sports
fanatics, with a near-legendary love for baseball. But ever since
Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, they've had the active
encouragement of their government, which early on identified sports
as a key element in its vision for an egalitarian, socialist
society. Cuban baseball players at baseball practice at the

   (NYT10) HAVANA -- Sept. 8, 2000 -- CUBA-OLYMPICS-COX-1 -- Many
Cubans are talking about the upcoming Sydney Olympics. And like any
die-hard Georgia Bulldog or Texas Longhorns or Florida Gator
football fan, they are firmly convinced their team is going to win,
and win big. Despite being one of the world's smaller countries,
with a population of only 11 million, Cuban athletes took home 31
Olympic medals in 1992's Barcelona games, placing fifth among all
nations. Cubans playing soccer at the National Sports City complex

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As the U.N. Millennium Summit wrapped up
Friday, President Clinton assured Chinese President Jiang Zemin
that he would deliver on China trade legislation, which is
scheduled for a Senate vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the legislation will pass, and I'm pleased at the
progress it's making in the Senate,'' Clinton told reporters during
a photo session before the two leaders began their meeting. ``But
of course we still have some work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill, already passed by the House, would mean
significantly lower tariffs for Americans selling goods in China.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute meeting at The Waldorf Astoria hotel near the
United Nations, Clinton and Jiang had ``frank and friendly''
discussions on Taiwan, missile proliferation and religious
restrictions in China, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents did not reach any specific decisions, the
official said, but the meeting served to review their eight-year
relationship, lay out where they stand on the issues and to ``get
these two men on the same wavelength a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think on that level this meeting served exactly the purpose
that we sought,'' the official said, adding that all of Clinton's
top foreign affairs officials also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has been conducting private meetings with world
leaders on the sidelines of the U.N. summit for the past three
days, also met separately Friday with Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern and Bolivian President Hugo Banzar Suarez.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, he was to attend a fund-raising dinner at a
private home in New York. Both Clinton and his wife, New York
senatorial candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, were to speak at the
dinner, which was expected to raise $615,000 for the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting with Jiang was their first since the two
countries reached agreement on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization more than a year ago. They are to talk again at a
meeting of Asian leaders after the U.S. presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ongoing controversy over human rights and religious
restrictions in China, Clinton has urged Congress to grant the
country Permanent Normal Trade Relations status. Normalizing trade
and bringing China into the WTO, the president has said, would
encourage China to cooperate in dealing with hot spots around the
globe and to curb human rights abuses at home.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official, who briefed reporters after
Clinton's meeting, said Clinton told Jiang that he believed the
Senate would pass the PNTR bill. ``He's working hard on it; he
thinks we will get it,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official added that Clinton has discussed human rights
issues at every meeting he's had with the Chinese leader, but does
not take the stance of rewarding China PNTR status in exchange for
a better human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has said publicly that he has felt the Chinese
are on the wrong side of history on how they handle these issues,
so this is not a new topic or one where they pull a lot of
punches,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Senate is to take up an amendment offered by
Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., that
would lower the bar for imposing sanctions on China and other
countries determined to be involved in weapons proliferation, The
Associated Press reported. The administration opposes the measure
and supporters of the trade bill say its passage this year could be
doomed if the Thompson language is attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the toughest issue that we have to face on PNTR,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Jiang also discussed Taiwan for the first time since
the island's opposition party won the presidential election.
Clinton encouraged Jiang to create a real dialogue between Beijing
and the new government in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are in a wait-and-see attitude,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also emphasized the importance of continuing discussions
between the United States and China on missile defense, even though
the president has left any decision on developing a national
missile defense shield to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'll encourage his successor to engage in serious
dialogue with the Chinese and others so as to try to get a clearer,
common understanding of the threat and how we can all end up more
secure by what we do about it,'' the official said.

daughter of former Gov. George Wallace of Alabama. What she
remembers most about her father is the last years of his life. He
was shot and paralyzed in 1972 while running as an independent
candidate for president. The shooting changed him in many ways,
Kennedy says. He renounced his racial politics, began reading his
Bible every day and started seeking forgiveness. ``He would call
friends he hadn't talked to for a long time and say, 'If we got
anything to straighten out, let's straighten it out now.''' Kennedy

get punched in the face on national television. It's one of his
fondest childhood memories. The confrontation arose as Rev. Vivian
was attempting to register as voters a group of blacks turned away
from the courthouse in Selma, Ala. Albert Vivian, 38, is following
in his father's footsteps, taking over a consulting business that

youngest son of Muhammad's eight children, he had begun to doubt
his father's faith by the time he was a teenager. By 1964, his
father banned him from the movement. Today, Warith Deen Mohammed is
a Muslim elder statesman and has a new appreciation for his father.
``Elijah Muhammad wasn't a racist,'' he says, ``but rather an

people self-reliance.'' Warith Deen Mohammed with a painting of

POWELL APPLAUDS KANSAS CITY'S VOLUNTEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Retired Gen. Colin Powell hailed Kansas City on
Friday as the city doing best at keeping America's Promise.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge was born at a 1997 national summit in Philadelphia in
which delegates to ``America's Promise _ The Alliance for Youth''
were sent back to their cities to mobilize an army of volunteers to
provide caring adults, safe places, healthy starts, marketable
skills and volunteer opportunities for millions of needy children.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, ``Kansas City has done better than anyone
else in the country,'' Powell, chairman of America's Promise, told
a cheering audience of about 2,500 Friday at the American Royal's
Hale Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the audience were connected to the 900 promises made by
businesses, churches, schools and other organizations to provide
Kansas City children with mentors and tutors, and to provide
parents with books to read to their youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's celebrate today, then wake up tomorrow and figure how to
reach more children,'' Bob Rogers, chairman emeritus of the Ewing
Marion Kauffman Foundation, told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the
Promise movement was much like military training, in which soldiers
are given the best training and resources before being sent into
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Today the enemies for many children are drugs, violence, crime,
despair, broken homes and lack of education, Powell said. And when
parents are unable to help, the responsibility falls to the rest of
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to step in. We can't stand back,'' Powell said. ``We
owe our children nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child is a gift from God _ not just to the parents but
to everyone in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell compared America's Promise volunteers to women in the
south Bronx neighborhood where he grew up. The ``aunts'' lived in
tenement buildings and kept watch on neighborhood children from
upstairs windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those aunts never went to the bathroom,'' Powell said. ``Every
time I looked up, one of them was looking down.''
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's ``A Salute to Kansas City's Promise,'' there was
much talk about community service. Senior citizens talked about
adopting young children; teen-agers talked about adopting seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Berry, 17, described tutoring fourth-grade pupils in math
and how she felt when one girl smiled when she got an answer right.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what sticks with you,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Another teen, Marcos Harders, told what volunteering brought to
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you self-respect and pride,'' Harders said.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Nelson, a delegate to the 1997 Philadelphia
convention and chairman of Friday's event, said Kansas City had
50,000 Promise volunteers. A forum will be held in November to
expand the movement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done more than any city in America, and it is that
commitment that brought General Powell here today,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Beene, president of the United Way of America, also lauded
Kansas City for the way the city had embraced the Philadelphia
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to start, harder to keep going and harder yet to
take to the next level,'' Beene said. ``Kansas City is a model for
the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In his keynote speech, Powell encouraged corporate leaders to
jump on the Promise bandwagon and to try to help at-risk children.
Such outreach would produce future employees and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You invest in the promise now or later with hgher taxes to
build new jails,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   He also stressed community service for high school students _
something he would like to see made mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people tell me, `Slow down _ you're not a general
anymore,' &UR; '' Powell said. ``They say you can't make a youngster do
something against their will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well they made me take algebra against my will.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was nonpolitical. But afterward at a press conference,
Powell stumped for Texas Gov. George W. Bush. He said a Bush
presidency would be better for America's children.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that as recently as Thursday, Bush had talked to
him about a possible job in a Bush administration.

 Sprint Corp. names chief operating officer for its wireless unit  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Sprint Corp. on Friday named Charles Levine as
chief operating officer of Sprint PCS, its fast-growing wireless
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, 47, formerly chief sales and marketing officer for
Sprint PCS, replaces Andrew Sukawaty, who stepped down as president
and chief operating officer of the wireless business in June to
join a cable television service in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Levine will answer to Ronald T. LeMay, president and chief
operating officer of Sprint Corp., who has been serving as interim
president of Sprint PCS since Sukawaty's departure. LeMay will
relinquish his Sprint PCS post, and the position of president will
remain vacant, a Sprint PCS spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Levine joined Sprint PCS in January 1997. Before that, he was
president of OctelLink and senior vice president of Octel Services,
a voice-mail provider acquired by Lucent Technologies in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Levine was also president and chief executive officer of CAD
Forms Technology, a pen-based computing company. He has held
various managerial roles with AT&AMP;T, General Electric and Procter &AMP;
Gamble. He has a master's degree in business administration from
the Kellogg Graduate School of Management of Northwestern
University.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS operates an all-digital wireless network serving more
than 7.4 million subscribers. The company has PCS licenses covering
all states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about this job is that I'm taking it
with a company with very strong leadership and dominance in the
most important things to consumers: clarity, connectivity and
coverage,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended June 30, Sprint PCS posted a net loss
of $456 million, or 46 cents per share, on revenues of $1.46
billion. That compared with a net loss of $555 million, or 61 cents
per share, on revenues of $736 million a year earlier. The results
reflect a two-for-one stock split in the first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Sprint PCS reported positive operating cash
flow, a key measure watched by Wall Street, for the first time. The
figure, $11 million, compared with a $338 million loss a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS has its own tracking stock that trades on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol ``PCS.'' The stock closed
Friday at $47.13, up $1.31, on volume of 3.65 million shares.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Gore shifts tack, backs oil tax break
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By BENNETT ROTH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore dropped
his standard rap against big oil and plugged his tax incentives for
the energy industry Friday during a visit to a state where oil and
gas exploration fuel the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In an address at Delgado Community College, Gore noted that, as
part of a long-range economic plan unveiled this week, he has
proposed extending tax incentives for deep gas exploration in the
Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said such exploration will ``reduce our overdependence on
foreign oil. That's good for our environment and our economy and
American families.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to one of a handful of Southern states where Democrats
still are competitive on the presidential level, Gore said, ``Of
course, Louisiana plays an important role in our economy as a
leading producer of oil and gas, and natural gas is a proven source
of clean energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not reprise his usual criticism of his Republican
opponent, George W. Bush, and running mate Dick Cheney for their
ties to the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp has regularly branded the Republicans as the ``Big
Oil ticket.'' Bush previously worked as an energy company
executive, and Cheney resigned from Halliburton, a Dallas-based oil
industry company, to run with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said it was ``highly hypocritical to
attack Governor Bush for his knowledge and expertise in the oil and
gas industry and at the same time cozy up to those constituents in
Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   At the community college, Gore stepped up his criticism of
Bush's Social Security plan, questioning how Bush could pay the $1
trillion transition costs of partially privatizing the system.
</P>
<P>
   That attack was amplified by a letter sent Friday to Bush by
Robert Ball, Social Security commissioner from 1962 to 1973, and
Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell, two entitlement experts.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said that, in proposing to let younger people invest
a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes into private
accounts, Bush has not detailed how he would make up for the funds
drained from the retirement system. Those funds, estimated to be
about $1 trillion, would still be needed to pay current retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not include any general revenues to replace the money
that is drained by your individual account proposals. Is Social
Security too small a detail to include in your detailed budget?''
the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett responded that the authors of the letter were
``partisan Al Gore supporters who have done partisan events for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the transition costs for
Bush's Social Security plan would mean it would take four years
longer than Gore's plan to eliminate the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has written
extensively about Social Security, said he had been contacted by
the Gore campaign and ``asked, was I willing to sign onto a draft
letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said that since the letter expressed the same views that
he had outlined in numerous published articles, he did not have any
problem signing on to it after recommending minor changes.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said that while he supports Gore, he has not done any
campaign events for him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit to Louisiana underscores his campaign's belief that
he has a chance in a state that twice went for President Clinton
but which is also a neighbor of Bush's Texas. On Thursday evening
in drizzly weather, Gore addressed an enthusiastic rally of more
than 8,000 in the French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving New Orleans, Gore flew to Atlanta for two scheduled
Democratic National Committee fund-raisers before heading back to
Washington.

FIGURES ON SAVINGS RATE MISLEADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're worried about the anemic U.S. savings rate, relax. It
can't be as bad as the numbers indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Commerce Department last month reported July's
personal savings rate at a negative 0.2 percent, there may be less
importance to that number than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Americans aren't the spendthrift grasshoppers the declining
savings rate of recent years implies. At least they don't appear to
be when official savings numbers are compared with those measuring
real-world nest-egg-building.
</P>
<P>
   Another report came out about the same time the government was
saying the savings rate had hit its lowest mark since Washington
began keeping such stats in 1959. That report, from the Investment
Company Institute, didn't get as much media attention as the
savings debacle headline-grabber and certainly deserved more
scrutiny than it got.
</P>
<P>
   It revealed that mutual funds added 5 million new stakeholders
over the last year. That brought the total number of Americans
owning mutual funds to nearly 88 million. Measured in the context
of household ownership, almost half of American households now have
a stake in mutual funds. This is nine times the number of
households that owned mutual funds in 1980, the institute reported.
</P>
<P>
   There are two particularly interesting aspects to these numbers.
One is that small investors are responsible for much of the mutual
fund ownership growth. Over the last two years, the percentage of
households with annual incomes of $25,000-$35,000 owning mutual
funds has grown by nearly one-third. Overall, about one-third of
households with total incomes of $50,000 or less have a stake in
mutual funds. Almost 60 percent of households occupied by the 45-54
age group own mutual funds, an increase of 11 percent since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting angle to these numbers is that over the last
three decades the personal savings rate has been highest when the
economy was weakest. A chart accompanying the /{Wall Street
Journal/} savings story showed the rate from 1970-82 ranging from 8
percent to 12 percent as a percentage of disposable personal
income. Most astonishingly, the rate spiked to about 15 percent in
1975, at the trough of one of the worst recessions of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the economy began to recover in 1982 is precisely when
the personal savings rate began its steady decline. Doesn't it seem
paradoxical that the savings rate has shown continuing decline
during a period when the number of households saving and investing
through mutual funds has exploded ninefold?
</P>
<P>
   As for the practical meaning of savings data, there seems little
to be concerned about given that the most prosperous period in U.S.
economic history has occurred during the worst deterioration of
savings statistics.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem counterintuitive to a generation nurtured on the
notion that saving is critical to prosperity and growth, but there
obviously has been a disconnect somewhere along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the methodology used to measure U.S. personal savings, or
have the rules of the game changed? The only logical conclusion is
that it must be faulty measuring tools, because the investment
capital supplied by savings is now and always will be critical to
economic growth.

CLEMENS DISMANTLES RED SOX WITH A REVITALIZED FASTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox fans loathe Roger Clemens for leaving Boston.
They taunt him because he plays for the hated Yankees. They have
one more reason to despise Clemens, now that he's all but buried
Boston in the American League East standings.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens overpowered the Red Sox Friday night, striking out seven
and limiting them to five hits in eight innings, as the Yankees
shut out Boston, 4-0, to push the Red Sox seven games out of first
place _ the largest margin this season. David Justice singled and
hit his 37th homer.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed for several minutes in the ninth inning
after the Yankees' Ryan Thompson smashed a line drive off the face
of Boston pitcher Bryce Florie. With a gash under his right eye and
blood pouring from that cut, his nose and his mouth, Florie got up,
stepped onto a cart and was taken away for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is 12-6 with 259 career victories. The Red Sox went 0
for 5 with runners in scoring position; in Clemens' 15 starts since
June 9, he has held opposing hitters to 9 for 88 (.102) with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   American League hitters cannot hide from Clemens' revitalized
fastball. His legs and back are healthy, and his fastball was
clocked at 98 miles an hour once, 97 mph a couple of times, more
consistently at 95 to 96 mph, thumping loudly against Posada's
mitt.
</P>
<P>
   More telling than the speed readings, however, were Boston's
swings. They reacted to Clemens' fastball as if they were swinging
at dragonflies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there was a river of adrenaline pumping through Clemens,
rather than just a steady stream, for this was his first game in
Boston since the Red Sox hammered him for five runs in two innings
in a playoff game here last October, and Fenway fans taunted
mercilessly. Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, said it
was the worst he had ever seen any player booed in a place where he
had once been a star.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens was pitching the same way against the Red Sox on
Friday night as he has against the rest of the league since coming
off the disabled list. He has not lost any of his last 15 starts, a
streak similar to his performance for Toronto in 1998, when he
didn't lose in the last four months of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Clemens throws a fastball, the effort causes his lips
to part and bears his teeth, his mouth guard visible in a menacing
grimace. But there was no question Clemens was enjoying himself
immensely: He covered first base on a ground ball to Tino Martinez
to end the fourth inning, and after crossing the bag and getting
the out, Clemens popped the umpire Fieldin Culbreth on the backside
with his glove, a genial gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 1-0, in the sixth. Nixon led off the inning by
lofting a ball against the left field wall, a double, the tying run
in scoring position. But after Nixon advanced to third on
Offerman's grounder to first, Clemens overpowered Everett, who
fouled out, and retired Nomar Garciaparra on a fly to right. The
Red Sox shortstop is 3 for 28 in his career against Clemens, with
11 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   There were two outs and nobody on base in the eighth when
Everett came to bat, intent on at least unsettling Clemens,
stepping out of the batter's box a couple of times. Clemens looked
exasperated, backed away from the rubber. With two strikes he
pumped a high fastball, Everett swung and missed. The yellow radar
gun readings flickered above Fenway Park: 96 mph. &QL;

EDITORIAL: MODERN-DAY SLAVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 9:
</P>
<P>
   By a conservative estimate, there are 27 million people working
under various forms of slavery in the world today, and the number
is growing.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the slavery America knew, today's slaveholders
mainly exploit people of their own race. But as in the American
past, they use violence and threats to force people to labor for no
pay. Slavery is illegal everywhere, but it thrives because of the
corruption of police and government authorities. Many people are
unaware that modern slavery exists.
</P>
<P>
   People held in some form of bondage pick sugar cane in the
Dominican Republic, make the charcoal used in Brazil's steel
industry and work as prostitutes in Thailand. In Mauritania and
Sudan blacks are forced into domestic and agricultural slavery in
Muslim households.
</P>
<P>
   Similar forms of oppression are not unknown in developed
nations. The CIA estimates that 45,000 women and children are
smuggled into the United States each year with false promises of
decent jobs. Instead, most find that their passports are stolen and
they are forced to work as prostitutes or maids, on farms or in
sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of people who are treated like slaves, perhaps
20 million, according to the United Nations, are South Asians in
debt bondage. The system is chillingly described in ``Disposable
People,'' a survey of contemporary forms of slavery by Kevin Bales,
who teaches at the University of Surrey in England.
</P>
<P>
   Whole families, including children, are trapped into peonage to
pay debts incurred by medical expenses, a funeral or crop failure.
Their debts are inflated by outrageous prices for food and usurious
interest rates. Families can essentially be enslaved for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery and related kinds of servitude are a growing business
because the number of desperately poor people is increasing and
globalization has disrupted rural communities. In many nations,
children, mainly girls, must drop out of school to work.
</P>
<P>
   A girl in a northern Thai village can be sold into prostitution
for $2,000 _ a huge sum there. A Thai survey found that many
families knowingly sold daughters into prostitution because they
felt pressure to buy consumer goods such as televisions. Girls stay
until they contract AIDS, and are then sent back to their villages
to die in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   While slavery is illegal, it is hard to eradicate. Even the
United States lacks adequate criminal penalties for those who
traffic in human beings. Moreover, the victims _ the potential
witnesses _ are usually deported. This may change, however, as both
houses of Congress recently passed a bill that would criminalize
trafficking, end the rapid deportation of victims and provide help
for them here and modest programs to prevent slavery abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery and forced labor are even more difficult to fight in
nations where they draw support from traditional structures of
power and corruption, the devaluation of women and, in India, the
caste system. Educating the poor about how to avoid falling victim
helps, as do small loans and skill training. India has an excellent
program to pay off laborers' debts and give them training and land.
But Bales argues that local officials and judges often sabotage it.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in combating modern variations of slavery,
however, is education. The developed world needs to realize that
slavery exists, and its victims may have helped produce the
clothes, rugs and other goods we buy. It is especially important
for people in nations where it is widespread not to accept it as a
traditional practice but to see it as one of the most serious
abuses of human rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Fidel Castro of Cuba denounced the American
economic embargo on his country on Friday night and presented a
bleak vision of the world's future before thousands of cheering and
flag-waving supporters gathered in Riverside Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall be entering the 21st century, and that will happen in
extremely hard conditions for the world,'' the Cuban leader said in
a hoarse voice to about 2,400 listeners. ``The world is undergoing
a catastrophic situation. Don't believe the experts who feign
optimism and ignore the cruel realities of the developing world.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro called the United States' economic sanctions against Cuba
a ``criminal embargo'' and ``a violation of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader arrived shortly after 9 p.m., an hour later
than scheduled. Dressed in his signature olive military uniform, he
strode confidently to the lectern, surrounded by guards in dark
suits. Cheers and screams rose to the dark heights of the church,
and hundreds of arms fervently waved Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers called the event ``an evening of solidarity with
the Cuban people.'' Friday night, those political sympathies were
worn on sleeves, collars and T-shirts, as pins of the Cuban flag
and of Che Guevara, the guerrilla leader who became a symbol of the
communist revolution, abounded.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who attended, including Rep. Jose E. Serrano,
D.-N.Y., and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., denounced U.S. policies
toward Cuba. The United States imposed the economic embargo shortly
after Castro took power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people view Cuba very differently from its
government,'' Serrano told a group of reporters in Spanish. He said
he and those present only wanted Cuba to be ``treated equally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cuba discovered oil tomorrow, my country would be its
greatest ally,'' he said. ``If Cuba had, and I don't want it to
have, military arms that could create terror in the world, we would
be allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro was invited to Riverside Church by the New York Welcoming
Committee for the Cuban Delegation for the Millennium. People
wanting to attend were asked to fax requests to the group, which
chose about 2,400 spectators. Friday night, about 2,100 of them sat
in the main chamber, while 300 sat in a side room watching the
event on television.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, made up of various grassroots groups, asked
Riverside if they could use the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are against the embargo, and that is why we are holding
this reception,'' said Aleeka Wade, a spokeswoman for the group.
``We hope to show tonight how many people there are who oppose the
embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bernard Wilson, the executive minister at Riverside,
said before the event that the church was pleased to play host for
the visit. ``Riverside has always been on the cutting edge of what
is happening in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was in New York this week to attend the United Nations
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at the United Nations, he criticized the power
that industrialized countries have over the developing world,
saying wealthy nations have ``only served to make us poorer, more
exploited and more dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for a reform of the United Nations, to transform it
``into a true representative body of all the interests of all the
peoples on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, as she was waiting for Castro to arrive at the
church, Ellen P. Bernstein reflected on the Cuban leader's role in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. people need to hear that he is not a devil, not the
devil he is said to be,'' she said. ``They need to hear he has
important ideas for the same goals we all aspire to: world peace
and security and the proper treatment of the power.''

METS OFFENSE PUNCHLESS IN 2-0 LOSS TO PHILLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Friday night was the eighth day of September, a month
when the Mets have unraveled in different and dramatic ways for the
last two years. Their latest tumbling has not escalated to a
drastic stage yet, but they were back home at Shea Stadium, and
they wanted to stop this spell before it became too serious. They
wanted Mike Hampton to boost them.
</P>
<P>
   This was the type of pivotal game perfectly suited for Hampton.
The Mets acquired Hampton to help guide them into the post-season,
and, to get that far, they would obviously need him on nights like
this. While the Phillies might be one of the worst teams in
baseball, this was a spot for Hampton to perform like an ace. And
he did. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton held the Phillies scoreless until Scott Rolen pounded a
two-run homer in the eighth inning, and that was enough to doom the
Mets in a 2-0 loss. After Rolen clubbed Hampton's 3-2 pitch,
Hampton immediately went down into a crouch and never looked up. He
remained in the crouch as the ball soared into the left-field
bleachers and stayed there until Rolen was rounding third base.
</P>
<P>
   But Hampton was not as relaxed as he looked. When Hampton walked
the next batter and was removed from the game, he did not even make
it to the first-base dugout before he whipped his glove like an
errant fastball. He rumbled down the steps, took a stack of towels
and slammed them repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton turned around and used his right forearm to almost knock
over a water cooler and almost knock a cup out of an unsuspecting
Todd Pratt's hands. After the forearm, Hampton walked toward the
clubhouse and flung his cap down the steps ahead of him. He was in
a volatile mood and showed a lot more power than the anemic offense
had shown all evening.
</P>
<P>
   The sputtering Mets are still having trouble scoring, and that
is why they lost for the sixth time in their last seven games.
Bruce Chen and four relievers stifled them on nine hits, holding
them without a hit in seven at-bats with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, who terrorized the Mets by sweeping a crucial
three-game series last September, ended an eight-game losing
streak. In the National League East, the Mets slipped to three
games behind the Braves, pending the outcome of their game against
the Expos Friday night, and in the wild-card race the Mets watched
their bulge over the Diamondbacks shrink to four and one-half games
as Arizona defeated Florida, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   With Jay Payton on first base and one out in the seventh,
manager Bobby Valentine elected to let Hampton bat. Valentine did
not want Hampton to bunt, either, as Hampton went up swinging and
slapped a single to center field. The hit put men on first and
second and knocked Chen out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets did not capitalize after Hampton's hit. Vicente
Padilla retired Derek Bell and Edgardo Alfonzo on groundouts. Chen
limited the Mets to eight hits in six and a third innings to
increase his scoreless streak to 202/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine claimed that the Mets had not played much differently
during this streak than they had played all season because they
were pitching ``pretty well,'' hitting ``OK'' and playing ``pretty
good'' defense. Still, even if the Mets have played similarly, the
results have been bad. The fans booed often at Shea Stadium as the
Mets stranded 11 runners, not the type of noise a team with
post-season aspirations expects to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a pretty good team,'' Valentine said. ``I think we're a
really good team, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was antsy in the fourth as he gave up an infield single,
walked two and uncorked two wild pitches to load the bases. He
tugged on his sleeve, stomped down off the mound to retrieve the
baseball from Mike Piazza and was staring at a perilous situation
that he was almost fully responsible for. But Hampton retired Gary
Bennett on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   After Hampton struck out the first two batters in the fifth,
Bobby Abreu sliced a shot that bounced inside the left-field line
and into foul territory for a double. Hampton did not flinch, and
he struck out Doug Glanville with a nifty changeup.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had a terrific opportunity against Chen in the first
when Bell and Alfonzo slapped back-to-back singles with one out.
Piazza, who was 3 for his last 16, tapped a ball back to Chen, who
got the fielder's choice at second. Todd Zeile then flied out to
right. There were several other scoring chances, but the most verve
any Met showed came when Hampton whipped equipment around like a
cranky toddler. Saturday is Hampton's 28th birthday. &QL;

DAVID CHARNEY, 44, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David A. Charny, a Harvard Law School professor who
was an expert on employment and corporate law and who advised
student demonstrators, died on Aug. 31 at his home in Cambridge,
Mass. He was 44.
</P>
<P>
   He died after a short illness, said Michael J. Chmura, the law
school's news director.
</P>
<P>
   Charny had taught at the law school since 1984 and had held its
David Berg chair of law since last year.
</P>
<P>
   He was best known at the school for his courses on contracts and
corporations, both of which he taught for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he was prominent among the law school faculty members
who provided legal advice to student demonstrators demanding
greater diversity in the faculty after the appointment of four
white faculty members. The demonstrators staged a brief sit-in in
the hall outside the office of the school's dean, Robert Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The sit-in was one of a series at the law school concerning
diversity in its faculty that took place in the late 1980's and
early 1990's. The school's faculty has become considerably more
diverse in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Charny was born and reared in Pittsburgh. He received a
bachelor's degree summa cum laude from Yale University and a law
degree magna cum laude from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his partner, Ahmad H. Tabari; his parents,
Margaret and Dr. E. Joseph Charny of Pittsburgh; a sister, Sharon
Charny of Baltimore; and a brother, Joel R., of Washington.

EDITORIAL: LIEBERMAN'S CAMPAIGN HEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Rewrites graf that begins ``Lieberman's spokesman ...''
Changes head. Deletes duplication of word ``a'' in graf that begins
``The Republican ...'') 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman is now running for two national offices at the
same time _ his Senate seat from his home state of Connecticut and
the vice presidency as the Democratic Party nominee. The
Connecticut Elections Enforcement Commission decided this week that
this double campaigning is legal. That still does not make it fair
to Connecticut voters or smart for the state's Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   By staying in both races, Lieberman is hedging his bets in a way
that benefits him, of course. But it hardly sends a signal of
confidence about the future of the ticket he is sharing with Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his dual candidacy could lead to a situation in which
Connecticut chooses a Democratic senator in November but has a
Republican installed by appointment. It could also lead to
legislative contortions as Democrats in the state Capitol try to
figure out a way to prevent Gov. John Rowland, a Republican, from
filling the vacancy from within his own party should Lieberman go
to Washington as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, only a few days after the traditional Labor Day
kickoff of the fall campaign, there is still time for Lieberman to
get off the ballot and let the two parties conduct a fair fight for
his vacated seat.
</P>
<P>
   As things now stand, if Lieberman resigns from the Senate race
before Oct. 27, Connecticut's Democratic State Central Committee
would pick a replacement. The name mentioned most often is the
state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who would be a strong
contender for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee, Mayor Philip Giordano of Waterbury, is
regarded by some as a place-holder against Lieberman, but the
Republicans would have the option of asking him to step aside in
favor of a stronger replacement.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman wins both his Senate campaign and the vice
presidency, Rowland will pick a replacement who must run for the
office two years later. Rowland can be expected to choose a member
of his own party for the job, giving the Senate one more Republican
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this potential for damage to his own party, Lieberman
has said that he favors a Rowland appointment now because it would
give the political system enough time to work _ with full primaries
and full-fledged elections in the year 2002. If he pulls out early,
he has argued, the process would be chaotic and unfair since a
party committee, instead of a primary, would pick the Democratic
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's spokesman adds that the winner of such a hurried
election this year would be serving for six years, a full Senate
term. He points out that the governor's probable Republican
appointee would serve for only two years at most until facing
election. This reasoning is thin and self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is prompting Democratic leaders in Connecticut to
contemplate a hasty rerigging of election laws. The thought is that
if Lieberman resigns from the Senate to be vice president, the
Democratic legislature can then pass a bill requiring a special
election in three or perhaps six months to fill the empty seat
sometime next year. Rowland, according to this plan, would have
difficulty vetoing such a bill because it would appear undemocratic
to deprive voters of an election.
</P>
<P>
   But the cleaner, fairer solution is to let Connecticut voters
have a choice in the regularly scheduled general election.
Lieberman should resign from the Senate race right away and leave
that contest to candidates who will definitely be available to
serve. That action would also put a ring of confidence into his
predictions of victory on the presidential ticket.

GEORGE SANDELL, 88, MUSICIAN AND INVENTOR OF GEE-BEE SPONGE
</HEADLINE>
 By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Edmund Sandell, a versatile viola and violin
player, teacher and inventor, died on Aug. 26 in Santa Monica,
Calif. He was 88 and lived in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Malmo, Sweden, Sandell grew up in Denver and graduated
from Denver University in 1933 with a bachelor's degree in music.
He continued his musical studies in New York, notably with the
viola virtuoso William Primrose, and, on a scholarship, at the
Royal Swedish Conservatory in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   He played with the Denver Symphony Orchestra and, after moving
to Los Angeles in 1938, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the
Pasadena and Santa Monica Symphonies. He performed as a member of
classical quartets but also began to play with pop, swing and Latin
music groups, including the string sections of the big bands of
Harry James, Jimmy Dorsey and Xavier Cugat.
</P>
<P>
   The principal Hollywood studios hired him to play for their
orchestral soundtracks, as did the arranger Nelson Riddle. With
Riddle's orchestra, Sandell performed several arrangements for
Frank Sinatra, onstage and in the recording studio. In 1946, the
USO commended him for entertaining the troops in World War II as a
soloist and as a member of the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey
orchestras. The Treasury Department also cited him for helping to
organize War Bond events in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Sandell's life took a sidestep into business in 1947, when he
began to market a kitchen gadget he invented. Patented and
trademarked the Gee-Bee, it was a sponge with a plastic handle for
washing dishes. To make and distribute it, Sandell formed his own
company, which he sold to the DuPont Co. in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, he played many concerts and taught master
classes on both the viola and the violin.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his third wife, Sheila Ruby; a stepson, Arlen
R. Lessin of Manhattan; and a granddaughter.

REBERT HARRIS, 84, SOUL SINGER AND MODEL FOR SAM COOKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Rebert is cq) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rebert H. Harris, the lead singer for the Soul
Stirrers, whose style was the fountainhead of gospel and soul
singers for generations, died on Sept. 3 in Chicago. He was 84 and
lived in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had a pure, high tenor voice that he used for syncopated
moans and slurs and leaps into falsetto. With his three-octave
range and smoothly unpredictable melismas, he improvised in ways
that were simultaneously fervent and playful. When he left the Soul
Stirrers in 1950, he was replaced by Sam Cooke, who brought Harris'
style to a large new audience and then into pop and soul music.
</P>
<P>
   As Cooke's direct model, Harris' singing was an enormous
influence on soul and rhythm-and-blues. ``All these people do me
who don't know my name,'' Harris used to say.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was born in Trinity, Texas, 86 miles north of Houston.
The Soul Stirrers were formed there in the 1920s, and the group
attracted the best of the local gospel singers; Harris had been a
member of a rival group, the Friendly Gospel Singers. He joined the
Soul Stirrers in the mid-1930s, after the group was recorded by the
Library of Congress. By the late 1930s the Soul Stirrers included
Harris, Thomas Brewster, Jesse Farley and Roy Crane.
</P>
<P>
   With Harris as lead singer, the Soul Stirrers brought
innovations to the quartet style that had appeared in the 1920s.
They traded lead vocals between two singers and used what Harris
called ``delayed time,'' sustaining melodies against the group's
steady beat to create syncopated tension. By the early 1940s the
Soul Stirrers were nationally known and toured extensively. The
group recorded for the Aladdin label and then for Specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Harris' best recordings from that era appear on the
anthology ``Kings of the Gospel Highway'' (Shanachie) and on
``Shine on Me: The Soul Stirrers featuring R.H. Harris''
(Specialty). In 1947 Harris and other quartet lead singers formed
the National Singing Quartets Union of America to promote the
music; Harris became its president. He left the Soul Stirrers in
1950, to be replaced by Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   Harris led his own groups, but with less success. In the 1950s
he had the Christland Singers, which recorded for the Peacock and
Nashboro labels, and then the Gospel Paraders, which recorded for
Cooke's SAR Records around 1960. His career gained new momentum
after he performed in 1972 at Radio City Music Hall in a gospel
concert. He sang three songs on ``Precious Lord: The Songs of
Thomas A. Dorsey'' (Columbia), a 1973 anthology produced by
Heilbut.
</P>
<P>
   With his Masonic Quintet, Harris made an album in 1975, ``The
Father of Them All,'' for Nashboro Records, and recorded the album
``Because He Lives'' for his own label, RHJC, in 1978. It was his
last recording, although he remained active in the National Gospel
Quartets Union.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary; a sister, Overn Jolly Harris;
three daughters, Jackie, Sheila and Cheryl; a son, Greg; and
several grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as
a member of the Soul Stirrers.

EDWARD ANHALT, 86, `BECKET' SCREENWRITER
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edward Anhalt, a prolific Academy Award-winning
screenwriter best known for his work on the films ``Becket'' and
``Jeremiah Johnson,'' died on Sunday, Sept. 3, at his home in
Pacific Palisades, Calif. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York and a graduate of Columbia University,
Anhalt worked as a writer during the embryonic days of television
in the 1930s and '40s before landing his first screenwriting credit
for the 1946 disaster movie ``Avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he received an Oscar for ``Panic in the
Streets,'' sharing the award for original story with Edna Anhalt,
the first of his five wives and his most frequent collaborator. In
1952, they earned a second nomination for ``The Sniper.''
</P>
<P>
   In a career of more than two dozen films, among them ``The
Madwoman of Chaillot,'' with Katharine Hepburn in 1969, and the
1962 Elvis Presley vehicle ``Girls, Girls, Girls,'' he was
especially well regarded for his adaptations of other writers'
works. Notable credits included ``The Member of the Wedding''
(1952), from the Carson McCullers story; ``Not as a Stranger''
(1955), from Morton Thompson's novel; ``The Young Lions'' (1958),
from the best seller by Irwin Shaw; and, in 1983, ``The Right
Stuff,'' by Tom Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Anhalt won a second Oscar for his screen adaptation of
the Jean Anouilh play ``Becket,'' which starred Richard Burton and
Peter O'Toole and received 12 nominations in all. With John Milius,
he wrote the 1972 Robert Redford movie ``Jeremiah Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Huguette Anhalt, and a daughter,
Julie Rice of Los Angeles.

WILLIAMS REFUSES TO FOLLOW HER FATHER OUT OF THE STADIUM, AND BEATS
HINGIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just when Martina Hingis believed she had neutralized
her opponent's vaunted power, she was suddenly confronted with the
specter of Venus Williams' heart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very big one, everyone should realize, after Hingis let
Williams off the hook and Older Sister surfaced from the depths of
a third-set deficit to claim a U.S. Open semifinal victory that was
deliciously desperate, if not uniformly pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Hingis took Williams apart in an Open final
between one polished teen-ager and another who was as raw as a cold
rain: ``A yearling,'' Williams said, laughing as she remembered her
1997 rookie Open run after her 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory sent her to
Saturday's final against Lindsay Davenport. ``I didn't know what I
was doing, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   What Williams did know Friday, after 24 consecutive victories
that included her Wimbledon title, was what it took to win just
about the time she looked worn out. She knew not to be afraid to go
for it, to ``take the opportunities, because when you don't,
they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In her game of punch and counter with the crafty Hingis,
Williams was the superior athlete and nothing about that will ever
change. But Williams deserves credit for so much more now because
stride and muscles alone do not make the legs chase the ball as if
it were life itself.
</P>
<P>
   At the point Hingis had a 5-3 lead in the third set, moments
before Williams' own father couldn't take the specter of defeat and
walked on out, it appeared Hingis' game plan of softening Williams
up with shots down the middle, into the body, was going to work.
Now Hingis, feeling the weight of nearly three sets at the
shot-making pace only a Williams can force, played the more
percentage angles, sent her ground strokes into the corners and bet
the tournament that Williams was in no shape to extend her angular
frame to dig them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was maybe my hope towards the end of the match,'' Hingis
admitted. ``That she would still miss some return or she'd give me
a chance to survive and finish it off.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3-5, 15-30, Hingis had a much-discussed overhead to put away
that could have set up double-match point. Hingis is sure to
remember the puny shot she returned to Williams' backhand for a
down-the-line winner. Not to be forgotten is how Williams
frantically stayed in that point, sprinting side to side, somehow
keeping the ball and her hopes in play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Hingis do not represent the classic matchup of the
baseliner versus the serve-and-volleyer. They are not Navratilova
and Evert, or McEnroe and Borg. But rarely in any tennis match are
we treated to the furious rallies of the type that filled the
second and third sets; the kind of points that reminded us these
two players don't have to embrace each other, or like each other,
but they sure should know that they bring out the best in each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's a great time,'' Williams conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I do enjoy it,'' Hingis said. ``If you win, you enjoy
more than if you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis had left the Arthur Ashe Stadium and appeared in the
corridor outside the women's locker room on the verge of tears.
Then came Williams, a little glassy eyed herself, with a distinct
wobble to her step. Her father, Richard, was already gone from the
National Tennis Center, out into New York's evening rush. Who knows
_ who cares _ why he bolted after his daughter netted a drop shot
for 15-30 in the ninth game of the third set? A pack of reporters
followed him out, just as the real story was about to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' Venus Williams said, about to author the headline.
``I've got a pretty big heart these days.''
</P>
<P>
   No brag, just fact.
</P>
<P>
   After saving her serve for 4-5, Williams broke Hingis at 15 to
pull even. On the 15-30 point, Hingis got a short ball and angled a
backhand crosscourt that looked like a winner. Williams was on it,
though, with an elastic stretch and a primal scream. Suddenly, the
two-hand backhand was down the line, deep in the corner. Hingis
spanked it into the net. Her shoulders sagged and her expression
finally seemed to say, ``I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a wonderful player, Hingis is, who stands in tall even
against all these women who have half a foot on her. She had a plan
Friday, a thirst to win her first Grand Slam title since January of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just when Hingis began to believe she could be the toast of
the Open again, Venus Williams refused to follow her father out
into the street. He walked. She ran.

EDITORIAL: A SOUND VERDICT IN IDAHO 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 9: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The $6.3 million verdict against the Aryan Nations, the white
supremacist group, and its leader Richard Butler may well put the
organization out of business. The defendants argue they should not
be punished for their racist and anti-Semitic ideology. But this
case was not about free speech or the right to hold odious views,
which the First Amendment protects. It was about holding an
organization responsible for assaults committed by its security
guards.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict of an Idaho jury sends a strong message that hate
groups will be held financially liable for the violence they
commit. It was properly about compensating victims who had been
terrorized and injured by the Aryan Nations' security guards.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan and her son Jason Keenan, were
attacked by the guards after they stopped their car on a road near
the entrance to the Aryan Nations compound to retrieve a wallet
that had fallen out of the car. The guards thought the Keenans were
Jewish agents sent to attack the compound. They got into a truck,
chased the car, shot at it with an assault weapon, forced it into a
ditch, and then surrounded and physically beat the Keenans. The
guards were drunk at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the guards are now in prison for assault, and a third is
a fugitive. The lawsuit by the Keenans, who were represented by
lawyers with the Southern Poverty Law Center, charged the Aryan
Nations and Butler with negligence and recklessness in training and
supervising the guards. The jury awarded the plaintiffs $330,000 in
compensatory damages and $6 million in punitive damages, with the
bulk of that amount to be paid by Butler and the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The law center has sued other hate groups for violent acts
committed by their members. The purpose is to shut down groups that
engage in conspiracies or aid and abet violence. In 1990, the
center brought a civil suit on behalf of a black man who was killed
by neo-Nazi skinheads in Portland, Ore. A jury in that case awarded
the man's family $12.5 million against the skinheads and the White
Aryan Resistance, a white supremacist group that recruited and
trained skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   While free-speech issues are inevitably raised in these cases,
the Constitution is not violated when verdicts are rendered to
punish conduct and not speech. Clearly, if a supermarket had hired
drunken guards who shot at innocent passers-by, it would be liable
for the conduct of its employees, and may even be put out of
business by a large verdict. The same applies in this case. The
fact that the Aryan Nations and its members are motivated by a
political ideology does not shield them from liability to injured
parties.

KAROLYI SUMMONED TO CONJURE UP A MEDAL 
(FOR RELEASE MONDAY, SEPT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Normally, the effusive Bela Karolyi rambles on in glorious
hyperbole but in such a thick Transylvanian accent, a toy decoder
ring is required to untangle his words. But after watching Shannon
Miller's comeback at the U.S. Olympic Trials last month end with an
inglorious fall, and seeing three other top gymnasts take spills on
the balance beam in Boston, Karolyi was short on words.
</P>
<P>
   The finish to the trials in mid-August seemed to unnerve him.
Once Karolyi, the national team coordinator, announced the Olympic
team _ which included two members of the 1996 gold medal team, Amy
Chow and Dominique Dawes _ he quickly discussed the difficult
subjective selection process and exited the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can contend for a medal,'' Karolyi said as he departed.
``We have to work.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant the gymnasts were about to experience even more
intensive training back at his ranch in the outback of Texas. Less
than a year ago, this out-of-the-way place was his retirement home
of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Just after the 1996 gold medal team of miracle pixies ended its
talk-show tour of the States, Karolyi, the bombastic architect of
the squad, ambled away from the scene as quietly as an old grizzly
disappearing into his cave.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi's work was done, or so he believed. The man who massaged
the souls and defined the power in Nadia Comaneci and Mary Lou
Retton was at peace with his body of work and living in obscurity
on his exotic 1,200-acre retreat 75 miles north of Houston. Before
he defected to the United States from Romania in 1981, America had
won only one medal in women's gymnastics. Once he began his
demanding approach _ interspersed with bearhugs along the way _ the
women found their way to the podium for 18 medals.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi thought the foundation of USA Gymnastics was secure. On
his expansive piece of forest, he could enjoy a ranch life that
Michael Jackson might envy. On land shared by antelope and emus,
llamas and geese, the eccentric Karolyi and his wife Marta were
ready to vanish from the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But last October, Karolyi was shaken by a U.S. free fall in
gymnastics. With the Magnificent Seven in retirement, a group of
tentative, naive gymnasts finished sixth at the 1999 World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible, just unbelievable and spectacular failure,''
Karolyi said. ``I don't know why it was so poor. It was everything
going down the drain. If I am there, I would be eating my fingers.
I would be doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karolyi was not there. And without him, there was a fear
that the team would not be mentally fit and medal-ready for Sydney.
After the 1996 team competition in Atlanta drew huge television
audiences, and after Kerri Strug became an American folk hero with
her courageous vault, there was pressure on USA Gymnastics to
provide NBC with a strong first week to these Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the pride of the program at stake as well. The USA
Gymnastics president, Bob Colarossi, boarded a plane to Houston,
pulled Karolyi out of retirement and began a feverish approach to
resurrecting the U.S. gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, that's when our team walked on the floor and now
became the reigning all-around Olympic champion,'' Karolyi said.
``It was a showcase of the incredible. This challenge is no less
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Since January, America's top gymnasts have made monthly journeys
to Karolyi's ranch, where a state-of-the-art gym shares space on
the retreat. Although Karolyi's controversial taskmaster approach
to building great gymnasts has been questioned by a hoard of
critics, as well as by some coaches, who feel he pushes athletes
too hard, this is the man USA Gymnastics needed to give the team a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't always know what he's yelling when I'm going through
my routine,'' the waifish team member Morgan White said. ``But he
gets the best out of you. For some reason, you just respond to him.
The next thing you know, you've done better than you ever have. His
method works.''
</P>
<P>
   Elise Ray and Kristen Maloney responded as well. And with
increased time in the gym, Dawes and Chow began to reveal the same
talents that made them a part of the Magnificent Seven in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in January, I looked and saw their little hearts still
beating, but they were missing confidence and fire,'' Karolyi said.
``And they were missing the physical readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   But was Karolyi's arrival too late? Although the team's results
in international competition improved dramatically just four months
after his return, there were a few letdowns at the Olympic trials,
a few missteps that left room for concern. Karolyi appeared taken
aback but still positive that the goal could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create a beautiful image on the floor,'' Karolyi
said. ``I believe this can be a beautiful team, a strong team. I
believe this will be a proud effort.''
</P>
<P>
   If Karolyi can will this team to a medal, it might one of the
greatest feats of his career.
