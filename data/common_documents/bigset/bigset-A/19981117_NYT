<P>
   Just eight days ago, former Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds
sat down to dinner with Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz in
Baghdad. The two men had already spent four hours in Aziz's office
_ Reynolds reminding the Iraqi of the need for compromise in any
crisis, Saddam's man (in full militia uniform) insisting, over and
over again, that it was Washington's intention to destroy Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the two men resumed their talks at the Iraqi
official's home, Mrs. Aziz was already cooking their dinner in the
kitchen: a traditional Iraqi dish of rice, chicken and lamb
followed by ice cream and six cups of tea. Alcohol is banned for
all officials in Baghdad. Reynolds has always been a teetotaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tariq Aziz's suspicion was that the Americans wanted to wipe
out the Iraqi people,'' Reynolds told me last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that repeatedly. He said if there was any other nation
subjected to this treatment of sanctions, it would be regarded as a
slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who helped to frame Northern Ireland's ``peace process''
was, of course, virtually ignored when he left Baghdad. By the time
he arrived on business in New York at the end of last week _ when
the Stealth bombers were already lining up on the runways _ he was
able only to talk on the phone to a few lowly State Department
officials about this trip. America didn't want any messages from
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   When Reynolds drove around to the headquarters of the United
Nations Security Council Official Monitors (UNSCOM) in Baghdad, he
was also told _ by one of three inspectors he met _ an intriguing
piece of information. A Finnish U.N. arms inspector claimed that
UNSCOM was only probably three months from completing its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have the Iraqis been told this?'' Reynolds wanted to know. The
U.N. man had no idea _ it wasn't his job to talk to the Iraqis.
Reynolds went back to Tariq Aziz. Aziz said: ``Decisions might have
been taken very differently if Iraq had known about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's easy to exaggerate a dinner-time chat between a Saddam
underling and an ex-Taoiseach of Ireland. Reynolds was a powerless
attention-seeker, a U.S. Official said privately. And it's true
that Richard Butler, UNSCOM's head, had several times stated, if
somewhat cynically, that the inspectors'' work had been nearing its
end.
</P>
<P>
   But Reynolds had, nonetheless, touched the roots of this latest
miserable, billion dollar crisis: Iraq's belief _ almost
unalterable and certainly not without reason _ that the U.S. never
intends to lift sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Tariq Aziz's comments to Reynolds can be found in the annex to
this weekend's Iraqi letter to the Security Council which
ultimately kept the bombers on the ground _ though it contains no
reference to that $100 million which the U.S. Congress has voted to
overthrow the Iraqi regime. The U.N. can hardly be blamed for that.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, then, it all came back to the purpose of sanctions
rather than the undiscovered anthrax spores which may or may not
remain in Saddam Hussein's laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds had been sickened by the medical conditions and deaths
of thousands of Iraqi civilians. Yet oddly, this plight has in a
perverted way become just another reason to continue the U.N.'s
ruthless sanctions machinery.
</P>
<P>
   When Madeleine Albright stood up at the U.N. to demand a
continuation of sanctions recently, she argued her case by saying
that there was photographic evidence that Saddam Hussein was
continuing to build massive and opulent palaces for himself and his
personal entourage all over Iraq. Aerial pictures showed the
buildings under construction.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam Hussein could go on amassing his personal wealth, then
sanctions had yet to bite him. The irony, of course, is that those
who wish to maintain the embargo do so by demonstrating its
failure. For if Saddam can still build palaces, then U.N. sanctions
clearly do not work _ but Madelaine Albright tried to argue the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   European nations believe that sanctions have become a kind of
dogma. Since they haven't worked for eight years, they must go on _
and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is asking about what the French call the ``very
strong smell of petroleum'' that surrounds the pax Americana in the
Gulf. If the oil embargo was lifted, where would the current low
price of oil collapse to?
</P>
<P>
   Like a bad Western, both Baghdad and Washington appear to have
adopted totally irrational policies. The Americans want to use
force without knowing what they will do afterwards. The Iraqis risk
an American offensive because they do not know if they have a
future.
</P>
<P>
   Questions rather than rhetoric might be a worthy outcome of the
latest nonsense in the Gulf. &QL;

   PARIS _ France should consider turning off all the lights in the
Principality of Monaco if the tiny country refuses to put its legal
and financial house in order.
</P>
<P>
   This drastic threat _ first used, with great success, by General
de Gaulle 35 years ago _ was reactivated Monday by the august and
influential newspaper Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for the French government to play tough with this
``Disneyland for millionaires, providing a refuge for cheats,'' the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny country, consisting of one square mile entirely
surrounded by France, imports all its electricity from its giant
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   De Gaulle's successful threat in 1963 to cut off the power was a
``precedent worthy of study'' by the present French government, Le
Monde said.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Monaco and France, which partly administers
the principality, have been severely strained for two years. The
row centers on allegations of widespread money-laundering in the
country's 50 independent banks (one bank for every 600 permanent
residents).
</P>
<P>
   According to an article published in Monday's Le Monde, young
and eager investigating judges in the principality (appointed by
France) have complained of interference in their work. The
interference comes, it is alleged, partly from the royal palace and
partly from an older guard of magistrates and judges (also
appointed by France).
</P>
<P>
   The French government recently overruled Prince Rainier and
refused to extend the mandate of the principality's chief
prosecutor, a French official suspected of taking too lax a view of
financial investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde said that Monaco had abandoned its old role as a
playground for the rich and energetic or, as it put it, ``a
generous place of asylum for racing drivers and tennis players.''
</P>
<P>
   It had adopted the ``Caribbean model'': attracting private
fortunes by passing laws of banking secrecy, by denying the concept
of embezzlement and by accepting the proceeds of organized crime
and tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The Monaco authorities say they are doing everything in their
power to discourage money-laundering and that their judicial system
is the most independent in the world. &QL;

UCLA NEEDS ALL POINTS IT CAN GET

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kansas State is charging hard and closing fast on
UCLA for the coveted No. 2 spot in the Bowl Championship Series
rankings. If both teams remain undefeated, victory margin could
determine the Fiesta Bowl participants.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are No. 2 in the latest BCS rankings, a mere .74
points ahead of Kansas State. (Last week, UCLA's lead was 1.26
points.) The Wildcats finish with Missouri and Texas A&AMP;M, which
could boost their strength-of-schedule component enough to pass
UCLA, all other factors remaining constant.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M is ranked sixth in the BCS poll; Missouri is 19th.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's upcoming opponents, USC and Miami, are ranked 20th and
24th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Bruins need all the points they can get. Two
of the three computer polls (Sagarin/USA Today and New York Times)
use victory margin in their formulas. Many pollsters are influenced
by impressive wins, as well.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo is opposed to running up the score, but
even he realizes the importance of appearance as the final weeks
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if we're No. 1 or 2,'' Toledo said. ``I just want
to be one of the two. I hope we win, and win convincingly enough,
to remain (at the top).''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS combines top-25 rankings, computer rankings, schedule
strength and losses. The top two teams in the final poll, released
Dec. 6, will play for the national title in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   __ Holding on: Defensive end Travor Turner was credited with one
tackle against Washington, but closer examination reveals an
influential performance.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's tackle was a third-down sack that led to Ryan Roques'
punt return touchdown at the end of the first half. Turner also
drew two holding calls on Washington linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are so quick,'' said Huskies guard Ben Kadletz, a
La Canada native. ``They go one way, get stuffed, then spin back.
They're well-coached.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick change: The lone change on the depth chart this week is
at fullback, where senior Craig Walendy, from Westlake, will start
in place of junior Durell Price, from Sylmar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walendy hasn't beaten out Durell,'' Toledo said. ``They're
like two starters. Because it's so close and Walendy's a senior,
we're going to give him the opportunity to start his last home
game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Guard Andy Meyers and center Shawn Stuart,
both fifth-year seniors, will join the season-long selections,
quarterback Cade McNown and safety Larry Atkins, as captains this
week.... Atkins and Roques were named Pac-10 players of the week.

LA HOME SALES COOL IN OCTOBER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Home sales in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley
flattened out in October, rising a scant 1.1 percent from year-ago
levels as the market experienced seasonal cooling and the effects
of turmoil in financial markets, a trade group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prices remained hot, however, jumping 12 percent with the median
hitting $192,000 in response to a tight market, said the Southland
Regional Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 1,038 single-family homes changed hands, an increase
of just 11 sales from October 1997. Sales volume declined 5.3
percent from September's level.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of active listings dropped 5.6
percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales in the smaller Santa Clarita Valley market shot
up 27 percent with 214 homes closing escrow. The median price was
$213,500, up 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The local results mirror what is happening across the Los
Angeles Basin, and 1998 is still on track to be the best year of
the decade, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably just a temporary hiccup because of the
turbulence in financial markets during October,'' said John
Karevoll, an analyst at Acxiom/Dataquick, a real estate research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt rise in mortgage rates during the early part of the
month may have postponed some sales as buyers waited for rates to
fall again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sales activity probably just got time shifted a little
bit. Now we are back to a fairly stable market, and we think that
November and December will be back on track with record activity,''
Karevoll said.
</P>
<P>
   Homes that sold in the Valley during October had been on the
market on average for about three months, which is normal for a
healthy market.
</P>
<P>
   Area Realtors think there is enough pent-up demand to keep
things hopping well into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with a slight seasonal cooling, the market is still
exceptionally active. We're not looking at a market that will take
the last two months of the year off,'' said Bud Mauro, president of
the Valley's Realtors group.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics bear out Mauro's optimism. While sales typically slow
in the fall and winter, the number of current open escrows
increased 5.5 percent from September, a sign of sales one and two
months out.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the association had 5,998 single-family homes and
condominiums listed for sale, not a large number for a market the
size of the Valley, but still 5.7 percent higher than at the same
time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that indicates that the rising prices are starting
to entice more owners to put their property on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventory remains tight and keeps the lid on resale activity.
But a growing number of owners realize prices are rising, which
translates into a a few more new listings,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the condominium market fell 7 percent last month to 257
units. But the median price soared 32.2 percent to $115,000.

WOMAN'S JUMP LEAVES TWO FAMILIES HOPING FOR MAN'S RECOVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A moment of self-sacrifice could cost Conrad
Buchanan and his family dearly.
</P>
<P>
   The security guard, a father of two, remained hospitalized in
critical but stable condition Monday, a day after he tried to catch
a suicidal woman who jumped from the sixth story of a parking
garage.
</P>
<P>
   The impact broke the 26-year-old Buchanan's neck and the fall
broke Julie Light's back. Police said Light, 68, left a suicide
note with her car saying she was suffering great pain from cancer.
Friends said she was depressed over the death of her husband. She
died at Northridge Hospital Medical Center on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy has devastated two families and left both hoping for
Buchanan's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of him,'' his mother, Norma Buchanan, said
Monday. ``He wasn't thinking that he was going to get hurt himself.
He was just thinking he could help someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Light's sons, Jon Light of Camarillo, expressed his
sympathy for Buchanan and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom's at peace now, so that's a good thing, but this must
be a nightmare for his family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Light tried to warn those below her to get
out of the way shortly before she jumped around 3:15 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   From the edge of the parking structure at the Galleria, she
called out to pedestrians below her to stand aside, said Celine
Kingsland at the Van Nuys division of the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan didn't stand aside. Instead, the security guard
tried to break her fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Dave Hanczuk of the Los Angeles Police Department said the
force of impact when an adult falls several stories is immense. The
department, he said, doesn't train officers to try to catch people
when they jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get hit by that or you can get hit by a Toyota pickup
truck and the effect will be pretty much the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Light's son and neighbors said the homemaker had been
depressed by the 1997 death of her husband, Robert, a former actor
and president of the Southern California Broadcasters Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was trying to find her way and start a new life, but she
had problems adjusting to the single life,'' said friend Sam
Bensussen. ``Everyone in the neighborhood liked her, she had a lot
of friends, but she became withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Light said caring for her older husband _ who was 85 when he
died _ may have drained his mother as his health grew worse. And
for most of her marriage, her social life had revolved around his
place in the broadcasting world.
</P>
<P>
   And yet she seemed to be doing better lately, he said. She
recently moved to Camarillo to Leisure Village, where she could
find partners for bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed she was getting more active, but I guess the
melancholy never left her,'' Light said.
</P>
<P>
   He last saw her Saturday, when she attended a grandson's martial
arts demonstration.

HYDE MAY SEEK BROADER CLINTON INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout; subs byline)   (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move that could widen the investigation of
President Clinton, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
will ask fellow Republicans on the panel to seek testimony from a
former Democratic Party fund-raiser, a senior Republican
congressional aide said on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the
chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, planned to ask Republican
committee members on Tuesday to either call the former fund-raiser,
John Huang, or get testimony from him in a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's interest in what Huang could have to say may be highly
significant because, until now, the possible grounds for
impeachment of the president that have been before the Judiciary
Committee all stem from Clinton's affair with a former White House
intern, Monica Lewinsky, and his attempts to keep that affair a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the congressional aide said, Hyde is interested in what
Huang has to say about his dealings with Webster Hubbell, the
former No. 3 official in the Clinton Justice Department who has
been a persistent target of the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been investigating Clinton's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. But long before that liaison was revealed, Starr was
known to be pursuing whether Huang might have steered money to
Hubbell to keep Hubbell quiet about what he knew of Clinton's
financial dealings in Arkansas _ the original mandate of Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Huang was at the center of the 1996 campaign-finance
controversy, involving the Democratic party's acceptance of large
sums of money from suspect sources, and it was revealed only
recently that Starr had granted him immunity in exchange for his
cooperation in the investigation of Hubbell. Hubbell was indicted
again on fraud charges last Friday. He has already served time in
prison for bilking his former law partners, but Starr has said he
ddid not think he had been sufficiently cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is said to have become interested in Huang on his own, not
because he has been persuaded by Starr, who himself is to be a
witness before Hyde's committee on Thursday _ the only confirmed
witness as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear on Monday night how strongly the 16 Democrats
on the Judiciary panel would resist the 21 Republicans, should Hyde
insist on hearing from Huang, or whether Hyde was primarily
motivated by a desire to reinvigorate an inquiry that has flagged
since Republicans did not do as well as expected in the midterm
elections two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't really count on Starr,'' the Republican congressional
official said on Monday night. ``He's not being very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee and Chairman Hyde have to find out for
themselves if there's anything there,'' the official added,
referring to Huang's dealings with Hubbell. Huang is known to have
funneled a $100,000 payment to Hubbell from the Riady banking
family of Indonesia, which was also at the center of inquiries into
1996 campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has consistently denied any wrongdoing in connection
with Hubbell, his longtime friend from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is also considering calling several other witnesses,
including the president's personal secretary, Betty Currie; his top
aide Bruce Lindsey, Ms. Lewinsky herself, and perhaps one or two
others, the Republican aide said. Moreover, the chairman is still
hoping to meet his target of completing his inquiry by the end of
the year, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is set to lay out his case against Clinton for the
Judiciary Committee on Thursday, and the White House was told on
Mondaythat it would have 30 minutes to cross-examine the
independent counsel. Democrats signaled that they intend to focus
as much on the prosecutor as on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of publicly released letters and statements, the
committee's Republicans and Democrats maneuvered furiously for
advantage before Starr's high-stakes appearance. Starr advised
Congress that there is ``substantial and credible evidence'' of 11
impeachable offenses by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are hoping that Starr, an experienced litigator,
will present a forceful case against Clinton and refocus the public
on the questions of whether Clinton lied under oath and obstructed
justice in his efforts to hide his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
They also want to give Starr a chance to rehabilitate his image
after months in which his role as a prosecutor has left him unable
to make public appearances and has brought him low approval ratings
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats are seeking to make Starr's own tactics an
issue. In a letter to Starr, Rep. John Conyers Jr., the ranking
Democrat on the committee, on Monday demanded reams of phone
records, messages, letters, notes, evidentiary materials and FBI
reports that could help Democrats question whether the prosecutor
himself broke rules as he investigated the president.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers also called for four senior deputies to Starr to appear
along with him for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' request came as law-enforcement officials with
the Justice Department said that aides to Attorney General Janet
Reno had, for the first time, asked Starr to turn over information
about whether his office improperly put pressure on Ms. Lewinsky
into cooperating at the outset of his inquiry last January.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Monday, the Justice Department said it had
already reviewed and dismissed a number of accusations raised by
Clinton's lawyers and others against Starr. The statement did not
specify those accusations deemed not warranting ``further
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that a review found no evidence
that Starr had acted unethically or withheld pertinent information
about the timing of his initial contacts with witnesses like Linda
Tripp when he asked the Justice Department to expand his inquiry to
include the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Those circumstances surrounding Starr's application to broaden
his inquiry and his relationship with Mrs. Tripp are among the
pieces of information sought by the Democrats. They are also
seeking documents about the Office of Independent Counsel's
relationship with a circle of conservative lawyers and lawyers for
Paula Jones and any notes or interviews with former Arkansas state
troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles G. Bakaly III, a spokesman for Starr, called charges
against Starr groundless and accused the Democrats of trying to
turn attention away from the president. ``We believe we have been
the victims of a series of allegations intended to challenge
prosecutorial authority,'' he said, ``and shift the focus from the
facts and evidence that we gathered during the investigation to the
practices of the prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats made their requests public just hours after Hyde
told Starr that he would be willing to accept such information in
closed session provided that it would not damage continuing
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also alerted the White House that a lawyer for Clinton
would be given a half-hour to question Starr after his two-hour
presentation. Republican and Democratic investigative counsels will
also be granted a half-hour each and the committee's 37 members
will each get five minutes to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Hyde, Starr agreed to provide certain materials
sought by the Democrats. But he said he would hold back two
documents concerning his request to Ms. Reno to expand his
investigation because they ``may interfere with an unrelated
ongoing criminal investigation'' by the Justice Department. He did
not elaborate. He also declined to turn over FBI notes of
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night Hyde, in a response to the Democrats, said the
impeachment inquiry was not an appropriate forum to investigate
Starr's actions, and said Ms. Reno had the authority to dismiss
Starr but had not done so. And Hyde signaled that to follow Justice
Department tradition, he would not press for Starr's deputies to
appear.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of suspended animation, the Judiciary Committee is
now pushing toward a vote next month on whether to recommend
articles of impeachment against Clinton. If the committee votes for
impeachment, the full House is expected to take up the issue before
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Although many lawmakers now believe there may not be the votes
in the House for impeachment, even Democrats are not ruling out
some punishment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the President did was very wrong and reprehensible,''
Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, said on Monday after he was
re-elected House minority leader. ``I believe that some action
should and will be taken. I'm not ready to conclude what I think
should be done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Democrats are likely to try to question Starr about other
investigations into the actions of his office. The outstanding
inquiries include these:
</P>
<P>
   _ An inquiry into charges that Starr's deputies improperly
disclosed federal grand jury information to news organizations. The
investigation is being conducted by John Kern III, a senior
District of Columbia judge.
</P>
<P>
   _ An examination of whether David Hale, an important Whitewater
witness, received payments from political adversaries of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Bar Association review of whether prosecutors on Starr's
staff violated provisions of the ethics code of the District of
Columbia Bar. The bar association is carrying out the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is expected to respond on Tuesday to the offer
of 30 minutes to question Starr. And for the first time, the public
on Tuesday will hear the voice of Ms. Lewinsky as the committee
releases Mrs. Tripp's secretly recorded tapes. Edited transcripts
of the 22 hours of recordings were made public by the committee in
October. Aides said the release of the recordings was slowed by the
complexity of editing them.

HACKETT FIGURES ON LOW-SCORING GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering UCLA's offense might be the most potent in the
nation, and some of the recent USC-UCLA scores have been in the 30s
and 40s, it seems a safe hunch that this year's game will also be
explosive. But USC coach Paul Hackett doesn't expect a shootout
when the teams play Saturday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be high scoring,'' Hackett said. ``We
haven't had any high-scoring games since Cal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said since neither team turns the ball over, he expects
it to be a fairly low-scoring game.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA does the best job of taking care of the ball,'' Hackett
said. ``They don't fumble and they don't throw interceptions. We
don't fumble and we don't throw interceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will sway the game, if there aren't many turnovers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of games, special teams make a difference,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to R. Jay Soward, whose badly sprained ankle
will remain the focus of attention during the week. It's not likely
he will participate on special teams if he is able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Soward was unable to jump on the ankle Sunday and it doesn't
appear he will be 100 percent, even if he plays. He is scheduled to
try some light running today at practice _ his first work on the
ankle since injuring it against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   __ Couch potato: After USC wide receiver Billy Miller spent his
Saturday watching the UCLA-Washington game, he isn't likely to be
influenced by the Bruins' recent close calls with Stanford and
Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the game. There wasn't anything else to do,'' Miller
said. ``Their defense looked a whole lot better. We've got a big
task ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Aggie reunion: USC linebackers coach Shawn Slocum worked with
UCLA coach Bob Toledo while Toledo was quarterbacks coach and
offensive coordinator at Texas A&AMP;M. But the pair haven't spoken
since last year's Cotton Bowl, when UCLA met the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little negligent,'' Slocum said. ``But I don't want
to bother him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Kudos to the offense: Hackett was effusive about UCLA's
performance against Washington, particularly the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington really saw a different Bruins. They're right where
they want to be,'' Hackett said. ``This is the best offense we've
seen all year. They're in good shape to make a run and we're in
good shape in make a run.''
</P>
<P>
   __ DeMars out: Defensive end Bobby DeMars of Westlake High has
suffered a groin injury and will not be available for the game.

   Besides, Moe, Larry and Curly were already taken.
</P>
<P>
   They probably settled on Titans because Giants was being used by
a football team in New York and a baseball team in San Francisco
and because ``Perennially Huge Disappointments'' was too big to fit
on the side of their helmets.
</P>
<P>
   They could have taken a page from the world of the skinny little
musician (The Artist Formerly Known as Prince) and changed their
name to only a symbol. But NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue's office
likely would have frowned on a stick figure of a man wearing
shoulder pads falling down an elevator shaft. Or a jersey-wearing
Mr. Bill once again being squashed by Sluggo.
</P>
<P>
   How about ``The Con Artists Formerly Known as the Oilers?'' Also
too unwieldy. And it was decided that the nickname Oilers, after 39
long and glorious seasons, would be retired. Or maybe they just
wore it out like an automobile engine from misuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Titans of torpidity. Titans of tediousness. How fitting for a
franchise that has played for the past 37 years without winning a
league championship.
</P>
<P>
   As Oilers, they were so often a dry hole. But now, all that
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The good inhabitants of their new city will forget all of that
and try to put their loving arms around these grand Titans to
embrace them.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is a brand-new start.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans have never celebrated New Year's Eve by firing the
best coach in the history of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans never sent the greatest player ever to wear one of
their jerseys to New Orleans to play the final seasons of a Hall of
Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans never hired Ladd Herzeg as their general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans never were coached by Jerry Glanville, all dressed in
black, who brought an element of professional wrestling to the game
long before Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura proved it was more suitable
for politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans never have used the run-and-shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans never have had a pair of assistant coaches engage in
a punch-out on the sidelines during a nationally televised game.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans never have threatened to move to Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans never have traveled to Buffalo in January, built a
35-3 lead early in the third quarter, and then experienced the
greatest playoff collapse in the known history of sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans never have squandered a double-digit lead to Joe
Montana in the final minutes of a home playoff game, thereby
killing any chance of rallying public sentiment for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans never have lost to the Chicago Bears in a Keystone
Kops ending in which two kickers wound up on the field at the same
time trying to nail the winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   They claim the new name was inspired by mythology, which makes
perfect sense, since in the history of the Budster's franchise, it
will fit right in with winged horses, gods living on a mountaintop
and the Super Bowl as strictly make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   Adams says it is also an appropriate fit for his adopted city
because so many people call Nashville the ``Athens of the South.''
Indeed, that same cultured class likely thinks I'd Rather Have a
Bottle In Front of Me Than a Frontal Lobotomy is an example of
classical music.
</P>
<P>
   But let us not spoil their fun. After all, these are heady days
for the soon-to-be-large ones. They have won five of their last six
games and are beginning to look like the kind of team that stormed
into the playoffs with momentum and so much hope through all those
seasons in our back yard.
</P>
<P>
   We can only offer a morsel of caution. From Bud's new symbol of
strength, leadership and heroic qualities comes another name with
which Tennesseans likely will grow quite familiar: Titanic.

DODGERS PREPARE TO MOVE ON BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is the week the Los Angeles Dodgers make
their move on Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't mean they will sign the free agent right-hander to
the six-year, $72 million contract he is seeking. There is a good
chance negotiations for Brown and left-hander Randy Johnson will
drag into December.
</P>
<P>
   But after weeks of sizing the market, the Dodgers are expected
to invite Brown to Los Angeles for a look around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all could take a while,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone said over the weekend. ``But we are serious about making
this team better. Kevin Brown makes us better.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone has a strong relationship with Brown's agent, Scott
Boras. The two spoke several times during last week's GM meetings
in Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly will be competition, but according to sources,
the New York Yankees have cooled their interest in Brown after
re-signing staff ace and clubhouse presence David Cone to a
one-year, $8 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies, however, figure to be players in the
bidding. They just hired Brown's former manager, Jim Leyland, for
three years at $6 million. Brown helped lead Leyland's Florida
Marlins to a World Series title in 1997 before he was traded last
season to the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make a run at him,'' Rockies owner Jerry
McMorris told Bloomberg News Service. ``We have five or six things
we're trying to do, and Kevin Brown has always been at the top of
our list. But we're not going to do a six-year deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras was traveling Monday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also has spoken to Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, who
last week said he was surprised the Dodgers had shown no interest
in his client.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have not made an offer for Johnson nor have they
scheduled a visit to Los Angeles. But both are expected shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to talk to the Dodgers and we are waiting for
some input before proceeding,'' Meister said. ``We've had a number
of discussions. And we are just waiting for the process to move
forward. I'm sure we'll talk later in the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 10-1 after joining Houston at the July 31 trading
deadline, is seeking a shorter contract than Brown but the same
salary per season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would like to sign with a team that trains in Arizona,
where he lives. Johnson met twice last week with the Arizona
Diamondbacks and reportedly was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   He also has received offers from the Angels and Texas Rangers.
The Rangers have proposed a three-year contract for between $36
million and 39 million and an option for a fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Notes:!off! Bench coach John Shelby, who was reassigned
last month during the purge of the Dodgers coaching staff, is back
as the first-base coach. Glenn Hoffman, who managed the club the
final three months of the season, was scheduled to handle first but
has been moved to bullpen coach.

ARIZONA'S `BIBLE WEEK' IS HALTED AS ACLU GOES TO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By EDYTHE JENSEN, JERRY KAMMER AND CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Hell hath no fury like a constitution scorned.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Civil Liberties Union on Monday got a temporary
restraining order in federal court against Gilbert, Ariz., that
stops Mayor Cynthia Dunham from proclaiming Nov. 22-29 ``Bible
Week'' at the Town Council meeting Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor and council of the Phoenix suburb are looking like
extras in a religious epic as prominent national groups battle
constitutional church-and-state issues on Gilbert's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Center for Law and Justice, part of a national law
firm started by evangelist Pat Robertson, is likely to fight the
town's cause at no cost to Gilbert, attorney Gary McCaleb said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely interested in this case, and we think the
ACLU is taking a ridiculous position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver issued the restraining order
three hours after attorneys Timothy Nelson and Victor Sipos filed
suit on the ACLU's behalf. She set a hearing for Friday, and could
decide then whether to sign a permanent injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull was not part of the controversy when, without
fanfare, she proclaimed Arizona Bible Week earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But ACLU Director Eleanor Eisenberg said Monday the governor may
be the organization's next target.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the court order was issued Monday, Dunham called
a news conference at Gilbert Town Hall and reaffirmed her
intentions to proclaim Bible Week.
</P>
<P>
   Later, town spokesman David Cannella said the mayor hadn't
received a copy of the ACLU's complaint or the federal court
injunction before she held the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did say if she is served with a restraining order, she's
certainly not going to break the law,'' Cannella said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gilbert could challenge Silver's decision, the Town
Council will decide tonight whether to use tax funds for the legal
bills if the Arizona Center for Law and Justice does not end up
paying.
</P>
<P>
   That could bring a parting of political waters; at least three
council members said they're not in favor of spending municipal
money to defend Bible Week, and some want to scrap the proclamation
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's offending people,'' Councilwoman Jo Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Dave Crozier disagrees, but doesn't think taxpayer
funds should be used to defend a proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Mayor Dunham is right on target with her
proclamation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's council meeting, resident Ellen Sklar identified
herself as a Jew and Holocaust survivor who finds the proclamation
offensive to non-Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Sklar was one of three plaintiffs listed in the ACLU suit; the
others are her husband, Ellis Sklar, and William Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   Hull refused Monday to rescind her Bible Week proclamation,
although she acknowledged she might handle it differently next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said she will consider a ``religious scriptures
week'' next year instead of focusing only on the Bible. Both the
state's and Gilbert's proposed proclamations state, in part, ``The
Bible is the foundational document of the Judeo-Christian
principles upon which our nation was conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope the governor would reconsider her decision (to
proclaim Bible Week) in light of the court's ruling,'' Eisenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the ``religious scripture'' proposal is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling prohibits Gilbert from proclaiming Bible week ``or
any similar religion-related observance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution applies equally to the state of Arizona as it
does to the town of Gilbert,'' Eisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg has been trying to meet with Hull but said the
governor did not return her phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In defending her proclamation, Hull released a stack of similar
decrees from governors and presidents that dated to a Bible
proclamation signed by President Truman in 1952. She ripped the
ACLU for filing suit, suggesting the group was looking for
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said she signs 400 proclamations each year for a variety of
groups, including recognition for the Islamic month of Ramadan, the
50th anniversary of Israel's independence, the Arizona Day of
Prayer, and the Interfaith Prayer Vigil Week.
</P>
<P>
   As Gilbert officials prepare for controversy over a religious
proclamation, town officials are this week hosting a delegation
from its first sister city _ Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Edward Crilly, from a nation known for its religious
battles, will be at tonight's meeting. He was pictured in the
recent Gilbert newsletter wearing orange _ the designated color for
Protestants in Northern Ireland. Catholics wear green. &QL;

BRONCOS CRUSH CHIEFS, 30-7 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Who will derail the Denver Broncos'
frolicking ride toward an unbeaten, untied season? Not the Kansas
City Chiefs. Not on Monday night, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   With no John Elway, who sat out the game with bruised ribs, and
before 78,100 at Arrowhead Stadium, the Broncos looked quite
comfortable. They jumped all over the Chiefs early and coasted to a
30-7 victory. Denver, which is 10-0, is the eighth team since 1970
to reach that mark.
</P>
<P>
   Six more to go.
</P>
<P>
   Six more victories and the Broncos have an undefeated, untied
season. The 1972 Miami Dolphins are the only team to accomplish the
feat. (Miami did it in a 14-game regular season and then won three
playoff games, including the Super Bowl, for a 17-0 mark.)
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, the defending Super Bowl champions, are compiling
numbers that indicate another championship ring is within their
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The last team to reach 10-0 was the Washington Redskins in 1991;
they went on to win the Super Bowl. The last defending Super Bowl
champions to reach 10-0 were the 1990 San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   While Denver won its 10th straight, Kansas City lost its fifth
straight. Kansas City, which began the season 4-1, is now 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, who trailed by 20-7 at halftime, could do almost
nothing right in the second half. Denver got a Jason Elam 35-yard
field goal late in the third quarter and then cruised.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis finished with 111 yards on 18 carries. On Monday
night, it was Bubby Brister (54 yards rushing and 180 yards
passing) who crushed the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Denver finished with 380 yards of total offense. Kansas City
gained only 221 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos started the game as if they would blow away,
embarrass and toy with the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City made a game of it briefly in the second quarter,
with its only long drive of the half resulting in a touchdown, but
Denver pushed its lead to 20-7 by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The start clearly indicated that this game would be nothing like
the recent ones in a hot rivalry that covers 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   Denver took the opening kickoff back to its 33-yard line and
quickly moved to the Kansas City 43. On third-and-2, Chiefs
linebacker Derrick Thomas jumped offside, giving Denver a first
down at the Chiefs' 38. The next Denver play was a bootleg run.
</P>
<P>
   Brister kept the ball after a fake to Davis and rolled wide
right and ran. And ran. And kept running, until near the Chiefs' 5,
he ran over and around the Chiefs. Brister wound up with a 38-yard
touchdown _ the longest scoring run by a quarterback in the
Broncos' history _ and Denver had a 7-0 lead with the game only
three minutes old.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, who could not move the ball, punted it back to
Denver and then the Broncos rolled again. Davis went for a 19-yard
run. Then Ed McCaffrey had a 19-yard catch. Davis had a 41-yard
touchdown run through the right side, all the while stumbling,
righting himself and blazing past the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The game was barely eight minutes old and Denver led by 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a surprise. Denver has outscored its opponents by
100-13 in the first quarter and has thrashed its opponents on
opening drives by 42-3.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Broncos are undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   It is why the Chiefs likely will not make the playoffs. &QL;

WOLF `HERE TO STAY,' BABBITT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Under crystal skies, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt carried two burdens Monday into the pine-studded forests of
eastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   One was a heavy steel cage. Inside was one of two endangered
Mexican gray wolves delivered Monday to the wilds of the Apache and
Gila national forests.
</P>
<P>
   The second was a message for those who in recent weeks have
gunned down three of the rare lobos, including the mother of the
first wolf pup born in the wilds of Arizona in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wolf is here to stay,'' said the former Arizona governor.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt returned to the same rocky ridge where in January he
took part in the release of the first 11 wolves into the wilds of
the Southwest in nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incomprehensible that people would view this (wolf)
as a threat, and that they would resort to this kind of violence,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although sheep and cattle ranchers feared their herds would be
decimated, the wolves have not killed any livestock.
</P>
<P>
   A reward of $30,000 is posted for information leading to the
arrest of the wolf killers.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of an endangered animal can result in a year in
prison and a $100,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The wolves are being returned to the wild in an effort to
increase their numbers, remove them from the list of species in
danger of extinction and put back a predator into the Southwest
ecosystems that will help ensure populations of other animals are
kept in check.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt met Monday morning in Albuquerque with state and federal
law enforcement officers from Arizona and New Mexico, and he
promised to provide whatever resources are needed to bring the
killer or killers to justice.
</P>
<P>
   And he promised to return again this winter, when four
additional wolf packs are planned to be released, part of a
multiyear plan to eventually have more than 100 wild wolves
scattered over 5,000 square miles of some of the most rugged land
along the Arizona-New Mexico line.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also left open the possibility that a federal
investigation may not be over for a Tucson man who killed the first
wolf in April _ a controversial shooting that was ruled an act of
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   He said decisions in the case involving retired postal worker
Richard Humphrey are up to law enforcement agents. But when pressed
for whether the case may be reopened, Babbitt said, ``I'd just
rather not comment on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The interior secretary, who heads the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, said there is no evidence that Humphrey or any member of
his family was under attack. And he said it remains true that there
is no documented case of a healthy wild wolf in North America this
century ever attacking a human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the facts support any inference that the wolf
was anything other than an animal that happened to be in the
neighborhood,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   G.J. of Tucson, a hunting enthusiast who has acted as a
spokesman for Humphrey, said he believes it is possible that the
three wolves shot in August, October and earlier this month may
also have been killed legitimately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well be that several people had a run-in with the
wolves similar to Humphrey, and are afraid to turn themselves in
after witnessing his public crucifixion,'' said Sagi, the former
editor of a newsletter called ``Outdoor News.'' Sagi said he closed
shop because of the harassment he's suffered while sticking up for
Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sagi said whoever killed the wolves recently should
consult an attorney and turn themselves in to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether a series of accidents or deliberate sabotage, one
thing is for sure: The recent killings are a monolithic catastrophe
in the effort to reintroduce the Mexican gray wolf, and speak
volumes about the need for coalition building in this and any
federal effort that potentially impacts recreation and property
rights,'' Sagi said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the wolf program goes beyond building bridges with
the local community.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ten games into the season, perfection has become
the Denver Broncos' obsession.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Denver, the defending Super Bowl champion, took another step
Monday night in its quest to join the 1972 Miami Dolphins as the
NFL's only unbeaten and untied teams. The Broncos destroyed Kansas
City 30-7 to become the league's first 10-0 team since the 1991
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look beyond our next game,'' Denver coach Mike
Shanahan said about the possibility of going unbeaten. ``The only
thing we're thinking about is that we play Oakland (on Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs (4-6), who suffered their fifth consecutive loss, are
headed for their worst season in Marty Schottenheimer's 10 years as
coach. Schottenheimer was particularly bothered by the way his
defense lost its composure in the fourth quarter, committing five
penalties on Denver's last scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been disappointed, and I've been frustrated, but I have
to tell you I am embarrassed and humiliated,'' Schottenheimer said.
``The way we permitted the fourth quarter to go is as great a
disappointment as I've ever had in my coaching experience. I'm
apologizing to you, the community, because I am embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos were without quarterback John Elway, who was on the
bench because of a rib injury, but dominated anyway. Bubby Brister
improved his record as a starter to 4-0 this season before an
Arrowhead Stadium crowd of 78,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go home,'' Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe screamed to the
fans as he ran off the field. ``This is our house. Your lease is
up. You haven't paid in three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Kansas City's third consecutive home loss.
</P>
<P>
   Brister was calm and smart playing before ABC's national
television audience. Brister and running back Terrell Davis carried
the Broncos to their 15th consecutive victory, dating to last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bubby did a great job,'' Shanahan said. ``We're fortunate to
have a quarterback like him with John out. I don't know when John
will be able to come back, but we've got a lot of confidence in
Bubby.''
</P>
<P>
   Brister was 13-of-23 passing for 180 yards. He didn't throw a
touchdown pass, but he wasn't intercepted, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most fun I've ever had,'' Brister said. ``Every
time I play, it seems like we score at least 30 points, but it's
not because of me. We've just got a great team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to talk about being 19-0. We've got a lot of
veterans and a very mature team. I don't think there's any pressure
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Gannon started at quarterback for Kansas City because Elvis
Grbac was benched last week. Grbac was 0-4 since returning from an
injury. Gannon is now 0-2 in this stretch as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Gannon said. ``We had terrible field
position all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving backward, not forward. We've got too much talent
to be playing like we are. We're just not a very smart team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos got off to such an awesome start, they almost fell
asleep during a 10-minute stretch in the first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
   On their first series, Brister took the Broncos to the Kansas
City 38. On first down, Brister faked a handoff to Davis running
left. The Chiefs went after Davis, but there was one problem _ he
didn't have the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Brister kept the ball on a perfectly executed bootleg and scored
on a 38-yard run. Jason Elam kicked the extra point for a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chiefs punted on their first series, Denver got the
ball at its 21. Davis ran for 19 yards, and Brister connected with
Ed McCaffrey for another 19. On first down at the Kansas City 41,
Davis broke two tackles and went the distance. Elam made it 14-0
midway through the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's offense went into hibernation long enough for the
Chiefs to make it interesting. On their best series, the Chiefs
went 87 yards in 14 plays, using 7:44 off the clock. The touchdown
came when Gannon avoided the rush and threw a three-yard pass to
fullback Kimble Anders. Pete Stoyanovich kicked the extra point to
pull Kansas City within 14-7 with 6:31 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Denver's offense awakened. Brister guided the
Broncos on two drives of 40 yards. Elam finished both with 42- and
46-yard field goals _ the latter with 14 seconds remaining _ to
give the Broncos a 20-7 halftime advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Denver began the second half the same way it ended the first _
with a field-goal drive. Because of a penalty, the Broncos started
at their three, and Elam finished off the scoring drive with a
35-yard field goal to make it 23-7 with 3:05 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth quarter, Gannon guided the Chiefs to
Denver's 29, but his pass was tipped and intercepted by linebacker
Bill Romanowski to ruin the drive.
</P>
<P>
   The next time the Chiefs got the ball, they drove to Denver's
10. At that point, the Chiefs had four plays that were symbolic of
their frustrating season.
</P>
<P>
   First, Gannon avoided the rush and threw to an open Andre Rison
in the end zone. The ball was thrown behind Rison, who couldn't
pull it in. After a one-yard run, Derrick Alexander dropped a pass
in the end zone that would have been a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On fourth down, Gannon dropped back against Denver's four-man
rush. He tripped over his feet at the 20, where he was touched down
by tackle Trevor Pryce, who was credited with a sack.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos scored their last touchdown on backup running back
Derek Loville's two-yard run.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Big news at Seahawk headquarters Monday _ no player
was cut for making a bad play against Oakland, ending the tradition
rather meekly.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall the tradition began two weeks ago after the
Seahawks massively screwed up a game against the Raiders at home.
Ronnie Harris, a seldom-used receiver/returner who fumbled away a
punt return that eventually became an Oakland touchdown, found
himself unemployed the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Seahawks massively screwed up another game against
the Raiders, this one in Oakland. This time defensive back Fred
Thomas, identified in this space during the preseason as the
dumbest Seahawk, lived down to the billing by sustaining the
Raiders' game-winning drive with a roughing-the-passer penalty that
was far more inexplicable than Harris' fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally ridiculous,'' was how coach Dennis Erickson described
Thomas' foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thomas remains employed, ready to commit mayhem against
either the Cowboys or his own team _ it's anybody's guess _ Sunday
in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson said Harris' firing was a message to his players that
this is the sort of outrage that will not be tolerated. No more
would punishments be limited to withheld dinners or allowances. Dad
was getting serious.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the tradition had a shelf life of one game. After
Harris was fired, the Seahawks actually won a game, albeit over a
Kansas City team that was more suicidally negligent than the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Seahawks were back to being their bratty selves. In
response this time, however, Erickson had no one go with the
fishes. Partly because of injuries and partly because the technique
works better on 8-year-olds than 28-year-olds, Thomas and everybody
else who stepped on a rake Sunday still has a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just keep practicing,'' Erickson said. ``I don't know what
else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That summarizes the Seahawk stink as well as anything. Seven
weeks into a run of results remarkably similar to one another,
Erickson and his staff apparently are out of answers.
</P>
<P>
   Not out of talent. Not out of games. Not out of excuses. Just
out of answers.
</P>
<P>
   The firing of Harris looked to be the last refuge of a desperate
coach. Harris had no responsibility for the Seahawks' rolling
debacle, yet he was sacrificed to make a dubious point. The players
got a message, all right _ blame was being flung recklessly.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Erickson needed was player backfire from a rare
decisive move. His support was already tenuous. When linebacker
Chad Brown, perhaps the team's most driven employee, makes a public
call for accountability, and starts with Erickson by name, trouble
is afoot.
</P>
<P>
   That was two weeks ago. Now, with a second game squandered to a
division rival guided by an obscure backup quarterback, the
Erickson regime is fading from mere confusion to futility.
</P>
<P>
   Some offensive shortcomings are plain. Warren Moon isn't the
quarterback he was a year ago, Ricky Watters isn't quite the
running back the Seahawks had hoped for. Nor has the re-made line
done what was projected. Each week, another receiver makes a
critical mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The two-back scheme featuring Watters often has been a bust, yet
the Seahawks quit on the more successful three-receiver formation
whenever they get near an end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The offense plays fearfully. The Seahawks have had leads in the
past four games, all against AFC West beatables, but have only two
wins because the offense seems to close down to avoid giving away
games.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Erickson's collegiate coaching past as an offensive
pyrotechnician, his conservatism is an astonishing turn away from
the credentials that got him the job.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps after having the NFL's third-ranked offense a year ago
and finishing 8-8, Erickson figured his stuff wasn't good enough
for the NFL, and backed away. Even so, the Seahawks in this
season's sixth week were on the verge of beating the NFL's best,
Denver, with their backup quarterback when a late interception
saved the Broncos' 21-16 win.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed then that Erickson, with his historic inventiveness,
was on the verge of resolving the offensive foibles. Instead, there
was regression. Regression all the way to a career crossroads
Sunday in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In his coaching past, Erickson often has been one step ahead of
trouble. He left Washington State just before his players'
off-field mischief and disastrous team GPA became a public joke. He
left the University of Miami with the NCAA federales on his tail
and his teams disparaged and much penalized for their undisciplined
behavior and rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's four years into his NFL career with the league's
fourth-highest payroll and virtually unlimited resources, and his
mistake-pickled team seems nowhere close to postseason caliber.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth loss almost assures playoff elimination, thanks to
tiebreakers. The only thing saving his job would be Seahawk
president Bob Whitsitt's decision whether a quality replacement
could be found and worthy of signing for the balance of this year,
or waiting until the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   At the pinnacle of his profession, Erickson has no steps to take
to escape. Professionally speaking, he lives or dies on a doomsday
in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   May as well let 'er rip.

SEAHAWKS OUT OF TIME FOR TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Two weeks ago, Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson
attempted to send a message to his underachieving team by releasing
Ronnie Harris after he fumbled a punt return.
</P>
<P>
   Later that week, the players had a meeting to try to regain
their focus.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the offense huddled as a unit for the first time this
season to review game video and try to cut down their penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, quarterback Warren Moon dropped $2,000 in
treating the entire offense to a night of dinner and bonding.
</P>
<P>
   What followed all that was another penalty-laced, mistake-strewn
effort in Sunday's 20-17 loss to the Raiders in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   What next? Apparently, nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have tried almost everything to right all that has
gone wrong with this season, but not much has worked.
</P>
<P>
   Another team meeting? Another impassioned pep talk?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming the same speech,'' wide receiver Mike Pritchard
said Monday. ``I don't want to hear it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the events of the past three games have left the
Seahawks 5-5, the Raiders 7-3 and Harris fair-catching punts as a
member of the 8-2 Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks appear to be fresh out of answers _ especially
Erickson. Asked about shaking up his team, the on-shaky-ground
Erickson could offer only coaching cliches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of pride,'' he said. ``We still have six games
left. Mathematically, we're not out of the playoffs. All you can do
is take it one game at a time. We'll just continue to practice and
we'll just continue to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done about everything,'' he said. ``Now it's a matter of
the players being accountable and they've got to do what they're
accountable for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The Seahawks need to start making big plays, and
stop making dumb plays.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes already have cost them the season they were expecting.
A continuation could cost people their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen different offensive players have been penalized in the
first 10 games. In this same dumbfounding stretch, the offense has
turned the ball over 20 times while scoring only 17 touchdowns. The
defense and special teams have combined to score eight times and
force 25 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense has played well enough for us to win eight
games,'' Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense's No. 1 goal is to hold the opposing offense to 17
points or fewer. The Seahawks have done that seven times and came
close in a loss to the Broncos (21 points) and a win over the
Chargers (20 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously frustrating,'' linebacker Dean Wells said.
``But when the offense is struggling, we just need to make more
plays. If we have to hold a team to seven points or shut a team
out, it's whatever we have to do. That's the attitude we have to
have on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Finger pointing? Not in the Seahawks' locker room. Not yet,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a team game. They're supporting us,'' Pritchard said.
``But you have to wonder when they go home at night what they're
thinking.''

WSU'S BROWN HITTING STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When he's walking, Kevin Brown moves with slow,
deliberate steps as if he's just trying to fit in with the crowd.
He keeps his head high, hat on backwards, and shuffles along
quietly without flash or flair.
</P>
<P>
   But put him in football pads, place the ball in his hands, and
Brown bolts to the forefront like a race horse. The sophomore
running back is on pace to run through the WSU record book if he
stays healthy and focused in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just learning my steps,'' said Brown, who seems
uncomfortable when he's the focus of attention off the field.
</P>
<P>
   But, like living in Pullman, he's starting to get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Pac-10 rusher going into Saturday's Apple Cup with
961 yards on 193 carries, Brown represents one of the few success
stories for the 1998 Washington State football program. For the
Cougars, the best part of those numbers is that the 6-foot-2,
220-pound Brown has two more seasons of eligibility to add to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can work hard in the offseason, improve his work habits
and work ethic, we're going to really have something in Kevin
Brown,'' said WSU coach Mike Price.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior-college transfer from San Francisco City College,
Brown is without question the biggest recruiting plum that WSU
coaches plucked from the momentum of last year's Pac-10
championship and Rose Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of that 1997-season success and the fact that
the Cougars run a one-back offense, Brown chose to attend WSU over
the University of Washington, a school that in hindsight could have
used his services even more than the Cougars. The UW's leading
rusher, true freshman Willie Hurst, has just 383 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl ``won me over,'' Brown said. ``It seemed like the
program was heading up more than the Washington program, that's
probably the reason why I came here.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Brown Monday, Husky coach Jim Lambright first
referred to him as ``Keith'' Brown, before correcting his error:
``When you lose them, you try to forget about them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Husky recruit, ``We really liked what he did,'' Lambright
said. ``He's big and strong and can take a physical pounding. ...
I'd love to have him in our program. We certainly have a need for a
1,000-yard rusher.''
</P>
<P>
   Isolated, laid-back Pullman now feels comfortable for the
well-traveled Brown, who was born in Moss Point, Miss., but played
high school football in West Covina, Calif. Brown was recruited by
Nebraska, then worked to get his grades up at Hutchinson Community
College in Kansas before landing in San Francisco for his official
freshman year of college football. He would have ended up in
Nebraska, but had completed only seven of the required 13 core
classes for eligibility out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Being in Pullman has given him some much-needed stability, and
he plans to work hard on a general studies degree in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool. Everybody is friendly and it's a great place to
live and go to school,'' Brown said. ``It's a great football town.
It's way better than San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than four months since arriving in Pullman, he's gone
from an asterisk in a big city to a bona fide star on one of the
Pac-10's smallest campuses. Although his photograph doesn't even
appear in this year's WSU media guide, Brown is starting to get
recognized wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   His coaches, however, have always recognized his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look very fast, but nobody catches him,'' said
George Rush, Brown's coach at San Francisco City College.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a blazer and he doesn't just run away from people,
but he gets through a hole in a hurry,'' said Hank Ives, publisher
of JC Gridwire, who followed Brown's progress in SFCC's 11-1 season
before he headed for WSU. Ives ranked Brown as a first-team
All-American last year.
</P>
<P>
   Price sees Brown as just starting to hit his stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming into his own,'' Price said. ``Even though he had a
couple of good games early, he had a drought there for a while. But
that was good for him and it made him a better player. It wasn't as
easy as he thought it was going to be and proved he had to work
harder to achieve it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first game as a Cougar, Brown rushed for 111 yards
against Illinois, but then struggled the next three games before
hitting a streak of 100-yard games interrupted only by a 33-yard
performance against USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started watching a lot of film and getting into the playbook
a little more,'' Brown said of his midterm football turnaround. ``I
started understanding my assignments and just started getting more
comfortable with the system.''
</P>
<P>
   He had 109 yards against UCLA, 100 against Oregon, 153 against
Arizona State, 126 against Arizona, and then 202 against Stanford
to take over the Pac-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a few adjustments and learned to pick my holes a little
better, that's been the only difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Apple Cup, Brown needs just 58 yards to break the
WSU record for sophomores (1,018 yards) set by Rich Swinton in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's finishing each play strong, and moving the pile when he
hits it,'' Price said. ``I think he's just getting a feel for the
offense, the blocking schemes and the speed of the opponents. It's
a different game than at San Francisco City College, and he's in a
different league now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown believes he's had little trouble making the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting more comfortable with the offense, learning
the steps,'' Brown said. ``I'm just doing what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for his success, he said, is due to the
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each week, they have been getting better and better. I'm able
to read their blocks and just run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cougars losing their past seven games, Brown admits to
being somewhat frustrated that the team hasn't succeeded. Losing
wears him out more than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you get used to winning, it's hard to accept losing,''
he said. But he still doesn't feel it's his place to speak up:
``I'm not the one to be lashing out or criticizing my teammates.
That's not my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt after the 202-yard effort in the Stanford
loss, he sighed: ``I'm tired because we lost, but if we had won, I
wouldn't be tired. I'm just trying to get a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of WSU's troubles this season, Brown concedes there are
times when he's wondered what his year would have been like had he
ended up a Husky instead of a Cougar.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have second thoughts, but there's nothing that can
be done about it now,'' he said.

N.Y. STATE WOULD RECEIVE $25 BILLION FROM TOBACCO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With BC-TOBACCO-SETTLE-NYT) (sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York state would get $25 billion over the next
25 years from a proposed settlement of litigation brought by states
against the tobacco industry, State Attorney General Dennis Vacco
said on Monday. Of that money, New York City would get more than $6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco was one of eight state attorneys general in Washington on
Monday to announce the $206 billion settlement, which was reached
with the four largest cigarette makers and is intended to cover all
46 states that have not already reached settlements with the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   New York would receive its first annual payment, $818 million,
in 2000, according to a timetable released by Vacco. The payments
would eventually increase to more than $1 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement calls for New York state to keep half the $25
billion, with the rest being split among the state's 62 counties.
New York City would receive about half of the municipalities' share
of that money, more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco also said that the cigarette makers would deposit $306
million for New York state in an interest-bearing escrow account by
the end of this year as a down payment on the settlement. That
money would become available once the plan is completed, which
Vacco said was expected sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   The companies participating in the deal are the Philip Morris
Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of the RJR Nabisco
Holdings Corp.; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of the Loews Corp.,
and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT Industries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Connecticut would receive $3.6 billion over 25
years, but the state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said he
has not decided whether to support the deal. New Jersey would
receive $7.6 billion, and its attorney general, Peter Verniero,
said he would back the plan.

   ANAHEIM, Calilf. _ The black cloud that has been hovering over
the Forum most of the 1998-99 season followed the Los Angeles Kings
to the Pond on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   And it likely followed them back after a 3-1 loss to the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks before 16,067 in the first of six meetings between the
Southern California teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Kings lose their fourth consecutive game and
fifth in the last six, their injury woes continued to mount as they
lost center Jozef Stumpel yet again. Stumpel, who missed nearly all
of training camp due to a sprained ankle and missed 10 regular
season games with an abdominal pull and hip flexor injury, left
Monday's game midway through the first period with a sprained right
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't bad enough, the inept Los Angeles power play
continued to struggle. The Kings misfired on their first five
chances and gave up a shorthanded goal to Travis Green that put the
Ducks in front to stay at 18:29 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were scoreless in their previous 25 power play
opportunities and 1 of 45 before Olli Jokinen made it close on Los
Angeles' 35th shot of the game with 3:46 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who outshot the Ducks 39-28, did continue to battle
but were done in by Paul Kariya's goal into an empty net with 5.7
seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the team's miseries, the normally dependable penalty
killers even gave up a power play goal to Johan Davidsson that all
but put the game out of reach at 2:58 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Ducks won for the third time in four games and
moved back to .500 (6-6-4) and into tie for sixth in the Western
Conference with the unlikely pair of Detroit and Calgary. The Kings
(5-10-3) are 11th in the conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Ducks' second win in three games since Teemu Selanne
suffered a thigh injury last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had some excellent chances to take an early lead but
were unable to get anything past Guy Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Johnson had a clean breakaway 1{ minutes into the game
when the Ducks turned the puck over at their own blue only to have
his shot smothered by the Anaheim goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert also made a fine save on a deflected shot by Philippe
Boucher, and when the Kings went on the power play for the first
time he robbed Olli Jokinen, back in the lineup after a one-game
benching, when he moved quickly across the crease to stop the
rookie's shot from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   On Los Angeles' third power play opportunity of the period, the
Ducks gave the Kings a bit of their own medicine, scoring the
team's second shorthanded goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has scored seven shorthanded goals this year, but
Steve Duchesne's season-long run of bad luck continued when he
couldn't get his stick on a rebound with an open net in front of
him. When the defenseman finally did collect the puck behind the
Anaheim goal, his hard pass up the boards jumped over the stick of
Luc Robitaille and right to Marty McInnis.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a two-on-one for the Ducks. McInnis fed Green,
who faked Manny Legace to the ice and lifted a backhander over the
Los Angeles goalie for his first goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise for the Kings to give a shorthanded goal _
they have given up five. But then their league-leading penalty
killing unit let them down early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a little wiser decision by Legace might have helped
their cause. He tried to clear Ruslan Salei's dump-in but only
managed to move it a few feet. Mattias Norstrom also failed to
clear and that gave Davidsson the chance to score his first NHL
goal from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks nearly took a three-goal lead with 11 minutes left in
the second. Steve Rucchin's shot hit the right post and bounced
right to Jim McKenzie, who knocked it in. However, the replay
clearly showed that the Anaheim winger kicked the puck in and the
goal was waved off. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's something that hasn't happened in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge women's basketball team has overcome
the controversy surrounding their former head coach to open the
season with two consecutive victories for the first time since the
1988-89 season. The Matadors relied on defensive pressure and
outside shots to roll over Portland 74-55 on Monday at Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one constant was our defense,'' said Northridge coach
Frozena Jerro. ``Our defense was phenomenal the first half and that
kept us in it. ``If we wanted to be considered among the top
Division I programs or a legitimate Division I program we had to
start beating teams like this. (We) came focused and ready to play.
This was a huge win for us. Huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors' aggressive defense forced 20 turnovers and helped
CSUN (2-0) jump to a 32-17 halftime lead. Jamilah Jones and
LaShaunda Fowler had four steals apiece to lead the Matadors. Jones
finished the game with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half the defensive intensity continued and
Northridge held the Pilots (0-2) to 11 points in the first 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Matadors relied on their backcourt controlling
the ball. CSUN had just 17 turnovers in the game and passed well
around the perimeter, almost always finding the open player. Often
it was sophomore Edniesha Curry, who scored a team-high 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our backcourt is so quick that our offense revolves around our
quickness and our ability to penetrate and get to the bucket,''
said Curry. ``I think this shows that Northridge is a team to be
reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN had lost its three previous meetings with the Pilots. &QL; 
Although one of Northridge's top rebounding prospects, forward Neda
Milic, was sidelined because of a bruised leg, the Matadors
remained aggressive on the boards. Natalia Jonas also did not play
because of a mild concussion. According to Jerro, both players
should return to the lineup Saturday afternoon at Cal State
Fullerton.

CSUN EXPECTS TO BE IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the craziness and absurdity that sometimes
overtakes the rational thought of the NCAA selection committee, one
never knows what could happen with at-large bids.
</P>
<P>
   But Cal State Northridge coach Ron Ponciano said he has no
worries, absolutely none, that the Matadors will get invited to the
NCAA Division I-AA playoffs if they win Saturday at Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said he feels that way regardless of whether Montana
beats Montana State earlier in the day, which would give CSUN an
opportunity to earn the Big Sky Conference's automatic bid with a
win. The playoff field will be announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry. Really, I don't,'' Ponciano said Monday.
``We've been reassured by people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, CSUN (7-3) remained No. 25 in the Sports Network poll
and moved up one slot in the USA Today coaches' poll to No. 23
after Saturday's 42-38 win at Southwest Missouri State. The ranking
means there are plenty of teams ahead of CSUN that would miss the
16-team playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those guys are going to be frustrated,'' Ponciano
said.
</P>
<P>
   What CSUN is counting on is history _ of the NCAA selection
committee and of the Big Sky's tradition. Since the field expanded
to 16 teams in 1986, the Big Sky has sent two teams to the
postseason each year.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the Sagarin ratings, to which the NCAA pays close
attention during postseason consideration. The Matadors are 15th
among Division I-AA teams and are the top-rated team in the Big
Sky.
</P>
<P>
   The conjecture could become meaningless with a win at Idaho
State, which would give the Matadors a share of the conference
crown. If Montana State wins, it would get the automatic bid based
on the Bobcats' win at CSUN earlier this season. The Matadors hold
the tiebreaker with Montana, which would also finish tied with CSUN
if both teams win.
</P>
<P>
   __ Back in action: After being suspended for the Nov. 7 Portland
State game, CSUN free safety Jeremy Golden said he was ecstatic to
be back on the field at Southwest Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had more jitters last week before the game,'' said Golden,
who made 12 tackles against Southwest Missouri State. ``My legs
were shaking because I knew I couldn't do anything. It was the most
nerve-wracking thing, not to be able to get in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, it's the opposite. If you don't play, you're nervous
to get in. I was nervous to be out.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Brady shares honor: Quarterback Marcus Brady threw four
touchdowns, ran for one, caught another, and all he got for it was
a share of the Big Sky Conference Offensive Player of the Week
honor. Brady, who went 34 of 40 for 466 yards, the third-most in
Matadors history, shared the award with Montana State quarterback
Rob Compson. Compson threw for 357 yards and five touchdowns in a
66-35 win against Idaho State.

TWO WAYS TO PLAY ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings' special teams are
indeed special this season. The penalty killing has been especially
good, ranked No. 1 in the league going into Monday's game. The
power play has been especially awful _ 27th and last in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   But when you crunch the numbers, there isn't much to pick from
between the Anaheim Mighty Ducks and Kings. Combine the goals
scored and allowed by the special teams and the Ducks were plus-2
and the Kings were plus-1 heading into Monday's contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have been doing things the more orthodox way, scoring
11 power-play goals and one shorthander, while giving up 10 on the
power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are certainly playing with fire. They have scored five
power-play goals and seven shorthanders, while allowing seven
power-play goals and four shorthanded.
</P>
<P>
   __ Short and sweet: Eight teams in the league have yet to score
a shorthanded goal and only four have score more than two.
Amazingly, the Kings have received two shorthanders from Yanic
Perreault and one each from Vladimir Tsyplakov, Glenn Murray, Rob
Blake, Mattais Norstrom and Nathan LaFayette.
</P>
<P>
   __ Getting better: The Ducks' power play started the season
nearly as inept as the Kings' (4 of 45 in the first nine games),
but Anaheim started to turn things around when coach Craig
Hartsburg moved Paul Kariya back to the point position. The Ducks
were 7 of 36 in the six games prior to Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya hasn't scored any of his three power-play goals since the
change, but he's not fighting the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a quarterback now and get more shots, said Kariya,
who has four assists in man-advantage situations. ``Down low you
don't get as many shots, but the quality is better. But it doesn't
matter, whatever Craig wants.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Teemu Selanne spent the weekend receiving
ultra-sound treatments, stretching and riding the exercise bike
trying to rehab his right thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's closer, but not tonight,'' said Hartsburg Monday morning.
``Mother nature has to do its work.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, who has seven goals and 15 points in 13 games, said he
will continue to take it ``one day at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to rush it at this point of the season,'' he
added. ``I don't want to have more injuries later because of this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast stat: When Kariya recorded 12 shots against Detroit, 10
versus Carolina and 11 against Vancouver, the winger become the
first player to record 10 or more shots in three consecutive games
since individual shots on goal became a stat in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, whose streak was ended when he had only two against
Calgary last Saturday, came into Monday's game leading the league
in shots (95).

PAUPER'S RETURN MAKES HOLAN A PRINCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks and Los Angeles Kings were
doing battle Monday night at the Pond, a far more meaningful battle
was being waged on the ice about 6,000 miles to the east in the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   There, former Mighty Ducks defenseman Milos Holan appeared in a
game last week for his former Czech team, Vitkovice, in the
continuing battle to salvage his hockey career. Holan already has
won his nearly three-year battle with leukemia, a disease that
almost cost him his life.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mighty Ducks cut him during training camp
without allowing him to play so much as a single shift in an
exhibition game, the 27-year-old Holan didn't give up on himself.
</P>
<P>
   According to Euroreport, an Internet Web site that chronicles
overseas hockey, Vitkovice is paying Holan one Czech crown for the
season, the equivalent of less than four cents.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the pauper's salary? According to Euroreport,
under terms of a $1-million insurance settlement Holan received
when released by the Ducks, he originally was not permitted to play
professionally this season.
</P>
<P>
   Holan told Euroreport he hasn't given up on a return to the
Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll play 10 games and I'll be finished,'' Holan said.
``Certainly, I don't plan to break any scoring records. I just want
to help Vitkovice. If I get back to my normal form, though, I'll
try the camp in Anaheim the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fashion statement: The National Post, a new Canadian
newspaper, recently assembled a panel of five fashion experts to
judge which jerseys are chic and which ones reek. The winners were
the Maple Leafs' and Flyers' traditional looks, plus the Kings' new
duds. Worst dressed, according to the panel, are the Mighty Ducks,
Coyotes and Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some comments:
</P>
<P>
   On the Kings: ``There's a lot of hubris in this shirt, giving
yourself a coat of arms. . . . It's very elegant, very fashionable,
very regal. . . . It's neutral, guy-girl, and yet it's definitely a
hockey shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Leafs: ``Nothing succeeds like an icon. . . . We know
what it is, we love what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Flyers: ``It's just interesting how the old logos, those
symbols seem to be clearer, more pure.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Ducks: ``It's already dated. It brings me right back to a
movie that's now old. . . . It's bad. Color, logo, the whole thing.
It doesn't reach into posterity. It doesn't give their team any
credibility. . . . I don't like anything cartoony.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Coyotes: ``It looks like a Power Rangers shirt. Far too
cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Sharks: ``Teal is a word from fashion's past we don't
need to revive.
</P>
<P>
   But I mean, are we in Bermuda here?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Canadian civil war: A planned exhibition tournament involving
the Canadian teams has fallen through, and Edmonton general manager
Glen Sather is blaming the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal
Canadiens, prompting a war of words between Sather and Leafs GM Ken
Dryden.
</P>
<P>
   Sather: ``(Dryden) has forgotten about when he was kissing
everybody's butt last year so he could switch (the Leafs from the
Western to Eastern Conference). We supported him and now he has
forgotten that he's still a Canadian.''
</P>
<P>
   Dryden said, ``We have spent more time thinking about this
tournament than Mr. Sather.'' He also accused Sather of missing a
vital conference call on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Sather replied: ``I couldn't stand listening to him for an
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Dryden said, ``Slats . . . is the hero of every story he tells
including this one. . . . Glen Sather is in a world that is about
this big and does not go beyond the boundaries of the skin of Glen
Sather. Everything is his version of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hullabaloo: Brett Hull, known for saying whatever's on his
mind, no matter how senseless, was unhappy about his playing time
after Dallas' recent visit to the Forum, even though he scored a
goal and the Stars defeated the Kings 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no possible way Brett Hull can do anything in 11
minutes,'' Hull said, ominously slipping into the third person.
``There's no flow, there's no feel. You're used to playing so much
all the time that it's a completely different mindset. . . . I
could have had four goals, but my timing was all (fouled) up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really good lesson for Brett Hull,'' Hitchcock said.
``He allowed himself to get going there and you can't do that. It's
unacceptable in this organization. It doesn't matter if it's Hull,
we just don't do it. From the general manager to the coach, we
don't do it. We're a family. If we have a family squabble, it's
behind closed doors. We don't air our laundry in public, period.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that aside from Mike Modano and Jere
Lehtinen, Hull gets more playing time than any Dallas forward.

HUSKIES SURVIVE OPENER AGAINST UNC WILMINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Someone forgot to bring the cupcakes to Edmundson
Pavilion Monday night. The Washington men's basketball team instead
bit into something hard, the North Carolina Wilmington Seahawks.
Luckily, the Huskies were able to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the college game's quaint tradition of opening with a
mismatch or two, the Huskies settled for a serious joust on their
first night out, finally pulling away for a 70-63 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Todd MacCulloch's free throw with 10:38 remaining broke a tie at
42 and put the home club ahead for good. However, the Huskies never
took an easy breath until the final buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   This one had all the trappings of a postseason game, rather than
a baptism. Seeking a football respite and apparently convinced
these weren't the local Seahawks, an enthusiastic crowd of 5,020
showed up, one that included the unemployed Gary Payton. No one
left calling for a Eastern Washington or Jackson State, the usual
first-month fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``(NCAA) selection committees don't care too much about those
games,'' MacCulloch said, referring to blowouts. ``They look at
games like this. ... I'm glad we don't have to play them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. North Carolina Wilmington, an NIT team eight months
earlier and a late addition to the UW schedule, came West because
the Huskies agreed to visit next year, considered a bold step.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we played them is (UW coach) Bob Bender is
one of the few guys who has the courage to play home-and-home,''
Seahawk coach Jerry Wainwright said. ``That's one reason he's going
to make this a top program. He's not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Anxious, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 32 minutes, Bender's Huskies and the Carolinians
were never separated by more than five points. Down the stretch, it
was no more than eight. Highly disciplined and talented, the
Seahawks blanketed MacCulloch effectively and had enough offensive
firepower to sit senior guard Donald Watts for nearly half the game
with foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch led all scorers with 20 points, but was limited to
just six shots from the floor. Everywhere he turned, there was a
Seahawk on his arm. He made up for his field-goal restrictions at
the free-throw line, hitting 14 of 18 attempts. He also had a
game-best 12 rebounds and five blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Husky 7-footer slapped the opening tip over to a teammate,
ran down the floor and took the game's first shot, banking in a
short one. He took just one more field-goal attempt that counted
over the next 19 minutes, hitting another bankshot near the end of
the half. The Seahawks either squeezed him with a zone or let 6-9
reserve Michael Gibbs wrestle with him down low.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little impatient looking for him,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Watts fell into early foul trouble trying to stop Seahawk guard
Stan Simmons, a determined offensive player who led his club with
15 points. The Husky guard drew his second foul 5{ minutes into the
contest, and Bender elected to sit him out the rest of the half.
Watts finished with just three points, nearly 14 under his average
last season, and made the best of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most I ever want it to go,'' Watts said of his
prolonged absence. ``It kind of interrupted my flow offensively.
But in the second half, I did a lot of good things defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   With their top two players carrying different restraints, the
Huskies looked elsewhere for help. Some of it came from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Deon Luton provided 17 points, filling the void left by
Watts. Reserve forward Chris Walcott dropped in all nine of his
points inside the game's final 10 minutes, including a crucial
layin when the Huskies were clinging to a 61-59 advantage. Freshman
point guard Senque Carey had a club-high five assists. And 6-7
reserve forward Greg Clark took the defensive assignment on the
Seahawks' 5-10 Simmons once Watts sat down, and kept up.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies survived a 36 percent shooting effort by committing
only nine turnovers. They passed a tougher-than-normal litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that needs these kind of challenges,'' said
Bender, his club now idle for 11 days. ``This was a good outing for
us all the way around. We weren't perfect, by any means. But if we
were perfect, I would have been worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Said MacCulloch: ``We looked like we knew what we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Only schedule-makers elsewhere would disagree.

WHEN CAN I PLAY?  
 LOCKOUT DELAYS BIBBY'S NBA DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Bibby should be getting ready for his seventh NBA game
Wednesday night, when the Vancouver Grizzlies were scheduled to
play Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, the second player taken in the NBA draft in June, should
be in Vancouver's backcourt, exciting fans with his ball handling,
defense and scoring while learning the nuances of playing point
guard from assistant coach Lionel Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   But the NBA's lockout of its players has put all of that on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bibby was at an Einstein Brothers bagel shop on East
Indian School Road on Monday, supporting the American Cancer
Society's Great American Smokeout. The 22nd smokeout, which
encourages smokers to give up their cigarettes for a day _ maybe
longer _ is Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And other than working out and waiting, Bibby didn't have much
else to do, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping the lockout wouldn't go for long, but I didn't
really know what to expect,'' Bibby said. ``I think the season will
come around quicker than everybody thinks. We've been sitting
around long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bibby could be playing right now.
</P>
<P>
   He left Arizona after only two seasons. Rather than sitting
through a labor dispute, he could have been on the floor with his
former teammates Friday night when they upset Tennessee in their
opener. At least one other early-entry player, Kansas' Paul Pierce,
has suggested that maybe it wasn't such a good idea to leave school
early.
</P>
<P>
   But Bibby said he knew what he was getting into. He was aware
that a lockout was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I made the right decision,'' he said. ``It kind of
hurt to watch Arizona play and not be playing with them. But I did
what needed to be done for my family and for me. And I think it was
the right decision, even though there is a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (former UA teammates) Miles Simon and Michael Dickerson
in Tucson about a month ago, and we didn't even talk about the
lockout much. There's nothing we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other rookies, Bibby can only wait to find out when he'll
be playing and to learn what system the league will have in place
for paying first-year players.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, Bibby would have been locked up by a rookie
salary scale for the first three seasons of his NBA career. Now,
owners are proposing a four-year scale, with players then becoming
restricted free agents, giving teams the right to match offers that
players receive from opposing teams.
</P>
<P>
   All of which Bibby will leave to his agent, David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, he's working on his game and trying to prepare for the
rookie season that ultimately will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work out in the mornings, lift weights, then shoot,'' Bibby
said. ``Then I go play with some of the Suns players at The Village
(Athletic Club). I go back at night and shoot again and get a
little workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm working out three times a day. The longer this takes,
the more I'm ready, I think. I'm working out harder than I ever
have in my life. It's fun. I'm learning stuff from the players at
The Village. They're helping me out a little bit, and I'm in great
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   During the days leading up to the NBA draft, many analysts
predicted that Bibby would be the first pick. He went second after
the Los Angeles Clippers selected center Michael Olowokandi
instead.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bibby is headed beyond the U.S. border to play in
Canada when the lockout ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be all right,'' he said. ``It's a long way from
home, but once I get up there and start playing, it will be fun.
It's a little colder than I'm used to. We were all freezing when we
were up there for the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in June, a balmy time in Vancouver. Bibby can only hope
he gets to experience a winter in British Columbia before this one
is over. &QL;

PRIMROSE PATH TO PLAYOFFS  
 CARDS' SCHEDULE BEST OF CONTENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No team in the NFC wild card playoff race has an easier path
than the Cardinals, who haven't played in the postseason in a
non-strike year since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Cardinals' six remaining opponents _ Washington,
Kansas City, the New York Giants, Philadelphia, New Orleans and San
Diego _ has a winning record. They are a combined 20-40, a .333
winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans, which like the Cardinals is 5-5, has a much tougher
schedule the rest of the season. Five of its six opponents have
winning records, including three division leaders _ Miami, Dallas
and Atlanta. The Saints' remaining six opponents are a combined
40-20, a .667 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (4-6) is the only other team in the wild card hunt and
has a relatively soft schedule remaining. The Buccaneers play two
teams with winning records _ Green Bay and Pittsburgh. Their
remaining six foes are 23-37, a .383 winning percentage. The Bucs
are winless on the road this season, but their remaining road games
are against three of the league's weakest teams: the Bears,
Redskins and Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   As disheartening as last Sunday's 35-28 loss to Dallas was for
the Cardinals, they know it didn't diminish their playoff chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to catch Dallas (in the NFC East), we'd have to pick
up three games with six to go,'' Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said.
``That's highly unlikely, but the playoffs are very much in reach.
We're still in control of our own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are trying not to look beyond Sunday's game at
Washington, but they know this is the best chance they've had to
make the playoffs since moving to the Valley of the Sun in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   If the season were to end today, the Cardinals would be in
because of a better NFC record than the Saints, who are 4-4 in the
conference compared with the Cardinals' 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize the last six games are very big,'' rookie defensive
end Andre Wadsworth said. ``Every game is a step to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't going anywhere if they continue to struggle
in the first halves of games.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't scored in the first quarter for four straight weeks
and haven't had more than seven points at halftime in any of those
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come out with the same intensity we've had in the
second half for the whole game every game,'' linebacker Jamir
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second halves of the past three games, second-year
quarterback Jake Plummer has completed 44 of 66 passes for 606
yards and four touchdowns. He also hasn't been intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way to start faster, even if it means using
the no-huddle early,'' Plummer said. ``We can't come back from big
deficits every game.''
</P>
<P>
   In their past two games, they trailed by 10 and 21 points at
halftime before rallying.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have to forget the disappointment of the Dallas game,
which ended with a controversial non-call in the end zone. Plummer
passed to wide receiver Rob Moore, who had cornerback Kevin Smith
draped over him in what many thought was pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before the Dallas game the next game (at Washington)
was bigger than the Dallas one,'' Plummer said. ``We can be 6-5 and
in the driver's seat for the playoffs. If we still feel sorry for
ourselves from the Dallas game and are not upbeat at practice
Wednesday, it's the worst thing that could happen to us. We have to
forget about that game and move on.'' &QL;

PLAYERS BIDE TIME, FILL NBA VOID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if there were no NBA? What if a disastrous lockout killed
the interest and emptied the arenas? What if the game existed only
in its purest form?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning at The Village health club in Phoenix, an
aerobics class ran laps around the gym, unaware that Rex Chapman
was lighting up Toby Bailey. A woman in a tennis skirt complained
about the lack of parking spots, oblivious to Danny Manning's
feathery jump shot. And on the edge of the court, a little girl
named Madison kept waving to her daddy, impatiently waiting for the
pickup game to end.
</P>
<P>
   When it did, Dan Majerle lifted his daughter to the sky,
planting a kiss on her forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very weird,'' Majerle said. ``I think everybody's
going a little stir crazy. I know I am.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Day 140, and the NBA lockout has entered the red zone. On
Sunday, the first batch of paychecks failed to arrive. The game of
chicken continues.
</P>
<P>
   Do the owners and players understand? Do they know how lucky
they've been? Or how their fan base is beyond the point of caring?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Joe Kleine said. ``We've already lost a lot of
them. It's just kind of crazy what's going on. To me, it makes
absolutely no sense at all. We're flirting with disaster.'' &QL; 
Strange days &QL; 
In the board room of greed, things are getting wacky. Billy Hunter,
the union boss, refuses to call David Stern. Meetings have turned
into screaming matches, so no further meetings are scheduled. And
over the weekend, Jerry Colangelo saw Michael Jordan on the golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo passed over a note. Jordan called Colangelo on his
cell phone. They chatted briefly, two men who might be able to
solve world hunger if they tried. But the line has been drawn, and
they're on opposite sides of this hissing match.
</P>
<P>
   So Game 2 begins. The scoreboard is off and they're calling
their own fouls. Manning is wearing a Kansas T-shirt and showing no
effects of knee surgery. Chapman is making ridiculous shots look
easy. ``This is real strange,'' Chapman said. ``The last 20 years
of my life, I'm playing organized basketball come October. To have
that void is really different. I keep saying I'm optimistic. I just
think that the people making decisions have to realize that this
can't go on. I just have to think that people are smarter than
this.''
</P>
<P>
   How smart do you have to be to divide a billion dollars? How
much is enough? At what point do they realize they're strangling a
game that paved their driveways with gold?
</P>
<P>
   The owners know the league will suffer once Jordan is gone, and
they're bargaining in preparation of declining revenue. The players
don't want to give back what they've negotiated, pointing out the
massive capital gains enjoyed by the owners.
</P>
<P>
   But the losses are mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Based on last year's salaries, Chapman has lost $24,000, Juwan
Howard $800,000, Jordan a whopping $2.8 million. &QL; 
Playing the game &QL; 
The owners are counting on athletes getting a little queasy. The
players are trying hard to stay together. But in the end, it all
gets down to percentage points. Who can live with what, who can
extract the most? Stuff that should take all of an afternoon to get
settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a fan, I'd be turned off by it,'' Chapman said.
``And I am a fan. Not only because it provides me with a great
lifestyle, but because I love the game. So we come here and play.
Not because we're getting in shape or we know something's around
the corner. A lot of us just like to play.''
</P>
<P>
   So they do. After 45 minutes of full-court, five-on-five,
they're ready to quit. Except a 30-footer from Majerle evens the
series at 2, and that's no way to call it a day. So they go once
more.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got to have something to do to kill the day,'' Chapman said.
``It kind of makes you think about life after basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   And a time when basketball wasn't just a revenue stream for the
rich. &QL;

BLACKHAWKS' LOSS IS COYOTES' GAIN  
 WAITE BIDES TIME, THEN TAKES CENTER STAGE IN GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chicago Blackhawks have gone through more goalies in recent
years than fellow Chicagoan Oprah Winfrey has gone through dress
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   They gave up on Dominik Hasek, who would go on to win the Vezina
Trophy four times with Buffalo and become the first goalie in NHL
history to win the Hart Trophy twice as the league's Most Valuable
Player.
</P>
<P>
   They got rid of Eddie Belfour, a former Rookie of the Year who
would capture the Vezina twice, the Jennings Trophy three times,
and now has found a home in Dallas, where the Stars had the
league's best record last season.
</P>
<P>
   They cut loose Chris Terreri, who has a solid 1.67 goals-against
average in New Jersey as Martin Brodeur's backup. On Monday,
Chicago traded Jeff Hackett, who's had a goals-against average of
2.40 or below each of the past four seasons, to Montreal in a
six-player deal.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget, the Blackhawks also let go of a goalie named
Jimmy Waite, who just happens to boast the NHL's best goals-against
average (0.73) and best save percentage (.970) for a team with the
league's best winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the NHL recognized Waite's accomplishments, naming
the Coyotes' No. 2 goalie as the league's Player of the Week.
Making three starts for Phoenix in place of injured Nikolai
Khabibulin, Waite went 2-0-1, allowing only two goals, to help the
Coyotes improve to 8-2-2, their best start in history.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Khabibulin's 1.74 average after eight games, the
Coyotes have the lowest average in the league at 1.40.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first such honor for Waite, who started the week by
stopping 20 of 21 shots during a 1-1 tie with Colorado, made 38
saves in a 2-0 shutout of Pacific Division-leading Dallas, then
completed his run with a 20-save performance in a 4-1 victory over
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to hear I won Player of the Week. I've always
wanted to get it,'' Waite said. ``It was really a fun week for me,
and this is like icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way it could have been better was if one of those games
had been against the Blackhawks, who never really gave him a
chance. Waite was a first-round draft choice in 1987, but after
playing in 20 games and sharing the Jennings Trophy with Belfour in
1992-93, he was traded to San Jose. The Blackhawks reacquired him a
year later, but he appeared in only five games for them over the
next three years. In September 1997, he was claimed by the Coyotes
in the waiver draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know why they brought me back from San Jose,''
Waite said. ``I mean, I was their third goalie. I'll never
understood that move. And I don't think it was fair to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Waite was also scratching his head about Monday's trade of
Hackett. Chicago dealt him, defensemen Eric Weinrich and Alain
Nasreddine to the Canadiens for goalie Jocelyn Thibault and
defensemen Brad Brown and former Coyote Dave Manson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hackett was struggling, but I think they pulled the plug on
him too early,'' said Waite, who becomes an unrestricted free agent
after the season. ``I know Jeff and Jocelyn real well, though, and
I think it could be a good change for both goalies. Getting traded
is never easy, but sometimes, changing teams is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Waite should know. He graciously accepts his role in Phoenix as
Khabibulin's understudy, but Coach Jim Schoenfeld will be calling
his number more often this season in an effort to keep Khabibulin
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Waite made only 10 starts last season, while posting a 5-6-1
record and 2.12 goals-against average. He already has four starts
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think these last three games really change anything,''
Waite said. ``I mean, I still think the team had faith in me before
those games. Before the season, they even told me to be ready
because they don't want Nik to play in 70 games again.''
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin has been cleared to play after recovering from a
bruised right hand, but it's too early to tell who will start
Wednesday night against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have Khabby back, but at the same time, it was
nice to get a chance to step in and play a few games,'' Waite said.
``We're both playing well, and things are going good for the whole
team. I'll tell you, it's fun being a Phoenix Coyote right now.'' &QL;

COLANGELO: NO MEETING WITH JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A chance meeting at Phoenix Country Club between Suns President
Jerry Colangelo and NBA star Michael Jordan almost created hope for
an end to the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out there isn't much reason to get excited.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is in the Valley playing golf and vacationing, and he
passed Colangelo's home adjacent to a Phoenix Country Club fairway
Saturday morning. Colangelo asked Jordan whether he wanted to get
together for lunch or dinner and discuss the labor situation.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute already has led to the cancellation of at least six
weeks of the regular season, and there doesn't appear to be much
optimism from owners or the players union for a quick settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And there won't be a meeting between Jordan and Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said Monday that his conversation with Jordan was only
about the possibility of a meeting, which now will not take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't meet, and we're not going to meet,'' Colangelo said.
``He's vacationing and playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Michael socially, and I saw him go by at Phoenix
Country Club. I thought we might get together and have a cup of
coffee or something and talk about this. But the timing isn't going
to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all that didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 days ago, NBA Commissioner David Stern cleared team
representatives to talk with players about the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo is a member of the league's Labor Committee and is
involved in negotiations. Jordan, who is represented by agent David
Falk, is not a union officer but has become a voice among players.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo indicated that the league has changed its policy about
allowing team representatives to talk to players.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things were said last week, but we're (the league)
going to shut it down now,'' Colangelo said. ``We won't be
communicating with the players anymore, and we won't be able to say
much about the negotiations. I'm at the stage where there isn't
much more I can say.'' &QL;

STOTTLEMYRE LATEST TARGET IN PURSUIT OF PITCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The parade of premium free agent talent continues today when
right-hander Todd Stottlemyre visits with Diamondbacks officials at
Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's somebody we're definitely interested in,'' General
Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ``Even though he's been in our
ballpark (with St. Louis before his trade to Texas), it's always
good to have him come in to see a side he might not have seen and
to become better acquainted with the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola said Stottlemyre has many similarities to right-hander
Andy Benes, a former teammate in St. Louis who signed as a free
agent with Arizona on Feb. 3 and went on to win an expansion-record
14 games in the team's first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have two guys of that caliber would be great,'' Garagiola
said. ``Todd is a competitor. I remember after his trade to Texas,
he pitched with a rib injury and said very little about it. He just
went out and pitched. He's a gamer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who finished 14-13 last season and has a career
record of 123-110, will be accompanied by his agent, Tony
Attanasio.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stottlemyre has offers from six teams, including one
from Detroit for four years at $28 million, he wanted to come to
the Valley, Attanasio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only visit he will make,'' Attanasio said. ``His
interest is piqued because their interest is piqued. Visit is an
overused word. It's good to meet people you don't know, especially
the owner (Jerry Colangelo) and manager (Buck Showalter).''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre knows all about Arizona's interest in left-hander
Randy Johnson, but Attanasio said, ``That doesn't faze us one way
or the other. If it's to be, that's great, or if it's not to be . .
. that line's been used before. If the right deal is there, he'll
take it. He doesn't necessarily have to wait to see what Randy or
Kevin Brown do.'' &QL; 
Japanese pitcher here? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola said Monday that the Diamondbacks have made a contract
offer to Japanese pitcher Misao Kida, a 30-year-old right-hander
who likely would be a middle reliever and occasional closer.
</P>
<P>
   A nine-year veteran, Kida spent most of his career with the
Yomiuri Giants of the Central League before pitching last season
with the Orix Blue Wave of the Pacific League. Kida, who began the
season as a starter but then came on to record 16 saves and a 1.29
ERA, has had offers from four or five other major league teams.
Detroit General Manager Randy Smith flew to Japan to make Kida an
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Marshall, Diamondbacks director of Pacific Rim operations,
said he saw Kida pitch twice, most recently in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a fastball that goes as high as 90 mph, has good
location with it, and a good forkball,'' Marshall said. ``Can he
pitch at our major league level? I believe he can.'' &QL; 
Move to Missoula &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' affiliate in the short-season rookie Pioneer
League is being moved from Lethbridge, Alberta, to Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   The move was announced Monday. Missoula officials generated
funding for a stadium that will open in 2000. The team will share
an American Legion field in 1999. Joe Almaraz, who managed
Lethbridge in 1998, will return as manager.
</P>
<P>
   Apathy on the part of fans in the Lethbridge area was a factor,
as was the monetary exchange rate between the United States and
Canada. The Diamondbacks also faced tariff charges for equipment
and supplies, so the move to Missoula will be more cost-effective
and easier on travel, Garagiola said. &QL; 
Short stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sources in New York indicate the Yankees' chances are fading in
their attempt to re-sign center fielder Bernie Williams, who is
among the players being courted by the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees GM Brian Cashman visited free agent outfielder Albert
Belle at Belle's Tucson home Monday. The Yankees also will be
visited by free agent outfielder Brian Jordan on Wednesday. Boston
also has shown interest in Williams and Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent right-hander Armando Reynoso is scheduled to be
examined by Arizona's medical staff this week. Reynoso has had
elbow and shoulder surgeries in the past few seasons. If given
medical clearance, a contract offer will be the next step. &QL;

DALLAS `SPY' UNABLE TO CORRAL PLUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opposing teams are beginning to worry so much about Cardinals
quarterback Jake Plummer's scrambling and running ability, they are
putting a ``spy'' on him.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys shadowed Plummer with linebacker Dexter
Coakley and defensive end Kavika Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer rushed for only 6 yards on three carries but threw for
465 yards, the third-most in team history, in the 35-28 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope teams keep doing that,'' Plummer said Monday. ``If they
are dropping a defensive lineman to spy on me, it takes one pass
rusher away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like Dexter Coakley spying on me, I don't think I could
get away from him and make him miss me. But a defensive lineman, I
think I can get around him or throw to a tight end behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said teams aren't using a spy on him because of his
speed in the 40-yard dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 4.9 (seconds), maybe,'' Plummer said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Making history &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's 465 yards passing were the most in the NFL this season
and the most in the league since the Cardinals' Boomer Esiason
threw for 522 at Washington in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's performance left FOX analyst John Madden, former head
coach of the Oakland Raiders, gushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the feeling that Plummer is playing like he's just
playing in the park,'' Madden said during Sunday's broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of guys who have to have their feet set to
throw. This guy can have his feet in any position to throw the
football. This guy leads, is a competitor and plays the game the
way a quarterback is supposed to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer appreciates Madden's compliments but is not sure they
are deserving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he also drew some diagrams of my legs and said how
skinny I was,'' Plummer said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No excuses &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Frank Sanders won't remember his career-high 190
receiving yards as much as his fumble and two dropped passes,
including one in the end zone in the final nine seconds.
</P>
<P>
   His fumble on a reverse set up Dallas' second score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just dropped it,'' he said. ``I mishandled the ball. I think
the coaches have a lot of confidence in the players, but they might
be hesitant (to call) it again.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sore spots &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backup offensive lineman Matt Joyce is expected to have surgery
today on the broken bone in his right hand. A plate will be put in
the hand.
</P>
<P>
   He could be out two to three weeks, but a final determination
will not be made until after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can play in a cast, I will,'' Joyce said.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce is the team's top reserve at tackle and guard.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Daniels will be the backup at both guard spots. Allen
DeGraffenreid, a second-year pro who has spent most of this season
at guard and center, also will work at the tackle spot this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals could promote tackle Jon Clark from the practice
squad to add depth there. They had hoped for rookie tackle Anthony
Clement to return to practice this week, but he suffered a setback
late last week when he tried to run.
</P>
<P>
   Clement has been out since undergoing back surgery in early
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I might have to have to accept the fact I might not play
this year,'' Clement said.

CHRISTOPHER REEVE: MAN OF ACTION ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Christopher Reeve and
Daryl Hannah in ``Rear Window.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For the first time since the horseriding accident in l995 that
left him paralyzed and unable to walk, Christopher Reeve is back in
the starring spot in a movie- ABC's ``Rear Window,'' airing Nov.
22.
 &HT;    In this remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic l954 thriller,
Reeve plays architect Jason Kemp who has been left a quadriplegic
after a catastrophic car crash. He shares the spotlight with
gorgeous Daryl Hannah, (reprising the role made famous by Grace
Kelly) as a man who, though confined to his room, witnesses what he
believes is a brutal murder.
 &HT;    Last year Reeve went behind the camera to direct the HBO movie
``In the Gloaming,'' a gem that brought him an Emmy nomination for
best director.
 &HT;    In the l997 TV film, ``Snakes and Ladders,'' he played a small
role as a quadriplegic who becomes a mentor to young man paralyzed
in a diving accident.
 &HT;    But this time he's back as the star, above the title, the
position he occupied before a balking horse changed his life
forever. Reeve was Superman on and off screen. The man who could
leap tall buildings in a single bound was in real life a real man
of action, flying gliders as well as jets, sky diving, sailing and
skiing, until, in the cruelest of ironies, he fell during a
relatively simple horse show, breaking the top two vertebrae of his
spinal column.
 &HT;    His courage has been challenged as never before. And ``Rear
Window,'' he says, allowed him to incorporate into the character
many of the terrifying things he himself has experienced. ``I
wanted to do this film because many times disabled people are shown
in a somewhat pathetic light or they're bitter or angry,'' he
explains. ``But this character is really more positive _ a
resourceful man who has been through the ringer. This movie shows
how far someone can come in reclaiming his life.''
 &HT;    Speaking from his home amid the woods of Bedford, N.Y., Reeve
has made incredible progress since the accident. Many thought he
wouldn't live out the year let alone have a career.
 &HT;    Now as an actor he has a unique opportunity to show an audience
at least a small part of what being a quadriplegic really entails.
For him this is not just acting.
 &HT;    ``Jason's experiences are very close to mine,'' he says. ``For
example, he experiences a 'pop off.' This means that some part of
the hose he depends on for breathing becomes separated from the
vent, or a hole develops in the hose. That's happened to me a
number of times. I stopped getting air and had absolutely no
breath.
 &HT;    ``And when we did that scene in the movie we did it for real.
The poor actor playing the nurse was terrified, but I told her it
was perfectly safe. There were actually nurses around and others
who could reconnect the vent in a second. I can also breathe off
the vent for short periods of time, so there was no real danger.
But when you see the pop-off on the screen, it's real. I'm actually
not breathing.''
 &HT;    It certainly takes Hitchcock's concept of the thriller a step
beyond. ``I think audiences will see what it's really like to go
through some of these very anxious moments,'' says Reeve. ``They
will see how those moments can be lonely and frustrating when
someone is just learning to cope with the situation.''
 &HT;    In the original film James Stewart played a photographer who was
sidelined with a broken leg. ``Our movie updates the story. The
idea is to raise the stakes,'' says Reeve. ``To do the same story
but with a ... quadriplegic puts the lead character in so much more
jeopardy. We wanted to create something exciting that forges new
ground.''
 &HT;    Hannah says Reeve was a joy to work with. ``He has a sparkle in
his eye that is sort of hypnotic and it kind of shoots out across
the room and tantalizes and hypnotizes you. He's got so much energy
and life it's just intoxicating.''
 &HT;    In his own life of course, Reeve has become a hero to millions
around the world since his accident. Besides directing, he has
narrated the film ``Without Pity,'' a plea for the disabled to
enjoy more rights in society. He's also penned a best-selling
autobiography, ``Still Me,'' which has helped ease his huge medical
bills.
 &HT;    In between he crisscrosses the country campaigning for a
national spinal cord registry and other legislation to help further
rights for the handicapped. His 37 year old wife Dana, (``my
rock'') is now rehearsing for a Broadway show, ``More to Love,''
and their son Will, 6, is at school. He also sees a lot of his
children from a previous relationship, Matthew l8, and Alexandra
15.
 &HT;    Reeve says of his wife: ``We're very much in love. Whether I
have zero recovery or full recovery our relationship will
survive.''
 &HT;    Progress, he says, is slow but perceptible. When he turned 43,
just four months after the accident, he couldn't blow out his
candles. Now when they wheeled in a cake for his 46th birthday he
proudly blew out the lot.
 &HT;    Through practice, he can now breathe without the ventilator for
up to 30 minutes a day. He exercises for three hours daily and is
now able to sneeze _ something he couldn't do a couple of years
ago.
 &HT;    But he still loses his cool when people, some of them doctors,
describe his quest as futile. And he insists he doesn't worry about
his medical insurance running out. ``By that time,'' he says,
``I'll be up and walking.''

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 17. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times leads with more tough words from the U.S.
about Iraq, but the Los Angeles Times is the only other paper to
front the Iraq story at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post's top national story analyzes the stock
market's resurgence. USA Today goes with the Supreme Court's
decision not to consider two campaign finance reform cases. And the
LAT leads with an analysis of the $206 billion proposed settlement
between the states and tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT lead says that the U.S. and Britain are highly skeptical
of Saddam Hussein's compliance and that ``there was an unusually
strong consensus Monday that American and British bombing was
almost inevitable.'' The real test, says the Times, should come in
a few weeks when surprise weapons inspections begin. British Prime
Minister Tony Blair echoed the Clinton Administration's strongly
worded sentiments; next time, Blair said, there will be ``no
warnings, no wrangling, no negotiations, no last-minute letters.''
American and British forces could be deployed within hours of any
decision to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Other stories from the NYT's Iraq package report that 1)
President Clinton's decision to terminate the Iraq strike came just
15 minutes before the missiles were to launch; and 2) The French
are miffed at Sen. John McCain for insinuating that France tipped
Saddam Hussein off to the imminent attack. McCain remarked of the
attack plan, ``We had to inform our allies, including the French.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAT tobacco suit story notes that if the case is settled,
``the industry got off relatively cheaply in strict financial
terms.'' Smokers themselves, rather than the industry, will
essentially shoulder the $206 billion cost through
35-cents-per-pack price increases; the LAT says that this is not
enough to seriously dampen consumption. Health advocates have
already criticized the settlement as too lax, but the state
attorneys general are eager to settle and get the money. For the
settlement to take effect, states representing 80 percent of the
nation's Medicare patients must sign by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The USAT lead, tucked inside elsewhere, says that the Supreme
Court elected not to hear cases from Ohio and Arkansas about
campaign finance reform. USAT emphasizes that prospects for
spending reform by the 2000 elections now seem remote, as Congress
is generally disinclined to pass the necessary legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The WP off-lead about the soaring stock market is buoyed by
Tuesday's figures, when the Dow finished above 9000 for the first
time since July _ 18 percent higher than it was Oct. 1. Factors in
the market rise, says the Post, include interest rate cuts, high
corporate earnings, and the waning prospect of Clinton's
impeachment. However, doubts linger as to whether the market can
maintain its course in the face of the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal fronts a terrific story on the Fed's
arduous decision-making process. The Fed's announcements and hints
on forthcoming interest rate moves are pegged to a delicate PR
dance; one ill-timed or misunderstood word can flip markets. The
WSJ paints Alan Greenspan as a highly autonomous operator; he
``makes major policy changes only at FOMC meetings _ partly so the
Fed doesn't look like the one-man show it often is.'' Another Fed
decision on interest rate cuts is coming today.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky has signed a book deal with St. Martin's Press,
a story fronted everywhere but the WP (which gives it to ``Style'')
and the LAT. The book (working title: ``Monica's Story'') will be
ghostwritten by Andrew Morton, the author of a best-selling
Princess Diana book. It could come out as early as February, says
the WP. All papers note that Monica's author fee is unexpectedly
modest--the NYT says it's just $600,000 plus bestseller bonuses.
For free, Monica also has agreed to a television interview with
Barbara Walters of ABC. A date has not been set, as Lewinsky is
still ironing out with Kenneth Starr's office the legal nuances of
a media appearance, but the NYT guesses February. The WP says that
Lewinsky may haul in a seven-figure sum for a separate TV deal to
be broadcast outside the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   From the Slate self-reference corner: A NYT ``Business'' piece
analyzes Slate's Microsoft trial coverage, saying that irreverent
descriptions of jowly Microsoft lawyers by Slate's inaugural
courtroom correspondent, Michael Lewis, ``seemed mightily
unfettered by Microsoft.'' ``Today's Papers,'' who also edits
Slate's ``Email to the Editor,'' recommends the piece to the
legions of you out there who sent in comments about the trial
coverage.

 &HT;    dWhere The Misfits Fit
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In a big old house on a small downtown
street live 10 retarded people _ and one who isn't.
</P>
<P>
   This beige stucco home, built in 1914, stands on a green and
leafy block. There's a tall Norfolk pine in the front yard and a
bronze plaque by the front door.
</P>
<P>
   The Eleanor Trachtenberg Residence _ 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Trachtenberg doesn't live here, but she's raised a lot
of money for the very special family that does.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone calls it ``E.T. House'' for short, even the state
Department of Children and Families, which licensed it, and the
local Association for Retarded Citizens, which owns it.
</P>
<P>
   The retarded people who live in E.T. House are called Charlene,
Sharon, Cheryl, Wendy, Daniel, Harold, Eddie, Robert, David and
David.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The one who's not retarded is called Sheryl Bargerstock _ with a
hard g, as in ``caregiver'' _ and for almost seven years now, she's
cared for all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I still catch myself expecting them to react as
someone their age would,'' she says. ``They're really between 28
and about 50, but mentally they range from about 7 to a rebellious
teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 a.m., Bargerstock helps them get up and off to work, and
when they come back in the afternoon, she has to be there to
welcome them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have these nightmares where I've gone somewhere, and all of
a sudden I look at my watch and notice it's almost 3 o'clock and
everyone's going to be coming home soon and I'm not there to let
them in,'' she says. ``And in the dream, I'm running and running to
get home before they do.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, about 3 o'clock, the doorbell chimes her awake, and
she comes downstairs and starts letting them in.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Bargerstock shares a house with 10 other adults. But
she's the only one who has a key.
</P>
<P>
   The Spec Tran ambulette pulls to a stop at the curb and the
driver, a young black woman with a warm smile, hurries around to
pull back the wide side door.
</P>
<P>
   The corrugated steel platform that usually raises and lowers
wheelchairs on and off the van slides out with a grinding hum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Robert, you're home!'' she calls, peering into the
shadowy van. And then she waits. And waits.
</P>
<P>
   And waits.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a tiny boy holding an Igloo Little Lunchmate cooler
toddles unsteadily onto the platform. The driver takes his free
hand and the platform lowers him to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   This little tyke is the most adorable child you have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   He's 4 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs just under 100 pounds. His
feet are so tiny he wears size 3 Spalding sneakers. He's so short
he wears size 18 jeans. His glasses are so big on his little face
they have to be tied to his head with a black elastic band whose
oversized bow dangles down the back of his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my God, that's stubble on his chin!
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else at E.T. House takes the city bus to their various
jobs and schools, but Robert Giordano _ 32 going on 7 _ has to be
driven to and from the Adult Skills Acquisitions Program at Palm
Beach Habilitation Center. Someone has to dress and shave him and
urge him to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slowest person on the planet,'' one of the former
residents calls him.
</P>
<P>
   When Robert stands in the shower, Sheryl Bargerstock must prompt
his every move.
</P>
<P>
   Wash your arm, Robert. Wash your foot, Robert. Wash your
privates, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven forbid you just put him on the toilet and forget about
him,'' Bargerstock says, ``because he'd sit there till the cows
come home!''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone who ever meets Robert could ever forget him.
</P>
<P>
   In this big house full of slow people, he is the slowest _ a
misfit among misfits _ and the smallest.
</P>
<P>
   He came to E.T. House as an emergency placement. Normally, ARC
wouldn't put a client so slow with moderately retarded housemates.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert has found his own role. In a house where all the
residents help each other, they all help Robert. They are Sheryl
Bargerstock's surrogate children, and he is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   He is everyone's baby brother.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Worry, Be Happy!
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Sheryl?''
</P>
<P>
   If the Association for Retarded Citizens were given a dollar
every time someone in E.T. House says, ``Hey, Sheryl,''
Bargerstock's annual house budget of $123,000 would be guaranteed
in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   By 4:30 p.m., the doorbell has chimed several times, and the
house, so peaceful two hours ago, is a frantic racket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Sheryl, did you get waffles?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Sheryl, where's my journal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Sheryl, you know what?''
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, Daniel Perkins, 32, is counting his daily
performance reports from the local ARC training center.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred and forty-eight excellents,'' he tells the walls
with a proud and nasally lisp.
</P>
<P>
   In the bedroom, Wendy Tenzer is painting her chipped and bitten
nails bright red.
</P>
<P>
   On the sun porch couch, Harold Leifer, who can't read, is
reading The Palm Beach Post.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, little Cheryl Garnett is washing the lettuce
while Eddie Pointe Jr. chops onions.
</P>
<P>
   And, in her usual spot on the west end of the blue-and-white
living room sofa, Charlene Believe, 30, sits alone, almost regal
among the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In every family, one person is always the worrier.
</P>
<P>
   After she's taken her after-work shower and put on her bright
pink housecoat and thick purple socks, Charlene always sits in the
same spot on the sofa. Left leg crossed primly over her right,
long, skinny arms folded protectively across her flat chest, she
stares at the flashing TV screen, swings her purple sock, and
worries.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene has worked in the stockroom at T.J. Maxx for nine
years, unpacking clothes and hanging them up for display. Back when
that Bobby McFerrin song, Don't Worry, Be Happy, used to float out
of the Muzak speakers, everyone always said that was her song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, be happy!'' she chirped all day. But sometimes it
seems like only worrying makes Charlene happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Sheryl,'' she calls, when Bargerstock passes her sofa,
``we're going to talk about my P&AMP;P, right?''
</P>
<P>
   People &AMP; Places is a Buffalo, N.Y., company that sponsors
chaperoned vacations for small groups of retarded people. Cheryl's
gone to Graceland on a P&AMP;P. In 1988, Eddie went to Hawaii and
brought home a black thong bikini. His folks let him wear it once
and threw it away.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Charlene visited Branson, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was worried about this hurricane that was out in the Gulf
somewhere at the time,'' remembers her job coach, Jim Owens. ``She
was sure it was going to head straight to Branson, Mo., and spoil
her vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Charlene and her roommate, Sharon Vaughn, have
decided to visit Disneyland on a P&AMP;P Southern California tour.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene has already started worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Sheryl, you're going to send off my application tomorrow,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Charlene, I'll send your application.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Sheryl. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes flicker back to the TV screen, and then she frowns. Her
purple sock stops swinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Sheryl?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it now, Charlene?'' Bargerstock sighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't forget, right?''
</P>
<P>
   He loves Lucy
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Robert came to E.T. House because of a broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1994, his mother tripped on a root in the front yard of
their Boynton Beach home. She was 71.
</P>
<P>
   I'm old, Maria Giordano thought. Maybe God is giving me a sign.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Robert moved to E.T. House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he was going on vacation, like a school trip,'' she
says in a rich Sicilian accent. ``Stay a few days, see if you like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in Robert's old bedroom, she proudly points out the
ribbons and trophies from the Special Olympics, the crucifix on the
wall above his bed, the rosary dangling from the bedpost and the I
Love Lucy collectible doll on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he used to watch Lucy every day,'' she remembers, smiling.
``Every day! If you talked to him then, he wouldn't answer. He was
talking to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, when he was born, the doctor said ``Down
syndrome.'' In Lingua, the little Sicilian town she left in 1960,
no one knew of such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw nothing different when he was born,'' she shrugs. ``He
smiled to everybody, he sang, he talked.''
</P>
<P>
   Flipping through the 1986 Boca Raton High School yearbook, she
finds his graduation picture. His face smiles off the page, lined
up among his classmates, with nothing to show he attended special
education classes and learned only daily living skills. ``He's
quieter now.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert's father, Frank, is 67, and takes Lithium to control his
manic-depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mood swings made Robert very nervous,'' his mother
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on July 5, 1994, Robert moved to E.T. House, just to see
if he'd like it. ``He never complained,'' she says. ``He never said
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now his parents visit most every Sunday, or he comes home to
visit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if tomorrow something happens to me,'' his mother says,
``I go in peace because I know my son is in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Motherhood
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd do this a couple of years and move on,''
Bargerstock says.
</P>
<P>
   For $21,000 a year, she is her housemates' mother and father,
their therapist and their travel agent, their accountant and their
cook. At 33, she is a big sister to men and women 15 years older
than she, a playmate to children with body hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' she says, ``you get so drained you forget you're
a woman or a man. You're a thing, and everyone needs you.''
</P>
<P>
   During the daytime, E.T. House is strangely quiet, and
Bargerstock's time is her own. Some days she writes grocery lists.
Twenty loaves of bread a month. Fifty cans of Coke a week. Three
rolls of toilet paper a day. Ten Publix birthday cakes a year.
After a while, you learn how to feed 11 people on $175 a week. And
some days she writes poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Some days she wonders if she'll ever go back to Total Hair &AMP;
Nails Of Lake Worth, Fla. and become a certified nail technician.
And some days she goes back to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, where the six men share three bedrooms, she has a
large private room that opens onto a long sleeping porch with a
canopied bed. Close the door and she has a kind of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking, `What am I going to do when I grow up?' ``
she goes on, leaning back in the sun porch chair and crossing her
ankles on the desk. ``But then I wonder, `What would I do with my
time if I did something else?' I mean, I grew up with the
Association for Retarded Citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Her younger sister is profoundly retarded. Compared to her,
Robert's fast. She can't walk, can't talk, can't dress herself. She
lives in a group home.
</P>
<P>
   Bargerstock was 9 when her sister was born. As an 11-year-old,
she started volunteering at ARC camp. At 20, she was teaching an
ARC preschool class. There were other jobs _ in a laundromat, a
skating rink snack bar _ but one way or another, it seems, she has
always worked with retarded people.
</P>
<P>
   When her marriage broke up in 1991 and the job at E.T. House
opened about the same time, she took it. Suddenly, the mother of a
boy who is now 10 became the mother of 10 men and women. Her son,
Brent, had stayed with his father, who was awarded custody and
child support.
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed social workers had concluded the boy should
remain with his father. Sheryl Bargerstock believes the judge was
prejudiced against having a young child live with a house full of
retarded people. But nothing in the court record says so.
</P>
<P>
   Today, father and son live outside Pittsburgh. Mother and son
exchange visits several times a year, and when he visits, Brent
fits in easily, the 11th child at E.T. House.
</P>
<P>
   In a family this big, one more mouth to feed _ or listen to _ is
easily accommodated. Bargerstock is supposed to have every other
weekend off, but what's that mean when you live where you work?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never really alone here,'' she says, ``but I love
taking care of these guys. I've had an opportunity to move back to
my old job at ARC, teaching pre-school, and I cried for a month. I
couldn't do it. They're my family.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harold had ankle surgery, she took no days off for six
weeks. In seven years, she's had three dates. If the substitute
cancels, her weekend off is on again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can get to a point where you don't think you're
making a difference,'' she confesses. ``You feel like a
stay-at-home mom, and I don't like being stagnant.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bargerstock enrolled in what was supposed to be a
three-month course to become a nail technician. Almost a year
later, she still needs 36 class hours to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I think I'm afraid that if I finish, I'll actually
have something else I could do and someday I might say, `OK, I'm
through here' and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So instead,'' she says with a laugh, ``I go to Key West and
get loose!''
</P>
<P>
   On the desk calendar, along with all her housemates' scribbled
birthdays and doctors' appointments, there is a week marked
``Vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I hate about going on vacation is that it's not
just me. I have to make sure there's enough food, and write menus
on everybody, and notes for the sub, and see all their allowances
are ready to be handed out and ...''
</P>
<P>
   `I love you, Ellie!'
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, March 14, a white Ford Club Wagon pulled to
a stop under the porte-cochere at The Fountains at Palm Beach
country club in suburban Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The doorman stepped forward, pulled back the sliding side door
and the residents of E.T. House scrambled out.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Robert, of course.
</P>
<P>
   For Robert, a small, green plastic stool was placed on the
ground. Eddie, his roommate, held one hand, little Cheryl took the
other, and Robert climbed slowly down while the doorman stood more
or less at attention.
</P>
<P>
   As the passersby were sneaking peeks at this unusual gaggle, a
silver-haired woman in a pink pantsuit waited by the lobby doors
with a welcoming smile.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as they saw her, the E.T. gang surged forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi again, Ellie!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Ellie!
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Ellie!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Ellie, you know what?!''
</P>
<P>
   In hugs and kisses, she gave as good as she got.
</P>
<P>
   Every year on the Saturday nearest her birthday, Eleanor
Trachtenberg, 83, hosts a luncheon for all the people who live in
the house that bears her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason to be involved with the retarded,'' she says
with a laugh, ``and I've been involved almost 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, a neighbor at The Fountains, another former Bostonian
named Anne Swerling who had taught the retarded before retiring,
invited her to accompany an ARC group to see the Ice Follies at the
West Palm Beach Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was so enthralled,'' she remembers. ``Not by the ice
show, but watching the clients. I was so entranced by how I
couldn't really tell their ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, The Friends of Retarded was born, with
Trachtenberg, Swerling and a couple of other women the only
members. For the next eight years, Trachtenberg was president of
the small but persistent group. Eventually, Rose Kennedy spoke at
their fund-raisers, and by 1985, when the big beige house opened
its doors, the ARC had decided Ellie Trachtenberg's name should be
on it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 650 Friends. Trachtenberg's scrapbook is thick
with clippings and pictures, and her annual luncheon has become a
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone else was eating, she moved from table to table,
chatting with each of the E.T. gang, hugging, kissing and holding
hands, encouraging their dreams and soothing their disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Eddie Pointe Jr. had a Reuben and cole slaw. Sharon
Vaughn had chicken salad, and Harold Leifer chose a Philly cheese
steak. Finally, everyone had frozen yogurt for dessert, except
Ellie Trachtenberg, who got another helping of hugs and kisses.
</P>
<P>
   On the way home, the big Club Wagon stopped at a red light on
the corner of Palm Beach Lakes and Okeechobee boulevards, right
beside another van, which was full of giggling girls.
</P>
<P>
   When the girls looked over and saw all these weird-looking
retarded people sitting politely beside them, they started to
giggle even louder, and wave and point and make faces out the
windows.
</P>
<P>
   When Eddie Pointe Jr. saw the van full of girls pointing and
laughing at him, his big smile froze.
</P>
<P>
   He stared straight ahead and pretended he hadn't seen them.
</P>
<P>
   The pancake breakfast
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Pointe Jr., 40, loves pancakes and waffles almost as much
as he loves hugging.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' Cheryl Garnett said once. ``People tell me I
should mind my own business and not worry about everybody else,
b-b-but-.'' She cocked her head, and her blue eyes rolled far, far
to the side, the way they do when she's thinking hard, and suddenly
the words bubbled forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not normal to eat four waffles!''
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday morning, the E.T. gang were guests at the West Palm
Beach Rotary Club's annual pancake breakfast. They sat at long
tables in the parish hall of Holy Trinity Episcopal Church and
shared a meal with the Rotarians and Episcopalians and homeless
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be polite,'' Bargerstock warned them in the parking lot. ``Say
thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie ate so many pancakes with syrup that morning he couldn't
resist getting right up and marching over to give Sheryl
Bargerstock a big thank-you hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I LOVE YOU, SHERYL!''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Down syndrome, Eddie was born with unusually small
ear canals, so his voice never sounds as loud to him as it does to
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Eddie!'' Bargerstock snapped at his open arms. ``I don't
want to hug you now!''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie was so hurt he couldn't eat any more pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't understand,'' Bargerstock whispered when Eddie was
too far away to hear. ``If I let him hug me, he thinks he can hug
everyone, and he's had some problems with that. We're trying to
teach him it's inappropriate hugging.''
</P>
<P>
   In E.T. House, ``inappropriate'' is a common word. Dating anyone
you live with, for example, is inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the only embarrassing moment. Everyone said thank
you, and everything went smoothly, except when Harold poured
himself a big cup of maple syrup instead of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   And then, 10 days later, Eddie's boss at Publix would call
Bargerstock.
</P>
<P>
   A female customer had complained that Eddie Pointe Jr. touched
her inappropriately in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Sex!
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex,'' says Frank Ciaramella, an ARC behavioral analyst, ``is
not a function of intellect.''
</P>
<P>
   In all ARC group homes, residents are forbidden from dating each
other, and so they date friends from their jobs or schools. But
``date'' may be a misleading term. They hold hands, go to dances,
have their pictures taken together, exchange birthday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as sure as I can be that no one's having sex in this
house,'' Bargerstock says. ``But legally, they're competent adults.
If they want to have sex, they can have sex. If they don't know
about birth control, it's my job to instruct them.''
</P>
<P>
   David Crook has had sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met her at the Hab Center,'' he remembers. He was 20, she
was 37, and they rented a motel room down on Dixie Highway. He
can't recall her name.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was another Hab Center client. They went to her
mother's house several times, when her mother wasn't home. Yes, he
says, they used condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Even tiny Robert has a sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his bedroom after a shower, he has discovered that
sometimes lying on your stomach feels better than lying on your
back, says his visiting aide, Susanna Kuhns. She closes the door
and leaves him alone.
</P>
<P>
   What the residents do by themselves is their own business. What
they do with each other isn't.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Bargerstock returned from vacation, Cheryl Garnett
asked to speak with her alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``While you were gone,'' little Cheryl said, ``Daniel offered me
a dollar to take down my pants.''
</P>
<P>
   When Daniel Perkins got home that evening, Bargerstock called a
private meeting. She sat at the end of the big dining table, with
Daniel on one side and Cheryl on the other, and asked him if
Cheryl's report were true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just kidding,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Bargerstock didn't believe him, but she wasn't outraged, either.
They're kids, after all, she told herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you don't kid about things like that. It's called sexual
harassment, and you can get arrested for it,'' she warned him
sternly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what the president's in trouble for right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A house with a history
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when sex and crime have come into E.T. House, the
residents have been the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1991 _ the oldest records available _ police have
been called to the address exactly 50 times, but almost always for
false burglar alarms, a few times when David Crook ran away.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, the alarm was real. Someone had broken in through
the kitchen window and burgled the house. Along with the VCRs and
boom boxes, Eddie's school ring was stolen, and Robert's crucifix
necklace.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest crimes against the residents of E.T. House have
come from within.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the house parents were Janet and Steve Lord,
who pleased almost everyone for nearly five years with their
dedication, discipline and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   When Eddie Pointe Jr. kept forgetting to look both ways before
crossing Dixie Highway, the Lords packed a black plastic garbage
bag with his lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``WHAT'S THIS?'' Eddie asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Steve Lord told him nonchalantly, ``when you get
squashed by a car, that's to put all the pieces in so we can send
them back to your parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie still looks both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1991, the Lords left voluntarily for other social
service jobs. They were replaced by another married couple, who
lasted about three months. No one likes to talk about them _
especially Danny Perkins and David Crook.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Nov. 7, 1991, police were called to E.T. House by
Jeanne Penney, ARC's director of residential services, after Crook
confided in her.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, the man had allegedly shown
pornographic videos to four of the male residents and encouraged
them to join him in masturbating.
</P>
<P>
   He left the same day.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement was a young man who arrived with glowing
references, stayed two weeks and disappeared without any notice _
taking with him about $1,200 in the residents' pay and Social
Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   And then Sheryl Bargerstock came to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Allowance day
</P>
<P>
   Each Friday evening, she distributes their $15 allowances, and
each Saturday morning they take the bus to Palm Beach Mall and
spend them.
</P>
<P>
   Marching through the Food Court, Eddie leads the way with a
splay-footed strut, stomach thrust forward as proudly, loudly, he
calls out the names of the stores and restaurants they pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``ARTHUR TREACHER!'' he shouts, like a train conductor
announcing stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``CHICK-FIL-A!'' he calls, and mouths stop chewing. Forks freeze
in mid-air and lowered eyes follow their parade.
</P>
<P>
   But no one laughs, no one smirks, no one makes fun.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the harried clerk discovers she's more patient than
she thought. Passing shoppers who have worked hard at not making
eye contact with anyone smile sweetly at the E.T. gang, as if to be
acknowledged by them might almost be a kind of blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Even the little clusters of hip-hop teens merely blink, size
them up and go back to their gossip. Being cool, they seem to
sense, means being cool about retarded people.
</P>
<P>
   In Walgreen's, Eddie bought a tube of Close-Up toothpaste, and
Sharon Vaughn a bottle of hydrogen peroxide. Harold chose scissors,
a bar of Ivory soap and a roll of Scotch tape.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Garnett bought a new spiral notebook for her diary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always keep it to myself,'' she explained. ``It's private,
so I know what's going on in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in Waldenbooks, she bought a book called Prescription For
Anger: Coping With Angry Feelings and Angry People.
</P>
<P>
   `Did you know ?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know I have a mental disability,'' Cheryl Garnett will
whisper, when she trusts you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called Down syndrome. That's what I have. It means I have
difficulty being coordinated. Damage in your brain. Sometimes I go
in my room and look it up in the dictionary .``
</P>
<P>
   Down syndrome (after J.L.H. Down, 1828-96, Brit. physician.) _ A
congenital condition characterized by abnormal chromosomes, mental
deficiency, a broad face, slanting eyes, a short fifth finger, etc.
Mongolism.
</P>
<P>
   What a lovely coincidence that the house parent in E.T. House is
Sheryl-with-an-S, and Cheryl Garnett is Cheryl-with-a-C.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, Cheryl is actually three years older than Sheryl, and
she's a kind of mother, too. She helps cook supper almost every
night, even when it's not her scheduled chore. She monitors
everyone's diet as strictly as she watches her own, and when the
gang goes out, she is the first to take tiny Robert's hand and tug
him along.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder they love her at Connor's Nursery and The Children's
Place, home to AIDS babies and abused children, where she works as
a custodian four days a week, emptying trash cans and scrubbing
sinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a model employee, it would be Cheryl,'' brags her
boss, Cindy Howell. ``There have been a couple of instances of her
vacuuming paper clips, but she's very receptive to criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, on Fridays, they let her play with the babies. This
retarded woman, almost a child herself, holds and rocks and sings
The Barney Song to crack cocaine infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' she says simply, ``they're very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   She also likes Garth Brooks and Danielle Steele, Beavis &AMP;
Butt-head and Hot Sam's pretzels without salt - ``It's bad for your
blood pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   What she doesn't like is people like the woman who yelled at her
one day as she was leaving the local ARC headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting on the bus, and this woman yelled out the car
window, `Hey, you! You're retarded!' `` she remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to cry, but I said to myself, `That's not right to
say that to me. That's rude.' ``
</P>
<P>
   She cocked her head and rolled her eyes and her voice swung high
in childlike wonder. ``Why would anybody d-d-do that?'' she said.
``I don't understand that part.''
</P>
<P>
   `A rebellious teenager'
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday, while everyone else was getting ready to head for
the mall and spend their allowance, long and lanky David Crook
quietly slipped out of E.T. House and loped toward Dixie Highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``David never wants to do things with the others,'' Bargerstock
said. ``He's the big brother, and they're the kids. Did you want to
hang out with your little brothers and sisters? Well, that's how
David feels. He's 28, but he's a rebellious teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   She shook her head. ``I don't know where he goes.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he got out of sight of the house, he tugged out a
cigarette and started smoking.
</P>
<P>
   David has never heard of Eugene Apert, but the French physician
described him back in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Apert syndrome is a genetic defect that occurs in only one of
every 160,000 to 200,000 births. The plates that will form the
baby's skull fuse too soon, denying the brain enough room to grow.
The face appears concave, and fingers and toes are webbed and
stubby.
</P>
<P>
   His right eye bulges, and his left eye droops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people see me and they run the other way,'' David
once told Bargerstock.
</P>
<P>
   At Dixie Highway, he stormed south, cut between the marble
pillars that line the Palm Beach County Courthouse and climbed on
the No. 40 bus at Quadrille Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   At Westward Plaza, a strip mall, he rushed off the bus, lit
another cigarette and headed for a $10 crew cut at Champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's kind of cute,'' he said, after tipping the stylist a
dollar, ``but I think she's married. I saw a ring.''
</P>
<P>
   In Books-A-Million, he read heavy-metal music magazines for 15
minutes, trying to decide between Metal Maniacs and Metal Edge.
</P>
<P>
   Metal Edge.
</P>
<P>
   Among his several tattoos, David has ``Duff'' on his left bicep
- for Duff McKagan, former bass player for the band Guns `n' Roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the name David,'' he explained. ``Somebody said
it's Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   David is, after all, the rebellious teen of E.T. House,
caustically rejecting anything that he thinks might make him seem
weak, even as some other, softer part of himself longs for
strangers to look beyond his stubby fingers and bulging eye and
love him.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the bus again at Spencer Drive, he spotted a young
woman named Joline Lake walking a beautiful black Labrador mix.
Without a moment's hesitation, he loped over and struck up a
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have a Lab named Onyx, but he got run over,'' he
told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great name for a black Lab!'' Lake said, warming to
him instantly.
</P>
<P>
   He was lying.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he later confessed, Onyx wasn't run over. He lost the
dog when his parents split up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't keep my stories straight,'' he murmured. And lit
another cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 12, David's parents divorced. His mother, Jaime,
kept the family house, where he'd grown up, and his father, John,
went _ where?
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 14 years, David didn't know. Then one day, he decided
to find out. His family, he knew, was from Syracuse, N.Y. He called
information and found a listing for his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Crook told him his father had beaten the drugs and alcohol
and was happily remarried and living in Rocky Point, N.C. And he
gave him the number.
</P>
<P>
   A man answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Dad,'' David said, ``this is your son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we both cried over the phone,'' John Crook remembers now.
``I was overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, his father drove down. They went to Denny's
together, visited his father's new brother-in-law and his pet pig,
drove to the beach and watched TV and talked and cried some more.
Now they chat two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just like me,'' David's father brags, ``the spitting
image of me.''
</P>
<P>
   What he means is that David has somehow developed the same
ability to reach strangers that he learned working swap shops and
flea markets in all the years they were out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he meets people,'' his father says, ``they don't say, `He
has birth defects.' They just see David. I wish I could see him
more myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Money's tight when you're just the assistant manager of a
Tru-Value hardware store in rural North Carolina, but this year
David is supposed to fly up and spend Christmas with his father and
stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   The dates aren't set yet, but his father has promised David it
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said he doesn't want any presents,'' he said as the bus
let him off back at Quadrille. ``He said he just wants me, but I'm
going to surprise him anyway because I know what he likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes Old Spice.''
</P>
<P>
   David lit another cigarette and headed down Clematis Street,
toward home.
</P>
<P>
   At Myers Luggage shop, he stopped to admire the window display.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that suitcase,'' he said. ``I'm going to have to be
getting a suitcase like that pretty soon to go visit my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   `Mr. Giordano'
</P>
<P>
   At the Palm Beach Habilitation Center in Lake Worth, ASAP is an
acronym for Adult Skills Acquisitions Program _ and As Soon As
Possible.
</P>
<P>
   On this sunny Wednesday morning, tiny Robert Giordano is sitting
at a long blond table, learning to drop poker chips through a hole
in the top of a Tupperware bowl as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Bobby G.,'' his teacher coaxes, ``pick up another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert's eyes wander. His hand pauses in mid-air, as if he's
forgotten what he meant to do. He is so short his sneakers dangle
six inches off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster, Bobby G.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster,'' he murmurs.
</P>
<P>
   In ASAP class, Robert is called ``Bobby G.'' On the official
forms where his tasks are timed and his progress charted, he's
``Mr. Giordano.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it will take Mr. Giordano 41 minutes to transfer 10 poker
chips from the table to the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Five days a week, the ambulette carries him from E.T. House to
the ASAP class, where he spends six hours a day learning to perform
mundane tasks a little faster.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 ``developmentally disabled'' students in the class place
different colored shower rings on matching pegs; they group cards
by color; they complete simple jigsaw puzzles. Sometimes they
manipulate locks and faucets, hooks and slide bolts attached to
pieces of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach daily living skills, self-care skills,'' says Donna
Hall, Robert's teacher. ``Concentration skills is the best way to
term it. But you have to break things down into tiny steps. That's
where you see the progress.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is ever fast enough, Robert will move to one of the
agency's sheltered workshops, where Davi

 &HT;    Supermodel no dummy about beauty
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The ``dummies'' aren't just getting
smarter, they're also getting better looking.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least they've got the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Seymour _ supermodel, Victoria's Secret poster girl
and seasonal local resident _ has added Beauty Secrets for Dummies
to the sky-high stack of yellow and black paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty is a very intimidating subject, and I wanted to write a
book that was easy to read,'' says Seymour, 30. ``It's not about
being gorgeous. It's about knowing how to deal with beauty
problems, learning how to take care of your skin and having the
confidence to put your makeup on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not telling everybody that they can look like me if they
buy this book.''
</P>
<P>
   (And to think, after spending just $19.99, we'd hoped to land a
L'Oreal contract like Seymour. Sigh.)
</P>
<P>
   The book _ sort of a Dick and Jane approach to skin, hair and
makeup _ assumes the reader knows next to nothing. The very basics
are explored, such as the difference between oily and dry skin; the
value of a cotton swab; and the definition of a bobby pin (``one
straight side and one crimped side'').
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the obvious, there are some very useful tips,
especially in The Makeup Workbook section, a step-by-step guide
that has color pages and cosmetic strategies for a range of ages.
</P>
<P>
   Also helpful are quick-reference charts (like the one on
hair-care products) and money-saving tips (use a tad of hairspray
instead of buying a separate brow gel).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around the beauty business for so many years, and
I've learned a lot,'' says the San Diego native, discovered at 15
after reaching the semifinals of Elite Models' ``Look of the Year''
contest in 1983. (Cindy Crawford and Hunter Reno also competed that
year.)
</P>
<P>
   Seymour caught the eye of former Elite chairman John Casablancas
_ who called her ``a charmer, a puppy dog, a pony with long legs''
_ and he whisked her to New York, where she began popping up on
covers: Cosmopolitan, Mademoiselle, Vogue and Sports Illustrated,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing what I do, I'm surrounded by experts,'' says Seymour,
who is 5-foot-10 and has dark brown hair and blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask `How do you put on liquid liner so perfectly?' `How do
I clear up my skin?' I wanted to pass all this along because
sometimes women forget or they just don't know or they get in a
rut.''
</P>
<P>
   She and husband, Peter Brant, 51 _ an entrepreneur, horse
breeder, publisher and polo player _ have homes in Wellington and
Greenwich, Conn. Prior to their marriage in 1995, Seymour was
linked with Casablancas (so much for not dating the boss), Warren
Beatty and Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, Seymour's main men are her children Dylan, 8
(from a previous marriage); Peter Jr., 4; and Harry, 2.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not on mommy detail (i.e., buying Harry a Simba
costume for Halloween that he stubbornly refused to put on right
before trick-or-treat time), Seymour poses for Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   And if you venture into a Victoria's Secret boutique, you'll
spot her picture on the front of most packaged body suits and pairs
of pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually very shy, although I try to pretend I'm not,''
she says. ``The great thing about working with Victoria's Secret is
that it's like a family. They try to make everyone feel
comfortable. I mean, when you're in your bra and panties ... ''
</P>
<P>
   While she doesn't mind being nearly naked for a photo, she can't
stand bare lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just absolutely have to have lip gloss,'' she says. ``I have
all different kinds _ tinted, clear, colored. I feel like my mouth
turns white and looks pruned up without something. I'm completely
addicted to lipstick.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beauty Secrets for Dummies, Seymour pays homage to her balm
of choice, the ever-so-modest Bonne Bell Lip Smacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hydrates the lips, adds sheen, tastes great and comes in a
variety of flavors, all with their own hint of color,'' she gushes.
</P>
<P>
   And the good news is, at just $1.50 a tube, you don't have to be
married to a millionaire. Read her lips: Stephanie's Top 10 tips
Hints from Stephanie Seymour's personal routine _ which focuses on
skin care _ are highlighted in the book with a circled lip print.
Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   1. `I force myself to drink water rather than tea, coffee, soda
or juice to maintain healthy skin.'
</P>
<P>
   2. `I always broke out from sunscreen. If that happens to you,
opt for a gel that won't clog pores.'
</P>
<P>
   3. `Whenever my skin broke out after a mask or cleanser,
facialists tried to convince me that my skin was purging `toxins.'
I no longer believe that. If a product makes you break out, return
it.'
</P>
<P>
   4. `If you're out of blemish medicine, use a dot of drying
mask.'
</P>
<P>
   5. `Alternating shampoo and conditioner helps my hair look its
best. I switch back and forth (between brands).'
</P>
<P>
   6. `Cover your ends or old highlights with conditioner before
applying hair color to keep them from absorbing too much.'
</P>
<P>
   7. `Make your own headbands by using opaque stockings. Cut
enough length off one leg and fit to head.'
</P>
<P>
   8. `Most brands of blush are comparable, so this is a product to
save money on.'
</P>
<P>
   9. `When I'm pressed for time, the one thing I won't leave the
house without is concealer under my eyes and something on my lips.'
</P>
<P>
   10. `Rather than take a sleeping pill, try a warm bath with
Epsom salts and a little lavender oil.'

 &HT;    Could parents' defensive nature be guilt in disguise?
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Just a couple of weeks ago, I confessed (in
print) to being a less than perfect student, and complained of how
disappointed I was that day in the first grade when I caught hell
at home for getting into trouble at school. When I tattled on my
mean old teacher for disciplining me, I expected unconditional pity
from my folks. Boy, did I have a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   It was my suggestion that parents, rather than complaining about
the schools disciplining their little lawbreakers (as in the case
of some teen-age vandals in Michigan), they ought to be thanking us
for picking up the slack on a job they should have done themselves
a long time before.
</P>
<P>
   From the looks of my mail, quite a few folks agreed.
</P>
<P>
   From Lufkin, Texas: ``I commend you for being on target. I'm a
teacher also and you would not believe the excuses we hear from
parents trying to justify the behavior of their kids. Your parents
and mine must have known each other!''
</P>
<P>
   From Huber Heights, Ohio: ``I get so tired of hearing about how
poor our schools are and the poor teachers we have. I'm sure there
are poor teachers, just like there are bad employees in every
company, but by and large, teachers go into the profession for one
reason _ they want to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a teacher, but I am a 32-year-old father of two boys
(11 and 12) and I couldn't agree more. I know my kids are just
going into their teen years and there may be trouble ahead, but so
far, so good. They are both well-behaved, well-mannered and perform
well in school and with others. We have to put up walls as to what
the kids can get away with and what they can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so consumed with themselves and their ambitions
that they have forgotten to teach their kids love and respect.
Respect seems to be the key word that comes to mind time and time
again. Many children grow up today without learning to respect
others...it might infringe upon their `rights.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, Ohio: ``AMEN! I have been teaching at the junior high
level for 19 years and have seen a dramatic increase in the type of
parent behavior you spoke of.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton: ``...my wife and I are both fourth-year teachers. ...
Although we do not have the experience that you have, we did have
similar experiences as students ourselves when we were in
elementary school. Being teachers, we see many parents taking the
side of their child instead of the school's side in an argument. I
hope that in the near future parents ... realize that we as
teachers
</P>
<P>
   are only trying to make their child a better person. I also hope
that the parents start taking responsibility for their child, not
to mention themselves, and disciplining them at home with
appropriate consequences. Until this happens, we as teachers will
be baby-sitters, social workers, psychologists, and pseudo-parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be part of the most talented profession ever created.
Thank you for sharing the thoughts and feelings of many educators
throughout the state of Ohio, and I would guess the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton: (a retired teacher of 31 years) ``Last year I decided
that I really did miss teaching so I became a substitute.
Substitutes are needed badly and I thought I could be of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``One incident occurred which upset me. I was the third sub in
three days and the teacher had left instructions for a video to be
shown to introduce the unit in reading. The kids carried on so over
the video and I made the statement that they were acting like
idiots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, maybe a poor choice of words, but not directed at any
special student, just the class as a whole. The next day when I
went back, an assistant principal kept coming in and out and this
had never happened before. He finally asked me out in the hall and
said a parent had complained about that statement and I needed to
watch my speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``... the next day when I was called to come to that class for
the third day, I turned it down. They were to go on a field trip
that day and for all I knew, the parent who complained about me
would be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then this year I only subbed one day and after school a man
was standing on the corner holding a sign that said `` school
practices and condones child abuse.'' Did I have his child that
day? Who knows. Yesterday I wrote letters to resign the position of
substitute teacher. It really reminded me of why I was so glad to
retire. It's too bad that this is the way the schools are. I used
to
</P>
<P>
   cry on the last day of school.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a pretty commentary, I'm thinking, but it makes me
wonder. Do we go overboard defending our children because of our
guilt at not having been around when they needed us?

 &HT;    `Double Live' _ two CDs, two concerts
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garth Brooks' mythic pop music career reaches for even greater _
some might say grandiose _ proportions today with the release of
the two-CD album ``Garth Brooks Double Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the Capitol release certain to zoom to No. 1 on the
charts, Brooks and his label expect to sell more than 1 million
copies today, while retail partner Wal-Mart even thinks its 2,400
stores alone could possibly move 1 million of the two-CD sets,
available in six different packagings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how that's possible,'' Brooks says of Wal-Mart's
hope, keyed to the chain's exclusive presentation tonight of a live
satellite-fed concert by Brooks. ``But, hey, if somebody says they
can do it, put them out there on the field and let them have their
run. I said, `Just show me where to sign up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Clarke, Wal-Mart's director of public affairs in
Bentonville, Ark., says there is ``no way'' to predict how many
fans will be drawn to the chain's stores by the concert or what
percentage will buy the two-disc album, which carries a modest
suggested price of $13.99. ``What I can tell you,'' Clarke says,
``is that in an average week we see approximately 90 million
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who majored in advertising at Oklahoma State University
and is described by Capitol Nashville President Pat Quigley as a
``marketing nut,'' is doing his part. He's been ultra-accessible
for the media in recent weeks and readily agreed to tonight's
concert, which can be seen only in the electronics departments of
Wal-Mart stores.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol's Quigley says Brooks has at least ``5 million core
fans'' and that it's just a question of getting them into stores
today to buy the 7 million copies initially shipped. Quigley's
theory is that there should be ``an event'' to launch each album.
He compares tonight's Wal-Mart concert and the NBC-TV special
Brooks will host Wednesday night with the free concert staged in
New York's Central Park in August 1997 to draw attention to the
release of Brooks' ``Sevens'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks will do three versions of his ``Double Live'' special
Wednesday from a studio in Burbank, Calif.: one for the
Eastern/Central time zones, one for the Mountain time zone and one
for the Pacific time zone. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``It always bugged me,'' Brooks says of tape-delayed TV shows.
``Why do we do a live show with call-ins and by the time it gets to
the West Coast, it's tape-delayed and there are no call-ins? So . .
. each show will vary and the calls will be live.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who plans to shut down his Nashville-based operation in
'99 for a year's sabbatical while keeping his band and other
employees on salary, has no trouble explaining the motivation for
the near-manic promotion of his first live album.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the demon of being forgotten,'' he says during a
yawn-punctuated morning interview recently from his Nashville home.
``It's the fear of having the industry throw you out before you're
ready to walk out on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry reaction to Brooks and Capitol's goal varies, with
Billboard editor Tim White among those weighing in with a negative
opinion. ``When you set yourself up like that, you invite
cynicism,'' White says. ``Everything Garth does in one form or
another is remarkable, but that's a tall order. I'll bet the record
does incredibly well, but why aim so high the first week?''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that Brooks could walk away without selling a
single copy of ``Double Live,'' or ever touring again, and never
worry. He shrugs off questions about his net worth by saying, ``I
don't have a clue. I wish I had the intelligence to tell you what
I'm worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has sold 85 million albums _ a figure that doesn't
include 2 million of his six-CD box set ``The Limited Edition'' _
in North America alone. Neither Brooks' management office nor
Capitol will say what worldwide sales have been since he debuted in
1989 with ``Garth Brooks,'' the first of 10 releases leading up to
his new ``Garth Brooks Double Live,'' or how much he's made from
sales. Royalty fees vary, but Brooks likely gets at least $2 and
possibly more for each album sold. (Forbes says he'll make $54
million in '98.)
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has performed for more than 5 million fans during his
current three-year tour, which ends Saturday in College Station,
Texas. Tickets, like Brooks' album, are among the industry's
cheapest with most priced under $20. Even so, recent multishow
stands with Trisha Yearwood in Tampa, Fla. (Oct. 28-31) and
Orlando, Fla. (Oct. 21-25) were weekly top-grossing events with
Billboard reporting ticket sales of more than $1.6 million in each
city.
</P>
<P>
   RUSS DEVAULT'S ALBUM REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``Garth Brooks Double Live''
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks. Capitol. Two-CDs, 25 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Some studio sweetening prevents this from being a truly live
album _ ``The River'' winds from a studio opening to an explosive
finish in an arena _ but it's a valid document of the ferocious
energy that Garth Brooks brings to the stage. A plus here is the
extra verses of ``The Thunder Rolls'' and ``Friends in Low Places''
that don't appear on other recordings; the only real minus is not
seeing Brooks, an out-of-control performer who knows how to turn it
down touchingly on ``It's Your Song,'' included as a tribute to his
mother, a cancer sufferer.

 &HT;    Texas' lost world revisited with fossil exhibit
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Scores of five-point stars seem pasted on a
2-foot-by-2-foot piece of limestone cut from the bed of Bouldin
Creek in South Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are some of Austin's original inhabitants: 85
million-year-old fossil starfish, a few right side up, most upside
down, from when the city was the floor of a shallow sea.
</P>
<P>
   The perfectly preserved starfish are among the simplest and most
captivating of 18 rare Texas fossils in ``Scratching The Surface
Again!,'' an exhibit that began this week at the free-admission
Texas Memorial Museum, 2400 Trinity St., on the University of Texas
campus.
</P>
<P>
   The annual paleontology showcase, which runs through Feb. 28,
will fill the UT museum's central hall with some of the best of its
millions of collected fossils: the large and small skulls and bones
of extinct dinosaurs, amphibians and mammals.
</P>
<P>
   There'll also be an ongoing demonstration of the techniques used
to free the fossil skull of an ancient crocodile from a rock found
in Big Bend National Park in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rarest fossils in the exhibit will be the upper jaw
bone, complete with teeth, of a Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaur. It's
one of a kind, the only T. rex fossil found so far in Texas, again
in the Big Bend park.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we find the bones of (dinosaurs) for the most
part,'' said E.L. Lundelius, Jr., a UT emeritus professor of
paleontology. ``The limestones in Central Texas bear only
(dinosaur) tracks, indicating it was probably shallow water then.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinosaur fossils are rare in Texas because of the shallow sea
that was home to the South Austin starfish. The sea covered most of
the eastern half of the state when dinosaurs flourished 65 million
to 220 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit's largest dinosaur specimen is the head of a
twin-horned Chasmosaurus, a ponderous, 17-foot-long plant eater, a
species whose bits and pieces have been found all over the park in
Big Bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the dinosaur equivalent of a rhinoceros,'' said
Lundelius, former director of UT's Vertebrate Paleontology
Laboratory, whose scientists discovered many of the fossils in the
exhibit. ``Very formidable-looking, but strictly a herbivore.''
</P>
<P>
   More common in Texas, because they swam the shallow sea covering
much of the land, were such animals as Diplocaulus, a 2-foot-long,
250 million-year-old amphibian. The boomerang-shaped fossil head of
a Diplocaulus, found near Abilene, is part of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of years after Diplocaulus and the dinosaurs had become
extinct, and the sea had retreated from the land that would become
Texas, the earliest mammals roamed.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit features the fossil skull of one of them, a
tree-dwelling, lemur-like monkey called Rooneyia, which was
abundant in North America 35 million years ago but now is extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just exquisite, scientifically,'' said Brent Lyles, the
museum's director of public programs, cradling in his palm the
skull that was found near Marfa, in far West Texas, in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   But the beautiful South Austin starfish still excite the most
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Lundelius was a child in the 1930s when the starfish were found.
Years later, he walked shallow Bouldin Creek with some other UT
paleontology graduate students hunting for more.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the original find was that the starfish weren't
visible until a sudden rain shower wetted the surface of their
ancient rock home.
</P>
<P>
   So Lundelius and his friends ``carried coffee cans and threw
water on the flat rocks,'' he recalled with a laugh, ``but we never
found any more.''

 &HT;    The thrill is gone; Viagra not the medical darling anymore
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The thrill appears to be gone, at least for many
early users of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   In April and May, when Viagra was still the hot new
prescription, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was paying for
nearly 4,000 claims per month to Ohio patients who wanted the
anti-impotence drug.
</P>
<P>
   But Viagra sales have cooled considerably in recent months,
thanks to a drop-off in media attention, a fear of side effects, an
insurance coverage crackdown and disappointing results for some
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem, one of the Dayton area's largest health insurers, is now
reimbursing fewer than 1,000 Viagra claims per month, mirroring an
international plunge in sales. Last month, Pfizer Inc. reported
Viagra sales of $141 million worldwide for the third quarter _
about a third of Viagra's $411 million sales in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Litscher, a Dayton urologist and a faculty member of
Wright State University School of Medicine, isn't surprised. He
says Viagra could never have lived up to its early hype as the
first oral medication for impotence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to be living in a cave at the time not to have heard
about Viagra,'' he said. ``The result is that every man who ever
had a problem (with impotence) asked for the drug when it first
came out,'' whether it might work for him or not.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients were soon disappointed with the results while
others began to fear the side effects after 69 American men, most
of them elderly, died after taking the medication.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to the drug, at least 12 of those victims
disregarded the warning label and were taking nitroglycerin for
their hearts at the time. Many of the other men also had other risk
factors, like high cholesterol, high blood pressure or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra can't be expected to work for everyone, Litscher said.
Pfizer's own research showed the drug to be effective for 60
percent to 80 percent of impotent men, ``and my hunch is it's
probably closer to 60 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Litscher's office has seen about a 40 percent drop in requests
for the drug since last spring. Many of those patients are
returning to their previous remedies, including injectable drugs
that are less convenient and more painful but work faster and last
longer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Lucas, manager of the Wright Health Building Pharmacy in
Dayton, agreed. ``When this first came out, everybody thought this
was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread,'' she said.
``Yes, it's working for a lot of patients _ the ones who really do
have (physical) impotence. But it's not working as well as they
thought it would.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the injection-style drugs, Viagra requires foreplay and
direct stimulation in order to produce an erection, she said.
Patients also must wait an hour for results, whereas the injectible
drugs usually work within 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers have played a key role in dampening the ardor for
Viagra as well. Most now limit how many pills they'll supply to
their patients, usually six per month. The pills cost about $10
each at retail prices _ a financial hardship for many elderly
patients, Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   But just because Viagra didn't live up to the early hype doesn't
diminish its long-term value, Litscher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a huge step forward in the treatment of
impotence,'' he said. ``It's the first pill proven to be better
than a placebo, and it works for a variety of conditions. We can be
thankful for that.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Suit views firearms merchants as public nuisance
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Recently the Austin-based EZ Pawn chain, which has
four stores in Waco, announced it was liquidating its cheap
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Hold it, bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance ``liquidate'' literally means ``make liquid'' _
at a smelter. Maybe the ooze can be used for something useful to
society, like prostheses, or bullet-proof vests.
</P>
<P>
   EZ Pawn decided to destroy 2,000 cheap, small-caliber man
killers (suitable also for killing children) in 12 states.
Actually, the handguns' exact disposal is left to police
departments in Houston, San Antonio and Atlanta, to which the guns
were delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company finds it desirable to take these types of firearms
out of circulation,'' said Vince Lambiase, CEO of parent company EZ
Corp. In an industry in which guns are a key commodity, the chain
has a reputation for refusing stolen goods and working closely with
police.
</P>
<P>
   Casting off Saturday Night Specials? That's a chunk of change _
$50 a potential pop. EZ Pawn has consigned $100,000 in merchandise
to the scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is to be applauded. But civic citizenship needn't
be the sole reason others might consider such a move. Indeed, as
the tobacco industry has discovered this year, dealing in death can
have its down side, in a pecuniary sense.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago recently became the second city in America to go after
the sellers of handguns, much like state attorney generals have
gone after Big Tobacco for human damage wrought.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Mayor Richard Daley has sued suburban Chicago gun
dealers for $433 million, asserting that the gun shops willfully
abet gang members, drug dealers and other criminals. The suit is
based in part on undercover purchases by Chicago cops posing as
individuals bent on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago law prohibits the private ownership of handguns unless
they were registered prior to March 30, 1982. The suit alleges that
suburban gun shops have been used to ``saturate'' the city despite
its gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If money is the only language they understand, then money is
the language we will use to make them understand,'' said Daley,
comparing the gun shops to polluters and calling them a ``public
nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month New Orleans became the first city to sue the firearms
industry. The suit lists 15 gun manufacturers and select merchants
as defendants, but uses different grounds. The suit is over the
failure to ``child-proof'' weapons so they could be used only by
their owners. This type of suit, like those against the tobacco
industry, takes product liability in a new direction. Generally,
product liability is aimed at defective products. But guns that
kill are doing what they're meant to do, very efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry is a monument to efficiency. You want death?
Step aside, Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the sick irony of the 1995 case against gun maker
American Derringer. That year the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration cited the company for violations of federal
regulations when two employees died on-site by accidental gunshot.
One employee was found at fault. In the other case, the company was
found at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, a federal agency asked to decide whether a gun
manufacturer is doing something safe. No, we're not talking about a
defective product here. It was meant to kill. It killed.
</P>
<P>
   From different angles, Chicago and New Orleans are going after
an industry because its product does exactly as advertised.

fraternities were exclusionary and openly racist. One of Pi Lambda
Phi's chartered purposes is to combat prejudice, both on campus and

two of his daughters and his grandson had died in the mass
murder-suicide of Jonestown, the Rev. John V. Moore delivered his
Sunday sermon to his United Methodist congregation in Reno. He had
not planned to speak, but his wife Barbara convinced him the effort
was crucial. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

WHEN YOUR CHILD STEALS FOR ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about
personal relationships that are key in having happy and productive
lives.) 
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old son is bringing home all sorts of
goodies from school. I don't think they're his, but I don't want to
accuse him of stealing. How common is stealing with kids, and if I
ignore it, are banks next? _ Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: It's not unusual for kids to steal, but it's not
something you want to encourage as a way to garner attention. Don't
condone or ignore his stealing, but shift the emphasis from
negative to positive. Make sure he is not stealing to get
attention. You don't need your kid to be the first jailbird in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   If your son is stealing, ask yourself why he is doing this. Who
sees his booty? If no one, he probably wants it for its own sake.
If he shows his friends, he wants their approval. If he shows you,
he's most likely asking for help. He's figured out how to get your
attention, and unfortunately punishing him will only emphasize the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Does he have an older sibling who gets a lot of attention for
sports or grades? Or a new baby in the house? Then he needs
reinforcement from you, including gold stars on the forehead, pats
on the back for positive behavior and help in making purchases.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to accuse him of stealing. Just explain you're
uncomfortable with his trading efforts and to cut it out before
other parents object. Suggest he takes no goodies to school and
brings no goodies home. If he doesn't already have an allowance or
job to pay for his own ``must-haves,'' institute a series of chores
to earn money that you will match.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I've been going with a woman 20 years my junior for a
little over a year. She's been divorced for a little under a year.
While she was married, she had numerous affairs. When I asked her
about them, she gave me sketchy details. Later I found out she'd
lied about the number and length of affairs. I want to leave her,
but I'm supporting her and her two children, ages 5 and 9, since
she doesn't work and doesn't receive sufficient alimony. What
should I do? _ Toronto
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Heavens! So many red flares shot up as I read your
letter my office is on fire. Despite your noble intentions, you've
stumbled into nearly every relationship pitfall there is.
</P>
<P>
   What she did before is none of your business. What matter is
what's going on between the two of you today. Stop supporting this
woman, so both of you can evaluate your feelings for each other.
She needs to grow up, get a job and realize that a romance is not a
rescue. Stop being ``Wally the Wallet'' and take a breather from
this troubled relationship for six months.
</P>
<P>
   After that your head should be clear enough to see who this
woman is as a person _ not a project. If at that time, you still
want to pursue a relationship, proceed with caution. You never know
when a booby trap might spring up and bop you on the shins again.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a guy trying to save money to buy a car, so I'm
living at home while I attend college. But my parents wait up for
me every night and want to know everything that goes on in my life.
Aren't I entitled to any privacy? _ Milwaukee
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Of course, but you may have to get it the old-fashioned
way _ earn it by moving out. Everything in this life has a price
tag. You're finding the price tag for free room and board is
expensive in terms of personal privacy and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Live under your parents' roof and I guarantee you're going to be
treated like a child whether you're 14 or 114. If you're unwilling
to change your living arrangements, compromise. Volunteer
information if they promise not to ask. Tell them you'll be home by
a certain time and say goodnight when you get in. Your parents are
always going to be interested in your life even after you move out.
It doesn't mean they're nosy, just that they're your parents and
they love you.
</P>
<P>
   Your best long-term solution is to earn more independence, which
may mean finding less luxurious housing with a friend, foregoing
the car temporarily, getting a job or finding campus housing in
exchange for some work. Not only will your parents drive you less
crazy, but you'll also feel a lot more grown up.

WHY BUY BOSE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   You've seen the ads. ``The Bose Wave Radio is no ordinary
radio.'' It's ``a sonic marvel,'' a ``genuine breakthrough.'' Such
a little thing _ barely the size of a shoe box _ yet it puts out
the ``full, rich sound'' of a ``primary music system.'' It costs
$349, startlingly high for a clock radio but not unreasonable if
the claims are not overstated. Are the claims overstated? Come on.
How could they not be?
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Bose is bad. In fact, it may be the second-best
tabletop radio out there. But just this month, what may be the best
tabletop radio hit the market. It's the Cambridge SoundWorks Model
88 and, at $199, it's very nearly everything the Bose Wave claims
to be _ at a little over half the price. The Cambridge delivers a
smoother, more coherent, more rhythmic, more dynamic, more tonally
true picture of the music.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on a Vladimir Horowitz piano solo, the keys sounded
clangy, a bit metallic, on the Bose; they were warmer, but no less
hammered, on the Cambridge. When the quartet Anonymous 4 sang a
medieval chant, I wasn't sure on the Bose if there were four
singers (were there three? five?) _ there was no doubt at all on
the Cambridge. When the Heath Brothers played a hard-bop jazz tune,
the hi-hat cymbal sounded smeared on the Bose. I couldn't hear the
accent on the beat. On the Cambridge, I got the percussive thwack
as well as the shimmering whoosh all around it. And though the Bose
hit the low octaves of the acoustic bass, the Cambridge caught the
finger-pluckings of the bass strings.
</P>
<P>
   The differences weren't night and day. But they were of the sort
that, over time, make you feel at ease or slightly tense _ and
which, in a moment of leisure, make you want to stop and really
listen or move on to something else.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, I hooked up each unit to a compact disc player.
(Both radios sport input jacks in the back for plugging in a CD
player, computer, tape deck, television, or VCR.) I used not some
humdrum portable but the Discovery/Pentagon CD-70, a
top-of-the-line machine that retails for $5,000. And I pulled out
two of my most sonically demanding discs _ Henryk Gorecki's Third
Symphony, by the London Symphony Orchestra, on Nonesuch; and Kendra
Shank's Afterglow, a chanteuse-plus-jazz-trio session, on
Mapleshade.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the Gorecki know that, on some full-size (if
not very good) stereo systems, the first minute or so _ bass
violins growling quietly _ comes off as a vague rumble, its melody
barely audible. Both the Bose and the Cambridge navigate this
passage clearly. However, the Cambridge gets more of the bowing on
the basses, more of their rhythmic inflections. When a second,
louder bass line starts in about a minute into the piece, the Bose
cracks up for a second. The Cambridge doesn't exactly keep
everything straight (teeny speakers and teenier amplifiers can do
only so much), but it keeps going _ it doesn't lose the thread.
</P>
<P>
   On the Shank disc, when she modulates her voice, accenting a
certain word or dipping another to a whisper, the Bose makes it
sound as if the engineer is sharply turning up or down the volume.
The Cambridge gets the subtleties right. How do these radios eke
such relatively big sounds out of such small boxes? The Bose isn't
exactly a technical ``breakthrough,'' but it is clever. In the back
of the speakers is a 7 foot tube that has been folded into a thin,
tight maze to fit inside the radio box. The frequency of a sound
wave is defined by its length: The longer the wave, the deeper the
bass. Such a long tube gives sound waves lots of room to enlarge.
Each speaker is also powered by an amplifier equipped with circuits
that boost the bass as you turn up the volume. However, once the
speakers get to the middle and upper octaves, their limitations
become more apparent; hence, the steely pianos, smeared cymbals,
ungainly dynamics, and the rest. The Cambridge SoundWorks 88, half
an inch taller but otherwise the same size as the Bose, takes a
different approach. Its bass comes from a 4 1/2 inch woofer cone,
which takes up two-thirds of the radio's internal space and is
powered by its own amplifier. The two smaller main speakers, each
of which has its own amp, are freed up to focus their energies on
the less burdensome middle and treble octaves. (The 88 also has a
separate volume knob for the woofer, so you can adjust the bass
level, which would otherwise depend greatly on room placement.)
</P>
<P>
   The 88 is designed by Henry Kloss, a hi-fi legend who made his
mark (with the KLH speakers of the 1950's and the Advents of the
'60s) by figuring out how to manipulate electronics so that a
speaker sounds smooth from octave to octave. He applied 47 years of
experience with this art to the rather skimpy components of the
Model 88, which explains how he gets such a smooth, coherent sound
from not only a small box but also a cheap one.
</P>
<P>
   Bose is the property of Amar Bose, a man long regarded as
hi-fi's most brilliant marketer but whose products tend to be built
around a technical fad. His Bose 901 loudspeakers, the company's
premium line for 30 years, have nine speaker cones, positioned all
over the cabinet, so that the sound bounces around your room ``just
like in a concert hall.'' One problem, among many, is that most
people's living rooms aren't Carnegie Hall; as a result, the music
just sounds muddy. His methods also encourage high prices: The 901s
cost $1,400 a pair (some companies make $300 speakers that sound
better) because nine cones cost more than two or three; the Wave
radio costs $350 because that 7 foot tube was a bear to design. The
Wave is one of Bose's better devices. But he stretched too far, in
his price tag and his claims, and now Kloss' Cambridge has
delivered his comeuppance.
</P>

   (Both radios are sold through mail-order, the Bose from
800-681-BOSE, the Cambridge SoundWorks from 800-FOR-HIFI.)

IN LIEU OF GIFTS, PLEASE WALK THE DOG

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you noticed how everyone wants to get their hands on your
new baby?
</P>
<P>
   Of course the attention and affection showered on the baby are
nice, but what's nice isn't always the same as what's needed, and
what new moms need is a no-holds-barred buddy who wades into the
trenches, rolls up her sleeves and asks, ``How can I help?''
</P>
<P>
   For the times when you're moved to ask others this question (and
the times when you wish someone would ask it of you), consider this
a ``clip- and-save'' guide to making life a little easier for a new
mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring (real) food.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping off a home-cooked meal (or great take-out) is an act of
friendship every new mom and dad dream of. A devoted friend might
even cook the meal, bring it over, serve it (holding the baby so
the new parents can actually eat it), and clean up afterward,
leaving nothing but happy, full bellies in her wake.
</P>
<P>
   Milk, juice, bread, fruit, and other staples are always
appreciated. After all, food is love.
</P>
<P>
   2. Come bearing brooms.
</P>
<P>
   A baby creates an avalanche of chores. After baths, diapering,
spit-up removal and laundry, there's no time (or energy) for much
else. Like many a new parent you shudder as the constant stream of
well-wishers wades through unread newspapers and dust balls in what
used to be a tidy home.
</P>
<P>
   New parents fantasize about buddies showing up, bucket and mop
in hand, cheerfully tackling the kitchen, shower, living room and
cluttered corners until they sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   For loving friends who live too far away for the do-it-yourself
approach and want to give a baby shower gift that will really make
a difference, how about three months of prepaid cleaning service?
It's guaranteed to earn the sponsor a spot in the Helper's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   3. Hold a crier (and don't complain).
</P>
<P>
   No matter how deeply a new mother adores her baby, she needs a
break sometimes (yes, even when the little sweetie is screaming for
all she's worth). In this ultimate test of friendship, people fall
into one of two categories: heroes who are willing to hold a crying
child and wimps who sing out ``Here, Mom!'' at the first squawk a
newborn makes, holding her at arm's length as if she were about to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   So the baby is crying. It's only a little voice, after all, and
a new mom will be eternally grateful if she can finish going to the
bathroom, just this once. Giving Mom time away from baby (crying or
not) is a necessity, not a luxury. It means she can have a minute
to herself to relax in a hot bath, take a walk or catch a nap.
</P>
<P>
   4. Offer on-the-spot childcare.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how a new mom ``runs out'' to pick up a quart of milk:
Feed the baby; change the baby; pack the diaper bag; feed the baby;
change the baby; change the mom; feed the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Two hours later you're finally on your way, but
the minute you enter the store, the little guy begins to wail.
</P>
<P>
   The probability of task completion increases tenfold with the
help of another adult who can hold the baby, change a diaper or
finish errands while Mom nurses. For new parents who don't get out
much, walking into a store with free hands, knowing that the baby
is nearby, safe in the care of a trusted friend, is liberating.
Moms might even complete two errands in one outing!
</P>
<P>
   5. Polish your penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   New mothers who send out thank-you notes for all the baby
presents before their child is 3 months old are either developing
an obsessive-compulsive disorder, getting a head start on the
supermom complex or lucky enough to have family and friends who
help them organize a mass mailing in between feedings and diaper
changes or during the baby's naps.
</P>
<P>
   New moms need buddies who seize the
thank-you-for-your-lovely-gift mission as their own, bringing over
stamps and addressing envelopes while Mom writes the notes, or
putting their best penmanship forward as Mom dictates.
</P>
<P>
   With all the other intense emotions of new parenthood, you can
at least keep guilt over unwritten thank-you notes out of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   6. Roll up your sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors whom dads and moms love most are those who stop by
not just to shoot the breeze or offer unsolicited advice but also
to fix the banging screen door. Or hang new curtains, recycle the
newspapers, take the dog for a walk, rake leaves, water the
houseplants, brush the cat and clean out the litter box.
</P>
<P>
   These little extras are acts of love in their best form:
hands-on care.
</P>
<P>
   7. Be a ``big sister'' to the new big sister.
</P>
<P>
   When a second child is born, mothers are confronted with a
knife-in-the-heart feeling, certain that in showering attention on
the new arrival they are ruining their firstborn's childhood
forever. Fortunate are those who have family and friends to push
big sister on the swings, take her to the park or library, build
block towers, play tag and hang around for the sole purpose of
helping with her bedtime routine.
</P>
<P>
   It's the people who show up at the door with barely a glance in
the new infant's direction, calling out, ``Where's my big girl?''
with their arms flung wide, who show they know what real help is
about.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, new moms need encouragement and congratulations as well,
but when it comes to changing diapers, running errands, cleaning
up, or finding a moment to themselves, kind words can't do the job.
But friends and family can, by showering new moms with love in the
form of tangible help.

<P>
   If you like to exercise with a group, you've probably attended
more than a few aerobic classes over the years, from dance to
hip-hop to high energy to low impact.
</P>
<P>
   You may also have tried the popular ``step'' classes offered at
health clubs, where exercisers step up on a plastic bench in a
series of choreographed movements.
</P>
<P>
   But what about weight-lifting? Does the thought of heaving
barbells put you off? What if you were able to do that in a class
where the atmosphere was fun and high energy, and the whole routine
was set to music?
</P>
<P>
   That's the concept of BodyPUMP, an increasingly popular new
exercise program that was developed in New Zealand in 1990 and
introduced in U.S. fitness clubs this year.
</P>
<P>
   BodyPUMP will ``breathe new life into the group fitness
market,'' says Rich Boggs, president of the Step Co. in Marietta,
Ga., which brought the step aerobic program to health clubs in the
early '90s and is marketing the new BodyPUMP program.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors can become certified in the method after attending
three-day workshops, then going through quarterly workshops to
learn new choreography and ensure their workouts are being taught
safely and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are often held in fitness centers' aerobics rooms.
Participants use a specially designed barbell system that allows
them to adjust weights for intensity and fitness levels. They lift
the barbells through a set of choreographed routines that are
designed to work every major muscle group, Boggs said, including
squats, presses, lifts and curls. The bar ranges from 3 pounds
without weights to a maximum of 91 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The focus: correct lifting using light to moderate weights with
high repetitions. ``You don't get big,'' Boggs says. ``Just toned
and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The user-friendly format is attracting females, who
traditionally shy away from free weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``BodyPUMP is the first opportunity for women to strength train
to music,'' says Debbie Lee, general manager at the Fitness
Connection for Women in Gainesville, Fla. ``You don't have to be a
body builder to do it. It's attractive to all groups, from novices
to advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Classes on average can accommodate 50 participants and last from
45 to 60 minutes. While the routine is not aerobic, the
weight-lifting helps build lean muscle mass, reversing bone loss,
which is increasingly important to women with concerns of
osteoporosis, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs recommends using BodyPUMP as part of a balanced exercise
program, two to three times a week.
</P>
<P>

www.bodypump.com, or call the Step Co. at (770) 859-9292.

CHRISTOPHER REEVE: MAN OF ACTION ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Christopher Reeve and
Daryl Hannah in ``Rear Window.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For the first time since the horseriding accident in l995 that
left him paralyzed and unable to walk, Christopher Reeve is back in
the starring spot in a movie- ABC's ``Rear Window,'' airing Nov.
22.
 &HT;    In this remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic l954 thriller,
Reeve plays architect Jason Kemp who has been left a quadriplegic
after a catastrophic car crash. He shares the spotlight with
gorgeous Daryl Hannah, (reprising the role made famous by Grace
Kelly) as a man who, though confined to his room, witnesses what he
believes is a brutal murder.
 &HT;    Last year Reeve went behind the camera to direct the HBO movie
``In the Gloaming,'' a gem that brought him an Emmy nomination for
best director.
 &HT;    In the l997 TV film, ``Snakes and Ladders,'' he played a small
role as a quadriplegic who becomes a mentor to young man paralyzed
in a diving accident.
 &HT;    But this time he's back as the star, above the title, the
position he occupied before a balking horse changed his life
forever. Reeve was Superman on and off screen. The man who could
leap tall buildings in a single bound was in real life a real man
of action, flying gliders as well as jets, sky diving, sailing and
skiing, until, in the cruelest of ironies, he fell during a
relatively simple horse show, breaking the top two vertebrae of his
spinal column.
 &HT;    His courage has been challenged as never before. And ``Rear
Window,'' he says, allowed him to incorporate into the character
many of the terrifying things he himself has experienced. ``I
wanted to do this film because many times disabled people are shown
in a somewhat pathetic light or they're bitter or angry,'' he
explains. ``But this character is really more positive _ a
resourceful man who has been through the ringer. This movie shows
how far someone can come in reclaiming his life.''
 &HT;    Speaking from his home amid the woods of Bedford, N.Y., Reeve
has made incredible progress since the accident. Many thought he
wouldn't live out the year let alone have a career.
 &HT;    Now as an actor he has a unique opportunity to show an audience
at least a small part of what being a quadriplegic really entails.
For him this is not just acting.
 &HT;    ``Jason's experiences are very close to mine,'' he says. ``For
example, he experiences a 'pop off.' This means that some part of
the hose he depends on for breathing becomes separated from the
vent, or a hole develops in the hose. That's happened to me a
number of times. I stopped getting air and had absolutely no
breath.
 &HT;    ``And when we did that scene in the movie we did it for real.
The poor actor playing the nurse was terrified, but I told her it
was perfectly safe. There were actually nurses around and others
who could reconnect the vent in a second. I can also breathe off
the vent for short periods of time, so there was no real danger.
But when you see the pop-off on the screen, it's real. I'm actually
not breathing.''
 &HT;    It certainly takes Hitchcock's concept of the thriller a step
beyond. ``I think audiences will see what it's really like to go
through some of these very anxious moments,'' says Reeve. ``They
will see how those moments can be lonely and frustrating when
someone is just learning to cope with the situation.''
 &HT;    In the original film James Stewart played a photographer who was
sidelined with a broken leg. ``Our movie updates the story. The
idea is to raise the stakes,'' says Reeve. ``To do the same story
but with a ... quadriplegic puts the lead character in so much more
jeopardy. We wanted to create something exciting that forges new
ground.''
 &HT;    Hannah says Reeve was a joy to work with. ``He has a sparkle in
his eye that is sort of hypnotic and it kind of shoots out across
the room and tantalizes and hypnotizes you. He's got so much energy
and life it's just intoxicating.''
 &HT;    In his own life of course, Reeve has become a hero to millions
around the world since his accident. Besides directing, he has
narrated the film ``Without Pity,'' a plea for the disabled to
enjoy more rights in society. He's also penned a best-selling
autobiography, ``Still Me,'' which has helped ease his huge medical
bills.
 &HT;    In between he crisscrosses the country campaigning for a
national spinal cord registry and other legislation to help further
rights for the handicapped. His 37 year old wife Dana, (``my
rock'') is now rehearsing for a Broadway show, ``More to Love,''
and their son Will, 6, is at school. He also sees a lot of his
children from a previous relationship, Matthew l8, and Alexandra
15.
 &HT;    Reeve says of his wife: ``We're very much in love. Whether I
have zero recovery or full recovery our relationship will
survive.''
 &HT;    Progress, he says, is slow but perceptible. When he turned 43,
just four months after the accident, he couldn't blow out his
candles. Now when they wheeled in a cake for his 46th birthday he
proudly blew out the lot.
 &HT;    Through practice, he can now breathe without the ventilator for
up to 30 minutes a day. He exercises for three hours daily and is
now able to sneeze _ something he couldn't do a couple of years
ago.
 &HT;    But he still loses his cool when people, some of them doctors,
describe his quest as futile. And he insists he doesn't worry about
his medical insurance running out. ``By that time,'' he says,
``I'll be up and walking.''

<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the
Holidays'' book is offered at the end of this article. THIS
INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, the simple act of setting the table means
creating a backdrop festive enough for holiday meals. And what
could be more glorious than a table laden with fruit? Fruit is
nature's bounty and an eloquent symbol of its richness.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch and Flemish masters immortalized fruit, as well as
flowers, in their prettiest still lifes. But it was the French,
during the 17th and 18th centuries, who refined fruit centerpieces
into soaring pyramids of glistening cherries and grapes; elaborate
epergnes whose branches were filled with strawberries, figs and
miniature apples; or a single golden pineapple served up on a
pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   The best fruits for creating table decorations have sturdy skins
and can thrive without being refrigerated. Apples, oranges and
lemons, for example, may last several weeks; grapes stay pretty for
four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   Combining fruit is as rich an art as arranging flowers _ and
just as rewarding, if you learn to appreciate fruit for its color,
shape, texture and size, as you do your favorite blooms. Be simple
or be grand. A single pear crowning a slender candlestick can be as
eloquent as a lily in a bud vase. Or a tower of plums, pears and
grapes can have the intricacy of a lavish bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   You can make delectable arrangements with surprising ease.
Construct a tall cone of fruit simply by piercing each piece of
fruit with a toothpick, then piling the fruit in circles on a
Styrofoam form. Create sparkling table ornaments with a coat of
spray-on adhesive and a frosting of granulated sugar. A single
piece of fruit can shine, dressed with a ribbon, at each place
setting.
</P>
<P>
   For still richer arrangements, combine fruit with greenery.
Sprigs of princess pine or boxwood can enliven a fruit pyramid. Red
fruit will look even more vivid against bluish evergreens, such as
eucalyptus or white pine.
</P>
<P>
   Wired to a wreath or garland, apples and plums will resemble
luscious Christmas-tree balls. And don't forget artificial fruit: A
swag garnished with polystyrene fruit is both lightweight and
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit is so vibrant it can provide a color theme for your table
or the decoration of an entire dining room. Fruit can also spin a
mood. A spiky pineapple and the bright, sunny hues of oranges,
lemons and limes may call to mind the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   But what fruit does best is help you welcome the holidays, and
your guests, with one of nature's sweetest, most prized gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to try:
 &UR; SUGARED LEMONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A light coating of sugar turns lemons into sparkling
decorations. Although they're not edible, sugared lemons are
long-lasting and especially easy to make.
</P>
<P>
   For an informal centerpiece, fill a bowl with sugared lemons, or
set them in eggcups or small goblets and dot them across the table.
</P>
<P>
   To make them, you'll need lemons; bamboo skewers; Spray-Mount (a
quick-drying adhesive available at art-supply or crafts stores);
granulated sugar; a spoon; a bowl; and craft paper.
</P>
<P>
   Insert a skewer into one end of a lemon. Working over craft
paper, hold lemon by skewer and coat with Spray-Mount. Sprinkle
granulated sugar over lemon with spoon, holding the fruit over bowl
to catch granules that do not adhere. Set sugared lemon on clean
piece of craft paper to dry.
 &UR; SHEER FRUIT POUCHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gold-mesh bags filled with pears and lady apples or other fruit
can be grouped on a sideboard or as a centerpiece, or used singly
to mark each guest's place at the table. At the end of the evening,
your guests can carry them away.
</P>
<P>
   To make a pouch: Cut one piece each of gold tulle and
gold-metallic organza 4 inches wide and 8 inches long; pin
together.
</P>
<P>
   With scissors, round the two corners of one of the 4-inch sides.
Machine-stitch around the U, leaving the top open.
</P>
<P>
   Turn bag right side out, fill with fruit and tie with ribbon,
adding a sprig of grapes or an artificial ivy leaf and vine if you
wish. You may also want to trim the tops of the bags.
 &UR; FRUIT PYRAMID &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make a 12-inch apple pyramid, you'll need 40 to 50 dwarf
apples; boxwood sprigs; a 12-inch polystyrene cone; toothpicks;
scissors; and a pretty urn, footed bowl or platter. The same basic
technique can be used for larger pyramids made of different fruits,
or combinations of fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the point of the cone so the top is flat. Poke
toothpicks into bottoms of apples; insert on cone in rings,
starting with largest apples at the base. Finish top with one
apple. Fill in spaces by tucking short sprigs of boxwood between
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Set pyramid atop your desired container, adding more boxwood
sprigs beneath the bottom row of apples, if you wish.
 &UR; DECORATING WITH REDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ripe red fruit can transform an otherwise quiet dining room for
the holidays. Here are several simple, inexpensive ways to
incorporate a variety of fruits into your table setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a centerpiece, fill a silver or crystal footed bowl with
pears, apples, pomegranates, crab apples, and litchi nuts in
countless shades of crimson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tie individual red apples with sheer silver ribbon and place
one at each place setting. The shiny red apples make tasty gifts
for dinner guests, who can eat them with dessert or save them for a
healthy midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surround pillar candles, on heatproof plates or in wide glass
cylinders, with plump cranberries (the berries should reach no
higher than a quarter of the way up the sides of the candles).
</P>
<P>
   _ On a surface like a mantel or sideboard, perch red pears on
one pair of candlesticks, and make tiny wreaths of viburnum berries
to encircle another pair. Line the mantel or sideboard with
cuttings of greenery to provide contrast in texture and color, and
nestle a few more pieces of red fruit among the cuttings.
</P>

   Ripe red fruit and scarlet seat cushions on the Gustavian-style
dining chairs transform an otherwise quiet green-and-white dining
room for the holidays. On the antique brass-edged mahogany dining
table, a handblown Murano glass bowl holds pears, apples,
pomegranates, crab apples and litchi nuts in countless shades of
crimson; a single apple marks each place setting. A similar mix of
red fruits, the papery litchi contrasting with the smooth apples,
dresses up the mantel. In shimmering niches displaying a collection
of creamware, tiny wrapped gifts and still more red fruit add dots
of color.

<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the

INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With only gray skies surrounding it, a house in early winter can
look stark. But hang a wreath or a swag on the front door, and your
house will spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttings of evergreen are sweet compensation for the leaves that
are missing from most of the trees, and the tart hues of winter
berries are reminders that nature has not forgotten about color,
even though the garden is no longer in bloom. Add wide ribbons and
twinkling lights, and holiday spirit brims over.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians, who never willingly left a surface unadorned,
are sometimes credited with the custom of hanging Christmas wreaths
on front doors. In more recent years, front-door displays have
taken many forms, from flashy tinsel wreaths with silver-metallic
bows to electric-light garlands that spell out ``Season's
Greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The most eloquent outdoor ornaments, however, are usually simple
and natural, made from the hearty fruit and greenery that flourish
while almost all of the landscape hibernates.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's harvest abounds with unexpected textures and shapes,
such as spiky pinecones and smooth little eucalyptus seeds. And the
palette is more than the red and green we expect. We do get those
colors, of course, in abundance: scarlet cranberries, blood-red
rose hips, crimson Pyracantha and a cavalcade of greenery _
silver-green eucalyptus, blue-green cedar, deep-green boxwood, and
the astonishing chartreuse and olive-green of the intriguingly
named golden hinoki false cypress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the tangy purple of privet berries, the spongy
gold of kumquats and the yellow pods and wild-red centers of
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   To make decorations for your front door, you may find all the
raw materials you need growing in your own yard or garden, but if
you don't, visit garden centers, florists, Christmas-tree lots,
even greengrocers.
</P>
<P>
   If the greenery you have chosen feels sappy or prickly, be sure
to wear work gloves. And remember that although there is nothing
wrong with a big spray of holly tied with a red bow, embellishing
the traditional recipes can yield lovely results. For example, try
finishing a large wreath with crisscrossed strings of cranberries
instead of a bow. (See instructions below.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you have learned how to cut and wire greenery, outdoor
ornaments are easy to construct and make enjoyable projects for
brisk winter days, especially when you are working with fragrant
greens. If you select cuttings that are as fresh as possible, and
the weather stays cold, your outdoor displays should last for
weeks, spreading holiday cheer throughout the season.
 &UR; CRANBERRY-LACED WREATH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This large, cranberry-wrapped wreath looks as handsome on a
window or wall as it does on a front door. You can also make two
small wreaths and strands of ribbon and cranberries to frame it _
or to decorate an interior window or mirror.
</P>
<P>
   To make the entire arrangement, you'll need a 20-inch tubular
straw wreath form; two 6-inch single-wire wreath forms; floral
pins; 24-gauge floral wire; cranberries; 4-inch-wide ribbon; and
golden hinoki false cypress. We chose this greenery because the
dark cranberries stand out against its varied hues of green;
light-colored fancy cedar can also be used.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the large wreath, place the straw wreath form on a
table and, using floral pins, attach sprigs of greenery all the way
around. Vary the wreath's color by alternating light, medium and
dark greens.
</P>
<P>
   2. To make cranberry strands: First twist one end of a length of
floral wire into a knot. String cranberries, one by one, onto wire,
piercing each berry from end to end. Finish the strand with another
knot, to keep berries on wire.
</P>
<P>
   3. To decorate the wreath, lay strands of berries on the wreath
to plot a crisscross pattern; use floral pins to indicate where the
strands intersect. Be sure the ends of the strands fall on the back
of the wreath. When you are pleased with the pattern, anchor the
cranberry strands with floral pins.
</P>
<P>
   Draping the cranberry strands can be difficult so, if possible,
have someone help you: One person holds the wreath and the other
weaves the strands.
</P>

   4. To complete the doorway decorations, make two wreaths using
6-inch wire wreath forms, floral wire and sprigs of golden hinoki
false cypress. Secure the end of the floral wire to the wire form.
Place a few sprigs of greenery on the form, and wrap the wire
around the cut ends and the form several times, securing the
greenery to the form; do not cut the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Add more sprigs, overlapping the first ones by about half; wrap
with wire. Continue adding sprigs until the form is completely
covered. Cut and wrap the wire to secure.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the small wreathes from nails placed above opposite sides
of the door. Thread two cranberry strands and a long length of
satin ribbon through the two wreaths. The ribbon and cranberry
strands should swoop gracefully above the door.
</P>
<P>
   When the ribbon and cranberry strands are positioned correctly,
cut the ribbon ends on a diagonal.

A FRATERNITY OF INCLUSION FACES EXCLUSION

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ His name was Alfred Kovner _ Koko, his friends
called him. I never knew him. He was killed in the Pacific before I
was born. Every year, a group of guys gathers in his name. The
dinner is sponsored by the Temple University chapter of my college
fraternity, Pi Lambda Phi, of which Kovner was a member.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades since I graduated, I've attended this dinner only
a half dozen times. It's held right after the election season, when
I'm usually wiped out. This year I received phone calls urging me
to show up.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in better than a decade, 11 of the 50 or so
Pi Lam graduates from my era were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   We were a varied bunch _ a physician, a dentist, two lawyers,
three independent businessmen, the vice president of a huge
international entertainment company and the head of an Ivy League
graduate school. And, of course, a humble newspaper scribbler or
two.
</P>
<P>
   We live in different cities and do different things. What
connects us at this stage of life is simply this: We'd known one
another intimately before we became what we are now, for better or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   We also had this in common: Years ago, we'd been adrift at a
huge, impersonal urban university of 40,000 students. We all needed
a cordial, human connection to the place. We'd chosen this
fraternity from the dozen or so on campus at the time because it
had an open charter. It wouldn't deny anybody membership on the
basis of race or creed.
</P>
<P>
   Most fraternities then were exclusionary and openly racist. One
of Pi Lambda Phi's chartered purposes is to combat prejudice, both
on campus and in the larger society. In my time there, Pi Lam at
Temple was about half Jewish, half almost everything else _ from
upstate New York Irish to Filipino to urban Greek to white-bread
Lutheran. No blacks applied for membership during my era. If any
had, we would have taken them in, provided they'd been sufficiently
demented.
</P>
<P>
   But it was years until my campus chapter became fully racially
integrated. In my time on the Temple campus, African-Americans had
their own fraternity, and racial tensions were high enough during
my student years to provoke race riots across the country. All of
us had kept in touch with at least some of the others, so we were
able to reconstruct what had gone on in the lives of many who
weren't present. Most were pursuing careers in the professions,
education, commerce and the media. Most still were with their first
wives, although one guy who showed up Friday night has a new wife
only a few years older than my daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of us have prospered. Two are dead. One guy did eight
years for drug dealing. Another won't attend another Kovner dinner
until 2018 _ unless he finds a better lawyer for his appeal than
the one he hired when he got busted. At that dinner, we got some
bad _ but, I suppose, predictable _ news. The university has banned
the Temple Pi Lam chapter for four years, something about too much
noise and boozing.
</P>
<P>
   There's a rational context to that. Every campus now has
drinking problems that dwarf what went on in our time, and
fraternities are tempting targets. Their parties take place at
regular intervals and at the same place every week.
</P>
<P>
   This ban could kill the house. In fact, it seems designed to do
just that. So, we'll all write letters to the university
administration, begging them not to wipe out our old fraternity
chapter. We'll tell them that this organization, for all its
conspicuous warts, was a profoundly positive force in the youthful
lives of a few thousand men who treasure that experience in middle
age and beyond. They might listen; probably not, though.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, then my old fraternity chapter is dead, a victim
of changing times, and nobody at my old university will have the
chance to build the vivid, gleeful memories I carry around with me.
Come next year, we'll hold the annual Kovner dinner anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But it might not be the same.

 APARTMENT INVESTORS SHOULD LOOK BEYOND LUXURY   (ATTN: Seattle,
Boston, New York, Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles, San Diego,
Minneapolis, Miami)
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CORRIE M. ANDERS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A group of real estate investors recently
purchased a 1920s-era apartment building here that was quite
elegant beneath its dowdy brick veneer. The 15-unit building,
located in an up-and-coming neighborhood, cost $1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The price averaged out to $95 per square foot for the property,
considerably below the going rate of $200 to $250 per square foot
for apartment buildings a few blocks away in the posh Pacific
Heights and Marina District neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury ``Class A'' buildings ``have gotten too expensive,'' said
real estate agent Craig Lipton, who put together the investment
group that purchased the 1920s-era property. They spiffed up the
building and were able to double the rent on vacant apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Lipton's group may be setting the pace for the next investment
trend: bypass luxury apartment buildings and fashionable addresses
in favor of Class B apartments.
</P>
<P>
   That is the studied advice from two prominent firms involved in
real estate, which note the luxury apartment market may be running
out of gas after roaring down the freeway for the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Focus investments more on B-grade apartments _ which are in
greatest demand,'' recommended Land Lease Real Estate Investments,
a New York-based investment firm, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, a New
York consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The advice was contained in ``Emerging Trends in Real Estate
1999,'' an analysis prepared for the two firms' clients, such as
pension funds and insurance companies. However, the report's
insights could prove advantageous for smaller investors as well.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive year, San Francisco was ranked as the
best place in the nation to invest in commercial real estate.
Following the cable car city in the top 10 were Seattle, Boston,
New York, Chicago, the District of Columbia, Los Angeles, San
Diego, Minneapolis and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Emerging Trends'' looked at all types of commercial
properties, it noted that the rental market was the precursor for
the entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   Here are snippets of how real estate will fare in the cities
ranked among the top 10 for investments in 1999, according to the
report:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The rental market is so tight that new apartment
projects coming on line ``should be winners.'' Nonetheless, the
apartment market will ``top off'' during 1999. But The Asian
economic crisis or a long collapse of high-tech stocks could ``send
Silicon Valley into decline and cool the entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The region has a dearth of apartments, therefore new
rental projects ``will be successful without softening the market
significantly.'' For an even deeper peek into the crystal ball,
``watch the San Francisco market for what will happen in Seattle;
it trails by 12 months.'' But economic turmoil in Asia and
high-tech employment could dampen the market. Other potential
problems include the government's antitrust case against the
Microsoft Corp. and layoffs at the Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Apartments are benefiting from high employment levels.
But demand could be short-circuited if Wall Street nosedives and
hurts the city's financial district.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city's 24-hour environment is being enhanced by
investors who are converting old office buildings into rentals. But
apartment prices ``have to level at some point'' and the city could
be hurt by a collapse on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The apartment market _ it's especially tight in
Orange County _ will have a strong 1999 and will peak in 2000 as
``for rent'' signs go up on newly constructed apartments. But the
region's biggest worry is the Asian economic situation.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Apartment owners have done well recently, especially
in northern areas where bio-technology companies are clustered.
While demand is strong currently, new construction coming on line
will level off rents.
</P>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Apartment vacancies barely register in this
Midwestern city. While the commercial market overall is peaking, it
``should sustain a slow growth track and not soften
appreciatively.''
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The forecast did not take note specifically of
apartments. But it warned investors to ``stay away from upscale
condos'' because ``development has been out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO and WASHINGTON, D.C. _ The report did not specifically
address the rental markets in these cities. However, it noted that
the commercial market in Chicago has ``not peaked yet.'' In
Washington, office construction is reaching saturation in suburban
Virginia, while suburban Maryland offers development opportunities
and downtown has rebounded with dramatic rent increases for office
space.

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``Emerging Trends'' study also offered this advice for
apartment investors for 1999: Consider B-grade apartments. Most
developers have built apartments for the well-to-do because it's a
niche with higher profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bulk of apartment renters aren't affluent'' and can't
afford either to purchase single-family homes or to rent Class A
units.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrate on apartments in 24-hour cities such as San
Francisco, Boston, New York and Chicago _ especially near subway or
light rail stops. ``Empty-nester baby boomers will target
apartments in those areas as they make a lifestyle shift from
family raising to enjoying a more convenient lifestyle,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Projects in and around 24-hour city cores are typically hard
to build, but they're almost failure proof in current markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Make sure that apartment units can be adequately wired for
faxes, computers and extra phone lines _ a must for business people
who conduct some of their work at home and upwardly mobile
Generation Xers.
</P>
<P>
   Target senior housing. Especially in short supply are rentals
for healthy seniors who can live in independent residences. The
study recommended that investors avoid nursing homes as a
specialized business ``fraught with risks.''

CATE BLANCHETT IS COMMANDING ATTNETION AS ELIZABETH I 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth I is the quintessential English historic icon _
the ``virgin queen'' who ruled for 45 years in her nation's golden
age.
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett is a 28-year-old Australian stage and screen
actress.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett portrays the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn in
director Shekhar Kapur's grand, if fictionalized, costume drama
``Elizabeth,'' which opens Friday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Elizabeth as she's imprisoned in the Tower as a
teenager and faces the threat of death at the hand of her Catholic
half-sister, Queen Mary. She's separated from her first love,
Robert Dudley (played by Ralph Fiennes' brother, Joseph), because
he may be a traitor to her cause. The film ends with Elizabeth's
coronation in 1558 at the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So how does a young Australian play an English monarch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Blanchett says in a phone interview from New York. ``I
won't work in reaction to what others have done. I'd seen the BBC
version with Glenda Jackson (``Elizabeth R'') when I was in high
school. I watched the Bette Davis film (``Virgin Queen'') later and
I did a lot of reading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I also went to the National Portrait Gallery,'' says
Blanchett, whose eyebrows and eyelashes were bleached, her hairline
shaved and half her hair dyed white for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we all discussed the fact that this would not be a totally
accurate historical portrait of Elizabeth,'' she emphasizes. ``That
was never the intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did go back to out of frustration, particularly at male
historians who dwelled on her so-called virginity, were the letters
she wrote. It was there I could see the mechanics of her brain and
her thought processes and the way she was able to play people off
against each other, as well as her extraordinary intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Elizabeth's interior life will always be speculation
and fictitious. We know the events in history and the impact she
had upon England, but how she felt about things is always
invention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The little things helped,'' adds Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned how robust she was and that she liked men who
hunted, danced and were agile. She was vigorous as a human being.
The Elizabethan Age was an electric, volatile age. It's not as
staid as the BBC version of her life would have us believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, she was in her element in front of a large crowd.
She had the instincts of a performer and she was aware of dramatic
impact and the symbolism of gestures.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett is a graduate of Australia's National Institute of the
Dramatic Arts (where Mel Gibson and Judy Davis once played opposite
each other in ``Romeo and Juliet'') and moved from the stage into
such movies as ``Paradise Road,'' ``Oscar and Lucinda'' and ``Thank
God He Met Lizzie,'' which played at this year's Seattle
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Her performances have been singled out in reviews, over such big
names as Glenn Close, Frances McDormand and Ralph Fiennes. She has
a gravity and grace onscreen that commands attention. Her Elizabeth
is accessible, savvy and strong.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Aussie and ``Elizabeth'' co-star Geoffrey Rush
(``Shine'') says, ``She's great, the talk of the town in an
extraordinary breed of young Australian actors,'' including Miranda
Otto, Toni Collette, Rachel Griffiths and Matt Day. Director
Michael Rymer, whose film ``Angel Baby'' won several Australian
Film Institute awards, says simply, ``She's the one to watch.''
High praise, but they're compliments that make Blanchett blanch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very nice thing for Geoffrey to say but I think what
distinguishes me is what distinguishes them. There's no sense of
homogeneity at the moment in the Australian film industry as far as
actors. All the actors you name embrace their differences, which I
think is really healthy. And it's hard in Australia because we're
farther away from America, which is a comparatively enormous film
industry, so it's rarer we even get seen overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   As an Australian, did she have any concerns about foraying into
English territory? ``Not at all. I actually balk at the idea of
`nationalism.' It's a very conservative concept and I relish
working with a disparate group of people. The idea of working with
(Indian director) Shekhar was what excited me about this project.
Nothing is purely an Australian _ or American _ film anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, none of the directors I've worked with lately are
Australian. I've just done three films with British directors _
`The Talented Mr. Ripley' with Anthony Minghella (who won Oscars
for `The English Patient'), `Pushing Tin' with Mike Newell and `An
Ideal Husband' with Oliver Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Italian-English-Australian crews with a British and
Australian cast on one; an American and Australian cast and an
English director on another. There is no purely national filmmaking
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Was her transition from the stage to the screen easy? ``It
depends on the role,'' she says. ``It's important to know the style
in which everyone involved in a project is working. You can tailor
your instincts to the style so you're all involved in the same
film.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, I'm doing David Hare's play `Plenty' next year at
the Almeida in London and I'm really excited about it, but that
play terrifies me because I have no idea yet how to approach it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with film is you have a time lag before you know
whether it all works or not. In the theater, you find out each
night whether you've communicated something to the audience. You're
dislocated from the audience in film and in some ways, it's
dissatisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett laughs, ``It's not until, God willing, you're in the
supermarket and someone stops you and asks what it was like to work
with Ralph Fiennes (her co-star in `Oscar and Lucinda'). Then you
know someone's actually gone to see your film.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actress, who married Andrew Upton in June of last year,
says she's not interested in developing projects aimed at steering
her toward stardom, no matter how great the feeling when she's
recogized in the express line at the local store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in pushing myself forward because I think
human beings often push too hard in a totally wrong direction,''
she says. ``I'm fluid about work and so far I've been lucky enough
to be in the right place at the right time without having to push
my photograph around a lot. I feel better and more secure if I've
gotten the job because of the previous work I've done. If I don't
get cast because my profile's not high enough, then it's probably
not the right film for me to do anyway.''

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle is like a major tattoo exhibition: Walk down a
busy street on Capitol Hill, around Pioneer Square or in the
University District and body art is everywhere _ arms, legs,
shoulders, necks, even cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the city is moving into a post-grunge era where tattoos may
become unhip.
</P>
<P>
   One-time ravers now find themselves moving up the corporate
ladder, where tattoos are not part of the uniform. One
thirtysomething investment banker says he had his tattoo removed by
a laser process last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my colleagues to know,'' he said, explaining why
he didn't want his name used. ``That is exactly why I had it
removed. I never thought the day would come when I would feel
embarrassed about my tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years tattoo artists thrived as the craze grew across
age groups. If you had firm skin, you weren't too old to get a
tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   But tattoos don't fade away, and the trend inevitably will.
Unless you can fork over several hundred dollars and have a high
pain threshold, you'll live with your body art for the rest of your
life.
</P>
<P>
   Tattoo removal by laser _ in which the ink compounds are broken
down and absorbed by the body _ is expensive, painful, may leave a
scar and is only 90 percent successful. Still, those who can no
longer live with their decorations are opting for laser treatment,
which currently is the best method of removal, say dermatologists.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Johnson, 28, a Seattle construction worker got his first
tattoo _ a large scorpion bearing his birth date _ on his right
shoulder when he was 17. He later got a second, smaller tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's keeping the smaller one for the time being, he's not
comfortable with the scorpion body art he once loved to show off
and he makes a point of covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its gaudy looking and pretty big,'' he said. ``T-shirts cover
it, but I can't wear a tank top.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he sometimes forgets that the tattoo is there ``until I
see it in the mirror and say, `Good god!'.''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, getting a tattoo 10 years ago was cool because it
wasn't trendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to do something that is trendy,'' he said. ``It's kinda
embarrassing (now) when I'm out swimming or something. I'm
conscious of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He had two laser sessions with Dr. Peter Odlend, a dermatologist
on Capitol Hill, and will need four more treatments. At around $300
a session, to remove the tattoo completely will cost about $1,800,
and this is with a small discount, since Johnson's wife, Amy, works
for Odlend.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson paid $50 to get the tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good exchange,'' he said of the far higher cost for
removal, ``and it is more painful than getting the tattoo, but I'll
just be glad when it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Johnson, 28, had her tattoo done for $30 when she was 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always wanted it,'' she said. ``(But) everybody has a
tattoo today, it's too trendy. Now you're different if you don't
have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her tattoo _ a sunshine with a face _ was on her hip
and not often noticeable, she still wanted it gone. She had it
removed by a dermatologist in Boston about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the removal procedure was much more painful than
getting the tattoo. She was fortunate though, since she did not
have to pay. The dermatologist she worked for then was testing
different lasers and she volunteered to be a guinea pig. Laser
procedure to remove a similar tattoo would cost around $1,500
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kinda glad I don't have it,'' Amy Johnson said. ``The
yellow pigment is still there and there is a slight scar, but you
can barely see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dermatologists say the laser technology most commonly used in
tattoo removal works best on black and blue but does not respond
well to yellow, green and red. The latter three colors each require
a different laser for more effective removal, but since the lasers
cost about $150,000 a piece, dermatologists generally do not have
the full range, says Goffe.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor in tattoo removal is the type of ink that was
used, said Odlend. Organic ink can be removed more easily than the
resistant metallic dye.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller tattoos in a single basic color are easier to remove and
obviously less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Odlend said he talks to every patient about the possibility of
scarring and how much of the tattoo can be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they're pretty decided they're going to get laser when
they get here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a higher risk of scarring if the tattoo is on the
shoulder. Keloid scars _ a reddish growth of collagen _ develop
more easily on that part of the body, said Odlend.
</P>
<P>
   Darker skin is more susceptible to scarring, which explains why
African Americans have more problems with keloids, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Renner, 18, chose laser removal because he didn't like the
look of his tattoo. The tattoo was an incomplete abstract design.
</P>
<P>
   Renner went to Dr. Ben Goffe, a dermatologist also based on
Capitol Hill, who said it will take at least six sessions, $300
apiece, to remove the tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Each procedure starts with the application of a local
anesthetic, which eases the pain but doesn't totally deaden the
area.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent session, Renner lay still and tried not to wince
as Goffe, wearing protective goggles, used a steady hand to guide
the laser over the tattoo as though he were tracing the design.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like snapping rubber bands as the laser started to
work, creating what looked like little red sparks as it penetrated
the skin and dissolved the ink.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, a trail of blood followed the laser. Renner felt
pain but didn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has high pain threshold,'' Goffe said. ``Some people cannot
take it and need more anesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Each session lasts no longer than 15 minutes. The next treatment
can be done only after the previous session heals, which usually
takes about six weeks. Depending on the size of the tattoo, the
full treatment, which might require six or seven sessions, could
take more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Laser technology has become more effective over the years, said
Goffe, and the chance of scarring is less than for other methods of
cosmetic removal.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Estrada, a Seattle dental assistant, said she was not
given that option. She went to a plastic surgeon a few years ago
and had her tattoo surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terribly painful and got infected,'' she said. ``I
thought he was going to use a laser, but I think he used a blade. I
just went with it anyway because I wanted it out so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She paid about $500, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada was 21 when she got her tattoo, an army insignia on her
left ankle, just above the heel. She regretted it shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out with a bunch of people in Texas, got drunk and got
the tattoo,'' she said. ``I'm not a tattoo type of person. I never
liked it and wanted it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people who get tattoos know what they're doing and don't
get them on impulse, say tattoo artists. Many who have tattoos
agree.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Daniel Berg, associate professor of dermatology at
the University of Washington, said ``most people get tattoos in
their teens and have not figured out what they want to do with
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So those who choose a statement of undying love, such as ``I
love Julie'' may be well advised: Don't get too many colors.

HONORING THE HUMANITY OF JONESTOWN'S VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Seven days after he learned that two of his
daughters and his grandson had died in the mass murder-suicide of
Jonestown, the Rev. John V. Moore delivered his Sunday sermon to
his United Methodist congregation in Reno, Nev. He had not planned
to speak, but his wife Barbara convinced him the effort was
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, she says: ``It was a testimony of love for
our family and the frailty of the human spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moores, who now live in Davis, Calif., have been married and
joined in Christian ministry for 55 years. With their living child,
Rebecca, a professor of religion and philosophy at the University
of North Dakota, they have labored for two decades to keep their
daughters _ and all those who died at Jonestown on Nov. 18, 1978 _
from being one-dimensionalized as poor, stupid sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family refused to be imprisoned by shame,'' Barbara Moore
said. ``Now, for the first time in 20 years, there is a sense
(among the public) of the humanity of the people who died in
Jonestown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moores' dead girls, Carolyn and Annie, shatter all the
lonely loser stereotypes that experts tend to slap on people who
join cults like Jim Jones' Peoples Temple. They came from a close
and loving home that thrived on a solid commitment to classic
Christian service and social justice.
</P>
<P>
   The biblical quotation that adorned the Peoples Temple
stationery _ the one from Matthew 25:35-40 about serving Jesus by
helping the poor, sick and imprisoned _ was practically the Moore
family credo.
</P>
<P>
   In the years the Moore children were growing up, they shared
their home with some 15 kids who needed a safe, loving place to
heal. They marched with their parents in rallies for civil rights
and against the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   While serving as pastor at San Francisco's Glide Memorial Church
in 1965, John Moore preached about the open inclusion of
homosexuals in the Methodist Church. He picketed vineyard owners
with Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers. He and Barbara counseled
college students about everything from unplanned pregnancies to
accepting or resisting the military draft.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn's husband, Larry Layton, discovered Jim Jones and the
Peoples Temple when Layton was serving alternate duty as a
conscientious objector at a state hospital. (The only person
convicted after the massacre at Jonestown, Layton is serving a life
sentence.) Even before the Moores' easy-going dog, Willy, broke
character and growled at meeting Jim Jones, John and Barbara had
misgivings about the charismatic pastor. There was too much ``Jim
says'' in Carolyn's letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That adulation of Jim Jones, that idolatry and the secrecy and
paranoia were there from the beginning,'' John said. ``When I first
met him (then realized Carolyn was intimately involved with him), I
thought, `Oh, my God. Here's another Elmer Gantry.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the Moores also saw their daughter ``living out the guiding
spiritual principles'' that their whole family had shared. And they
knew that drawing a line in the sand and alienating Carolyn was the
quickest way to lose her.
</P>
<P>
   When Annie, too, joined the Peoples Temple after nursing school,
John and Barbara tried to combat their mistrust of Jones by
focussing on the multitude of Christian positives in the church,
from its diverse and multi-ethnic population to its work with the
poor, uneducated and mentally retarded. As Barbara writes in an
essay on a comprehensive Jonestown web site
(www.und.nodak.edu/dept/philrel/ jonestown/witness.html): ``I told
myself that some good things were happening in Peoples Temple and
that it would probably phase out in time as many movements do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jonestown ended in unthinkable horror, with the murder and
suicide of more than 900 members in the jungles of Guyana. Among
the 409 children was Carolyn's 4-year-old son Jim Jon, or ``Kimo.''
His father was not Layton but Jim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last 20 years, the media, academic and religious
attention have centered on Jones. The hundreds of others who died
in Guyana became only a nameless, faceless mass, posthumously
represented by grotesque photographs of poisoned, bloated bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Such dehumanization, the Moores contend, not only profanes the
inherent sanctity of each Peoples Temple member's life, but
dangerously deludes the rest of us. If we believe that Jones was
simply a wacko and that everyone who followed him was too, we'll
miss any chance we have to learn from Jonestown, to acquire tools
that can help us discern the false prophet from the true servant of
God.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't simply that something went wrong along the way with
Peoples Temple,'' John said. ``The seeds of destruction were always
there amid all the positive stuff. It was more like an escalation
of compromise. They kept cutting corners until they were so
compromised, they really were different. By the time they got to
Guyana, they thought the end justified even the most extreme
means.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years John, Barbara and Rebecca have viewed
their role in the Jonestown tragedy as a calling. At first, it was
a hard and bitter one. Over time, it's become a calling to
experienced counseling, consolation and _ when asked _ warning. As
John writes on the Web site: ``When we are in the midst of pain and
suffering, we hear a voice within asking, `Why?' But there is
another voice asking a different question: `What will you do?' The
`Why?' question was not answered, but I knew that I had the power
to make choices ... We chose to work with God to bring whatever
good we could out of the tragedy of Jonestown.''

BORSCHT BELT MEDITATES A NEW EXISTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH FALLSBURG, N.Y. _ There is no herring here. No guys named
Shecky. No ``Dirty Dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days at the Brickman, Gilbert and Windsor hotels,
guests ate tons of herring, pickled and smoked. There was a surplus
of Sheckys, also pickled and smoked. Hordes of Jewish singles came
to mix, mingle and merengue.
</P>
<P>
   No more. The three Catskill Mountain hotels, former stars in the
constellation of ``Borscht Belt'' getaways, have been transformed.
Instead of all-you-can-eat playtime resorts, they have become an
all-you-can-meditate spiritual retreat.
</P>
<P>
   After a long slide toward oblivion, the three nearby properties
have been combined and resurrected into a 550-acre ashram, complete
with guru and swamis in residence. Carnivorous Jews from
metropolitan New York and New Jersey have given way to vegetarian
devotees from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oy vey'' has been replaced by ``Om Guru Om.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some locals grouse about its exemption from property
taxes, and some critics question its practices, the ashram's steady
growth during the past decade has fueled Catskill boosters' hope
that this once-vibrant region can reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has passed for what was here,'' said Leni Binder, a
member of the Sullivan County Legislature, whose family once ran a
small hotel. ``We're looking for new ideas to bring this community
back to where it should be. The ashram fits perfectly into that.''
</P>
<P>
   To put it mildly, the ashram is proof of a new regional tourism
slogan: ``These are not your grandmother's Catskills.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of the storied old hotels are still open, notably
Kutscher's Country Club, the Raleigh Hotel, and the Nevele Grande
Resort and Country Club. The area is also dotted with some smaller
hotels and bungalow colonies catering to Orthodox Jews who have
flocked here in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospitality industry _ while still the area's biggest
employer _ seems a small and fragile thing when compared with the
postwar glory days. Back then, several hundred hotels overflowed
with guests, and entertainers considered the area a new vaudeville
in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   All that is in the past. The old Brown's Hotel has been
converted into a condominium complex. The old Stevensville Lake
Hotel is being eyed as a resort for golf-loving Korean tourists.
The biggest of the old properties, the Concord Resort Hotel, has
been through bankruptcy proceedings and is scheduled to be sold at
auction Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of others have disappeared altogether, their manicured
grounds reclaimed by the mountain greenery, their foundations left
like empty dance floors in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple explanation for the decline: Children of
former Catskill regulars have turned their back on the old resorts.
Preferring the Caribbean and Europe, Aspen and Disneyland, they
have abandoned what their city-dwelling parents used to call ``the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shree Muktananda Ashram is a dramatic exception to the
downturn, a thriving, bustling community where thousands of
like-minded seekers flock every year to chant, contemplate, take
classes and do guruseva, offering ``selfless service to the ashram
and to the guru.''
</P>
<P>
   The ashram's guests are devotees of Siddha Yoga Meditation, a
practice with roots in India that is now headed by a charismatic
female swami named Gurumayi, whose photo seems to be everywhere at
the ashram. Upon arrival, a desk clerk hands a guest a Hershey's
chocolate kiss and says, ``It's from Gurumayi.'' Other omnipresent
portraits are those of her predecessors, Bhagawan Nityananda and
Swami Muktananda, who died in 1982 and for whom the ashram is
named.
</P>
<P>
   Siddha Yoga is built on the belief that divinity lies within all
people and that it can be experienced through meditation. In the
words of Muktananda, the message is: ``Honor your Self; Worship
your Self; Meditate on your Self; God dwells within you, as you,
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catskill Mountain ashram has become the movement's
international headquarters. Officials from its operating arm, the
SYDA Foundation, say they cannot estimate the number of devotees _
there are no dues or official membership lists _ but say there are
more than 500 meditation centers worldwide. There also are smaller
ashrams in Australia, England, India, Mexico and the United States,
including one in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   The Siddha Yoga movement first came to the Catskills in the
1970s, after Muktananda was drawn by the mountains, the weather,
the sparse population and the proximity to New York City, just 90
miles away, according to an official history.
</P>
<P>
   After using rented quarters for several years, in 1979 the
organization bought the Gilbert Hotel, followed by the Windsor in
1983 and the Brickman in 1986. The Windsor had already made the
leap from resort to retreat; it had been owned since 1976 by the
Transcendental Meditation movement, which sold it to SYDA. Years of
renovations followed the purchases.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the properties still look like well-tended
Catskill Mountain resorts, albeit with some key alterations. The
hotel pools have all been filled in, and meditation halls have
replaced the smoky nightclubs where comedians such as Henny
Youngman, Jackie Mason and Shecky Green got laughs with jokes such
as: ``What's the definition of mixed emotions? Watching your
mother-in-law drive over a cliff...in your new Cadillac.''
</P>
<P>
   The ashram also has made some big additions, most notably a
glass-enclosed pavilion the size of a football field, and nearby
concentric circles where devotees express themselves through dance
around a fire pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development over time has been done to create a beautiful
atmosphere, so you create beautiful feelings, and you create a
beautiful environment in every respect,'' said Dan Nakari, a
spokesman at the ashram.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, a typical day at the Brickman would have
included activities such as: ``Become a Glamour Doll'' beauty
clinic, ``Simon Sez'' by the pool patio, ``Sing-along at the
Steinway,'' and a night of Las Vegas-style entertainment and
dancing. Now there are courses in Hatha Yoga, meditation
instruction, and two-day programs such as ``There is no friend
greater than the Guru.'' Accommodations, including food, range from
$29 a night for a dorm-style room to $101 for a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real sense of calm here. Real peace,'' said Bernie
Clyne, who has lived at the ashram for more than a decade. In the
1950s, Clyne, 67, worked as a busboy at another resort,
Grossinger's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were exciting days. But now I prefer this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the boundaries of the ashram, the SYDA Foundation has
worked to make itself part of the community, hiring numerous local
contractors, sponsoring benefits for a local hospital, and making
donations such as $200,000 for a new firehouse and $10,000 to area
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movement is not without its critics, including some
former devotees who say they were harassed upon leaving the fold.
The organization has been publicity shy at least since 1994, when a
New Yorker magazine story raised questions about the movement's
leaders, history, practices, and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, it is common to hear complaints about the ashram's
tax-exempt status as a nonprofit religious organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is they don't pay taxes and they're not helping
the community,'' said Theresa Sussman, who owned the Windsor with
her husband for 36 years before they sold it in 1976. Yet even she
acknowledged that no hotel operators were interested in the old
hotel, so there was almost no chance that the Windsor would be on
the tax rolls today.
</P>
<P>
   To the ashram's credit, Sussman said, ``They keep the property
in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Other local business owners said they are thrilled the ashram
has brought new life to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had an uphill battle when they first arrived here,
because of the tax issues, but they've made long strides toward
convincing locals that they are good people,'' said Letty Steingart
of South Fallsburg, whose fourth-generation printing business had a
long relationship with the hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where you are, in Boston, here, wherever,''
Steingart added, ``some people are tolerant and some people aren't.
Remember, people didn't always tolerate Jews, and that's why they
came to the Catskills.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ben Kass has visited about a dozen colleges this year, but Yale
was the one that most seemed like his future home. ``I felt like I
really fit in there,'' the Newton South (Mass.) High School senior
muses, recalling his two trips to the clubby New Haven, Conn.
campus. His mother, Ellen Kass, remembers that he even called her
from the railroad station. ``He told me, `If they would let me stay
right now, I'd do it,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't Ben Kass smiling as he sits at his kitchen table on
a recent afternoon? Especially after having sent his application to
Yale a few days earlier, thereby placing himself squarely among the
school's early-decision pool?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I wanted to apply early or I was forced into
it,'' laments the 17-year-old, whose grade point average is 4.25
out of a possible 4.5. ``I can't even be sure anymore. But I do
know that everyone I know is applying early to college, and
everyone says you ought to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to November, seniors, once a time when a tiny number of
you rushed to send off early-admissions packets to a small number
of colleges. No more. A trio of early-admissions programs, one of
which can leave applicants little choice but to attend the chosen
school, now keeps tens of thousands of you _ and your parents _ up
late at night, laboring over lengthy application forms and
gotta-be-perfect essays long before the last falling leaf hits the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be only the cream of the crop that applied early,''
points out Kim O'Byrne, a guidance counselor at Wellesley High
School, where about 40 percent of last year's seniors filed early
applications. ``But now that pool includes kids who might be
marginal candidates for a particular school. They feel that by
applying early, they're sending a message to a school that they
really want to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   It also used to be _ as far back as the 1960s _ that only the
Ivies and a few other top Eastern colleges offered early admission.
But during the current academic year, 410 colleges from Palo Alto,
Calif., to Unity, Maine, have either ``early decision'' or ``early
action'' plans, according to the College Board. That's an increase
of 23 percent over last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the College Board in 1996 introduced an October
session of the SAT, in large part to accommodate seniors planning
to apply to college in November instead of waiting for the normal
Jan. 1 deadline. About 365,000 students took the new test that
year, and the number swelled to an estimated 400,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Curran a 17-year-old senior at The Pingree School &UR;  &LR; in
Hamilton, Mass. who began visiting colleges more than a year ago,
is applying early to Middlebury College. Her deadline arrives
today.
</P>
<P>
   To have it any other way, she feels, would leave her at a
disadvantage. ``It's just the general belief that your chances are
better of getting into college if you apply early,'' she says. ``If
I hadn't fallen in love with Middlebury, I would have applied
somewhere else now, because I feel there's a lot of pressure to
apply early. Everyone feels their chances are better if they apply
early.''
</P>
<P>
   When, say, Ben Kass calculates his chances of being admitted to
Yale, it doesn't matter that he's an advanced placement calculus
student, because the math is simple: Although slightly more than a
third of this year's freshman class at Yale applied early, those
particular students represented only one-ninth of all applicants.
Highly regarded Massachusetts schools such as Amherst, MIT, Tufts,
and Williams typically fill a similar slice of their admissions pie
with early applicants (see chart). At Harvard, the figure is even
higher, around 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools deny that they have different standards for early
and regular applicants, arguing that the early birds tend to be
more qualified. But who's listening?
</P>
<P>
   And so, the heat is on. Horace Simmonds, 18, is a B-plus student
at Winchester (Mass.) High School whose senior year is starting off
with a quartet of top courses and several hours of homework a
night. He also works 15 hours a week at a local mailbox company. He
has taken the SATs twice this fall, and has labored mightily over a
600-word essay that was part of his early application to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Simmonds is still trying to visit other colleges on weekends,
should Brown reject him. ``I want to get the relief of knowing I'm
going somewhere,'' he says of his decision to apply in early
November. ``But right now, it's very hard. The hours are turning
into days.''
</P>
<P>
   Early-admission procedures have quickened the pace of adolescent
lives. Some kids are taking their first SATs as early as the fall
of their junior year, rather than waiting until spring. Many now
begin their road trips to prospective colleges during the spring of
their junior year instead of the following summer. And, as is the
case with Simmonds, the beginnings of their long-awaited senior
years are being filled with the rush to assemble applications,
collect recommendations, and compose essays _ not to mention taking
more SATs and perhaps adding another campus overnight or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are already under a lot of pressure these days, and
adding this on top of it doesn't do them any favors,'' says Dale
Eldridge, whose son, Dan, is an early applicant to Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But the wrinkle that really raises the pressure is the one that
is part and parcel of ``early decision'': A student can apply early
to only one college and agrees to enroll there if admitted.
Translation: Don't tell the college of your choice six months from
now that you've changed your mind about where you'd like to spend
what will likely be the most important four years of your young
life. Never mind that if you commit now, you probably won't know
what kind of financial aid you'll receive until next spring.

MONEY FLOWS GET PLENTY OF ATTENTION 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their relentless effort to come up with new ways of
predicting the stock market, the nerds of Wall Street have come up
with a new tool: Money flows.
</P>
<P>
   Money flows are supposed to measure how much money is flowing
into or out of an individual stock or stocks. It does this by
measuring how many trades were at a higher price than the previous
one _ an uptick trade _ compared with the number at a lower price _
a downtick trade.
</P>
<P>
   This statistic has gained more attention because The Wall Street
Journal and Bloomberg News have begun listing money flow figures in
their reports on share prices performance.
</P>
<P>
   The money flow figures give you a detailed snapshot of the day's
trading by telling you whether there's more investing at higher
prices or lower prices for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I'm more inclined to tell average investors to look beyond
yesterday's trading and do some old-fashioned homework about a
company's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it (money flow figures) gives you a sense of a
stock's prospects over a long period of time,'' said Les Fox, a
portfolio manager at money management firm Dain Rauscher in
Houston, who added he doesn't pay much attention to money flow
data. ``I would view it as a short-term technical indicator.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested, you can now find a money flows table in
the Journal, which appears daily in its New York Stock Exchange
stock-quotations page. The table compares the dollar value of
uptick trades with the dollar value of downtick trades.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal calculates the money flow dollar value by comparing
the dollar value of all the trades where there was an uptick with
the dollar value of all the trades where there was a downtick. The
net gain or decline of the two figures at the end of the day is the
money flow for a stock or groups of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts use money flows to determine whether buyers are more
willing to bid up the price of a stock than sellers are willing to
push down a stock's value.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning is that a greater volume of stock trading on an
uptick indicates that buyers are more aggressive at snapping up
stocks than sellers are at selling them. The conclusion is that the
more aggressive investors mark the trend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DEFINE YOUR OWN GOAL
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But numbers can also paint an inaccurate portrayal of investor
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it to be technical data that's not very predictive for
the future movement (of stocks),'' said Fowler Cary Jr., president
of Companion Capital Management in Columbia, S.C., a money
management firm. ``It tells you what's currently going on.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more important for individual investors is to decide what
their investment goal is, put it down on paper and define how much
risk they're willing to shoulder, Cary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they've evolved that and formalized their investment
objective, it's pretty straightforward to go out and execute it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most fundamental stock analysts, Cary has little use for
picking stocks based on analyzing stock price movements.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of this debate is technical analyst Hamilton
Lewis, who finds the money flow figures telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you the psychological perspective of the public
investing at a particular time,'' said Lewis, who runs his own
money management firm in Houston. ``It's gauging where the
percentage of money into and out of the market stands at a given
place in time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KNOW DIRECTION OF FINANCES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he uses money flow figures as a contrarian indicator
to do the opposite of where money flows are going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public normally comes in and buys at the top of the
market,'' Lewis said. ``They then become impatient because what
they bought doesn't go any higher and they end up selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Many investors hurt themselves by becoming too occupied with
past performance of stocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at where the rabbit was vs. where the rabbit should
be moving,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   But even he said investors ultimately must stay focused on
buying stocks that look cheap, compared with their prospects, and
selling out at the most lucrative points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to be a very aggressive investor is to be in when
blood is on the streets,'' Lewis said. ``Funeral time, you want to
buy; wedding time, you want to sell.''

 UNDATED: ... next spring.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``As one of my wise old associate deans says, `Be careful of
early decision, because you might get in,''' says Bill Hiss, vice
president for administrative services at Bates College _ and a
self-described believer in early decision.
</P>
<P>
   Are teenagers ready to irrevocably choose a college nearly a
year before they actually go there? Matthew Lynch thinks he is, and
so the Pingree senior has made an early-decision application to
Duke after starting out last spring with a list of likely colleges
that totaled 50. His father, George, who in March helped him visit
11 Southern schools in 10 days, a trip that covered some 2,200
miles, agrees with his decision. ``I can't imagine him changing his
mind,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Linda Lynch, Matthew's mother, isn't so certain. Sitting
with her husband and only child at the dining room table one recent
evening, she voices her concern, over tea and homemade apple crumb
cake. ``He's a mature and responsible kid,'' she says of her son, a
B student who felt strongly that he wanted to make his college
selection early so he could go about the business of his senior
year in high school. ``But he's still a kid. And I worry that come
March, when this friend is going to college here and that friend is
going to college there, that he's going to wish he were someplace
other than Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits to colleges of an early, binding arrangement are
significant. For one thing, they lock up a sizable chunk of next
year's freshman class early in the game. For another, the schools'
``yield'' _ the percentage of kids admitted to a particular school
who actually enroll there _ is increased, an important factor in
college rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But some college administrators are troubled by the increasing
pressure that's being put on high school kids. ``The down side is
simply that these young men and women are still growing and
changing rapidly at this time of their lives,'' says Harry Payne,
president of Williams College. ``And gee, a year is a long time in
a young adult's life.''
</P>
<P>
   A student admitted under early decision can usually wriggle free
of the commitment only if the finanicial aid package he or she is
offered is insufficient. And colleges take a dim view of students
who apply for an early decision to more than one school. The
institutions involved invariably withdraw their offers of
acceptance in such cases, admissions officers say. In order to
ferret out miscreants, 30 to 40 independent schools, such as
Amherst, Williams, Wesleyan, and Dartmouth, share lists of the high
school seniors they admit by early decision.
</P>
<P>
   For Patrick English, a senior at Boston College High School, the
final decision between two schools was not easy. A top student and
captain of his cross-country team, English is a highly organized
kid who had decided even before entering high school that he
eventually wanted to apply early to college. Using a lined
notebook, he organized his possible choices this year into a kind
of tournament, complete with quarterfinalists, semifinalists, and
finalists. Then he meticulously listed the advantages and
disadvantages of his top two contenders, Dartmouth and the
University of Virginia. The former, for example, had a beautiful
campus but lousy weather. The latter offered friendly folks but had
some dorm rooms that were not air-conditioned. At times, Lynch
leaned toward Hanover, N.H. At others, he liked Charlottesville.
Meanwhile, the November deadline loomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I said to him, `Don't do this. Give
yourself more time,''' says Patrick's mother, Sally English. ``It's
so different now than when I went to college. It's part of the
whole accelerated pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick English eventually applied to the University of Virginia
_ ``I closed my eyes and I could see myself there'' _ and mailed
off his application 10 days early. He says he's comfortable about
his choice, and about making it now rather than later. ``I've just
always felt this need to apply early, to not have this ultimate
decision hanging over my head,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For some kids, however, the pressure of early application is
more than they want. Lauren Silva, ranked 20th in a Braintree
(Mass.) High School senior class of more than 300 students, would
not have been out of place in an early-application pool. She
visited eight colleges this year, especially liked Connecticut
College, and was prepared to apply early. ``I thought: `Everyone
else is going early, and if I don't I'll miss out,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But Silva changed her mind. She decided she wanted more time to
take her SATs again to improve her scores. She wanted more time to
work on her applications and her essays. And she wanted more time
to choose a college because, as she puts it, ``Whenever I visit a
school, I love it. I love them all.'' Says her mother, Helaine
Silva: ``She just wasn't ready. I'm pleased she's waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, however, more and more kids will be applying to
college early. And earlier. Wake Forest University, in
Winston-Salem, N.C., has an admissions option called ``early
decision single choice,'' whereby a student can apply any time
after the completion of his or her junior year in high school and
receive a decision within weeks. If accepted, the applicant must
agree to attend, meaning a college can be chosen some 14 months
before enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Too much too soon? Not to 17-year-old Meredith Katter, who
applied to Wake Forest in July, was accepted _ and made a
commitment _ during the first week of her senior year at
Lincoln-Sudbury (Mass.) Regional High School. ``Just getting the
whole thing out of the way was my main reason,'' Katter explains.
``All my friends are applying now, but I have it off my shoulders.
Wake Forest was a school I liked, but knowing that this was an
option definitely attracted me more.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ben Kass _ assuming he is accepted on or about Dec. 15, when
most early applicants begin to get the word from colleges _ Yale
may turn out to be the perfect choice. Maybe he'll like the
challenging academics, the friendly students, and even the jokes
about Harvard as much as he does now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a place I could be happy at,'' Kass declares as
he ponders the early commitment he's made and the push to get it
done, ``even if a month after I've been there I decide that UPenn
is really where I should have gone.''

A WEEKEND OF MANEUVERING LEADS SADDAM NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Sometimes in an international crisis, the toughest
task is to know when to take yes for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether President Clinton picked the right moment _ in the
predawn hours of Sunday morning _ is a question that only events in
Iraq in the next few days, weeks, and months can answer.
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth the frustration and the guff from macho types to
test any realistic chance that the best means of keeping Saddam
Hussein's regime from acquiring biological and chemical weapons in
quantity and the means of using them _ namely tough inspections _
can still work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a weekend of maneuvering that was bizarre and
maddening even by the standards of this eight-year melodrama, it
should be obvious that there is a chance worth testing because the
test is at long last clear.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply that Iraq has no basis for denying United Nations
inspectors anything they need _ whether it is access to particular
sites on timetables of their choosing or to a specific Iraqi
document. That is what UN Secretary General Kofi Annan _ a wobbler
at times over the weekend _ had in mind when he acknowledged Sunday
night that the era of escape clauses and compromises has ended.
Henceforth, he said, there will only be ``complete and
unconditional compliance,'' or there will be military action, with
no time for last-minute diplomacy or even warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In summing up the new reality, Annan was speaking for a world
whose willingness to tolerate Saddam Hussein has been steadily
sapped by the determined diplomacy (backed by credible threats of
force) of the Clinton administration for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great myths of this period _ propagated by hawk and
dove critics alike _ has been that US policy had abandoned all hope
of enforcing comprehensive arms control on Iraq and had retreated
to a new line of just keeping economic sanctions on in perpetuity.
In fact, the opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   But a year ago, the international support for both the
inspections regime and the sanctions had deteriorated seriously in
an atmosphere of weariness, economic opportunism, and Arab world
anger that the United States could be implacable toward Iraq but
soft toward Israel's occupying hardliners. Far from accepting this
unstable status quo, the president was determined to reverse it,
aware that it would take time. His ally was Saddam Hussein's
remarkable combination of evil and stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   With each crisis over Iraq's flouting of the inspection rules to
either hide records and material or block access, the diplomatic
noose tightened. In February _ when the United States and Britain
showed they were prepared to use force almost alone if necessary _
the result was a Security Council resolution making a future
military response in effect authorized in advance and tying Kofi
Annan personally to the unfettered operation of Ambassador Richard
Butler's inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
   When, predictably, Iraq first tested that resolve, then broke
its word for the zillionth time (most significantly in August), and
then attempted to halt all cooperation with the UN inspectors (at
the end of October), the time to yank the string arrived. This
time, Iraq got no help from China, Russia, or France and, most
dramatically, none from the core of the Arab world (Egypt, Syria,
Saudi Arabia, and the five smaller Gulf states) _ an atmosphere
helped immeasurably by the Clinton-brokered Wye Plantation
agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   This resolve continued through last weekend. When Annan tried to
call Iraq's conditional surrender on Saturday a step in the right
direction, the administration stopped him cold with one word _
unacceptable. The attack, first planned for Saturday evening, was
rescheduled for 24 hours later and stayed scheduled until all the
conditions set by Clinton before the weekend began were met.
</P>
<P>
   There are no illusions. No one is trusting anyone. What there
is, at last, is a test, in an atmosphere defined by Iraq's
international isolation. Either Saddam's hegemonic scheme will
evaporate under rigidly supervised disarmament or it will end under
a rain of bombs and missiles followed by strict containment.
</P>
<P>
   And arranging this test was worth the aggravation it produced
over a year of patience-trying diplomacy that has left Iraq with no
other alternative and no allies.
</P>

 &HT;    BRITAIN UNVEILS $9.6 BILLION PLAN TO CREATE 'LONDON MILLENNIUM
CITY'
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A 40-story Ferris wheel on the banks of the River
Thames, a ``City of Wine,'' new and improved museums and galleries
are among the $9.6 billion in improvements and attractions planned
for the millennium celebration here, government and business
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the umbrella of an initiative called ``London Millennium
City,'' the improvements are intended to maximize London's campaign
to be the world's focal point for celebrating of the dawn of the
new century. Many projects are underway or soon to begin, but this
was the first time they have been catalogued and presented
together.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing their plans at Whitehall Palace, tourism officials
predicted that the celebration here will begin on New Year's Eve
1999 with the ``biggest party on Earth'' spread through the
rambling city's pubs, night clubs and busy streets.
</P>
<P>
   Also on New Year's Eve, a huge celebration is planned at the Old
Royal Observatory -- where the world's official time is kept --
with live performances and fireworks. There also will be all-night
religious services at Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Among the planned attractions and improvements are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The British Airways London Eye: A 400-foot Ferris wheel across
the River Thames from the Parliament House and Big Ben tower. It
will be the highest observation wheel in the world and will provide
a 25-minute, slow-moving flight over the heart of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The New Tate Gallery of Modern Art: It will be one of the
three largest museums in the world and will showcase art of the
20th Century. This is the centerpiece of a $208 million
redevelopment alongside the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Millennium Bridge: The first new bridge over the Thames in 100
years linking the Tate Gallery to St. Paul's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Vinipolis: An attraction focusing on the wide world of wine
with multimedia tours, four restaurants and wine tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial renovations and expansions also are being planned
for the Royal Opera House, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Artillery
Museum, the British Museum, Geffrye Museum and Saler's Wells
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Britain's celebration is the $1.2 billion
Millennium Dome in Greenwich, about 7 miles down the Thames from
the center of London. The Dome will open Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The projects and programs are being funded from a combination of
private sector contributions and sponsorships as well as $3.2
billion being spent on millennium-related projects from the
national lottery.
</P>
<P>
   One reason British officials believe London will be in the
limelight for the millennial celebration is that the country
already has spent several years preparing while plans in other
cities are still being formed. ``When I have spoken to people in
other places they tell me that we are far and away ahead of other
countries in their preparations for the millennium,'' said Chris
Smith, the British secretary of state for Culture, Media and Sport.

   The region is adding 20,000 hotel rooms in the period leading up

New Year's celebration and have started booking guests. It can be

including entry to major attractions, dinner, champagne and
breakfast -- will run about $2,300 a couple.

 &HT;    BRITAIN UNVEILS $9.6 BILLION PLAN TO CREATE 'LONDON MILLENNIUM
CITY'
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.

   LONDON _ A 40-story Ferris wheel on the banks of the River
Thames, a ``City of Wine,'' new and improved museums and galleries
are among the $9.6 billion in improvements and attractions planned
for the millennium celebration here, government and business
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the umbrella of an initiative called ``London Millennium
City,'' the improvements are intended to maximize London's campaign
to be the world's focal point for celebrating of the dawn of the
new century. Many projects are underway or soon to begin, but this
was the first time they have been catalogued and presented
together.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing their plans at Whitehall Palace, tourism officials
predicted that the celebration here will begin on New Year's Eve
1999 with the ``biggest party on Earth'' spread through the
rambling city's pubs, night clubs and busy streets.
</P>
<P>
   Also on New Year's Eve, a huge celebration is planned at the Old
Royal Observatory -- where the world's official time is kept --
with live performances and fireworks. There also will be all-night
religious services at Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Among the planned attractions and improvements are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The British Airways London Eye: A 400-foot Ferris wheel across
the River Thames from the Parliament House and Big Ben tower. It
will be the highest observation wheel in the world and will provide
a 25-minute, slow-moving flight over the heart of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The New Tate Gallery of Modern Art: It will be one of the
three largest museums in the world and will showcase art of the
20th Century. This is the centerpiece of a $208 million
redevelopment alongside the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Millennium Bridge: The first new bridge over the Thames in 100
years linking the Tate Gallery to St. Paul's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Vinipolis: An attraction focusing on the wide world of wine
with multimedia tours, four restaurants and wine tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial renovations and expansions also are being planned
for the Royal Opera House, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Artillery
Museum, the British Museum, Geffrye Museum and Saler's Wells
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Britain's celebration is the $1.2 billion
Millennium Dome in Greenwich, about 7 miles down the Thames from
the center of London. The Dome will open Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The projects and programs are being funded from a combination of
private sector contributions and sponsorships as well as $3.2
billion being spent on millennium-related projects from the
national lottery.
</P>
<P>
   One reason British officials believe London will be in the
limelight for the millennial celebration is that the country
already has spent several years preparing while plans in other
cities are still being formed. ``When I have spoken to people in
other places they tell me that we are far and away ahead of other
countries in their preparations for the millennium,'' said Chris
Smith, the British secretary of state for Culture, Media and Sport.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Egan, the president of the London Tourist Board, said
the enormous cost will be offset by the tourist spending. ``All of
these attractions will have a huge return to the economy,'' he
said. ``There will be a lasting legacy for the city creating a
cityscape second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   The region is adding 20,000 hotel rooms in the period leading up

WHO ARE YOU CALLING STUPID?

   The scene at the ticket counter last week at the General Cinema
theaters in suburban Newton, Mass. could have been lifted from the
classic ``Saturday Night Live'' skit with John Belushi and Dan
Aykroyd shouting ``cheesebooga, cheesebooga, cheesebooga.'' Except
the litany that developed as patrons stepped up to buy was
``Waterboy,'' ``Waterboy,'' ``Waterboy.'' They were white, black,
male, female. All young. There were five different movies screening
that night, but ticket sellers said 80 percent of the tickets sold
were for ``The Waterboy,'' Adam Sandler's surprise blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   After shocking the movie industry last weekend by grossing $39.2
million and breaking many non-summer opening box office records,
``The Waterboy'' continued at the top of the box office this
weekend, making an estimated $25.2 million, a drop of only 33
percent. Its one-week total? $79.9 million, for a film that cost
just $24 million to make. Daily Variety reported Monday that ``The
Waterboy'' is expected to earn as much as $170 million, making it
one of the most profitable movies of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised as Hollywood (or the critics, who almost universally
panned it) may be, ``The Waterboy'' fits into a tradition of, to
put it bluntly and accurately, stupid movies. They are as old as
Hollywood itself. Not all are as successful, but ``The Waterboy''
family tree can be traced to Charlie Chaplin, the Marx Brothers,
and The Three Stooges. There's a major recent branch from
television comedy that includes ``Saturday Night Live'' _ breeding
ground not just for Sandler, but Belushi, Aykroyd, and a long line
of stars of stupid movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were only mildly suprised,'' says Phil Barlow, president of
distribution for Disney's Buena Vista Pictures, of ``The
Waterboy's'' success. ``We have a tracking service and we knew
almost three weeks ahead of time that the storm was coming. But
it's the level of success: We thought we had Mt. Whitney we ended
up with Mt. Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been this,'' says Martin Grove, movie analyst
for CNN and the Hollywood Reporter. ``Jerry Lewis. Charlie Chaplin,
who was not initially about great art. Hollywood has always had a
place in the mix for the clowns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If stupid means `not challenging intellectually,' I will take
stupid every day of the week,'' says Boston comic Steve Sweeney,
who played a cop in Bob and Peter Farrelly's $170 million (and
still running) hit, ``There's Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are overstimulated. It takes a real effort to think about
the issues, or to think at all,'' says Sweeney. ``I found I can't
keep up and I don't have the urge to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything in the news,'' adds comic Lenny Clarke,
Sweeney's pal and co-bit player in ``There's Something About
Mary,'' ``children being murdered, the market up and down, with
Clinton ... we're on the verge of war, you go into a movie and it's
a couple hours of mindless babble and chatter. You get a good laugh
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stupid, says Clarke, ``is on the upswing. Look at the numbers. I
was fortunate to be involved in it 'cause I know the Farrelly
brothers.''
</P>

the song ``Pinhead.''

<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A showing of ``The Waterboy'' also sold out last week at the
Cheri in Boston. Sandler, playing a simple, mush-mouthed Cajun man
(a character similar to one he played on ``Saturday Night Live''),
transforms himself from waterboy to star athlete, from punching bag
to tackling monster. Laughter and applause filled the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Touchstone Pictures, which made ``The Waterboy,'' broke
down the mostly male first weekend audience:under 11 years of age,
8 percent; 12-17, 33 percent; 18-25, 33 pecent; 26-34, 20 percent;
35 and over, 6 percent. A total of 41 percent of the audience was
under 17.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has paid off. This weekend it fended off two
newcomers: screen idol Brad Pitt's ``Meet Joe Black'' ($15.6
million gross) and horror movie ``I Still Know What You Did Last
Summer'' ($17.5 million). The two-weekend total of $79.9 million
places ``The Waterboy'' in lofty company, already topping the Oprah
Winfrey epic ``Beloved'' (), the critically acclaimed
``Pleasantville ($32 million; four weeks) and ``The Seige'' $26.5;
two weeks). Those numbers, combined with press speculation that
Sandler could be the next Jim Carrey, prompted another Disney
company, ABC, to pull a Nov. 21 broadcast of ``The Flintstones''
for another Sandler vehicle, ``Billy Madison.''

</P>
<P>
   That was just one of many truisms that came from ``This Is
Spinal Tap,'' the Rob Reiner movie that cleverly skewered the
exceedingly stupid faux band Spinal Tap and rock 'n' roll in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' led this year's parade of
stupids, but did so, at least in part, by being clever-stupid.
``The Waterboy'' is stupid-stupid. And as young America has said,
voting at the ticket window, ``And your point is ... ?''
</P>
<P>
   Movies like ``The Waterboy,'' says Northeastern sociology
professor Jack Levin ``celebrate the all-American nerd. They're
stupid; the protagonist is stupid. But he gets smart by the end of
the movie. The all-American nerd reflects Joe Schmo, who's out
there going to see the movie. He gives the average citizen the hope
he will have an exciting life despite his mundane existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Meet the stupids. You can blame ``National Lampoon,'' the once
transgressive cutting-edge humor magazine, and also the parent
company that launched the hilarious ``Animal House,'' the endless
Chevy Chase ``Vacation'' series, and numerous even lesser siblings.
You can, of course, blame ``Saturday Night Live,'' from where so
many comics have spun off into movie fame, starting with Chase,
Eddie Murphy, and the Chris Farley-David Spade duo, up to the
current Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell pairing in ``A Night in
Roxbury.'' You can blame ``In Living Color'' for launching Carrey
the many Wayans brothers. You can blame David Letterman for his
hackneyed middlebrow jokes that are ``funny'' because of the irony.
</P>
<P>
   The highly regarded Steve Martin and Robin Williams have toiled
in many a dumb, popular movie. The no-joke-too-low Howard Stern
proclaims himself the King of All Media, and the
no-invective-too-vile Jerry Springer is the star of ``Ringmaster,''
opening Nov. 25. Its catch-phrase: ``Season's Beatings!''

</P>
<P>
   But the genius of ``The Waterboy,'' is this, says CNN's Grove:
``I was at the premiere of `I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'
and I ran into a producer. She and I were talking and she was
saying, `All they did is take the `Forest Gump' football story and
develop it into a full length movie.' That's smart, to perceive
that one element in a highly regarded film and converting it into
an enormously successful film that stands on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood will keep making stupid movies as long as there are
stupid moviegoers,'' Grove says, ``and there's nothing wrong with
being in that business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like `Rocky Horror (Picture Show),' the ritual
attending of these movies,'' says Jerry M. Lewis, professor of
sociology at Kent State University in Ohio. ``(Kids) don't care so
much about content. You'll miss the dialogue, they're screaming and
laughing. They're there to raise a little hell. It gives them
permission to get out of their role as a serious student. Sandler
has found a niche with college students, juniors and seniors in
high school. They're worried about the economy, their role models
are not clear. This gives them a time to relax and be totally
stupid. It can be a freeing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid movies aren't as stupid as they look,' adds
Northeastern professor Levin. ``They're the cinematic version of
the National Enquirer, which profiles ordinary people who do
extraordinary things. It sends exactly the same message. Miracles
can happen and you are a good person who deserves to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Who always seems to be ... male.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' says Levin, ``it's because it's the men that lack the
self-confidence. Even in this era of post-feminism, it's still men
who expect to be the breadwinners, who define themselves by jobs
and how much power they accumulate. Being a nerdy male is a lot
worse than being a nerdy female. Misery loves miserable company and
they get plenty of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe also we sometimes overanalyze and undersimplfy,''
says Disney's Barlow. ``This is a talented comedian people can
identity with. He takes on the big guy and wins. When something is
meant to entertain instead of instruct, divert inestsad of teach,
at that point we shouldn't overanalyze. I don't even think that's
generational.''

UNDERSTANDING PIE-THROWING IS NO PIECE OF CAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As simple as pie. Nothing in San Francisco is as
simple as pie, even pies.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week ago, Mayor Willie Brown was hit in the face
with three pies by a group claiming it was ``a political act'' on
behalf of the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Now the three members of the so-called Biotic Baking Brigade,
charged with misdemeanors by the district attorney, have been
charged with racism by the African-American community. It's more
complicated than that, of course. But basically, three white
smart-alecks can't hit a black mayor of a major city with cherry
pies and not expect to raise some hackles in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``As African-Americans we have suffered humiliation enough, and
here we are with a black mayor being humiliated again,'' said the
Rev. Cecil Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was one of dozens of African-American community leaders
and ministers, some of whom hadn't spoken to each other for years,
who appeared before the Board of Supervisors on Monday in support
of Supervisor Amos Brown's resolution to provide more security for
the mayor and the supervisors. It passed unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how they (the pie-throwers) would feel if they saw
three or four African-Americans coming at them,'' the Rev. Arnold
Townsend told the board. ``I guess there would be a different
response.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Biotic Baking Brigade, Al Decker, said the
black community leaders were playing the race card, and it wasn't
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Biotic Baking Brigade has pied seven people, and six of
them were white men in positions of power,'' Decker said. ``What we
did to the mayor focuses on his policies.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Decker used to be known as ``Al Baker,'' but dropped
the alias because he wants people to know he isn't ashamed of
tossing pies as a means of social change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I debated Supervisor Amos Brown on TV last week, and he raised
the race issue three times,'' Decker said. ``It's just
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers and community leaders who spoke before the
supervisors didn't talk about race only. They also spoke of how
they teach children to settle issues by dialogue, yet pieing the
most accessible of mayors is treated as a joke. They spoke of how
offended they were that the pie gang would do this in the name of
the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are concerned about the homeless, you don't make
grandstand plays to get in the newspaper,'' Townsend said. ``You do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for the pie-throwers, though, was expressed by
the soft-spoken labor leader Leroy King: ``We want some jail
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The question I was left with, and I believe leads to more
serious questions, is why pie-throwing can have racial overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Let me say that I am sure the people in the Biotic Baking
Brigade intended no racial insult, and did not pie Mayor Brown
because he is African-American. I also completely understand why
blacks would be upset about it.
</P>
<P>
   Let us consider the image of a distinguished black mayor covered
with goo. It was not a pretty sight, even though he was wearing a
warm-up jacket and not an Italian suit.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who remember the late Stokely Carmichael also
remember the sit-ins at lunch counters in the South where white
toughs poured ketchup and mustard all over black protesters' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Imagery counts.
</P>
<P>
   Let us also consider some of the racial undertones and overtones
one hears in conversations about Mayor Brown. Most are not overtly
racist. Most do not use the ugly words.
</P>
<P>
   People say things like, ``Well, you know, he only cares about
his people.''
</P>
<P>
   I say, who's that? The people of Pacific Heights? The developers
and lobbyists? The people of San Francisco who smile and say hello
to him on the street, even if they disapprove of his handling of
public transportation or the homeless issue?
</P>
<P>
   No, whatever his flaws, this is an intriguing man and a great
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Hit him with a pie, and the incident may make the front page of
the New York Times, as it did last week. Maybe it drew attention to
the plight of the homeless, or maybe just to the plight of Willie
Brown as yet another mayor saddled with the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But you can understand why it draws the attention of
African-Americans to something else.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is as simple as pie in America. Nothing is as complex as
race and dignity.
</P>

8-DISC SET TRACKS COLTRANE THROUGH HIS FOREMOST ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Coltrane has long symbolized the restless side of jazz, the
compulsion to push through boundaries, to sift the elements of
harmony, tone, and rhythm into new forms of expression, and in ways
that stress more the tension of the quest than the relief of
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as spiritual seeker comes mainly from his
recordings on the Impulse! label, especially those of 1962-65 with
one of the most riveting quartets in all jazz history _ Coltrane on
tenor and soprano sax, McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on
bass, and Elvin Jones on drums.
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane's entire output with this group, except for live
sessions, is now collected in an eight-CD set, ``The Classic
Quartet: The Complete Impulse! Studio Recordings'' (Impulse/GRP) _
which hits record stores today priced about $90 _ and there is no
better display of his journey's evolution.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long road indeed from the balladry of ``Greensleeves'' to
the sheets-of-sound implosions of ``Meditations:
Love/Compassion/Joy'' _ though, then again, not so long a road as
first glance might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane had been experimenting with new sounds well before the
earliest of these sessions. His explorations reached their first
apex in May 1961, during a weeklong gig at the Village Vanguard,
where _ joined by the quartet and saxophonist Eric Dolphy _ he
ripped through standards with split tones, quadruple-time tempos,
head-spinningly long solos (up to 20 minutes with scarcely a pause
or repetition), and an insistence on squeezing a chord or a scale
for every possible pattern of notes before moving on to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, these sessions (released as a four-CD box by Impulse!
last year) have the capacity to shock, bewilder, and thrill. At the
time, most critics were simply appalled, denouncing it as
``anti-jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane's first albums for Impulse! _ which comprise Disc 1 of
the new set _ were meant as retrenchments from the Vanguard
scandal, reassurances that he was still connected to ``the jazz
tradition.'' This was especially true of the ``Ballads'' album,
which includes such chestnuts as ``What's New,'' ``Too Young to Go
Steady,'' and ``Nancy with the Laughing Face.''
</P>
<P>
   Even here, though, as he had shown a few years earlier still, in
his rendition of ``My Favorite Things'' (from ``The Sound of
Music''), Coltrane could blow with a straight face only so far. The
delights of these early-'60s recordings lie in hearing Trane bounce
up against conventional song-forms _ spinning raga rhythms on ``The
Inch Worm'' (which Danny Kaye had sung in ``The Hans Christian
Anderson Story'') or churning from Harold Arlen's ``Out of This
World'' a 10-minute solo as complex and adventurous as nearly
anything from his later years.
</P>
<P>
   The surprises go the other way, too. In an August 1965 session
full of frenzied reverie (amelodic improvisations with titles like
``Attaining,'' ``Sun Ship,'' ``Ascent,'' and ``Amen''), Coltrane
suddenly belts out an original hymn, ``Dearly Beloved,'' as
gorgeous as anything on ``Ballads.''
</P>
<P>
   The masterpiece of the box set comes near the middle _ the
famous four-part suite, recorded Dec. 9, 1964, called ``A Love
Supreme.'' It is that rare thing in 20th century music: an avowedly
spiritual piece that has genuine spiritual impact. Never again
would Coltrane scale such heights of articulated passion. Never
would he (or, really, anybody) come so close to grabbing jazz's
magic ring _ that perfect synthesis of structure and freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he didn't try. After ``A Love Supreme,'' and especially
starting with the June 1965 sessions that formed the album
``Transition,'' Coltrane pushed into deeper, denser territory,
departing almost entirely from chords or scales, yearning with
ecstatic intensity for that eye of the storm where all is at once
chaos and calm.
</P>
<P>
   These final discs, I suspect, won't be the most frequently
played, but, for all their shortcomings, they possess an undeniably
hypnotic quality. And, heard in the context of the entire set,
their music makes more sense _ in terms of where the ideas came
from and how they developed _ than it ever did on their individual
albums, most of which were released after Coltrane died, in 1967,
of liver trouble.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the ultimate success of ``The Classic Quartet'' _
that it lets us see the Coltrane of this era as a rapturous and
turbulent whole.

REINVENTING GOVSPEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last June was not, perhaps, the ideal moment for President
Clinton to issue his Plain Language directive, a memorandum
ordering federal departments and agencies to use clear, simple
English in written communications.
</P>
<P>
   A worthy goal, as anyone who has corresponded with the Internal
Revenue Service will agree. But in this year of scandal, bracketed
by a shortage of plain language from the White House and what some
consider a surfeit of it from the independent counsel's office,
juicier topics have tended to dominate our language debates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Al Gore has been soldiering on with the Plain Language
campaign, each month presenting a ``No Gobbledygook'' award for the
best translation from bureaucratese into English. (The award's logo
is a turkey with a slash through it, not as a comment on the
writers of the original bad prose but because gobbledygook, slang
from the '40s, is apparently modeled on a turkey's nonsensical
gobble. For some reason, though, when people talk turkey _ an
expression a quarter-century older than gobbledygook _ the meaning
is just the opposite: to speak plainly, not mince words.)
</P>
<P>
   The Plain Language Action Network, or PLAN (even reinvented
government apparently needs its acronyms), also has a Web site _
www.plainlanguage.gov/ _ that offers simple, useful instructions
for de-
</P>
<P>
   bureaucratizing documents; there's even a list of banned words
(abeyance, henceforward, hereinbefore, whensoever, and witnesseth
deservedly among them). But reforming government's language will be
no easy task, judging by the Oct. 28 memo on plans for
``Implementing the Presidential Memorandum on Plain Language.''
</P>
<P>
   The introduction, by US Archivist John W. Carlin, is clear
enough, but the attached Action Plan shows all the signs of
lingering bureaucratitis. How will the staff get people on board,
as they no doubt say, with the new program? Well, in item 2, the
Office of the Federal Register ``prepares for Archivist's signature
NARA Notice outlining NARA's strategy for meeting goals of
Presidential Memorandum and identifying resources available for
drafting Plain Language documents.'' (I'm just guessing, but I
think this means step 2 of the plan consists of waiting for this
very memo.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's item 6: ``Program officers will identify staff with Plain
Language expertise.'' Well, that could take a while, I admit; how
could an employee hold on to the memory of Plain Language in a
world where this is the lingua franca?
</P>
<P>
   There's more along these lines, but the 13th and last item on
the list is almost intelligible. ``After January 1, 1999,'' it
reads, ``all new final and proposed rules will be written in Plain
Language.'' Sooner or later, we'll find out whether that translates
as ``Happy New Year, citizens!'' or ``Fooled you again, suckers!''

MURDER CASE OPEN, BUT HOPES OF HAITIAN FAMILY DIM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ For hours, no one came.
</P>
<P>
   Along the muddy roadside, a crime scene left to the elements
rotted under a flaring sun. Fingerprints. Witnesses. Pale blue
paint chips from a getaway car. And all around, a constellation of
bullet casings that set the bodies of Willy and Alicia Merisier
against a blood-red sky of ambush and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing, it seemed, was a justice system to
gather the evidence and act on it. But on this impoverished island
_ the homeland that beckoned one couple and greeted them with
gunfire _ justice &UR;  &LR; is as elusive as wages or running water. By
nightfall, wind sent the spent casings rolling along the ground.
Fingerprints disappeared and so did witnesses, into the stream of
anonymous crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, almost a year after the deaths of a patriarch and
matriarch of Boston's Haitian commmunity _ and the Skakespearean
split of a family stretching from Boston to Haiti _ some
authorities in Haiti are &UR;  &LR; saying they fear that the killers never
will be found. No amount of fact-finding now, they say, could make
up for the evidence that was destroyed then.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I think people are hoping for the hand of
God,'' said an official in Haiti's diplomatic ranks who has
followed the case. ``I think people are hoping that the killer will
wake up one day and feel so guilty that he'll just turn himself
in.''
</P>
<P>
   But if God's hand has touched this tragedy, the Merisiers' five
children have yet to discern it. As they struggle with their own
competing urges to fight and to forget, some 70 relatives in Boston
remain divided over the investigation and over the suspicion that
two among them are the killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where this thing is now, only the Haitian government can get
it started again,'' said Fritz Resil, of Hyde Park, the godfather
to one of the Merisiers' children. He is convinced that two family
members are guilty of the killings. ``The kids, they have lost
hope,'' he added. ``But I haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   But as some family members try to revive a dying investigation,
it appears as stalled and directionless as a US effort that has
poured several hundred million dollars into training the Haitian
judges and police officers responsible for solving the crime. With
all its missteps and missed opportunities, the case, some say, has
laid bare a much larger failure: that of US foreign policy in
Haiti, whose government remains locked in political stalemate and
whose justice system remains ill-equipped to handle a surge of
murders and other crimes whose perpetrators routinely go
unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disastrous,'' said Rachel Neild, a Haiti specialist at
the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights
organization. ``We're talking about a place where no one in the
country even has a complete copy of the criminal code. You've got
administrators in the justice ministry incapable of doing the most
basic tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Neild, there are only 6,000 police officers in a
country of about 7 million people. That's one officer for every
1,200 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the vast sum of money spent by the State Department,
Justice Department, and Department of Defense and other agencies in
the four years since US intervention restored former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, much of the police force and
judiciary cannot keep basic records and lacks equipment as
essential as cars to respond to crime scenes and seek out
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Merisiers, who lived in Boston's Mattapan section for many
years, were shot in an ambush on Dec. 2 as they drove from
Port-au-Prince International Airport to a friend's house. Alicia,
49, had just arrived from Boston to visit; Willy, 66,had already
moved to Haiti permanently, and was supervising the construction of
their retirement home. Since March, the case has rested
with &UR;  &LR; Kesner Michel Thermesi, an investigative judge, who under
Haitian law has simultaneously acted as part-prosecutor and
part-grand jury in a protracted inquiry into the prime suspect in
the case. A second suspect is still wanted by Haitian police.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince said the
embassy's security office is in ``close contact'' with both the
local police and the Merisier family about the case. But almost
from the beginning, the investigation has moved sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   At different points, it has drawn in the FBI and the office of
US Representative &UR;  &LR; Joseph P. Kennedy II of Massachusetts. It drew
the couple's oldest daughter, Sandra Merisier Bissante, back to
Haiti, despite her vows never to return, to testify before
Thermesi.
</P>
<P>
   And the case has drawn cries of outrage from both sides of the
family over the handling of Rene Laurent, the onetime prime
suspect. A cousin of Alicia Merisier and close friend of the
couple, Laurent was seen with the Merisiers at the airport on the
day of the slayings. Police arrested Laurent in March. Soon after,
he was released, only to be arrested again a week later. He
remained in jail until July, when Thermesi released him for a
second time, saying there was no concrete evidence to indict him.
</P>
<P>
   Some family members, including the Merisier children and Resil,
say the judge has not called witnesses who may have information
about Laurent and the second suspect, Ngi Napoleon, also a
relative. Those who have fought for Laurent's and Napoleon's
innocence say that three months in jail was too severe in a case
they believe has been fueled by rumor and groundless suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his desk inside the Palais de Justice in the heart of
the capital, Thermesi seemed unsure whether justice can be meted
out. As a noisy stream of visitors passes through his office _
lawyers, clerks, students _ the judge pulled out underlined news
clippings on the case from American and Haitian newspapers. The
reports, along with the second- and third-hand testimony from
relatives, friends, and residents living in the area where the
killings took place, are his only instruments in a muddled case.
When asked what led officials to first issue the outstanding
warrant for Napoleon, Thermesi held up a clipping from the Boston
Globe, showing that Napoleon has a criminal record in Boston.
``It's right here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex case,'' he continued, rustling through folders.
``Why do I say it's complex? Because there was a lot of
misinformation. Rene was one of the people last seen with the
Merisiers, so we put him in jail to avoid him escaping the country.
But no one has given us any concrete evidence. We have theories. We
hear a lot of things. But they are just theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Thermesi said he went to see the car the Merisiers were driving
when they were killed. The blue paint chips he found on the car are
probably the only physical evidence he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   But even if someone were to collect them, there would be no way
to analyze them. The same goes for &UR;  &LR; ballistic evidence or
fingerprints. That kind of technology doesn't exist in a country
where there are no records of who sits in jail, who awaits trial,
and who has been released &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fingerprints? What would they do with fingerprints?'' said
Gregory Mayard-Paul, a &UR;  &LR; lawyer hired by the family to follow the
case in Haiti. ``Even if they had them in their hand, they wouldn't
know whose fingerprints they were, since no one keeps prints of
anyone in Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Thermesi, Mayard-Paul said he is ``among the more competent
we have.'' But in the context of Haiti's justice system _ where
some judges can't read French, the language in which the &UR;  &LR; laws are
written, and where monthly salaries of $300 make some judges
vulnerable to bribes _ competence can be relative, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Haitian proverb that says, `In country where
everyone is blind in both eyes, the one-eyed seeing man is king,'''
Mayard-Paul said. ``Investigations in this country can last a long,
long time and can lead to no result whatsoever. That's not a reason
to lose hope ... But if something does happen, it will be
considered a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   One Haitian-American lawyer who came here to help train judges,
prosecutors, and administrators said the kind of miracle
Mayard-Paul hopes for is, for now at least, the only chance in a
system still tackling basic skills and dealing with the constant
threat of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, the mission was supposed to be to teach
people to manage case loads, and how to create due process,'' said
Renald Breton of Maryland, who worked for two years with Overseas
Prosecutorial Development and Training, which is run by the US
Justice Department. ``Instead it was like, `This is how you make a
file. This is how you create an alphabetical index.' There's no
efficient system. You can't expect the rule of law to function
because there is no rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for the Merisiers, but not for many others either, some
officials said. Since the Dec. 2 killings, there have been dozens
of murders. Three weeks after Willy and Alicia Merisier were
killed, a woman named Micheline Coulanges was shot dead in broad
daylight as she closed up her family's wholesale shop in Croix des
Bossales, on the edge of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Coulanges and her family are well-known in Haiti, members of the
business and artistic class. Yet the Haitian police waited three
months before interviewing Coulanges' son, who was with his mother
and witnessed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's someone who was well-known, whose funeral tied up
traffic for hours. It was just devastating,'' said Meg Gilroy, a US
embassy spokeswoman. ``I understand the frustration the Merisiers
feel, the frustration of Haitians in Boston. But by the standards
of the Haitian criminal justice system, this case is still alive.
It's not being ignored.''

FINISH THE JOB THAT BUSH LEFT UNDONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Updated version of column that originally moved Nov. 16)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Bush and Colin Powell were squeamish about killing Iraqi
soldiers as they fled north out of Kuwait in February 1991, and so
they called a halt to the Gulf War. They rejected the advice of
General Norman Schwarzkopf -- ``We could have continued to wreak
great destruction upon them; we could have ... made it in fact a
battle of annihilation.'' Instead, they declared victory.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush had called Saddam Hussein ``worse than Hitler.''
He had urged the Iraqi people to overthrow him. But when Iraqis
erupted in revolt the day the war ended, Bush declined to help. The
``defeated'' Saddam commenced using helicopter gunships and napalm
to murder Iraqi Kurds and Shi'ites -- right under the eyes of
400,000 US troops. Still Bush refused to intervene. When Sen.
George Mitchell suggested that US pilots shoot down Saddam's
helicopters and stop the massacre, Bush flippantly replied,
``Always glad to have his opinion. Glad to hear from him.'' To
underscore his lack of interest, he went fishing in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As the current crisis in Iraq has unfolded, commentators have
noted President Clinton's history of drawing lines in the sand,
then allowing Saddam to cross them. On the few occasions when
Clinton (ital) has (unital) punished Iraq, his actions have been
meaningless. In 1996, for example, Saddam assaulted the Kurdish
city of Irbil, located in the northern no-fly zone. Clinton's
retaliation was to lob cruise missiles at military sites hundreds
of miles to the south. The result, CIA director John Deutch later
testified, was to leave Saddam politically strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of Clinton's blundering, it is worth remembering:
The mother of all blunders was Bush's. Eager for the PR coup of a
``hundred-hour war,'' he left Saddam in power. He tossed away the
chance to liberate the Iraqi people by demolishing Saddam's
tyranny. Saddam was left free to butcher his foes by the tens of
thousands. And he was left hungry for revenge -- and bent on
acquiring chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is gone now, as are most of the other heads of state of the
Desert Storm coalition. But Saddam remains, more dangerous than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors from the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) have been
barred since early August from hunting down Iraq's weapons of mass
death. Even if they return this week, Saddam has had 3 1/2 months
to find new hiding places, tamper with monitoring equipment, and
build more of his hellish weapons. &UR;  &LR; Meanwhile, he is believed to
already have mobile missiles loaded with biological poisons, such
as anthrax and botulinum. Thousands of tons of chemical weapons
agents are still unaccounted for. And tests have shows that before
the Gulf War, Iraq packed VX, a lethal nerve gas, into missile
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   According to UNSCOM, Iraq has 34 plants that can be converted to
the production of chemical weapons, and sufficient personnel with
the expertise to run them. Scott Ritter, the weapons expert who
resigned last summer to protest the administration's repeated
cave-ins, says that Iraq has built three nuclear devices. As of
August, the Iraqis lacked only the fissionable material needed for
the weapons' core. By now they may have acquired them on the black
market.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam and his spokesmen harp on the misery caused by the
economic sanctions against Iraq, but sanctions are nothing to him.
(Ordinary Iraqis suffer, but Saddam and his inner circle live in
lavish comfort.) The only thing he cares about is amassing an
arsenal with which to dominate the Middle East and be avenged on
his enemies. Each time he has had to choose between ending
sanctions or protecting his secret weapons, he has chosen the
weapons. His about-face over the weekend changes nothing. Saddam
turns these crises on and off at will, repeatedly shutting down
inspections whenever he needs to buy time for his weapons-makers.
</P>
<P>
   He has used chemical weapons before. During Iraq's war with
Iran, he launched missiles loaded with Sarin at Iranian cities. To
quell dissent in the Kurdish city of Halabja, he mustard-gassed
5,000 men, women, and children to death in 1988. He would do it
again. He (ital) will (unital) do it again.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons inspectors are honorable and courageous, but the
time for inspecting is past. Now it is time to finish the job
George Bush left undone.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must announce to the world that it is the intention of
the United States to liberate Iraq from Saddam's bloody grip. He
should encourage the formation of an Iraqi government-in-exile, and
begin aiding Saddam's opponents -- economically, militarily,
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   The northern and southern no-fly zones should be proclaimed Free
Iraq, and declared off-limits to Saddam's forces -- and under the
military protection of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Sunday that ``Iraq has backed down,'' but the
danger has not passed. Saddam may at this moment be preparing to
fire his weapons of mass destruction. Clinton must deter him by
saying explicitly that any use of such weapons will bring massive
retaliation. At the same time, he should order more aircraft,
armor, and troops to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years of American vacillation have allowed Saddam to
reestablish himself as the most powerful despot in his part of the
world. Nothing is more urgent at this moment than making it crystal
clear that the United States intends to crush him and his regime
for good. If we fail again, we will never be forgiven.

AIRPLANES

<P>
   ORONDO, Wash. _ Apple grower Grant Daniel has wrapped up the
fall harvest, but his trees are still laden with fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Like other apple farmers along the Columbia River Valley, Daniel
couldn't afford to pick his lower-quality fruit this year. Apple
prices are at bottom-of-the-barrel levels, hurt by a devastating
economic crisis in the industry's chief export market, Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of panic, a lot of concern among growers,'' said
Daniel. ``What are we going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The 16-month-old economic downturn that has ravaged economies
from Thailand to Tokyo is taking a toll on the Pacific Northwest,
particularly in Washington, the most trade-dependent state among
the Lower 48.
</P>
<P>
   One in five jobs here is tied to the export market. And prior to
the crisis, Asia purchased nearly half the state's merchandise
exports.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Asian economies struggling, the unemployment rate
in this once-booming state is ticking up. Tax revenues are
stagnating, and government leaders are facing the possibility of a
statewide recession.
</P>
<P>
   Apple growers aren't the only ones feeling the pinch.
Seattle-based Boeing Co., the nation's largest exporter and the
dominant force in Washington's international trade, is cutting back
production of wide-bodied aircraft and shedding 28,000 jobs
companywide.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech firms such as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.,
Intel Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. also are laying off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Lumber companies are shuttering mills, while the state's wheat
farmers are struggling with some of the lowest prices in two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost the real engines of our exports,'' said Desmond
O'Rourke, a professor of agricultural economics at Washington State
University in Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   Export cargo through the Port of Seattle on its way to Asia
dropped 10 percent in the third quarter, after falling 28 percent
in the second quarter. Apple and pear shipments for the first eight
months were down 53 percent, while lumber exports were off 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say the fallout from the Asian crisis has been
severe enough to send the Washington economy into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   The state unemployment rate, for instance, stood at 4.3 percent
in September. That's one-half a percentage point higher than just a
year ago, but it's still better than the national average of 4.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's computer software industry _ anchored by the
behemoth in the field, Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft Corp. _
continues to create thousands of new jobs annually. Bellevue,
Wash.-based Paccar, maker of Kenworth heavy-duty trucks, is
relocating truck production from Mexico to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
But to help ensure Washington and the rest of the nation are not
dragged down further, White House officials is meeting with other
leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, hoping to find ways to restore growth in
the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the crisis nearly a year and a half ago,
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other government and
business leaders have been nervously watching for signs the Asian
downturn could slow the U.S. economy. Fed policy-makers twice have
lowered interest rates _ and may do so again Tuesday _ to help keep
the United States from sliding into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel could have told them plenty about the Asian crisis a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   He grows apples, cherries and pears on a 71-acre family farm on
the east bank of the Columbia, in a narrow, mile-and-a-half wide
valley between the river and the rocky foothills of the Cascade
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he invested thousands of dollars in his orchards,
installing trellises, planting new fruit varieties and upgrading
his irrigation system. He also built a new house with a sweeping
view of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in July 1997, the real estate market in Bangkok, Thailand,
collapsed, which was the start of an economic and currency crisis
that took down much of Asia, before ricocheting around the world to
slam Russia and then Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel had been more concerned about an invasion of the stink
bug than the drop in the Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the crisis, more than 80 percent of Washington's farm
exports and half of its apples were shipped to Asia, according to
the Washington State Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   But as the economic crisis sent currencies plunging throughout
the region, many of the state's biggest farm customers could no
longer afford their products. State agricultural exports for the
second quarter of 1998, for instance, reached only $492 million,
barely half the $976 million in the comparable period the previous
year, the quarter preceding the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to troubled Indonesia, for instance, once the
third-largest export market for Washington apples, fell 85 percent,
said Jim Thomas, a spokesman for the state's Apple Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for Red Delicious apples _ the fruit's benchmark _
averaged only $10.49 a box over the first 10 months of this year,
down from $15.13 a box two years ago, said Kirk Mayer, manager of
the Washington Growers Clearing House in Wenatchee, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's farm cleared a total of $5,200 last year. His orchards
produced a strong crop, in a year when the state's overall yield
was mediocre. ``Otherwise, I would have lost my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   In more normal years, Daniel and other growers used to ship
their lower-grade apples to markets such as Russia or sell them to
juice-making plants. But once the Asian economic crisis spread to
Russia last August, that market evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Growers also face increased competition from China, which is
trying to export its way clear of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Washington apple growers anticipate a bumper crop,
nearing 100 million boxes. The Chinese expect to produce 1.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese already have flooded the market with juice-grade
apples. Apples that used to fetch $180 a ton are now worth only $10
a ton, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough. It's really tough,'' Daniel said. ``I used to kid
about being at the bottom of the food chain. Now I know I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just wait out the crisis, however, Washington's
apple growers have adopted an aggressive marketing strategy to
boost sales in their largest market, the United States. At a time
of depressed prices, they've agreed to raise their own fees _ from
25 cents a box to 40 cents a box _ to help fund a $23 million
advertising campaign, comparable, growers say, to the amount of
money spent to market the Snickers candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   The state's largest private employer, Boeing, is having troubles
of a different sort. The giant aircraft maker has been forced to
park 34 jets _ many built for Asian customers _ in the desert
because the buyers could not obtain adequate financing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials calculate the Asian crisis will reduce growth
in world air travel by about 2.5 percentage points over the next
five years. And for aircraft manufacturers like Boeing, that will
translate into the loss of about 150 aircraft orders worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Boeing, which exports about 70 percent of the
commercial aircraft it builds, plans to scale back production of
both the 747 and 777 jets next year. The company, which lost money
last year for the first time in half a century, also plans to pare
down its work force, from 238,000 to 220,000 by the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Any troubles at Boeing are dramatic news for the state, since
Boeing and other companies in the transportation equipment sector
accounted for a whopping 70 percent of the state's merchandise
exports during the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south in Puyallup, a suburb of Tacoma in the shadow of
Mount Rainier, Japanese electronics giant Matsushita closed its
semiconductor plant in September, laying off 340 workers.
</P>
<P>
   That was a big letdown for a city that was expecting so much
more. Just three years ago, Matsushita _ which manufactures
television sets, videocassette recorders and other electronic
appliances under brand names such as Panasonic, Technics and Quasar
_ said it would spend $600 million to build a new computer chip
fabrication plant at the Puyallup site.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to double employment at the site by the end of the
decade. But Matsushita got caught by a severe downturn in the
semiconductor business, an event that helped bring on, and which
has been exacerbated by, the Asian debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for computer memory chips are down 78 percent from two
years ago and a stunning 96 percent from 1995, according to San
Jose, Calif.-based Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to compete, Matsushita decided to close the plant, pack
up the best equipment and ship it back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   For the city of Puyallup _ population 29,900 _ the Matsushita
plant closing meant the loss of a quarter of the city's property
taxes and delays in road work and city park projects, said Puyallup
Chief Financial Officer Dean Driver.
</P>
<P>
   Puyallup officials had not used the Matsushita revenues to fund
general operations such as police and fire, since that facility,
once owned by oil-field service giant Schlumberger, had been
through uncertain times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Like Houston's oil and gas industry, the semiconductor business
has been through its share of boom and bust times.
</P>
<P>
   Process engineer Darrell Field has worked in the semiconductor
industry for 19 years. During that time, ``I've escaped four of
these down cycles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the plant was bought by a Japanese company in 1990, Field
thought his worries about job security were finally over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always under the impression you would have life-long
employment'' with a Japanese company, Field said. The crisis taught
him differently.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dean, owner of DuPont Grocery, is suffering the indirect
effects of hard times in the semiconductor industry. Dean sells
everything from shoe polish to baitbox grubs in a small store
around the corner from a huge complex owned by computer chip-maker
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Intel had employed 1,800 workers at the site, with the
expectation of increasing staffing to about 6,000 within five years
and as many as 7,900 sometime down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is in the process of
eliminating 650 computer-assembly jobs at the plant, although it
has not abandoned its projections for future employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take away (that many) faces without having some
impact,'' Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the pain of the Asian crisis is trickling down, at least
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Harper operates Harper Lumber in Roslyn _ population 935 _ a
town made famous as the location for shooting many of the scenes
for the hit television show ``Northern Exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper, whose chain saw shop is across the street from the
storefront used to represent the fictional Dr. Joel Fleischman's
office, serves the area's timber industry. But while lumber exports
are hurting from a huge drop in Japanese housing starts, Harper's
business continues to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been extremely busy,'' Harper said. ``We had a very good
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis is prodding many small business owners and
farmers to become more sophisticated. Chris Herron, a wheat farmer
from Connell in eastern Washington, said, ``I'm 41 years old and
not the world's best marketer.''
</P>
<P>
   When Herron saw wheat prices tumbling as the Asian crisis
expanded, he realized he would have to take some risks. For the
first time in his career, Herron sold wheat into the futures
market, gaining a price advantage of 32 cents a bushel on 40,000
bushels of wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out pretty good this year,'' Herron said. ``That's
heat for the house and coffee for the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, many Washington business leaders believe the state
economy can withstand the ill winds from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this tremendous momentum, and we're living off that
momentum right now,'' said Gary Hofer, a commodities broker in
Walla Walla. ``We shouldn't waste it. We've go work to do, lots of
work to do.''

DING DARLING: NATURE AT ITS WILDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL DRAKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANIBEL, Fla. _ If you happen to be visiting the Red Sox spring
training site in Fort Myers, or are just migrating to southwest
Florida for a little warmth, you might want to see nature at its
wildest at J.N. ``Ding'' Darling National Wildlife Refuge on
Sanibel Island. Sanibel is only one half-hour's drive from Fort
Myers and is the top location in North America to photograph many
species of waterbirds, especially the shy but majestic roseate
spoonbill.
</P>
<P>
   First the spoonbills look to the left, then right, slowly
turning their heads like an attentive tennis spectator or an
observant photographer. But it's food they're after, and they look
long and hard, methodically giving the patient row of a dozen
photographers plenty of time to make warm images into the early
morning light as the fog slowly lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Spoonbills feed by swinging their heads through the water. When
a special nerve ending in the beak senses the presence of food,
either by movement, vibration, or contact, the beak closes
instantly. The diet of shrimp, crustaceans, and plankton gives the
roseate spoonbill its distinctive and vibrant pink color, just the
way you would turn orange if you only ate carrots. On this morning,
low tide coincided with sunrise for ideal viewing conditions with a
rich, clear blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ding Darling Refuge is 7,000 acres, it's only five miles
along the Wildlife Drive, which veers right off of the main road to
Captiva. The refuge is in a huge mangrove forest and is wild
jungle, with more than 250 species of birds including osprey,
red-shouldered hawks, snowy egrets, double-crested cormorants,
brown pelicans, great blue herons, and mangrove cuckoos.
</P>
<P>
   The mangrove trees are unique in their ability to thrive in
salty water and hurricane weather. Some of those trees filter the
salt from the water and others shed the salt through the leaves.
The leaves eventually fall off and become food for the fish.
Branches fall off, float downstream, and plant themselves miles
from their origin. The roots of the mangroves look like a stick
figure's legs and feet, forking down like a bird's claw. These
roots provide protection for small fish when high tide brings in
the bigger fish. The roots also help calm stormy waves, so sea
captains seek mangrove coves during particularly rough weather.
</P>
<P>
   With so many fish able to thrive in the mangroves, the place is
packed with fish-eating birds and bird-eating alligators. It's so
wild here but the birds seem to sense that it's a refuge and that
they're protected, so most aren't too shy.
</P>
<P>
   If you're energetic, try walking along the Indigo Trail. My
patient wife and I trekked the length, some 2 1/2 miles, finding
peace and solitude while seeing only four people even on a perfect
Sunday morning at low tide. The trail begins with a sandbar near
where the cars park along the side of the dirt road. We soon
spotted a lone anhinga, black with starkly contrasting silver white
stripes on the wings, and a yellow beak. It was standing serenely
at the water's edge, 2 1/2 feet high, watching the tranquil setting
and occasionally preening its wings. I thought this might be a nice
foreground subject for my wide lens (35-mm), with the curving
estuaries and green vegetation for background. Eventually, I was
amazed to fill the frame with the wild, long-necked bird only three
feet away, unconcerned with me in this safe sanctuary. Eventually
it dived into the water and swam away, under the surface, before
its neck and head rose up 30 seconds later like a submarine's
periscope.
</P>
<P>
   We then walked past most people to view an area where ibises
feed on crabs and fish. Two wood storks danced and threatened each
other before breaking off and settling down some 50 feet apart,
within easy range of my ready camera. The wood stork is the only
stork variety in North America, and, to us, seemed funny-looking.
</P>
<P>
   After we walked for about five more minutes, we noticed a great
egret, about 3 1/2 feet tall, walking in our direction while
munching every few feet on whatever insect or lizard it found. The
great egret is starkly white with a bright yellow beak, pretty
green surrounding yellow eyes, and an impossibly narrow and curved
neck. He shook his neck and trembled before snapping his beak
forward like a cobra and expertly grabbing another lizard, which
would wiggle for a second or two before being flipped down the
egret's throat. By this time, the bird's head was filling my
viewfinder only six feet away, the Indigo Trail having provided us
with a quiet intimacy away from cars and other people. Farther down
the path past many ibises, egrets, and two spoonbills, a loud male
cardinal shrieked and screamed its place in the branches 10 feet up
in the branch. A bright beam of sunlight occasionally lit up the
head, allowing for a dramatic slide exposure with bright red in
front of shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated visits are sure to provide surprises to the dedicated
birder. One afternoon, I met the refuge's lone crocodile, a female
affectionately named Clementine by the volunteer staff. Another
afternoon visit brought us to within 15 feet of a red-shouldered
hawk, perched at eye level, and close to a colorful brown pelican
with a seven-foot wingspan, bobbing up and down with the wind while
resting, perched on a tree branch. With bird photography, patience
is necessary for rewards. Our last day, we watched as a friendly,
curious cattle egret followed his favorite people around at the
visitors' center. ``He's adopted us,'' a man said. ``He's been
following us for more than an hour.'' Seeing a cattle egret is
listed in the refuge's bird guide as an uncommon occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge was named after J.N. ``Ding'' Darling, a two-time
Pulitzer prize winning cartoonist at the Des Moines Register who
specialized in environmentally sensitive, satirical commentary. He
wintered on neighboring Captiva Island and was later asked to head
the US Biological Survey (eventually re-named US Fish and Wildlife
Service) by President Franklin Roosevelt, whose ``uncle'' Teddy had
visited Sanibel. Darling established the Migratory Bird
Conservation Commission and initiated the Federal Duck Stamp
Program, which uses hunting stamp proceeds to purchase additional
wetlands for waterfowl habitat.
</P>
<P>
   He's been called the best friend ducks ever had, for
establishing a network of game refuges throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
GETTING THERE:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You really can't miss the Refuge if you follow signs for
Captiva-Ding Darling Refuge is on the only road that goes to
Captiva Island. A $3 toll just before Sanibel keeps the larger
crowds far away at Fort Myers Beach, so is well worth it. There's a
$5 charge to drive around the refuge for the day or $1 to park at
the Visitor's Center and walk or bicycle. The Visitor's Center has
recently been expanded ,thanks to these charges, and provides
facilities, educational movies and displays, and a fine book and
gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   After a visit to the Refuge, empty beaches are only five minutes
away, and many good restaurants dot the road's scenery. We had an
especially good lunch of fresh oysters, Grouper sandwich, and Key
lime pie at the nearby Lazy Flamingo restaurant. Or try poolside
eats and drink at Thistle Lodge on West Gulf Drive before using
access to the bright white, shelled beach two hundred feet from the
pool. There are good shopping opportunities at the Sanibel outlet
stores just off of the island, and luxury resorts cater to some of
the rich and famous, including Tom Cruise. But back in Fort Myers
there was baseball to watch; spring training where hope and
optimism are rampant. The Red Sox play in a cute ballpark before
dedicated crowds of 6,500, while the poorer Twins play in an even
more intimate setting before 1,000 fans. The Twins game we went to
cost us four dollars each and allowed us close access to the Twins
batting practice on a secondary field in front of the watchful but
friendly Twins skipper Tom Kelly, who talked freely to the adoring
fans.

ACTIVE MANAGERS TRAILING INDEX FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How bad are the index funds kicking butt? Let us count the ways:
</P>
<P>
   _The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index funds as a group are up 16.23
percent this year, compared with an average of 8.09 percent for all
actively managed growth and growth and income funds, according to
Lipper Analytical Services. That is a huge 8.14 percentage point
gap _ the largest in history, Lipper says.
</P>
<P>
   _Figure the gap with all general equity funds and it gets really
absurd: a 12.84 percentage point difference this year _ again the
biggest in history, Lipper numbers show.
</P>
<P>
   _For the second year in a row only about one in 10 active
managers _ those who select stocks for their funds rather than
invest only in an index _ is beating the Vanguard Index Trust 500
Portfolio, says Kanon Bloch Carre, the Boston consulting firm. Just
4 percent of active managers are beating the index over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when the Vanguard index was introduced, the very idea
was criticized as ``un-American'' because it settled for
``mediocrity'' in trying to just keep pace with the market. Some
mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth year in a row that active managers have been
looking up at what has become a taunting bogey, the S&AMP;P 500. The
reasons have less to do with the relative competence of active
managers and more with the inherent cost advantages of index funds,
which have lower expenses and trading costs.
</P>
<P>
   It also has much to do with a market that in the last few years
has increasingly narrowed to favor the largest of the
large-capitalization stocks. ``It's the Microsoft and General
Electric Syndrome. The Nifty 10,'' says William Doherty, president
of Kanon Bloch.
</P>
<P>
   The startling success of indexing has made Vanguard Group the
hottest mutual fund company in the world. So far this year Vanguard
has accumulated as much in new stock and bond sales as the next
five fund complexes combined, according to Financial Research
Corp., the Boston data house.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's new stock and bond inflows are roughly 4 1/2 times
those of Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the world's biggest
fund company, says Financial Research. What is really interesting
is that Fidelity, the home of Peter Lynch and his ``bottoms-up''
stock-picker followers, is selling far and away more index funds
than actively managed funds. According to industry sources,
Fidelity saw roughly $3.9 billion move into its index funds this
year through mid-November, compared with about $2.4 billion in all
of its active funds combined.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history aside, active management is still where investors
are putting the lion's share of their money. Overall, just 6
percent of all stock and bond assets are in index funds, says
Financial Research. So far this year 16.8 percent of all new money
coming into stock and bond funds is being indexed, but that is up
from 2.6 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Sauter, managing director at Vanguard, points out that there
was just $1 billion in all of indexing in 1987, a decade after
Vanguard started the first index fund. Today that number is roughly
$200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Active managers have gotten buried as the market has risen over
the last five years, but they have also mostly trailed in down
markets when stock pickers were supposed to have an advantage. In
five market downturns dating to 1990, the majority of active
managers have beaten the indexes only once, in the brief October
1997 sell-off, says Kanon Bloch. In the most recent market
correction, from July 17 to Aug. 31 this year, only 21 percent of
mana-gers beat the Vanguard 500 index, Kanon Bloch says.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Kinnel, equity funds editor for Morningstar, says it would
be wrong to suggest that indexing is a one-size-fits-all solution
for investors. In fact, index funds for small and mid-cap stocks
have performed on average only slightly better than their actively
managed peers, he says. Among nine small-cap index funds tracked by
Morningstar, six have trailed the small-cap group over five years,
Kinnel says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, index funds look about as un-American today as making
money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can't accuse Fidelity Magellan manager Bob Stansky of hyping
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Stansky told an audience Monday that investors should get used
to the idea of a stock market that earns 6 to 8 percent a year over
the next year. Big numbers, like the 20 and 30 percent returns in
some recent years, aren't likely, at least in part because of
slowing corporate earnings growth, Stansky said in a rare public
speaking appearance before the American Business Editors and
Writers Conference on Personal Finance.
</P>
<P>
   As for Magellan, Stanksy said he will probably continue the
recent pattern of concentrating more of the fund's assets in its
largest stock holdings. About 22 percent of the fund's assets are
held in its top 10 stocks. Sixty percent of assets are in the
fund's top 50 holdings.

DOCTORS FIND THAT HORMONES _ BOTH MALE AND FEMALE _ IMPROVE WOMEN'S
LIBIDOS

<TEXT>
<P>
   In March, talk-show host Cristina Ferrare told viewers that she
had lost interest in sex and feared for her marriage _ until a
prescription made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Judith Reichman prescribed a 2 percent testosterone
ointment, which Ferrare, 47, credits with reviving her interest in
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor and patient were invited to talk about the treatment on
``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' where they were overwhelmed by the
response from sexually distressed women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got so many call-ins and e-mails, and the online audience
participation was so high, we couldn't finish the show,'' Reichman
says.
</P>
<P>
   Reichman, who practices and teaches at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center and UCLA in Los Angeles, this month published ``I'm Not in
the Mood: What Every Woman Should Know About Improving Her Libido''
(William Morrow, $21.95).
</P>
<P>
   Female sexual dysfunction continues to be dismissed, denied or
ignored by much of the medical establishment, Reichman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man who can't get an erection because of low testosterone
levels is an endocrinologic catastrophe, whereas a woman with an
androgen deficiency that leads to sexual problems falls into the
category of, `Oh, well, use a lubricant,''' Reichman says.
</P>
<P>
   But things are changing. New hormone replacement therapy with a
combination of male and female hormones is making a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Libido maintenance is complicated _ especially for women, whose
sexuality is activated, at least in part, by male sex hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial role of male sex hormones in female sexuality was
the subject of a telebriefing during the recent annual meeting of
the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of medical researchers, practicing gynecologists and
medical school professors who convened also helped formulate the
first clinical guidelines on the ``Role of Androgens in the
Menopause.''
</P>
<P>
   Androgens are male sex hormones, with testosterone the best
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women experiencing symptoms such as sexual dysfunction, sleep
disturbance, depression, anxiety, fatigue and lethargy associated
with natural menopause usually have substantially impaired quality
of life and should be considered candidates for estrogen-androgen
combination therapy,'' the guidelines conclude.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of women do not even know that they naturally
produce androgens, much less that they produce more testosterone
than estrogen in their 20s and 30s, says Dr. Gloria Bachmann,
chairman of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hormone replacement therapy has been around since the 1930s,
but we ignored the data,'' says Dr. Morrie Gelfand, professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at McGill University in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed testosterone was for men and estrogen for women.
Actually, men and women have both estrogens and androgens, just the
amount differs. We're not thinking of giving women androgen in high
doses. What we are talking about is replacing the androgen, the
testosterone, that their ovaries have lost with menopause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We found from several different studies that at least 60
percent of women experience a decline in sexual desire at menopause
that can be very distressing,'' says Dr. Philip Sarrel, professor
of obstetrics, gynecology and psychiatry at Yale University School
of Medicine. ``It is most distressing to women who have considered
being sexual a very natural and normal part of being a woman _
women who have always been sexually interested and responsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1990, I published a paper stating that replacing estrogen
was sufficient to rekindle desire, while others were already saying
that androgens were important. I subsequently learned my work was
incorrect. As time went on, the response to estrogen alone
failed,'' Sarrel says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless testosterone is replaced, women are going to experience
a major loss in sexual desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachmann says she looks for relief of symptoms and keeps a check
on patients' lipid levels rather than testing for the amount of
testosterone circulating in the blood to determine how much to
give.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to quit measuring and focus on contentment. When women
say it was good and now it isn't, or I used to enjoy sex and now I
don't, we need to treat that problem. It's the change in attitude
that brings women in to see me. That's what needs fixing,''
Reichman says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   THE SEVEN SEXUAL SABOTEURS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women can't blame all their sexual woes on hormones. Other
factors that may be sabotaging female libido, according to Dr.
Judith Reichman, include:
</P>
<P>
   PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES: Depression, stress and anxiety, fatigue,
sexual abuse, and body image issues can undermine sexual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   COUPLE TROUBLE: Couple problems that have sexual repercussions
include relationship difficulties, power issues and lack of sexual
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICATIONS: Birth control pills, antidepressants,
antipsychotics, tranquilizers, blood pressure-lowering drugs,
antacids, antihistamines and antibiotics may undermine the libido.
</P>
<P>
   DISEASES: Long-standing health problems _ diabetes, heart and
lung disease, autoimmune diseases, thyroid disease, epilepsy _ can
make sex uncomfortable and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION: Many of the medical
procedures associated with the treatment of pelvic disease and
cancer can trigger sudden menopause, with disastrous libido
results.
</P>
<P>
   PAIN: Dyspareunia, which is pain with intercourse, is the most
common sexual complaint reported to gynecologists, occurring in 10
percent to 15 percent of women.
</P>
<P>
   MEN: Women who don't have a partner, or who have a partner who
can't or won't participate in a satisfactory sexual union, lose an
important opportunity to be ``in the mood.''

NEELY COMEBACK WAS NEEDED BY FANS AS WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now I know how Professor Henry Higgins felt at one point in ``My
Fair Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know exactly what it was that brought on his reaction,
but, as I recall, the dialogue went something like this: ``Damn!
Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!''
</P>
<P>
   That was my own reaction to the news that Cam Neely won't be
able to pursue his dream of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Damn!
</P>
<P>
   We desperately needed him in this town. There is no professional
basketball. The football team is on life support. The baseball
team's general manager, who simply doesn't believe that the game is
actually played by people, is actively pursuing the anti-Christ.
Save for a few guys, the hockey team might as well be entered into
the Federal Witness Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, and we needed one really good feel-good story to
brighten up the professional sports scene. Cam Neely was going to
be that story.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Was.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave it 150 percent,'' says orthopedic physical therapist
Dan Dyrek. ``It just wasn't meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand that playing hockey wasn't what Cam Neely had in mind
when he went to see the renowned body reconstructor last March.
Between his right hip and his left knee, he felt 133, not 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't negotiate a staircase,'' Dyrek recalls. ``He
couldn't sit comfortably in a chair for more than 15 minutes at a
time. The goal was to get him functional and as pain-free as
possible in his daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyrek is the man who, among his many professional
accomplishments, basically gave Larry Bird an extra five or six
years in his career. You can go so far as to say that Celtics'
title No. 16 would never have happened had Dyrek not taken care of
Larry's aching elbow. His massage table ought to be dangling from
the FleetCenter ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Dyrek won't be able to say the same thing about Neely, but that
doesn't mean Neely thinks any less of Dyrek than Bird does. The
basic mission was accomplished a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were going along great,'' says Dyrek. ``About three
months into it, Cam called me up one day and said, `Dan, you think
I could maybe play hockey?' And I said, `This was not part of the
deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dyrek had certainly promised Neely neither a rose garden nor a
second career in the NHL. But he was satisfied that Neely was
within his rights to pursue that dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he wasn't going to do anything to hurt himself, I
didn't see why he couldn't try,'' Dyrek explains.
</P>
<P>
   So Cam tried. Oh, boy, did he try. He skated and skated. He
pumped iron. He dropped weight. He did everything to get himself
into a condition where he even had the right to ask the Bruins
about anything. Cam has too much respect for the game and the team
to have injected himself into a situation where he clearly didn't
belong.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't want to be a tease, I'm sure, but, in a sense that's
what he was. The players and the coach saw that he had retained
certain skills. I'm sure more than a few imaginations had begun to
run amok.
</P>
<P>
   But it was always an ultra long shot. The game in question was
hockey, as demanding a team sporting activity as we know, and the
brand of hockey was the NHL version. It is a very rugged activity,
and within a week it was brought home to Cam Neely that the mind
and the heart can only take you so far if the body is under
enormous siege.
</P>
<P>
   He felt (relatively) OK the first day, but that was one day. It
didn't take long before Cam knew this probably wasn't going to be a
Go, and he wasn't the only one who realized the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him last Saturday at the FleetCenter,'' says Dyrek. ``He
was doing everything he was supposed to do, but I looked at his
face and I could see pain. I said,`Hmmm, I think we have a
turnaround.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dyrek isn't saying ``I told ya' so,'' because he didn't know how
it would turn out. His experiences with these elite athletes have
taught him not to underestimate their capacity to rise above
debilitating physical circumstances. He thought that Cam Neely was
well within his rights to try this comeback. Dan Dyrek has, and
always will have, enormous respect for Cam Neely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is top-notch,'' confirms Dyrek. ``I've gotten to know him
as a person and he is very special. He is very intelligent. He was
a very, very good patient who asked very good questions. He gave
this his very best shot. As I said, he gave it 150 percent. It
obviously just wasn't meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   What matters most is that Dyrek has done what Neely asked him to
do. Within months Cam was playing 18 holes of golf. He can walk
those staircases. He can sit in that chair. ``He can do those
things almost without pain,'' says Dyrek, ``and some days he can do
them completely without pain.''
</P>
<P>
   He just can't play hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Damn!
</P>

A CRUISE GUIDE FOR `IDIOTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost 75 million Americans have indicated a strong desire to
take a cruise within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   It's an amazing figure when you consider that up to now only
11.3 percent of Americans have taken a cruise. That's a lot better
than in '86, when the Cruise Lines International Association
reported just 3.6 percent of Americans had cruised.
</P>
<P>
   But now, based on these latest figures, the cruise industry has
a target market of 133 million. Said James Godsman, president of
CLIA, ``When CLIA conducted its first consumer research study in
1986, we found that we had an extremely small _ but very loyal _
cadre of cruisers in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, only 20 percent of Americans fit our target
definition of individuals 25 and older with household incomes of
$20,000 and above,'' Godsman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises are receiving exceptional satisfaction ratings. In the
``extremely satisfied'' category, cruises rank above all other
types of vacations. Even those who have yet to take a cruise view
such vacations as better than other types for their pampering,
their visits to several destinations, the relaxation and romance
they offer, the fine dining available, and the luxury, said
Godsman.
</P>
<P>
   With such a rosy picture of cruising, it would seem that many
more people would simply walk into a travel agency office and book
a cruise. But many potential cruisers fear the unknown: Will they
feel out of place? What should they wear? Will they miss out on
something aboard the ship, or end up on a lousy tour?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to many of those questions can be found in a new
guide-book, ``The Complete Idiot's Travel Guide to Cruise
Vacations'' by Fran Wenograd Golden (Alpha Books, $16.95). Golden,
a Boston-area resident and cruise editor for the trade publication
Travel Weekly, knows you are not an idiot but that you have some
legitimate ideas as well as misconceptions about what a cruise is
about.
</P>
<P>
   Here, packed in 446 pages, are candid and humorous views on
taking a cruise: tips on picking a ship, on stateroom selection,
activities on board, tours ashore, ripoffs, tourist traps, and
tipping. It's a good book even for those who have taken a cruise
and are contemplating their next one.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean International, Fran Golden says in her book, is
``proof that big can be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``beautiful proof'' can be found in the line's newest
vessel, the Vision of the Seas, which visited Boston in September
while on its maiden voyage to America.
</P>
<P>
   The Vision is appropriately named because it is the last in the
line's Vision-class ships _ all somewhat similar in design, public
facilities, and staterooms.
</P>
<P>
   On a all-too-brief cruise, this Vision came across as brighter,
livelier, and more pleasing to the senses.
</P>
<P>
   The 78,491-ton ship is now sailing on 10- and 11-day cruises
between San Juan and Acapulco. Other vessels in this class are the
Legend of the Seas, Splendour of the Seas, Grandeur of the Seas,
Enchantment of the Seas, and Rhapsody of the Seas.
</P>
<P>
   While the ships are similar in design, there are differences in
each, so that even if you've sailed on one, you may find another
more to your liking. I, for example, enjoyed the Vision of the Seas
on a brief cruise more than the others I've visited.
</P>
<P>
   The Vision seemed lighter in decor, easier on the eye, just more
pleasant to explore. I remember one of the earlier vessels had lots
of Roman statuary that seemed out of place to me, but the Vision
offers a simpler design. Its ShipShape Fitness Center offers Mayan
textiles and art throughout that just seems the perfect fit for a
spa experience.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other differences are subtle, some major. For
example, while all the Vision-Class vessels may look similar
outside, there are differences ranging from the length of the
vessel (867 feet to 915 feet) and the tonnage, (69,130 tons to
78,491 tons) to various features. Two ships have 18-hole miniature
golf courses aboard, the others have no golf course; two have the
ShipShape Spa on one level, the others on two levels; two have
dining rooms with a single glass wall spanning both levels, while
the others have round windows on the lower level and a glass wall
on the balconies.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the ships similar yet different provides a great
oceangoing experience for cruisers who enjoy the Royal Caribbean
level of service, yet want to experience different ports of call (a
variety of itineraries are offered for each ship) with a different
shipboard atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Like the otherVision-class vessels, the Vision of the Seas
offers a variety of stateroom experiences, including the
ultra-luxurious Royal Suite with 1,117 square feet of space, a
132-square-foot private balcony, and a spacious separate living and
bedroom area. It was a bit ostentatious for my taste.
</P>
<P>
   I think if I were to book that stateroom, I'd never come out and
experience the dining and entertainment features of the ship. I
enjoyed my simple outside cabin with its small balcony (private
balconies are high on my must-book cruise needs).
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the lower-category room is a lot less costly,
yet I could enjoy the same level of service and food as those who
might book that lavish Royal Suite.
</P>
<P>
   The Vision also has some nice family suites with two bedrooms, a
separate living area, and two baths _ an ideal family setup. For
the physically challenged, the Vision offers 14 rooms with a
functional bathroom facility and special devices to aid the hearing
and visually impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Next November, Royal Caribbean will introduce the world's
largest cruise ship, a mammoth 142,000-ton vessel, and is currently
also building a huge new terminal in Miami to serve it.
</P>
<P>
   The Voyager of The Seas will be filled with innovative touches.
Among them will be a sports court for basketball and volleyball, a
rock-climbing wall, and an ice skating rink. The ship will also
feature the first horizontal atrium, the Royal Promenade, filled
with shops, restaurants, and entertainment areas. The ship will
also have staterooms that overlook this lively street scene.
</P>
<P>

Norwegian discoveries
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bergen Line features air/sea Norwegian Coastal Voyage
programs along the spectacular 1,250-mile west coast of Norway. The
voyage, between Bergen in the south and Kirkenes in the north, is
seven days northbound, six days southbound, and 12 days round-trip.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle is like a major tattoo exhibition: Walk down a
busy street on Capitol Hill, around Pioneer Square or in the
University District and body art is everywhere _ arms, legs,
shoulders, necks, even cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the city is moving into a post-grunge era where tattoos may
become unhip.
</P>
<P>
   One-time ravers now find themselves moving up the corporate
ladder, where tattoos are not part of the uniform. One
thirtysomething investment banker says he had his tattoo removed by
a laser process last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my colleagues to know,'' he said, explaining why
he didn't want his name used. ``That is exactly why I had it
removed. I never thought the day would come when I would feel
embarrassed about my tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years tattoo artists thrived as the craze grew across
age groups. If you had firm skin, you weren't too old to get a
tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   But tattoos don't fade away, and the trend inevitably will.
Unless you can fork over several hundred dollars and have a high
pain threshold, you'll live with your body art for the rest of your
life.
</P>
<P>
   Tattoo removal by laser _ in which the ink compounds are broken
down and absorbed by the body _ is expensive, painful, may leave a
scar and is only 90 percent successful. Still, those who can no
longer live with their decorations are opting for laser treatment,
which currently is the best method of removal, say dermatologists.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Johnson, 28, a Seattle construction worker got his first
tattoo _ a large scorpion bearing his birth date _ on his right
shoulder when he was 17. He later got a second, smaller tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's keeping the smaller one for the time being, he's not
comfortable with the scorpion body art he once loved to show off
and he makes a point of covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its gaudy looking and pretty big,'' he said. ``T-shirts cover
it, but I can't wear a tank top.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he sometimes forgets that the tattoo is there ``until I
see it in the mirror and say, `Good god!'.''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, getting a tattoo 10 years ago was cool because it
wasn't trendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to do something that is trendy,'' he said. ``It's kinda
embarrassing (now) when I'm out swimming or something. I'm
conscious of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He had two laser sessions with Dr. Peter Odlend, a dermatologist
on Capitol Hill, and will need four more treatments. At around $300
a session, to remove the tattoo completely will cost about $1,800,
and this is with a small discount, since Johnson's wife, Amy, works
for Odlend.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson paid $50 to get the tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good exchange,'' he said of the far higher cost for
removal, ``and it is more painful than getting the tattoo, but I'll
just be glad when it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Johnson, 28, had her tattoo done for $30 when she was 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always wanted it,'' she said. ``(But) everybody has a
tattoo today, it's too trendy. Now you're different if you don't
have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her tattoo _ a sunshine with a face _ was on her hip
and not often noticeable, she still wanted it gone. She had it
removed by a dermatologist in Boston about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the removal procedure was much more painful than
getting the tattoo. She was fortunate though, since she did not
have to pay. The dermatologist she worked for then was testing
different lasers and she volunteered to be a guinea pig. Laser
procedure to remove a similar tattoo would cost around $1,500
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kinda glad I don't have it,'' Amy Johnson said. ``The
yellow pigment is still there and there is a slight scar, but you
can barely see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dermatologists say the laser technology most commonly used in
tattoo removal works best on black and blue but does not respond
well to yellow, green and red. The latter three colors each require
a different laser for more effective removal, but since the lasers
cost about $150,000 a piece, dermatologists generally do not have
the full range, says Goffe.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor in tattoo removal is the type of ink that was
used, said Odlend. Organic ink can be removed more easily than the
resistant metallic dye.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller tattoos in a single basic color are easier to remove and
obviously less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Odlend said he talks to every patient about the possibility of
scarring and how much of the tattoo can be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they're pretty decided they're going to get laser when
they get here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a higher risk of scarring if the tattoo is on the
shoulder. Keloid scars _ a reddish growth of collagen _ develop
more easily on that part of the body, said Odlend.
</P>
<P>
   Darker skin is more susceptible to scarring, which explains why
African Americans have more problems with keloids, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Renner, 18, chose laser removal because he didn't like the
look of his tattoo. The tattoo was an incomplete abstract design.
</P>
<P>
   Renner went to Dr. Ben Goffe, a dermatologist also based on
Capitol Hill, who said it will take at least six sessions, $300
apiece, to remove the tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Each procedure starts with the application of a local
anesthetic, which eases the pain but doesn't totally deaden the
area.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent session, Renner lay still and tried not to wince
as Goffe, wearing protective goggles, used a steady hand to guide
the laser over the tattoo as though he were tracing the design.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like snapping rubber bands as the laser started to
work, creating what looked like little red sparks as it penetrated
the skin and dissolved the ink.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, a trail of blood followed the laser. Renner felt
pain but didn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has high pain threshold,'' Goffe said. ``Some people cannot
take it and need more anesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Each session lasts no longer than 15 minutes. The next treatment
can be done only after the previous session heals, which usually
takes about six weeks. Depending on the size of the tattoo, the
full treatment, which might require six or seven sessions, could
take more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Laser technology has become more effective over the years, said
Goffe, and the chance of scarring is less than for other methods of
cosmetic removal.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Estrada, a Seattle dental assistant, said she was not
given that option. She went to a plastic surgeon a few years ago
and had her tattoo surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terribly painful and got infected,'' she said. ``I
thought he was going to use a laser, but I think he used a blade. I
just went with it anyway because I wanted it out so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She paid about $500, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada was 21 when she got her tattoo, an army insignia on her
left ankle, just above the heel. She regretted it shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out with a bunch of people in Texas, got drunk and got
the tattoo,'' she said. ``I'm not a tattoo type of person. I never
liked it and wanted it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people who get tattoos know what they're doing and don't
get them on impulse, say tattoo artists. Many who have tattoos
agree.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Daniel Berg, associate professor of dermatology at
the University of Washington, said ``most people get tattoos in
their teens and have not figured out what they want to do with
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So those who choose a statement of undying love, such as ``I
love Julie'' may be well advised: Don't get too many colors.

CATE BLANCHETT IS COMMANDING ATTNETION AS ELIZABETH I 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth I is the quintessential English historic icon _
the ``virgin queen'' who ruled for 45 years in her nation's golden
age.
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett is a 28-year-old Australian stage and screen
actress.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett portrays the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn in
director Shekhar Kapur's grand, if fictionalized, costume drama
``Elizabeth,'' which opens Friday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Elizabeth as she's imprisoned in the Tower as a
teenager and faces the threat of death at the hand of her Catholic
half-sister, Queen Mary. She's separated from her first love,
Robert Dudley (played by Ralph Fiennes' brother, Joseph), because
he may be a traitor to her cause. The film ends with Elizabeth's
coronation in 1558 at the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So how does a young Australian play an English monarch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Blanchett says in a phone interview from New York. ``I
won't work in reaction to what others have done. I'd seen the BBC
version with Glenda Jackson (``Elizabeth R'') when I was in high
school. I watched the Bette Davis film (``Virgin Queen'') later and
I did a lot of reading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I also went to the National Portrait Gallery,'' says
Blanchett, whose eyebrows and eyelashes were bleached, her hairline
shaved and half her hair dyed white for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we all discussed the fact that this would not be a totally
accurate historical portrait of Elizabeth,'' she emphasizes. ``That
was never the intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did go back to out of frustration, particularly at male
historians who dwelled on her so-called virginity, were the letters
she wrote. It was there I could see the mechanics of her brain and
her thought processes and the way she was able to play people off
against each other, as well as her extraordinary intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Elizabeth's interior life will always be speculation
and fictitious. We know the events in history and the impact she
had upon England, but how she felt about things is always
invention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The little things helped,'' adds Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned how robust she was and that she liked men who
hunted, danced and were agile. She was vigorous as a human being.
The Elizabethan Age was an electric, volatile age. It's not as
staid as the BBC version of her life would have us believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, she was in her element in front of a large crowd.
She had the instincts of a performer and she was aware of dramatic
impact and the symbolism of gestures.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett is a graduate of Australia's National Institute of the
Dramatic Arts (where Mel Gibson and Judy Davis once played opposite
each other in ``Romeo and Juliet'') and moved from the stage into
such movies as ``Paradise Road,'' ``Oscar and Lucinda'' and ``Thank
God He Met Lizzie,'' which played at this year's Seattle
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Her performances have been singled out in reviews, over such big
names as Glenn Close, Frances McDormand and Ralph Fiennes. She has
a gravity and grace onscreen that commands attention. Her Elizabeth
is accessible, savvy and strong.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Aussie and ``Elizabeth'' co-star Geoffrey Rush
(``Shine'') says, ``She's great, the talk of the town in an
extraordinary breed of young Australian actors,'' including Miranda
Otto, Toni Collette, Rachel Griffiths and Matt Day. Director
Michael Rymer, whose film ``Angel Baby'' won several Australian
Film Institute awards, says simply, ``She's the one to watch.''
High praise, but they're compliments that make Blanchett blanch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very nice thing for Geoffrey to say but I think what
distinguishes me is what distinguishes them. There's no sense of
homogeneity at the moment in the Australian film industry as far as
actors. All the actors you name embrace their differences, which I
think is really healthy. And it's hard in Australia because we're
farther away from America, which is a comparatively enormous film
industry, so it's rarer we even get seen overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   As an Australian, did she have any concerns about foraying into
English territory? ``Not at all. I actually balk at the idea of
`nationalism.' It's a very conservative concept and I relish
working with a disparate group of people. The idea of working with
(Indian director) Shekhar was what excited me about this project.
Nothing is purely an Australian _ or American _ film anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, none of the directors I've worked with lately are
Australian. I've just done three films with British directors _
`The Talented Mr. Ripley' with Anthony Minghella (who won Oscars
for `The English Patient'), `Pushing Tin' with Mike Newell and `An
Ideal Husband' with Oliver Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Italian-English-Australian crews with a British and
Australian cast on one; an American and Australian cast and an
English director on another. There is no purely national filmmaking
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Was her transition from the stage to the screen easy? ``It
depends on the role,'' she says. ``It's important to know the style
in which everyone involved in a project is working. You can tailor
your instincts to the style so you're all involved in the same
film.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, I'm doing David Hare's play `Plenty' next year at
the Almeida in London and I'm really excited about it, but that
play terrifies me because I have no idea yet how to approach it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with film is you have a time lag before you know
whether it all works or not. In the theater, you find out each
night whether you've communicated something to the audience. You're
dislocated from the audience in film and in some ways, it's
dissatisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett laughs, ``It's not until, God willing, you're in the
supermarket and someone stops you and asks what it was like to work
with Ralph Fiennes (her co-star in `Oscar and Lucinda'). Then you
know someone's actually gone to see your film.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actress, who married Andrew Upton in June of last year,
says she's not interested in developing projects aimed at steering
her toward stardom, no matter how great the feeling when she's
recogized in the express line at the local store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in pushing myself forward because I think
human beings often push too hard in a totally wrong direction,''
she says. ``I'm fluid about work and so far I've been lucky enough
to be in the right place at the right time without having to push
my photograph around a lot. I feel better and more secure if I've
gotten the job because of the previous work I've done. If I don't
get cast because my profile's not high enough, then it's probably
not the right film for me to do anyway.''

MICROSOFT GEARS UP FOR FLATTER WORLD OF COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Microsoft Corp. wants to be the common currency
in a flat-Earth society.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman William H. Gates has unveiled technologies
that could make the software giant the leader of the next computer
revolution: portable flat-panel computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' Gates told the Comdex computer industry trade show
Sunday in describing the devices, adding that the machines would
become an integral part of the computing world. ``In fact,'' he
said, ``it's hard to say where's the dividing line between the
personal companion and the PC.''
</P>
<P>
   Flat-panel displays are tubeless computer screens that use
updated variations on liquid crystal displays. Think of the old
gray-on-gray digital watches, but with larger, vivid color
capabilities and back lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Because they don't use bulky, energy-sucking cathode ray tubes,
flat-panel displays are slim and light. They are already the
standard on all laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   This new generation of displays, coupled with smaller computers
that store data on chips instead of bulky hard drives and that have
touch-screen input capabilities, is putting heavy-duty computing
power onto small forms that resemble writing tablets and date
books.
</P>
<P>
   Gates announced a potent duo of technologies that signal
Microsoft's determination to set the standards for this new class
of computer.
</P>
<P>
   The first is ClearType. This new technology, Microsoft claims,
triples text resolution on flat-panel displays. The second involves
Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, a subset of the ubiquitous
Windows OS that can be stored and run on a small, energy-saving
chip.
</P>
<P>
   Wedded together, these two technologies create a portable
computing standard. ``The fact is, if we introduce this technology
(ClearType) into the operating system ...'' Microsoft researcher
Bill Hill began to explain to the Comdex audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which we will,'' Gates interrupted. Responded Black: ``OK,
when we introduce this technology into the operating system ...''
</P>
<P>
   Black then explained how all-encompassing the company expects
ClearType to be: ``Office documents. E-mail. Internet content.
Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Already this new combination has allowed Microsoft to seize the
budding eBook market. eBooks are large, flat-panel devices that
display the content of books in digital form. Gates said eBooks
``will be moving to Windows CE in their next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said several major publishers, including Simon &AMP; Schuster and
Time-Warner, have agreed to adopt the Microsoft way for this next
digital publishing wave.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is on trial in Washington in an antitrust case brought
by the Justice Department.

SHAMROCKS FOR A SAVVY SHIPMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRALEE, Ireland _ It was 40 years ago this spring in Pearl
Harbor, Hawaii, that I had my first encounter with Ireland. A man
who had never been there told me that if he ever had any money, he
would visit the land of his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   This encounter came through the agency of Bernard T. Casey, late
of the Bronx, my friend and shipmate on the diesel submarine
Carbonero. We were on paint-chipping detail. That tattoo on his
shoulder, he informed me patiently, was not a clover leaf but a
shamrock. And you pronounced it ``bra,'' not `brag' when you read
the legend under it. ``Erin go Bragh'' meant ``Ireland forever''
Casey said, and counseled me to take that to heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later, Casey returned to the subject of Ireland. He was
in a mellow mood after a few beers on a moonlit beach with some
shipmates and after we had driven off some local toughs with the
teak club I always carried under the car seat. It was no
shillelagh, Casey said, but it had done nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that country,'' he suddenly said, out of nowhere.
``Some day I hope to go there.'' He meant Ireland. But when I last
saw him 33 years ago, there had been a marriage, a child, a job,
night school to further his career, and what with one thing and
another, he still hadn't gotten to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But I got there this year and, old friend and shipmate, wherever
you are, here is my report:
</P>
<P>
   If you would go to Ireland, go in the spring. Not only will you
avoid wading hip deep in tourists, but you will be there when the
countryside does its wearin' of the green. Go to the west if you
can or the southwest or the northwest. Save Dublin for another trip
entirely. It will be worth a separate trip, but for now go to where
the west wind, the poet's ``Zephyrus with its sweete breathe,''
brings in the warm rain from the Gulf Stream that makes the thin
soil over the basalt and the limestone sprout with the green that
has become the country's national color for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Don't complain about the rain. The Irish don't complain, and
joke about it instead. Besides, May and June are the sunniest
months in Ireland, climatologists will tell you with a straight
face.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you were never to meet any of the people _ and it would
be a tragedy _ you should find yourself a hillside or two and gaze
out over the lushly green meadows bordered in walls of Ireland's
plentiful stone and old hedges.
</P>
<P>
   You should rent a car and drive, especially on those narrow
country roads and up and down the steep mountain roads that will
take you to the real Ireland. Driving in Ireland on the left side
and through those narrow lanes bordered by stone walls or hedges or
both will test your skill and nerve to get past a big semi or a
tour bus. But the Irish drive with seeming unconcern, and I don't
want you to let on that an American's nerves are less steely than
that of an Irish driver.
</P>
<P>
   I should prepare you for an uncanny experience. When you stand
on a city street, it will be unnerving to see all the cars glide by
with no one in the driver's seat. But don't fret: All cars in
Ireland are equipped with controls on the right-hand side and can
be driven from the front passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
   So drive into County Clare and drive up to the Burren, a region
of that county that travel books and tourist brochures don't always
mention, for some reason. It is a near desert of limestone flats
and mountains, with a little grass growing in the cracks that
somehow sustains a few sheep and cows.
</P>
<P>
   If you weren't Irish already, contemplating that desert and then
reflecting on how thin the soil is elsewhere and how close disaster
and tragedy always have been, you would learn here why the Irish
always seem so resigned to inevitable misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they absorb that into their bones, but it has also made
them great poets. Just pull out the map and scan the sonorous place
names that speak of the poetic impulse of a people who also have
had 5,000 years in which to devise and polish those names. There is
music in the Tullamores, the Dundalks, the Kinsales, in Kilkenny
and Kildare, in Connemara, in Limerick, and in Drogheda. They sound
even more sonorous when spoken in Gaelic, the official language of
Ireland, but which is the daily speech of only about 50,000 people,
most of them in Connemara. That's 1 percent of Ireland's five
million people.
</P>
<P>
   So pervasive is that poetic sense that the lyricist for the
musical ``Finian's Rainbow'' could write ``How are things in
Glockamorra'' and to this day few people know that there is no such
place.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry, and writing in general, is very important in Ireland.
Even before you get to Ireland, if you take an Aer Lingus flight,
you will come upon the Irish preoccupation with the written word.
You will find that the seat covers are imprinted with handwritten
lines in Gaelic and English from many of Ireland's great literary
works.
</P>
<P>
   You might even come upon as startling a scene as we did in a pub
near Bantry Bay. Two truck drivers sitting at the bar were deep in
conversation. Were they speaking of the price of diesel fuel? Of
the terrible freight rates? Of the prospects for peace in Northern
Ireland? They were not. They were examining the proposition of
whether Oscar Wilde was a writer in the Irish tradition or whether
he should more properly be ranked among English writers.
</P>
<P>
   I did not stick around to hear the conclusion. One thing I was
convinced of sight unseen is that the argument was resolved
peacefully. Forget that canard about Irish pugnaciousness. The
people know when to use it and when not.
</P>
<P>
   Manners are as important as prose and poetry. Take the following
scene in the hotel restaurant here: At a table full of yuppies _
Ireland has them, too, alas _ one young man was loudly talking on
his cellular telephone about some business that interested no one.
</P>
<P>
   We all bore his bad behavior in silence, but as soon as he was
off the phone, a man at a neighboring table stood up and approached
the yuppie table. With his gray hair, military posture, and
authoritative bearing, he could have been a Gaelic chieftain, and
with a voice that was both thunder and gentleness, he admonished
the young man that if he should get another call on his portable
phone, he should be kind enough to answer it outside the dining
room because the rest of the patrons wished to eat their dinner in
peace and have conversations of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The man then had to endure a procession of fellow diners who
stopped by his table to voice their hearty approval.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of dining, forget the jokes about Irish cuisine being
an oxymoron. The Irish can cook quite well, and they do it at
reasonable prices. And there is great beer, stout, and wine. And I
hope I don't have to instruct you about the merits of Irish
whiskey. We gained weight scandalously, both from sumptuous dinners
in elegant restaurants and from lunches in neighborhood pubs.
</P>
<P>
   And, for God's sake, if you come across some real Irish music in
one of those pubs, don't go all mushy and sentimental on me when
listening to the real thing. Forget about the Irish-American
staples like ``Mother McCree'' or ``When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.''
Here you will find the real thing, Kerry slides, reels, and such
heart-tugging favorites as ``Galway Bay,'' and ``Maggie.''
</P>
<P>
   If you should find yourself sitting pensively at a bar,
listening to those fine songs, pay for your drink with a 20-punt
note. (It's pronounced pound. It's spelled p-u-n-t, but don't
pronounce it that way unless you are speaking in Gaelic). Your
change will contain a 10-punt note.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, you will see James Joyce, smiling enigmatically
like the Mona Lisa. Flip the note over. You will be startled
because what you will read is this: ``riverrun, past Eve and
Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a
commodious vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and
Environs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, the opening paragraph from ``Finnegans Wake,''
Joyce's masterpiece with which he said he was trying to fathom the
linguistic memory of the race. Where but in Ireland would you find
literature on a bank note? Did you know that writers and poets pay
no income taxes in Ireland?
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what will be on the bills of the Euro currency
once it displaces the punt. The designers could do worse than
putting such a literary quotation on at least one of the bills.
Perhaps they could use the end of Part I of ``Finnegans Wake,'' or
better yet, the last dozen lines or so from Molly Bloom's soliloquy
at the end of ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Europe owes Ireland an ineradicable debt of
gratitude. It was Irish monks who in their isolation and precarious
existence kept the embers of civilization glowing for the more than
300 years between the fall of the Roman Empire in AD 476 and the
rebirth of culture at the Carolingian court of Charlemagne about AD
800.
</P>
<P>
   In that long night, Europe was the scene of strife, warfare,
murder and corruption, when every generation knew less than the one
before and when good manners, arts, sciences, and writing sank from
sight.
</P>
<P>
   When the long nightmare ended, it was the Irish monks who stood
ready to Christianize Europe and who were ready with the books they
had so laboriously copied in their stone huts on windy coasts all
these years.
</P>
<P>
   For details, you might want to read Thomas Cahill's book ``How
the Irish Saved Civilization.'' Incidentally, when my wife,
Barbara, asked a young historian in Tralee's Ashe Memorial Hall
museum and research center whether she had read that book, the
young woman smiled and said, ``I always assumed it was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it is not. And I think the designers of the Euro currency
should put Molly Bloom's soliloquy on one of them. So what if that
soliloquy is about Molly's sexual fantasies. How many non-Irish
would know? And if they do, so what. As the Irish would say, have a
bit of wit.

WHO'S GOT TIME? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the most valuable brand names in all of corporate
America belong to to the gatherers and packagers of news. The New
York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the
Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, The
Philadelphia Inquirer: These are the best newspapers in the
country. Their reputations for diligence and independence mean a
good deal to their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, magazines are fading as a source of
independent views.
</P>
<P>
   The paradoxical reason: too much money chasing the most
attractive audiences. A wave of technical change has made entry
into the business easier than ever. E-zines _ electronic magazines
published on the World Wide Web _ have begun competing for ads,
too. The result is an epic fragmentation of revenues that gives
advertisers the whip hand.
</P>
<P>
   Television network news organizations have been reduced to
humble status for similar reasons. Once able to survey the scene
with the equanimity of the the truly wealthy, ABC, CBS, and NBC
have been driven by competition to flirting with the likes of movie
director (and conspiracy buff) Oliver Stone in hopes of earning
high enough returns to satisfy their corporate parents: Walt Disney
Co., CBS Corp. (formerly Westinghouse Electric Corp.), General
Electric Co., respectively.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when magazines, too, were a powerful force
binding Americans in a common culture. Time, Readers Digest, The
Saturday Evening Post, The New Yorker, Life, Fortune, Sports
Illustrated, Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   But relentless demographic and techological change has worked a
great transformation. The Saturday Evening Post went out of
business in 1969, replaced to all intents and purposes by Rolling
Stone. (A low-budget ghost edition of the Post survives.) The
picture weekly Life was a victim of television _ though successor
People magazine thrives symbiotically on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated's franchise, though healthy, is under fire
from upstart ESPN. Readers Digest got lost somewhere along the way;
Monday it auctioned off much of its magnificent art collection to
raise cash. Forbes has turned into a vehicle for its quixotic
editor-in-chief's presidential ambitions. The New Yorker, the
quintessential big tent, fired its loss-making editor and is trying
to reclaim focus.
</P>
<P>
   The latest grand old name to turn up in the spotlight is Time
magazine, now a cog in the great wheel, which is the Time &UR;  &LR; Warner
entertainment conglomerate. Last spring's debacle over its
``Operation Tailwind'' story _ the phony account of how the United
States was supposed to have used nerve gas during the Vietnam War
jointly done with another Time Warner property, Cable News Network
_ was just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent controversy has to do with single-advertiser
issues. In a story Monday, New York Times media reporter Alex
Kuczynski disclosed that Time's first issue of 1999 would be
devoted to ``The Future of Medicine.'' Its sole advertiser: Pfizer
Inc., third-largest pharmaceutical firm in the country, which last
year spent $85 million in consumer magazines.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first single-advertiser issue for Time, Kuczynski
reported. Sears sponsored a special issue on women in 1990;
Chrysler underwrote an issue on multiculturalism in 1993; AT&AMP;T one
on cyberspace in 1995. Glaxo-Wellcome, the biggest pharmaceutical
firm, has bankrolled issues on the frontiers of medicine and
``medical heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   What is different this time is that the special projects editor
overseeing the issue spent a day with Pfizer product managers in
New York &UR;  &LR; _ merely a courtesy to his ad salesmen, said the editor.
Moreover, Ford Motor Co. has agreed to become the sole sponsor of a
weekly section on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to run a magazine? Only if you don't care what
people think. For comparison, take a look at the tough-minded
series ``Hard to Swallow'' on America's soaring drug costs that is
running in The Wall Street Journal this week. Magazines will
continue to represent a vital part of the spectrum of opinion, of
course. The National Geographic, Science, Business Week, and the
New Republic continue to function largely as magazines have in the
past. The E-zine Slate is one of the liveliest entries in this
derby, despite being owned by Microsoft Corp. But as this list
suggests, magazines are best when they attract a wide audience, or
represent a single voice.

SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ (itals)``These are the times that try men's
souls,''(unitals) Pete Carroll said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Or words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``You ask what is our aim,''(unitals) he told a
quarrelsome press corps one day after his New England Patriots had
lost their fourth game in five weeks and fell to within one more
defeat of virtual playoff elimination.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``I can answer in one word _ victory! Victory at all
costs. Victory in spite of all terror. Victory however long and
hard the road may be,''(unitals) he said.
</P>
<P>
   Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   With his ragged band of Patriots lying tattered and disconsolate
one floor below the room where his press conference was being held,
Carroll seemed to sense the moment. This was a time to rally the
troops and the public. All seemed lost, in part because for the
last five weeks, nearly all their games have been lost. It was a
time for words to inspire deeds.
</P>
<P>
   No longer was it time for merely promises to challenge his
troops. Now is the time, he said, to hold his ground and ``be
stout.'' Unfortunately, a few of his linemen long ago fit that
description, which is probably part of the reason they've had
trouble coming off the ball, but that is a story for another day.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was a time for oratory and inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``We shall not flag or fail,'' Carroll said. ``We shall
go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the
seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing
strength in the air, we shall defend our island whatever the cost
may be.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the
landing grounds, in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight
in the hills. We shall never surrender.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Give or take a few words.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to explain his offense's inexplicable collapse the
past month, Carroll did not name names, for that is not his wont.
The leader, he believes, names no names nor points no fingers
(except at referees). The leader acknowledges that his offense has
produced an average of 12 points a game these past five weeks
despite having few injuries to blame for it, short of the loss of
Terry Glenn and Troy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the leader leads and to do that, first he must
inspire.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``Never in the field of human conflict has so much been
owed by so many, to so few,''(unitals) he said of his offense's
overall efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Or something close to that.
</P>
<P>
   With their backs against the wall, Carroll said, his team is
facing a do-or-die situation because the ducks are on the pond and
the chickens have come home to roost because the die is cast now
that a line has been drawn in the sand after the gauntlet has been
dropped once the call went out to friend and foe alike.
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   It has come down to making plays, he said. Or not making them.
It has come time for his players to step up because in big games
big players make big plays because these are the times that try
men's souls, don't you know?
</P>
<P>
   As the great Roger Staubach once said, ``Quarterbacks are like
the tea bags of life. They've got to perform while the water's
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   And today the water is boiling in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually not today because the boys have the day off, but
maybe tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually not tomorrow because the boys have tomorrow off,
too, but when asked why he'd give a team that has lost four of its
last five games an extra day of rest Carroll explained eloquently,
(itals)``It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever
done. It is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever
known.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   So to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Words are everything in Foxborough these days. Words more than
deeds rule the day. Following Sunday's 13-10 loss to the Buffalo
Bills that sent the once cocksure Patriots into shocked silence
Monday, Carroll took action. He tore up the pea patch after the
game. He raised the roof. He kicked up his heels and put a foot on
their throats.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Carroll could be heard through the visiting locker
room door challenging his players, as he so often has said he has
done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``In war, indeed, there can be no substitute for
victory,''(unitals) he was heard to holler, a wooden pipe clenched
between his teeth. (itals)``For a man can be destroyed but not
defeated. Know the enemy and know yourself and in 100 battles you
will never be defeated! For to sit back hoping that some day, some
way, someone will make things right is to go on feeding the
crocodile, hoping that he will eat you last _ but eat you he will.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``If you can't stand the heat, you better get out of the
kitchen because the buck stops here. Never forget if you don't
produce on Sunday, there's no fame, there's no money, there's no
cars, no jewelry, no home, and there's no women because who wants a
loser?
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``Because, brother, you're either part of the solution or
you're part of the problem.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Or so it sounded like, to me.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, of course, the cruel medium had to be addressed as
well. The naysayers, the nattering nabobs of negativism, the cursed
media that so haunts the steps of fallen heroes and fading Patriots
had to be confronted this time. For them, too, Carroll had some
words.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``As far as criticism is concerned, we don't resent that
unless it is absolutely biased _ as it is in most cases,''(unitals)
he muttered. (itals)``A critic is a man who knows the way but can't
drive the car.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``But we understand that a skunk kills itself by the
publicity it gives itself.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   And on he went, exhorting his team to rise above its injuries
and its infirmities. To ignore its frailties and its follies. To
step up, to accept the challenge, to answer the call, to tote that
bale but to never forget, (itals)``Without losers, where would the
winners be?''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what it sounded like he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, maybe it was all different than that Monday in
Foxborough. Maybe it wasn't all words and thin air. Maybe it wasn't
whistling past the cemetery and walking by the media because as he
left the press room, Pete Carroll was overheard saying something
else to the team's PR director, Stacey James, when James asked him
just exactly what that had been all about.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``Purple haze is in my brain,''(unitals) Carroll said.
(itals)``Lately things don't seem the same.''(unitals)
</P>

BANKERS AND POLS GRAPPLE OVER EUROPE'S NEW CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 News analysis  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The history of monetary policy during the past 50 years
could be written largely in terms of struggles between politicians
and central bankers. Now the same fight has broken out over who
will control Europe's new single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   However, this time the main battlefield is Germany, where the
newly elected Social Democrats have tried to take on the previously
sacrosanct Bundesbank. The decisions of Germany's central bank were
unchallenged by the last chancellor, Helmut Kohl, even when they
hurt him politically.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was ousted by Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder in
September's elections because voters blamed his government for high
unemployment and faltering economic growth. Those setbacks stemmed,
many analysts contend, from Kohl's support for the Bundesbank's
insistence on high interest rates and a strong D-mark even during a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The high rates have made it expensive for German businesses to
borrow money for expansion while the strong D-mark has hindered
exports. But the Bundesbank has remained wedded to these policies
as protection against inflation, the great bugaboo of German
financial history.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is determined not to be caught in the same trap that
snared Kohl. So he and his left-leaning finance minister, Oskar
Lafontaine, swiftly challenged the Bundesbank and called for an
interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   Then the pair backed away in the face of the usual stiff
Bundesbank resistance to anything smacking of easy money. Bank
chief Hans Tietmeyer, whose institution is guaranteed independence
by Germany's constitution, seemed unimpressed by the election
returns.
</P>
<P>
   One German commentator described the Social Democrats' demand as
provoking ``hysteria'' in central bank circles. For the move came
not long before the introduction in January of the euro under the
supervision of the new European Central Bank (ECB), which will
effectively replace the Bundesbank and 10 other national central
banks of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his retreat from a head-on collision with the
Bundesbank, Lafontaine declared that his real target is the ECB,
which, he insisted, must introduce more flexible policies to
encourage economic growth in Europe as a whole. He made it clear
that the government would be much less timid in confronting the new
central bank than it and its predecessors have been in taking up
arms against the Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the German government faces a tough antagonist in
Wim Duisberg, the former Dutch finance minister who was chosen to
run the all-Europe bank. Duisberg is a hard-money man and already
has been dubbed by some as Tietmeyer II.
</P>
<P>
   Duisberg wants the cost of borrowing in the euro zone to average
about 3.3 percent _ too high, his critics say, to goose the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and Lafontaine have some important allies, including
the widely respected Italian finance minister, Carlo Ciampi.
Although he is known as an advocate of sound money, Ciampi declared
last week that there should be a loosening of the strict rules
under which the euro was created in order to allow for government
budget overruns on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new currency was set up, the politicians joined the
bankers in declaring stability and strength would be the sole
considerations for it. Now at least some of them are starting to
have second thoughts.

UNION MAKING NO NEW INROADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor is back in Massachusetts _ except, apparently, when it
comes to organizing hotel and restaurant employees.
</P>
<P>
   Their major union, the Hotel Employees &AMP; Restaurant Employees,
has had successful organizing drives in several cities across the
United States in the past year, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, HERE Local 26 in Massachusetts has yet to organize
a single restaurant or hotel in recent memory. Most labor activists
attribute the difference to the contrast in leadership.There is no
evidence that HERE Local 26 has even started an organizing campaign
in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   For example, according to a national AFL-CIO weekly update,
``Work in Progress,'' the vast majority of 4,336 workers at the
Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas signed union authorization cards last
month, and hotel management recognized the union.
</P>
<P>
   HERE also organized 100 workers this past summer at the Las
Vegas Hilton. Today, 90 percent of the 50,000 hotel workers in Las
Vegas are now union.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, HERE also won union organizing drives for 164
workers at the Omni Hotel in New Haven and have had success with
other drives across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, a multiunion organizing campaign by HERE and the
Service Employees International Union resulted in 3,500 baggage
workers and food and retail workers signing union authorization
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has more nonunion hotels than union hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The last restaurant organized by any union was the Sports Cafe
in the FleetCenter, which was organized through a National Labor
Relations Board election by Local 1445 of the United Food and
Commercial Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was in Boston that HERE Local 26's leadership was
the toast of the town in the 1980s. Under Local 26's then-president
Dominic Bozzotto, the union achieved two consecutive contracts that
sharply increased wages and benefits for its members. With these
contracts, Bozzotto became the leading, and most recognized, voice
for lower-income working people in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was viewed at the time as an advocate of new tactics
for labor, and was often quoted on organizing efforts such as the
successful campaign at Harvard University in the late 1980s,
Bozzotto's local itself had no such major organizing successes.
</P>
<P>
   Bozzotto became a controversial union leader when he moved in
1990 into the camp of the GOP. That year, his Local 26 endorsed
Republican gubernatorial nominee William F. Weld and his Lieutenant
Governor nominee, Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Local 26 again endorsed the Weld/Cellucci team in 1994 and Weld
again when he ran for the US Senate in 1996. Ironically, Bozzotto
endorsed Weld the same year that the governor vetoed the minimum
wage increase over strong objections of unions and the state's
Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bozzotto was rewarded when Weld appointed him the
director of human resources for the Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority. When Bozzotto resigned as union president, his
successor, Janice Loux, picked up where Bozzotto left off.
</P>
<P>
   Loux is a Weld/Cellucci appointee to the MBTA board of
directors, which pays a $7,500 annual stipend. Under Loux, Local 26
has not yet had a successful, or even a visible, organizing drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Weld/Cellucci team, and now Governor-elect Cellucci,
received endorsements from other unions during their election
campaigns, but it is no coincidence that many of their leaders also
have received appointments from the Republican administration.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this union support did not deter Weld from crossing HERE
Local 25's picket line in 1996 when he went to Washington, D.C. for
a fund-raiser. That year, Local 25 won the right to organize and
successfully bargain for more than 1,000 parking lot attendants.
</P>
<P>
   When Weld crossed the picket line he was, along with Cellucci, a
member of HERE Local 26 in Boston. Apparently, Weld and Cellucci
were the only new members Local 26 added in the past 10 years.
According to reports, the national leadership of HERE plans to come
to Boston in the near future to launch an organizing campaign of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the HERE national leadership feels that if HERE can
organize virtually anywhere in the country, it can organize in
Boston. No doubt a lot of unorganized hotel and restaurant workers
would agree. They have been ready, waiting, and willing for a very
long time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Each of the two 47-foot swans and two 56-foot dolphins weighs
60,000 pounds. And although they're at Disney World, you won't find
them in the new Animal Kingdom theme park. They're nearby, though,
atop the two hotels at the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin
resort, a most unusual property that is almost a theme park in
itself. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _The two coral-and-turquoise buildings were designed by
architect Michael Graves as ``entertainment architecture.'' With
those 30-ton swan and dolphin statues, expansive murals, and huge
hand-painted figures throughout the public areas, the resort is a
place where whimsy and fantasy flourish. Hallways leading to guest
rooms have beach murals on the walls, and the room doors resemble
striped cabanas. Inside are such touches as sea horse and monkey
chandeliers, parrot lamps, and pineapple-stenicled headboards.
</P>
<P>
   _There's water, water everywhere. The exterior fountain at the
Dolphin hotel cascades nine stories through five seashell-shaped
troughs into a 54-foot clamshell. More water courses across
rock-faced grottoes in the Dolphin foyer. The Swan hotel,
meanwhile, has fountains spouting within giant clamshells. Swan and
dolphin fountains are the centerpieces in the lobbies of their
respective hotels. Outside, there is a three-acre world of water
containing a grotto pool, two lap pools, a wading pool, waterfalls,
whirlpools, water slides, and a beach.
</P>
<P>
   _Many of the Disney characters, Goofy and Pluto among them, drop
in during breakfast and dinner at selected restaurants. Children
enjoy their presence almost as much as certain unnamed adults do,
and exclusively for kids are Camp Dolphin, the Dolphin Dinner Club,
and supervised trips to the Disney parks. And you can bet there is
a video arcade.
</P>
<P>
   _There are 17 restaurants and lounges, some with humorous names
like Juan and Only's, where Tex-Mex food is served, and the Copa
Banana lounge. At the Dolphin Fountain &AMP; Snack Bar, the waitstaff
routinely breaks out in a choreographed jitterbug of joy. At
Harry's Safari, Harry the Gorilla and his friends occupy chairs.
(These creatures aren't messy, though; they're big dolls.) And at
Palio's, an Italian restaurant favored by residents as well as
visitors, strolling musicians may even serenade you with ``Bella
Notte,'' that sterling song from ``Lady and the Tramp.''
</P>
<P>
   _There are two health clubs, four tennis courts, five nearby
Disney golf courses plus the two adjacent Fantasia miniature golf
courses. The resort adjoins Disney's lively BoardWalk
entertainment-dining area, and complimentary bus or boat
transportation is provided to all four theme parks and other Disney
entertainment areas.
</P>
<P>
   _The Swan and Dolphin, with its 2,267 guest rooms, is the only
non-Disney-owned property to bear the name Walt Disney World. It is
a Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts property, jointly managed by Sheraton
and Westin. The nine-year-old resort has completed a $15 million
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   (Listed rates begin at $275; various hotel-and-theme-park
packages bring down the cost and add to the amenities. For more

BRAZIL'S QUALITY IS NOT ALL IN EXPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vasco da Gama is doing much to contradict the critics of
Brazilian club soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Vasco, one of Rio de Janeiro's oldest clubs, defeated D.C.
United, 1-0, in the first leg of the InterAmericana Cup at RFK
Stadium Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians had to travel to Washington via Miami after
playing a game in Sao Paulo 48 hours previously. After a season of
60-plus games, the players probably felt nearly as exhausted as the
crew of the Portuguese explorer for which the team is named.
</P>
<P>
   But Vasco has enough depth to survive. It took this game
seriously, though it was not much more than a nuisance/-stopover on
the way to the Intercontinental Cup against Real Madrid in Tokyo.
Only six players who will start against Real Madrid played against
D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   Vasco da Gama brought 32 players on the trip. Coach Antonio
Lopes had several options for substitutes, including Valber, the
team's most versatile player, who helped hold things together in
the second half against United. The ``Vascainos'' have strength and
speed, and the skill is remarkable among even their back-line
enforcers, such as Luis Henrique.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe, the goal-scorer against D.C. United, will challenge Real
Madrid's Roberto Carlos for a starting spot on the national team.
Mauro Galvao, a starter in the 1990 World Cup, is the defensive
``sheriff,'' and he could be joined next year by the virtually
impregnable Julio Cesar, who is with Borussia Dortmund in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vasco failed to qualify for the Brazilian playoffs. In fact,
none of the teams from Rio de Janeiro finished in the top eight,
further illustrating the competitive level of the Brazilian
leagues. The amount of talent is incredible. Brazil has exported
more than 300 players, enough to stock an entire professional
league, so those who stay are theoretically not even the best the
country produces.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil's national championship is unwieldy, and the game is
filled with problems. The state championships have a legitimate
claim of taking precedence, especially in the case of Rio and Sao
Paulo. Fluminense, traditionally among the strongest teams, has
been relegated to the third division. Sao Paulo, which has
dominated the national tournament this year, is big and rich enough
to support several good teams _ the economy of the state of Sao
Paulo is greater than Argentina's.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of Brazilians' ability to adapt occur regularly.
Venezia coach Walter Novellino, the former Italian international
who lived in Brazil as a youngster, brought two virtually unknown
Brazilians to Venice this year. Bilica, a.k.a. Fabio Alves da
Silva, and Tuta, a.k.a. Moacir Bastos, sparked Venezia to a 2-0
victory over Lazio, the Venetians' first victory of the season,
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bilica, 19, is described as ``a white Lilian Thuram,'' after the
French World Cup star. Tuta, 24, is a striker who scored Venezia's
first goal. The Brazilians' dynamism was contagious, and their
ability to provide solutions caused them to become points of
reference for their teammates, according to Alessandro de Calo of
La Gazzetta dello Sport.
</P>
<P>
   Japan built much of the J League philosophy on the Brazilians,
depending on them for advice, coaching, and talent. The Brazilians'
combination of charisma and ingenuousness is unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   Vasco da Gama displayed an uninhibited style against D.C.
United, though it was far from home, without their main central
defender, and with little to gain. United's attacking style made
for a wide-open match, played before 25,260 spectators, United's
biggest home crowd of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Staging this type of match on a regular basis would almost
guarantee success for the game in the United States. D.C. United
has lost three of its last four games _ also losing to Columbus and
Chicago in the Major League Soccer playoffs last month _ but
continues to promote a stimulating brand of soccer. United is still
a couple of players away from having a solid first team, and the
bench is nonexistent compared to those of teams such as Vasco da
Gama.
</P>
<P>
   Yet D.C. United has another chance in the second leg of the
InterAmericana Cup in Fort Lauderdale Dec. 5 in what will be Bruce
Arena's final game before he becomes full-time US national team
coach.

   The Republic of Ireland, rejuvenated by young players, will

<P>
   The Irish strategy of mass importation of players from the
English League paid off for former coach Jack Charlton, and now
some of those players are finding success as coaches. Mick McCarthy
heads the national team and Ronnie Whelan is advancing in the
European Cup Winners Cup with Panionios.
</P>
<P>
   Whelan, a former Liverpool star, struggled while managing
Southend United in England. He brought in former Manchester United
striker Mark Robbins and an obscure Yorkshireman named Garry
Haylock, who had been taking coaching courses in Dublin. They have
been the impetus for Panionios, located in the Nea Smirni district
of Athens, deep in the shadows of AEK, Olympiakos, and
Panathinaikos.

   Most of the money in Greek soccer is in the top clubs. Anghel

finals, is relinquishing his $320,000 annual salary with Greece's
national team to become head coach of AEK for $534,000 a year.
Iordanescu guided Greece in two Euro 2000 qualifying matches.
</P>
<P>
   The next national team coach will be a Greek, according to
federation source.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't count on a foreign coach who is going to abandon us
when he receives another offer,'' the source told Reuters.
</P>

   An exception would likely be made for Dusan Bajevic, the Mostar
native who led AEK to three successive championships, then moved to
Olympiakos and won the title in his first year.

after Real Madrid's Davor Suker failed to convert a penalty kick.

   The driving force behind Celta's success has been midfielder
Mazinho, a starter for Brazil's 1994 World Cup championship team.
Mazinho, 32, failed early in his career in Italy but has found his
place in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The original Celtic, the Glasgow club founded by Irish
ex-patriates in 1888, could be taken over by Kenny Dalglish and
Simple Minds vocalist Jim Kerr. This combination would be welcome
to Celtic supporters, who have been dissatisfied with Canada-born,
Phoenix-residing president Fergus McCann, though McCann has
prepared the club for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Celtic's latest local hero is striker Mark Burchill, designated

Burchill, 18, scored the winning goal in his debut against Dundee

a month and has five children.
</P>

   ``If we didn't have financial problems I would not have accepted
the $50,000,'' he said.

propagated for many years by European clubs with African players.

BANKERS AND POLS GRAPPLE OVER EUROPE'S NEW CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 News analysis  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The history of monetary policy during the past 50 years
could be written largely in terms of struggles between politicians
and central bankers. Now the same fight has broken out over who
will control Europe's new single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   However, this time the main battlefield is Germany, where the
newly elected Social Democrats have tried to take on the previously
sacrosanct Bundesbank. The decisions of Germany's central bank were
unchallenged by the last chancellor, Helmut Kohl, even when they
hurt him politically.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was ousted by Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder in
September's elections because voters blamed his government for high
unemployment and faltering economic growth. Those setbacks stemmed,
many analysts contend, from Kohl's support for the Bundesbank's
insistence on high interest rates and a strong D-mark even during a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The high rates have made it expensive for German businesses to
borrow money for expansion while the strong D-mark has hindered
exports. But the Bundesbank has remained wedded to these policies
as protection against inflation, the great bugaboo of German
financial history.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is determined not to be caught in the same trap that
snared Kohl. So he and his left-leaning finance minister, Oskar
Lafontaine, swiftly challenged the Bundesbank and called for an
interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   Then the pair backed away in the face of the usual stiff
Bundesbank resistance to anything smacking of easy money. Bank
chief Hans Tietmeyer, whose institution is guaranteed independence
by Germany's constitution, seemed unimpressed by the election
returns.
</P>
<P>
   One German commentator described the Social Democrats' demand as
provoking ``hysteria'' in central bank circles. For the move came
not long before the introduction in January of the euro under the
supervision of the new European Central Bank (ECB), which will
effectively replace the Bundesbank and 10 other national central
banks of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his retreat from a head-on collision with the
Bundesbank, Lafontaine declared that his real target is the ECB,
which, he insisted, must introduce more flexible policies to
encourage economic growth in Europe as a whole. He made it clear
that the government would be much less timid in confronting the new
central bank than it and its predecessors have been in taking up
arms against the Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the German government faces a tough antagonist in
Wim Duisberg, the former Dutch finance minister who was chosen to
run the all-Europe bank. Duisberg is a hard-money man and already
has been dubbed by some as Tietmeyer II.
</P>
<P>
   Duisberg wants the cost of borrowing in the euro zone to average
about 3.3 percent _ too high, his critics say, to goose the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and Lafontaine have some important allies, including
the widely respected Italian finance minister, Carlo Ciampi.
Although he is known as an advocate of sound money, Ciampi declared
last week that there should be a loosening of the strict rules
under which the euro was created in order to allow for government
budget overruns on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new currency was set up, the politicians joined the
bankers in declaring stability and strength would be the sole
considerations for it. Now at least some of them are starting to
have second thoughts.

PATRIOTS BACK TO DRAWING BOARD ON OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ That daring experiment by the Patriots _
trying to play in the National Football League without an offense _
is about to be scrapped. Coach Pete Carroll hinted Monday the team
may jazz up what has been well disguised the last month as an NFL
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had enough production,'' said Carroll. ``So we may
have to do some other things. The (offensive) side of the ball has
got to come to life, if we're to have a chance to win. It's got to
come to life.'' Trickery may abound.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' attempt to play football with no offense has been
only half a success. New England has done next to nothing on its
first drives of games, only managing seven first downs and no
points in 10 games; five of those first downs in one game against
New Orleans. It has also done little on those all-important final
drives of games.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the New England offense was also well disguised as
NFL caliber: blockers didn't block, receivers didn't receive,
runners didn't run, and quarterbacks didn't quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have lost four of their last five, so Carroll
Monday decided to try a different approach _ follow the
conventional route of the other 29 NFL teams and try to establish
an offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we have stayed pretty tight to what we've been
doing on offense; we wanted to do what we know how to do well in
the hopes that we would be able to come out the other other end of
(the offensive doldrums),'' said Carroll. ``But we haven't had
enough production to do that. So we're going to have to do some
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll wouldn't specify how the offense will be jazzed up, but
it is believed that attempting to score a touchdown will be
included in the plans. Perhaps the new Patriot offense will be very
jazzy and try to score two TDs Monday night against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (haven't) come out of the chutes and get our game plan
going right off the bat; it's an opportunity to do very well on
that first series because (opposing teams) don't know what you're
going to do,'' said Carroll, sounding almost giddy about a chance
to coach a team that has an offense and a defense. ``But we have
not been able to produce anything out of it. It sure would be nice
to get off to a start where you pop the ball around, run the ball
at 'em and you make the plays. It would be a nice change for us in
these last six games to show something on the first drive, at
least.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be the difference, if the offense can come to life
these last six weeks and take over. Then we'll have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the second game against Indianapolis, ``we haven't
moved forward'' in the last five games. (The New England offense
averaged 29.4 points in each of its first five games; in the last
five, the offense's output has plummeted to 12.8 points a game.)
</P>
<P>
   The sad situation on offense ``calls for us to be creative,''
Carroll added. ``It calls for us to devise some ways to get (the
offense) moving that we haven't used yet. It's important that we do
that ... and that the (coaching) staff give us a chance to move
from where we are because right now we're not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of the single-wing, anything may go, Carroll hinted.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we've got to try anything that we can draw up
right now,'' he said. ``We've got to come up with some ways to make
the plays and move the ball. That's because right now we've been
staying with our system and counting on execution, but we've fallen
short. Fallen short on throwing and catching, fallen short on our
running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, said the coach, ``it's time to work the edges a
little bit. And that's what we're going to do. That's what we have
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroll added that until five weeks ago, ``We were making
progress but we're not making progress now. We've gone the other
way ... we've gone backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Patriots may flip to the back pages of the playbook
because necessity truly is the mother of invention. And the
Patriots, the team without an offense, need to invent one very,
very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to be creative,'' Carroll said. ``It's time to come
up with whatever we can. It's time to be very resourceful.''

UCONN IS STACKED, SET TO REACH NEW HEIGHTS

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; STORRS, Conn. _ Ask Jim Calhoun the question and he'll give
you names and dates and highlights when he was coaching back at
Dedham High School in 1971-72. He'll stroll back a decade to when
he arrived at the University of Connecticut and suffered through a
9-19 season in 1986-87, which also happened to be the last time
UConn had a losing record.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to him about the almosts and the near-misses in the NCAA
Tournament. The Christian Laettner jump shot that beat him in 1990;
the two free throws Donyell Marshall missed in 1994; the mistake
Calhoun now concedes he made in trying to run for 40 minutes with
UCLA in the West Regional final in 1995; the frustration of
watching his team play a ``road'' game in last year's East Regional
final against North Carolina in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun will break down each of those games in his staccato-like
speech pattern, speaking so quickly that even a tape recorder has
trouble picking up the complete text.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly have been disappointments in a career that has
brought the Huskies within seconds of making their first Final Four
appearance; setbacks that have taken UConn to the very edge of the
benchmark for the elite programs in college basketball. The
Huskies' Final Four slate has no Final Four blemishes. Or
highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun sits in his office and acknowledges the pressure that
has been mounting since the No. 2 Huskies ended last season with a
75-64 loss to the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   Five starters are back from a team that finished 32-5. Of course
expectations should be great at UConn. Final Four? Perhaps No. 1 in
the country?
</P>
<P>
   Then Calhoun will tell you to look at where he is: Storrs, Conn.
Not Duke or North Carolina. Or UCLA. Or Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   But when you talk about Top 10 each season, programs that have a
chance not only to reach the Final Four but win a national
championship, you have to mention UConn. Not just this season, with
players such as last year's Big East Player of the Year, Richard
Hamilton, and the Rookie of the Year, Khalid El-Amin, but every
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five seasons, Calhoun's teams are 139-33. They have
been to two regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' says Calhoun, speaking slowly now, ``we deserve to
be where we are (in terms of rankings). This is not a sudden thing.
We've spent a long time getting to this point. Now we want to enjoy
it. We deserve to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   So they do. UConn has become a national program. El-Amin is from
Minnesota; Hamilton comes from Pennyslvania; center Jake Voskuhl is
a Texan.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, Calhoun attended the British Open and was
strolling the course at Royal Lytham in England when he saw a
friend who asked what he was doing in England in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going after this kid from Senegal,'' said Calhoun, who indeed
got a commitment from 6-foot-11-inch Souleymane Wane, who will play
a major role on this year's team.
</P>
<P>
   Ask some of the Huskies about the talk of No. 1 and they will
smile and nod. ``We had a great season last year and we have
everyone back,'' says El-Amin, who scored 28 points in the Huskies'
season-opening 102-60 rout of Quinnipiac Sunday and is the key to
the team. ``Why shouldn't we have big expectations? We think we can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only may the Huskies reach the Final Four for the first
time, but they conceivably could walk away with a national
championship in March in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Look for a weakness. ``I don't see any,'' said Syracuse coach
Jim Boeheim. ``They can beat you in a lot of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to play small? Calhoun will let El-Amin, Hamilton,
guard Ricky Moore, and 6-6 forward Kevin Freeman transition you to
death.
</P>
<P>
   You want to go big? Calhoun will counter with 7-footer Voskhul,
who has bulked up and has another year's experience, and Wane.
</P>
<P>
   You want to run with the Huskies? Bring it on. ``I think we can
go nine deep without losing a whole lot,'' said Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Calhoun gave El-Amin more freedom than he ever had
given any freshman. ``He's a very special player,'' said Calhoun.
``He has a presence about him that you don't find in many
players.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin's critics say he is too heavy, too selfish _ a team
breaker instead of playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin just pats his belly, as he did during one press
conference during last year's NCAA Tournament, and goes out and
plays harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with the philosophy that great guard play was the
key to a great team,'' says Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese,
who has watched UConn evolve into a national power during the past
decade. ``When I first saw El-Amin, I thought that was a unique
player. Nothing I have seen since has changed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Huskies are primed for a run this season. ``We've had
opportunities in the past,'' said Calhoun. ``They didn't work out.
Are we good enough this year? I think we are.''

AIDS GROUP PLANS MOVE TO NATION'S CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The AIDS Memorial Quilt _ a San Francisco icon
marking the epidemic that so ravaged the city's population _ is to
be permanently moved to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the Names Project has voted to begin searching the
nation's capital for a suitable home for its executive offices, as
well as a place to store and display the mammoth quilt, which
weighs some 52 tons in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   The actual move won't happen for a few more years, according to
Executive Director Andy Ilves. Until then, the bulk of the quilt
will remain in storage in a San Francisco warehouse, as pieces of
it continue to be shipped out for display at schools, civic
functions and commemorations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there is a strong emotional tie to San Francisco,
birthplace of the quilt,'' Ilves said. ``But what began 10 years
ago as an ad hoc response to this tragedy has become an icon and
the No. 1 AIDS prevention and education tool in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position in that logistically, we belong in the nation's
capital. It's the main magnet to visitors from all over the globe.
None of us has any interest in having the quilt be this musty,
dusty relic stored on shelves. It's intended to be shown in a
bright, interactive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Names Project has made no official announcement of the
decision, reached at a June board meeting, but word has been slowly
spreading through the city's gay community.
</P>
<P>
   Ilves said the reaction thus far has been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what they're trying to do,'' said Mike Salinas,
news editor of the Bay Area Reporter, a gay newspaper. ``Relocating
to Washington will let them reach a broader audience of visitors
from around the globe, many of whom are in desperate need of better
AIDS education.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Names Project denied that financial troubles
prompted the decision to relocate. But the group's budget for the
1998 fiscal year is $2.6 million _ just half of the original
projected budget for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activist Cleve Jones conceived the concept of the quilt
during the chilly night of Nov. 27, 1985, while participating in a
candlelight vigil honoring assassinated San Francisco Supervisor
Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone. He asked fellow marchers to
write on pieces of cardboard the names of lovers and friends who
had died of AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   When the marchers scaled the Federal Building and covered it
with their placards, ``it looked like a patchwork quilt of lives
cruelly cut short,'' Jones recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Names Project has 52 chapters around the country. Its
primary focus has shifted to education, particularly aimed at
school children.
</P>
<P>
   As for the quilt itself, if its segments were laid end-to-end it
would stretch 44 miles. It continues to grow by a few hundred
panels each month.

A WEEKEND OF MANEUVERING LEADS SADDAM NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Sometimes in an international crisis, the toughest
task is to know when to take yes for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether President Clinton picked the right moment _ in the
predawn hours of Sunday morning _ is a question that only events in
Iraq in the next few days, weeks, and months can answer.
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth the frustration and the guff from macho types to
test any realistic chance that the best means of keeping Saddam
Hussein's regime from acquiring biological and chemical weapons in
quantity and the means of using them _ namely tough inspections _
can still work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a weekend of maneuvering that was bizarre and
maddening even by the standards of this eight-year melodrama, it
should be obvious that there is a chance worth testing because the
test is at long last clear.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply that Iraq has no basis for denying United Nations
inspectors anything they need _ whether it is access to particular
sites on timetables of their choosing or to a specific Iraqi
document. That is what UN Secretary General Kofi Annan _ a wobbler
at times over the weekend _ had in mind when he acknowledged Sunday
night that the era of escape clauses and compromises has ended.
Henceforth, he said, there will only be ``complete and
unconditional compliance,'' or there will be military action, with
no time for last-minute diplomacy or even warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In summing up the new reality, Annan was speaking for a world
whose willingness to tolerate Saddam Hussein has been steadily
sapped by the determined diplomacy (backed by credible threats of
force) of the Clinton administration for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great myths of this period _ propagated by hawk and
dove critics alike _ has been that US policy had abandoned all hope
of enforcing comprehensive arms control on Iraq and had retreated
to a new line of just keeping economic sanctions on in perpetuity.
In fact, the opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   But a year ago, the international support for both the
inspections regime and the sanctions had deteriorated seriously in
an atmosphere of weariness, economic opportunism, and Arab world
anger that the United States could be implacable toward Iraq but
soft toward Israel's occupying hardliners. Far from accepting this
unstable status quo, the president was determined to reverse it,
aware that it would take time. His ally was Saddam Hussein's
remarkable combination of evil and stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   With each crisis over Iraq's flouting of the inspection rules to
either hide records and material or block access, the diplomatic
noose tightened. In February _ when the United States and Britain
showed they were prepared to use force almost alone if necessary _
the result was a Security Council resolution making a future
military response in effect authorized in advance and tying Kofi
Annan personally to the unfettered operation of Ambassador Richard
Butler's inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
   When, predictably, Iraq first tested that resolve, then broke
its word for the zillionth time (most significantly in August), and
then attempted to halt all cooperation with the UN inspectors (at
the end of October), the time to yank the string arrived. This
time, Iraq got no help from China, Russia, or France and, most
dramatically, none from the core of the Arab world (Egypt, Syria,
Saudi Arabia, and the five smaller Gulf states) _ an atmosphere
helped immeasurably by the Clinton-brokered Wye Plantation
agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   This resolve continued through last weekend. When Annan tried to
call Iraq's conditional surrender on Saturday a step in the right
direction, the administration stopped him cold with one word _
unacceptable. The attack, first planned for Saturday evening, was
rescheduled for 24 hours later and stayed scheduled until all the
conditions set by Clinton before the weekend began were met.
</P>
<P>
   There are no illusions. No one is trusting anyone. What there
is, at last, is a test, in an atmosphere defined by Iraq's
international isolation. Either Saddam's hegemonic scheme will
evaporate under rigidly supervised disarmament or it will end under
a rain of bombs and missiles followed by strict containment.
</P>
<P>
   And arranging this test was worth the aggravation it produced
over a year of patience-trying diplomacy that has left Iraq with no
other alternative and no allies.
</P>

MURDER CASE OPEN, BUT HOPES OF HAITIAN FAMILY DIM 
</HEADLINE>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ For hours, no one came.
</P>
<P>
   Along the muddy roadside, a crime scene left to the elements
rotted under a flaring sun. Fingerprints. Witnesses. Pale blue
paint chips from a getaway car. And all around, a constellation of
bullet casings that set the bodies of Willy and Alicia Merisier
against a blood-red sky of ambush and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing, it seemed, was a justice system to
gather the evidence and act on it. But on this impoverished island
_ the homeland that beckoned one couple and greeted them with
gunfire _ justice &UR;  &LR; is as elusive as wages or running water. By
nightfall, wind sent the spent casings rolling along the ground.
Fingerprints disappeared and so did witnesses, into the stream of
anonymous crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, almost a year after the deaths of a patriarch and
matriarch of Boston's Haitian commmunity _ and the Skakespearean
split of a family stretching from Boston to Haiti _ some
authorities in Haiti are &UR;  &LR; saying they fear that the killers never
will be found. No amount of fact-finding now, they say, could make
up for the evidence that was destroyed then.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I think people are hoping for the hand of
God,'' said an official in Haiti's diplomatic ranks who has
followed the case. ``I think people are hoping that the killer will
wake up one day and feel so guilty that he'll just turn himself
in.''
</P>
<P>
   But if God's hand has touched this tragedy, the Merisiers' five
children have yet to discern it. As they struggle with their own
competing urges to fight and to forget, some 70 relatives in Boston
remain divided over the investigation and over the suspicion that
two among them are the killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where this thing is now, only the Haitian government can get
it started again,'' said Fritz Resil, of Hyde Park, the godfather
to one of the Merisiers' children. He is convinced that two family
members are guilty of the killings. ``The kids, they have lost
hope,'' he added. ``But I haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   But as some family members try to revive a dying investigation,
it appears as stalled and directionless as a US effort that has
poured several hundred million dollars into training the Haitian
judges and police officers responsible for solving the crime. With
all its missteps and missed opportunities, the case, some say, has
laid bare a much larger failure: that of US foreign policy in
Haiti, whose government remains locked in political stalemate and
whose justice system remains ill-equipped to handle a surge of
murders and other crimes whose perpetrators routinely go
unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disastrous,'' said Rachel Neild, a Haiti specialist at
the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights
organization. ``We're talking about a place where no one in the
country even has a complete copy of the criminal code. You've got
administrators in the justice ministry incapable of doing the most
basic tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Neild, there are only 6,000 police officers in a
country of about 7 million people. That's one officer for every
1,200 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the vast sum of money spent by the State Department,
Justice Department, and Department of Defense and other agencies in
the four years since US intervention restored former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, much of the police force and
judiciary cannot keep basic records and lacks equipment as
essential as cars to respond to crime scenes and seek out
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Merisiers, who lived in Boston's Mattapan section for many
years, were shot in an ambush on Dec. 2 as they drove from
Port-au-Prince International Airport to a friend's house. Alicia,
49, had just arrived from Boston to visit; Willy, 66,had already
moved to Haiti permanently, and was supervising the construction of
their retirement home. Since March, the case has rested
with &UR;  &LR; Kesner Michel Thermesi, an investigative judge, who under
Haitian law has simultaneously acted as part-prosecutor and
part-grand jury in a protracted inquiry into the prime suspect in
the case. A second suspect is still wanted by Haitian police.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince said the
embassy's security office is in ``close contact'' with both the
local police and the Merisier family about the case. But almost
from the beginning, the investigation has moved sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   At different points, it has drawn in the FBI and the office of
US Representative &UR;  &LR; Joseph P. Kennedy II of Massachusetts. It drew
the couple's oldest daughter, Sandra Merisier Bissante, back to
Haiti, despite her vows never to return, to testify before
Thermesi.
</P>
<P>
   And the case has drawn cries of outrage from both sides of the
family over the handling of Rene Laurent, the onetime prime
suspect. A cousin of Alicia Merisier and close friend of the
couple, Laurent was seen with the Merisiers at the airport on the
day of the slayings. Police arrested Laurent in March. Soon after,
he was released, only to be arrested again a week later. He
remained in jail until July, when Thermesi released him for a
second time, saying there was no concrete evidence to indict him.
</P>
<P>
   Some family members, including the Merisier children and Resil,
say the judge has not called witnesses who may have information
about Laurent and the second suspect, Ngi Napoleon, also a
relative. Those who have fought for Laurent's and Napoleon's
innocence say that three months in jail was too severe in a case
they believe has been fueled by rumor and groundless suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his desk inside the Palais de Justice in the heart of
the capital, Thermesi seemed unsure whether justice can be meted
out. As a noisy stream of visitors passes through his office _
lawyers, clerks, students _ the judge pulled out underlined news
clippings on the case from American and Haitian newspapers. The
reports, along with the second- and third-hand testimony from
relatives, friends, and residents living in the area where the
killings took place, are his only instruments in a muddled case.
When asked what led officials to first issue the outstanding
warrant for Napoleon, Thermesi held up a clipping from the Boston
Globe, showing that Napoleon has a criminal record in Boston.
``It's right here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex case,'' he continued, rustling through folders.
``Why do I say it's complex? Because there was a lot of
misinformation. Rene was one of the people last seen with the
Merisiers, so we put him in jail to avoid him escaping the country.
But no one has given us any concrete evidence. We have theories. We
hear a lot of things. But they are just theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Thermesi said he went to see the car the Merisiers were driving
when they were killed. The blue paint chips he found on the car are
probably the only physical evidence he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   But even if someone were to collect them, there would be no way
to analyze them. The same goes for &UR;  &LR; ballistic evidence or
fingerprints. That kind of technology doesn't exist in a country
where there are no records of who sits in jail, who awaits trial,
and who has been released &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fingerprints? What would they do with fingerprints?'' said
Gregory Mayard-Paul, a &UR;  &LR; lawyer hired by the family to follow the
case in Haiti. ``Even if they had them in their hand, they wouldn't
know whose fingerprints they were, since no one keeps prints of
anyone in Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Thermesi, Mayard-Paul said he is ``among the more competent
we have.'' But in the context of Haiti's justice system _ where
some judges can't read French, the language in which the &UR;  &LR; laws are
written, and where monthly salaries of $300 make some judges
vulnerable to bribes _ competence can be relative, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Haitian proverb that says, `In country where
everyone is blind in both eyes, the one-eyed seeing man is king,'''
Mayard-Paul said. ``Investigations in this country can last a long,
long time and can lead to no result whatsoever. That's not a reason
to lose hope ... But if something does happen, it will be
considered a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   One Haitian-American lawyer who came here to help train judges,
prosecutors, and administrators said the kind of miracle
Mayard-Paul hopes for is, for now at least, the only chance in a
system still tackling basic skills and dealing with the constant
threat of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, the mission was supposed to be to teach
people to manage case loads, and how to create due process,'' said
Renald Breton of Maryland, who worked for two years with Overseas
Prosecutorial Development and Training, which is run by the US
Justice Department. ``Instead it was like, `This is how you make a
file. This is how you create an alphabetical index.' There's no
efficient system. You can't expect the rule of law to function
because there is no rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for the Merisiers, but not for many others either, some
officials said. Since the Dec. 2 killings, there have been dozens
of murders. Three weeks after Willy and Alicia Merisier were
killed, a woman named Micheline Coulanges was shot dead in broad
daylight as she closed up her family's wholesale shop in Croix des
Bossales, on the edge of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Coulanges and her family are well-known in Haiti, members of the
business and artistic class. Yet the Haitian police waited three
months before interviewing Coulanges' son, who was with his mother
and witnessed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's someone who was well-known, whose funeral tied up
traffic for hours. It was just devastating,'' said Meg Gilroy, a US
embassy spokeswoman. ``I understand the frustration the Merisiers
feel, the frustration of Haitians in Boston. But by the standards
of the Haitian criminal justice system, this case is still alive.
It's not being ignored.''

   &UR; Thanksgiving: An American Celebration &LR;
</P>
<P>
   APPLES-THANKSGIVING (St. Michaels, Md.) _ They eat well all year
on the Eastern Shore, and they never eat better than at
Thanksgiving. The Shore has always been a world unto itself. Its
people are not rich and never have been, except of course for the
few wealthy ``come heres,'' as the natives call them, who have made
this their headquarters for duck hunting or sailing, and the old
aristocratic families, fewer still, some of whom have lived in
their fine old houses since Colonial times. But the truck farms,
orchards, marshes and coastal waters of this isolated domain have
always provided the raw materials for a rich and singular regional
cuisine, known far and wide for dishes based on oysters and crabs
and game birds. By R.W. Apple Jr.

<P>
   PUMPKIN (Undated) _ The pumpkin, during its brief season, lives,
literally, for the holidays. Most people know it as pie _ flaky
pastry with a dark, miraculously heavy filling of spices, cream,
pumpkin and sugar. Traditional, yes. But the pumpkin has much more
to offer. The pumpkin is, next to the potato, the most malleable
and perhaps the most dynamic of autumn foods. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-STUFFING (New York) _ The great American gift for
invention meets its match in the turkey, the great American bird.
The turkey itself is not the problem, it's the yawning chasm
within, a black hole in the culinary universe that somehow manages
to absorb and deaden anything that wanders near its force-field,
making ``stuffing'' a synonym for ``dry, volumetric bore, often
tricked out with oysters in a hopeless search for personality.'' An
unlikely solution to the stuffing crisis has emerged in an unlikely
place _ the cafe at Jean Georges, where a savory, steaming square
of bread pudding rounds out a dish of baked poussin and roasted
carrots. By William Grimes.

perfectly cooked that it practically ruined dinner. In praise of
dry turkey. By John Willoughby and Chris Schlesinger.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-TIPS (Undated) _ If you insist on perfection, here is
what I have learned after roasting 40 turkeys in search of it: you
must brine the turkey in salt water the night before, and rotate it
during roasting. By Pam Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BBQ (New York) _ Like a puff of smoke, Pearson's Texas
Barbecue, the only authentic barbecue pit in New York City, will
fade and vanish by the end of the year. The smoke, in fact, is part
of the problem. By Eric Asimov.
</P>
<P>
   BAUM-LEGACY (New York) _ When Joseph H. Baum died last month,
New York lost one of its great restaurant legends. But his company,
B.E. Group, remains, as does his attention-grabbing flair in
projects he had been developing with his partners. By Florence
Fabricant.

</P>
<P>
   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The Dean of Westminster Cathedral in
London wants to eliminate the Christmas tree. It's a pagan symbol,
he says, and shouldn't be part of the holiday. I have something
equally subversive in mind: getting rid of the Thanksgiving turkey.
Yes, that sacred symbol of holiday plentitude and culinary
ineptitude. It's time for it to go. Trouble is, I forget about this
annual outrage until a day or two before it's on us once again,
when it's too late to drum up any support. So since I have to have
turkey, I'd like to have good wine with it. But which one? By Frank
Prial.

 &HT;    U.S. vs IRAQ: WHO'S THE CAT IN THIS GAME?
 &HT;    With photo mug of Malone in the Op-Ed/Editorial folder on the
Cox Server.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the cat-and-mouse game between President Bill
Clinton and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, it is no longer clear
which one is the cat.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nothing is cockier than a cat playing with its cornered
prey. The supremely confident feline amuses itself by allowing its
captive just enough running room to give the illusion of an escape.
Then down comes the paw. And the cycle continues until the prey
exhausts itself.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, the commanding role in the U.S.-Iraq game belongs
to the leader of the superpower whose armed forces crushed the
Iraqi military during the Gulf War. U.S. warplanes can fire off
cruise missiles and strike at the heart of Iraq -- Baghdad -- at
will, and American flyers own the skies over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But has the wily president of this middling-sized, arid country
with a population less than California's become the tormenter of
the giant? Is Saddam, whose likeness adorns the streets of his
capital even as his people suffer from malnutrition, the cat
controlling the game?
</P>
<P>
   After seven-and-a-half years, two U.S. presidents and six costly
U.S. military build-ups, the Iraqi leader has yet to comply with
even the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire accord requirement that he turn
over lists of all of his weapons of mass destruction within 15
days.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent play-by-play:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saddam stopped cooperating with United Nations weapons
inspectors at an opportune time, starting last summer. Clinton was
distracted by an impeachment effort and a fund-raising drive for
Democrats for the November 3 congressional elections. Moreover, the
U.S. sponsored anti-Iraq alliance was in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In a Halloween day trick, Saddam then shut down all U.N.
weapons monitoring, a blatant provocation to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  With no one to watch, Saddam had time to shift around and hide
the chemical, biological, nuclear or other other doomsday weapons
that he considers so essential to his power.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  President Clinton responded by ordering warplanes and ships
into the region, and the United States won support for allies and
even Arab nations to condemn Iraq's ``flagrant violations'' of U.N.
resolutions. But only Britain agreed to join in airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Then, just as the planes were in the air and preparing to fire
their cruise missiles on Sat., Nov. 14, Saddam fired a precision
bomb of his own in the form of a letter to the United Nations
pledging once again to cooperate. The effect was immediate,
dissolving the international backing for military action. Clinton
cancelled the attack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Much of the massive deployment, costing hundreds of millions
of dollars, has been put on stand-by. ``The world is watching
Saddam Hussein to see if he follows the words he uttered,'' Clinton
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam will have much tougher guidelines, the president said,
including the still unfulfilled requirement from 1991 to turn over
``all documents bearing on the production of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and the missiles that could be used to deliver
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and his aides offer little hope that Iraq will
comply as long as Saddam is in charge. As a result, the president
is now backing the idea of spending nearly $100 million to bolster
Saddam's opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Baghdad, the mouse is breathing easier. Or is it the
cat?

   SMOKERS _ WASHINGTON _ Joe Camel has grown up to become Joe
College, and a Harvard University survey published Tuesday in the

(Nesmith, Cox News Service 500).
</P>
<P>
   SMOKERS-TRENDS _ A year ago, big tobacco looked to be on the
ropes. Congress was about to drive up prices with big new taxes;
California had just banned smoking even in bars; some cancer rates
were falling as adults quit. Today, the industry's ads have cowed
Congress into inaction and smoking is one of the hot trends among
teens and 20-somethings. As a measure of how difficult it is to
stamp out smoking: Even black teenagers, who traditionally shied
away from tobacco, have taken to trendy new cigarettes called
bidis. On the occasion of the annual anti-cancer Smokeout, we ask

Secretary Louis Sullivan, now president of Morehouse School of
Medicine in Atlanta, announced Tuesday the formation of a new
health ``advisory'' organization of scientists who expect to issue
periodic position papers recommending policies on ``pressing public
health priorities.'' Sullivan said at a press conference formation
of the group was partly inspired by his frustration as HHS
secretary with the lack of information on which to base public
policy decisions that ultimately condemned silicon-based breast
implants. He now feels those decisions were wrong, he said. The
group, the Public Health Policy Advisory Board, will sponsor a
daylong meeting on children's health issues next month at the
National Academy of Sciences, Sullivan said. (Nesmith, Cox News

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 was only a little
propeller-driven plane that fell in an obscure hayfield in west
Georgia: 10 people died, 19 survived. In terms of lives lost,
certainly it was not on scale with TWA Flight 800 and Swissair
Flight 111. More than 200 people died in each of those crashes. Yet
the ASA crash is writ large across many lives. Nearly two-thirds of
the people aboard survived _ a miracle gift _ and so this crash is
not
</P>
<P>
   only about death, but life.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter Gary M. Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from
Georgia to Maine to Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview
survivors of ASA Flight 529. He also canvassed investigative files
of the National Transportation Safety Board and testimony taken
during the ensuing litigation. Pomerantz vivdly describes the 9
minutes and 20 seconds of horror aboard that doomed aircraft as it
fell to earth, the fire that consumed the broken fuselage, as well
as how the tragedy has reshaped lives.

<P>
   CRASH-KENNEDY _ Sitting at his kitchen table in Roswell, Ga.,
about 10 p.m., his dinner growing cold, his wife on the phone
across the room, Barrington thought about those who died in the
crash: people he did not know but might have saved. That included
Jim Kennedy. Now, realizing funerals were only a day away,
Barrington's thoughts took him to the grave sites of Kennedy and
the others. ``Did you do everything you could to help my father/my
mother/my son?'' He imagined a grieving family asking him this
question. Barrington thought, ``Unless you died in the attempt, you
did not try hard enough.'' He heard himself say aloud, ``I'm
alive,'' and so the answer had to be, ``No, I didn't do everything
I could have done.'' This admission brought tears and sobs. He fell
from his chair to the floor. (Pomerantz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   METEORS _ The most intense Leonid meteor shower in three decades
is expected to shower the Earth's upper atmosphere with hundreds of
``shooting stars'' per hour today around 2:45 pm (EST). Although
Americans may not see dramatic celestial fireworks, skywatchers in
Asia are expected to see a vivid cosmic lightshow, and military and
communications satellite operators are bracing for the onslaught.
Marcia Kunstel will file a live report from China. SciMed/Business
desks will look to assess any satellite damage and fallout. (Tate,

<P>
   COMMUNITIES-FORUM _ ATLANTA _ At Vice President Al Gore's
behest, transportation Secretary Rodney Slater will be in Atlanta
Tuesday to host a forum on ``livable communities.'' This is the
second in a series of administration listening sessions on how
American cities can grow smarter that Gore promised a couple of
months ago. The selection of Atlanta was deliberate, given the
area's current status as poster child for sprawl run amok.

   CRUISE-LAWYER _ LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Sidebar to NYT story on

   MCDUFF-EXECUTION _ Serial killer Kenneth McDuff, whose list of

Huntsville. (Greenberger, Austin American-Statesman).

<P>
   TEXAS-JUVENILE-JUSTICE-SYSTEM _ The Texas Supreme Court on
Tuesday heard arguments on whether a juvenile can ``outgrow''
juvenile delinquency charges. The case is being appealed from a
Houston court which ruled that the state cannot bring charges
against a girl because she turned 18 before she was convicted. Will
the decision have far-reaching implications for the juvenile
justice system? (McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman).

was still the hot new prescription, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue
Shield was paying for nearly 4,000 claims per month to Ohio
patients who wanted the anti-impotence drug. But Viagra sales have
cooled considerably in recent months, thanks to a drop-off in media
attention, a fear of side effects, an insurance coverage crackdown
and disappointing results for some patients. (DeBrosse, Dayton

   TEXAS-FOSSILS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Scores of five-point stars seem
pasted on a 2-foot-by-2-foot piece of limestone cut from the bed of
Bouldin Creek in South Austin. In fact, they are some of Austin's
original inhabitants: 85 million-year-old fossil starfish, a few
right side up, most upside down, from when the city was the floor
of a shallow sea. The perfectly preserved starfish are among the
simplest and most captivating of 18 rare Texas fossils in

CATE BLANCHETT IS COMMANDING ATTNETION AS ELIZABETH I 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth I is the quintessential English historic icon _
the ``virgin queen'' who ruled for 45 years in her nation's golden
age.
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett is a 28-year-old Australian stage and screen
actress.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett portrays the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn in
director Shekhar Kapur's grand, if fictionalized, costume drama
``Elizabeth,'' which opens Friday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Elizabeth as she's imprisoned in the Tower as a
teenager and faces the threat of death at the hand of her Catholic
half-sister, Queen Mary. She's separated from her first love,
Robert Dudley (played by Ralph Fiennes' brother, Joseph), because
he may be a traitor to her cause. The film ends with Elizabeth's
coronation in 1558 at the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So how does a young Australian play an English monarch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Blanchett says in a phone interview from New York. ``I
won't work in reaction to what others have done. I'd seen the BBC
version with Glenda Jackson (``Elizabeth R'') when I was in high
school. I watched the Bette Davis film (``Virgin Queen'') later and
I did a lot of reading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I also went to the National Portrait Gallery,'' says
Blanchett, whose eyebrows and eyelashes were bleached, her hairline
shaved and half her hair dyed white for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we all discussed the fact that this would not be a totally
accurate historical portrait of Elizabeth,'' she emphasizes. ``That
was never the intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did go back to out of frustration, particularly at male
historians who dwelled on her so-called virginity, were the letters
she wrote. It was there I could see the mechanics of her brain and
her thought processes and the way she was able to play people off
against each other, as well as her extraordinary intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Elizabeth's interior life will always be speculation
and fictitious. We know the events in history and the impact she
had upon England, but how she felt about things is always
invention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The little things helped,'' adds Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned how robust she was and that she liked men who
hunted, danced and were agile. She was vigorous as a human being.
The Elizabethan Age was an electric, volatile age. It's not as
staid as the BBC version of her life would have us believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, she was in her element in front of a large crowd.
She had the instincts of a performer and she was aware of dramatic
impact and the symbolism of gestures.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett is a graduate of Australia's National Institute of the
Dramatic Arts (where Mel Gibson and Judy Davis once played opposite
each other in ``Romeo and Juliet'') and moved from the stage into
such movies as ``Paradise Road,'' ``Oscar and Lucinda'' and ``Thank
God He Met Lizzie,'' which played at this year's Seattle
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Her performances have been singled out in reviews, over such big
names as Glenn Close, Frances McDormand and Ralph Fiennes. She has
a gravity and grace onscreen that commands attention. Her Elizabeth
is accessible, savvy and strong.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Aussie and ``Elizabeth'' co-star Geoffrey Rush
(``Shine'') says, ``She's great, the talk of the town in an
extraordinary breed of young Australian actors,'' including Miranda
Otto, Toni Collette, Rachel Griffiths and Matt Day. Director
Michael Rymer, whose film ``Angel Baby'' won several Australian
Film Institute awards, says simply, ``She's the one to watch.''
High praise, but they're compliments that make Blanchett blanch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very nice thing for Geoffrey to say but I think what
distinguishes me is what distinguishes them. There's no sense of
homogeneity at the moment in the Australian film industry as far as
actors. All the actors you name embrace their differences, which I
think is really healthy. And it's hard in Australia because we're
farther away from America, which is a comparatively enormous film
industry, so it's rarer we even get seen overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   As an Australian, did she have any concerns about foraying into
English territory? ``Not at all. I actually balk at the idea of
`nationalism.' It's a very conservative concept and I relish
working with a disparate group of people. The idea of working with
(Indian director) Shekhar was what excited me about this project.
Nothing is purely an Australian _ or American _ film anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, none of the directors I've worked with lately are
Australian. I've just done three films with British directors _
`The Talented Mr. Ripley' with Anthony Minghella (who won Oscars
for `The English Patient'), `Pushing Tin' with Mike Newell and `An
Ideal Husband' with Oliver Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Italian-English-Australian crews with a British and
Australian cast on one; an American and Australian cast and an
English director on another. There is no purely national filmmaking
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Was her transition from the stage to the screen easy? ``It
depends on the role,'' she says. ``It's important to know the style
in which everyone involved in a project is working. You can tailor
your instincts to the style so you're all involved in the same
film.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, I'm doing David Hare's play `Plenty' next year at
the Almeida in London and I'm really excited about it, but that
play terrifies me because I have no idea yet how to approach it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with film is you have a time lag before you know
whether it all works or not. In the theater, you find out each
night whether you've communicated something to the audience. You're
dislocated from the audience in film and in some ways, it's
dissatisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett laughs, ``It's not until, God willing, you're in the
supermarket and someone stops you and asks what it was like to work
with Ralph Fiennes (her co-star in `Oscar and Lucinda'). Then you
know someone's actually gone to see your film.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actress, who married Andrew Upton in June of last year,
says she's not interested in developing projects aimed at steering
her toward stardom, no matter how great the feeling when she's
recogized in the express line at the local store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in pushing myself forward because I think
human beings often push too hard in a totally wrong direction,''
she says. ``I'm fluid about work and so far I've been lucky enough
to be in the right place at the right time without having to push
my photograph around a lot. I feel better and more secure if I've
gotten the job because of the previous work I've done. If I don't
get cast because my profile's not high enough, then it's probably
not the right film for me to do anyway.''

TATTOOS CAN BE IN INDELIBLE PAIN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle is like a major tattoo exhibition: Walk down a
busy street on Capitol Hill, around Pioneer Square or in the
University District and body art is everywhere _ arms, legs,
shoulders, necks, even cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the city is moving into a post-grunge era where tattoos may
become unhip.
</P>
<P>
   One-time ravers now find themselves moving up the corporate
ladder, where tattoos are not part of the uniform. One
thirtysomething investment banker says he had his tattoo removed by
a laser process last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my colleagues to know,'' he said, explaining why
he didn't want his name used. ``That is exactly why I had it
removed. I never thought the day would come when I would feel
embarrassed about my tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years tattoo artists thrived as the craze grew across
age groups. If you had firm skin, you weren't too old to get a
tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   But tattoos don't fade away, and the trend inevitably will.
Unless you can fork over several hundred dollars and have a high
pain threshold, you'll live with your body art for the rest of your
life.
</P>
<P>
   Tattoo removal by laser _ in which the ink compounds are broken
down and absorbed by the body _ is expensive, painful, may leave a
scar and is only 90 percent successful. Still, those who can no
longer live with their decorations are opting for laser treatment,
which currently is the best method of removal, say dermatologists.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Johnson, 28, a Seattle construction worker got his first
tattoo _ a large scorpion bearing his birth date _ on his right
shoulder when he was 17. He later got a second, smaller tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's keeping the smaller one for the time being, he's not
comfortable with the scorpion body art he once loved to show off
and he makes a point of covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its gaudy looking and pretty big,'' he said. ``T-shirts cover
it, but I can't wear a tank top.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he sometimes forgets that the tattoo is there ``until I
see it in the mirror and say, `Good god!'.''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, getting a tattoo 10 years ago was cool because it
wasn't trendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to do something that is trendy,'' he said. ``It's kinda
embarrassing (now) when I'm out swimming or something. I'm
conscious of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He had two laser sessions with Dr. Peter Odlend, a dermatologist
on Capitol Hill, and will need four more treatments. At around $300
a session, to remove the tattoo completely will cost about $1,800,
and this is with a small discount, since Johnson's wife, Amy, works
for Odlend.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson paid $50 to get the tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good exchange,'' he said of the far higher cost for
removal, ``and it is more painful than getting the tattoo, but I'll
just be glad when it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Johnson, 28, had her tattoo done for $30 when she was 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always wanted it,'' she said. ``(But) everybody has a
tattoo today, it's too trendy. Now you're different if you don't
have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her tattoo _ a sunshine with a face _ was on her hip
and not often noticeable, she still wanted it gone. She had it
removed by a dermatologist in Boston about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the removal procedure was much more painful than
getting the tattoo. She was fortunate though, since she did not
have to pay. The dermatologist she worked for then was testing
different lasers and she volunteered to be a guinea pig. Laser
procedure to remove a similar tattoo would cost around $1,500
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kinda glad I don't have it,'' Amy Johnson said. ``The
yellow pigment is still there and there is a slight scar, but you
can barely see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dermatologists say the laser technology most commonly used in
tattoo removal works best on black and blue but does not respond
well to yellow, green and red. The latter three colors each require
a different laser for more effective removal, but since the lasers
cost about $150,000 a piece, dermatologists generally do not have
the full range, says Goffe.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor in tattoo removal is the type of ink that was
used, said Odlend. Organic ink can be removed more easily than the
resistant metallic dye.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller tattoos in a single basic color are easier to remove and
obviously less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Odlend said he talks to every patient about the possibility of
scarring and how much of the tattoo can be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they're pretty decided they're going to get laser when
they get here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a higher risk of scarring if the tattoo is on the
shoulder. Keloid scars _ a reddish growth of collagen _ develop
more easily on that part of the body, said Odlend.
</P>
<P>
   Darker skin is more susceptible to scarring, which explains why
African Americans have more problems with keloids, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Renner, 18, chose laser removal because he didn't like the
look of his tattoo. The tattoo was an incomplete abstract design.
</P>
<P>
   Renner went to Dr. Ben Goffe, a dermatologist also based on
Capitol Hill, who said it will take at least six sessions, $300
apiece, to remove the tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Each procedure starts with the application of a local
anesthetic, which eases the pain but doesn't totally deaden the
area.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent session, Renner lay still and tried not to wince
as Goffe, wearing protective goggles, used a steady hand to guide
the laser over the tattoo as though he were tracing the design.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like snapping rubber bands as the laser started to
work, creating what looked like little red sparks as it penetrated
the skin and dissolved the ink.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, a trail of blood followed the laser. Renner felt
pain but didn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has high pain threshold,'' Goffe said. ``Some people cannot
take it and need more anesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Each session lasts no longer than 15 minutes. The next treatment
can be done only after the previous session heals, which usually
takes about six weeks. Depending on the size of the tattoo, the
full treatment, which might require six or seven sessions, could
take more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Laser technology has become more effective over the years, said
Goffe, and the chance of scarring is less than for other methods of
cosmetic removal.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Estrada, a Seattle dental assistant, said she was not
given that option. She went to a plastic surgeon a few years ago
and had her tattoo surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terribly painful and got infected,'' she said. ``I
thought he was going to use a laser, but I think he used a blade. I
just went with it anyway because I wanted it out so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She paid about $500, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada was 21 when she got her tattoo, an army insignia on her
left ankle, just above the heel. She regretted it shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out with a bunch of people in Texas, got drunk and got
the tattoo,'' she said. ``I'm not a tattoo type of person. I never
liked it and wanted it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people who get tattoos know what they're doing and don't
get them on impulse, say tattoo artists. Many who have tattoos
agree.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Daniel Berg, associate professor of dermatology at
the University of Washington, said ``most people get tattoos in
their teens and have not figured out what they want to do with
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So those who choose a statement of undying love, such as ``I
love Julie'' may be well advised: Don't get too many colors.

MOTHERLY AFFECTION BECOMING A CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whew! I am worn out. I have exhausted my last bit of energy in a
fruitless marathon that yielded no tangible results. In the end, I
am left forlorn and uttering the same question that mothers have
asked themselves for countless generations, ``Why won't my son let
me kiss him?''
</P>
<P>
   It all started this morning when my oldest son, who refers to
himself as ``almost a teen-ager,'' came into the kitchen to prepare
his lunch for school. I was drinking my ritual morning cup of
coffee and scanning the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   I watched him as he reached up to the top shelf of the pantry
for peanut butter. For the first time, I noticed that he didn't
have to tiptoe or use a chair to get to that shelf. Then he took a
knife and spread the peanut butter smoothly across the bread
without punching a hole in it. He even cleaned the knife off when
he was done. He placed everything into a paper bag and put it in
his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   I was so proud of him. My little man can dress himself, make his
bed, and prepare his own lunch. My, my, haven't we come a long way,
I thought.
</P>
<P>
   My heart swelled with pride and I walked over, intent on giving
him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek. He saw me coming and
immediately recognized my maternal expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, stop!'' he said. ``I don't want a kiss. It's too early to
kiss people.''
</P>
<P>
   I grinned and lunged for him anyway. He took off like the
Roadrunner with the Coyote chasing him. I was full of caffeine, so
I figured that I could catch him. Boy, is that kid fast! He circled
the kitchen table a few times before he headed toward the den,
where he leapt over the sofa in a single bound.
</P>
<P>
   I remained close on his heels as he ran to his room. He tried to
slam the door, but I was just quick enough to get a foot in. We ran
around and over the obstacles scattered about his room until I
pinned him on one side of his bed with his back against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes flitted from right to left, frantically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, Mom, I don't want a kiss. How about I just give you
$10 to go away?''
</P>
<P>
   When I simply smiled in response, he yelled, ``Dad, help me! Mom
is trying to kill me!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, a simple kiss from your mother won't kill you,'' I said.
``You'd have died years ago if that were the case. You used to let
me kiss you all the time on your fat little cheeks. And you'd kiss
me back, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, that was 100 years ago. I'm a man now. Men don't like to
kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   I leaned across the bed certain of victory. To my surprise, he
did a 4-foot vertical leap, stepped on my back and ran out of the
room. I followed him outside and chased him down the street. He ran
into a neighbor's back yard, startling their turkey, who was trying
to dial the SPCA on a cell phone with his beak. Just then, his
father pulled up in his truck, threw open the passenger door and
yelled, ``Come on son! She's slowing down! You can make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outnumbered, outmaneuvered, and outcast, I watched in silence as
he dove into the truck. The two of them drove away before the door
was shut.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK . He'll be back. I'm sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   I have his lunch.

TODAY'S CDS HAVE MORE FILLING, LESS MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I want less for my money.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   Like 15 or 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt you've noticed CDs are getting longer, that through
technological advances we can now get around 80 minutes of music on
a single disc.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like a great idea, right? More bang for the buck and
all?
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it often isn't _ that too many musicians have forgotten
that just because you can give the public that much music doesn't
mean you should. Or need to.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you whippersnappers out there remember LPs; generally
black in color, came in a cardboard sleeve?
</P>
<P>
   Ring a bell? Anybody?
</P>
<P>
   Hands down.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, they were about half of what CDs cost. Most folks
thought the cost-to-amount-of-music ratio was pretty OK, except for
Tom Petty, who kicked up a big ol' fuss back in 1981 when his
label, MCA, was going to price his ``Hard Promises'' CD at $9.98,
instead of $8.98. That's right. A rock star who demanded a dollar
less per recording. He won, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Then CDs came along and, man, did they give people an excuse to
go on and on. And on some more. Otherwise intelligent people (the
guys in Metallica and Alanis Morissette, to name but five) have put
out CDs in recent years that have nearly 80 minutes of music.
</P>
<P>
   Was this time well-spent? Frankly, no. Not to pick on Alanis or
Metallica, but both those CDs _ her just-released ``Supposed Former
Infatuation Junkie,'' their ``Load'' _ would have been better if
three to five songs, minimum, would have been left off each.
</P>
<P>
   And this is endemic to the industry as a whole: The art of the
good, solid, memorable ``three-minute'' pop song has been
supplanted by the not-so-good 4 1/2-minute pop song, and the result
is a whole lot of songs (like a whole lot of CDs) that would be
better if they were condensed at least a little.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, this is especially noticeable in gospel: On
CD after CD, songs are stretched to five, six, seven minutes,
almost invariably by simply repeating the title or a key phrase
over and over. This cheapens the impact of the song, because it so
often winds up being simply numbing.
</P>
<P>
   One can understand that people want to make longer CDs to
justify the higher price _ and because they now have room to put
songs on there that would otherwise have been relegated to B-sides
or never heard at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that, for whatever reason, under an hour is the
ideal length of time for a CD; more than that and the cohesive
feeling is lost. Think back to Richard and Linda Thompson's ``I
Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight'' (37 minutes), the Rolling
Stones' ``Beggars Banquet'' (40 minutes) or the Beatles'
``Revolver'' (35 minutes). Recall how well the songs complement
each other and seem to play off each other, how the record leaves
you satisfied, like nothing needed to be added or subtracted.
</P>
<P>
   This is equally true in the CD era: Consider that what ties some
of the best recordings of the '90s together is that they ``don't''
go on forever, that the band/performer presents a cohesive, smartly
sequenced group of songs with no fat or filler, and leaves it at
that. U2's ``Achtung Baby,'' Soul Asylum's ``Grave Dancers Union''
and Lucinda Williams' ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' are all less
than an hour in length, but they feel like a complete meal, rather
than stuffing your face with fast food.
</P>
<P>
   They're perfect collections of songs _ in any era. And hearing
them alongside bloated recordings underscores that a collection of
songs works best when it feels thematically complete and doesn't
tax the listener's endurance _ and gives him or her time to do
other stuff, such as sleep and go to work.

   &UR; Thanksgiving: An American Celebration &LR;
</P>
<P>
   APPLES-THANKSGIVING (St. Michaels, Md.) _ They eat well all year
on the Eastern Shore, and they never eat better than at
Thanksgiving. The Shore has always been a world unto itself. Its
people are not rich and never have been, except of course for the
few wealthy ``come heres,'' as the natives call them, who have made
this their headquarters for duck hunting or sailing, and the old
aristocratic families, fewer still, some of whom have lived in
their fine old houses since Colonial times. But the truck farms,
orchards, marshes and coastal waters of this isolated domain have
always provided the raw materials for a rich and singular regional
cuisine, known far and wide for dishes based on oysters and crabs
and game birds. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   With photo and locator map.
</P>
<P>
   PUMPKIN (Undated) _ The pumpkin, during its brief season, lives,
literally, for the holidays. Most people know it as pie _ flaky
pastry with a dark, miraculously heavy filling of spices, cream,
pumpkin and sugar. Traditional, yes. But the pumpkin has much more
to offer. The pumpkin is, next to the potato, the most malleable
and perhaps the most dynamic of autumn foods. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-STUFFING (New York) _ The great American gift for
invention meets its match in the turkey, the great American bird.
The turkey itself is not the problem, it's the yawning chasm
within, a black hole in the culinary universe that somehow manages
to absorb and deaden anything that wanders near its force-field,
making ``stuffing'' a synonym for ``dry, volumetric bore, often
tricked out with oysters in a hopeless search for personality.'' An
unlikely solution to the stuffing crisis has emerged in an unlikely
place _ the cafe at Jean Georges, where a savory, steaming square
of bread pudding rounds out a dish of baked poussin and roasted
carrots. By William Grimes.

perfectly cooked that it practically ruined dinner. In praise of
dry turkey. By John Willoughby and Chris Schlesinger.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-TIPS (Undated) _ If you insist on perfection, here is
what I have learned after roasting 40 turkeys in search of it: you
must brine the turkey in salt water the night before, and rotate it
during roasting. By Pam Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BBQ (New York) _ Like a puff of smoke, Pearson's Texas
Barbecue, the only authentic barbecue pit in New York City, will
fade and vanish by the end of the year. The smoke, in fact, is part
of the problem. By Eric Asimov.
</P>
<P>
   BAUM-LEGACY (New York) _ When Joseph H. Baum died last month,
New York lost one of its great restaurant legends. But his company,
B.E. Group, remains, as does his attention-grabbing flair in
projects he had been developing with his partners. By Florence
Fabricant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLUMNS &LR;

   SIMPLE-COOKING (Undated) _ The column: The advantages to
roasting only a whole turkey breast. By Mark Bittman.

</P>
<P>
   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The Dean of Westminster Cathedral in
London wants to eliminate the Christmas tree. It's a pagan symbol,
he says, and shouldn't be part of the holiday. I have something
equally subversive in mind: getting rid of the Thanksgiving turkey.
Yes, that sacred symbol of holiday plentitude and culinary
ineptitude. It's time for it to go. Trouble is, I forget about this
annual outrage until a day or two before it's on us once again,
when it's too late to drum up any support. So since I have to have
turkey, I'd like to have good wine with it. But which one? By Frank
Prial.

SURGEONS FINDING GENTLER WAYS TO DO HEART SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Robert Krieger's sister needed six months to
recover from open heart surgery in 1995, after surgeons opened her
sternum with a saw.
</P>
<P>
   So when doctors at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany told the
52-year-old New York state employee about a less invasive
alternative to his double-bypass operation, he didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it wasn't much of a choice,'' Krieger said less than a
week after his six-hour operation. ``I was dreading having that
breast bone broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most people suffering from heart disease didn't
have an option. The gold standard approach to repairing blocked
arteries involved surgeons making a 12- to 15-inch incision down
the middle of the chest, cracking open the sternum, and stopping
the heart while they repaired it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, surgeons are increasingly using gentler methods, with
instruments that can reach the heart through ``keyhole'' incisions
between the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   The techniques vary: Some surgeons stop the patient's heart;
others leave it beating. Their goal is the same: avoid trauma to
the chest bone and reduce the recovery and hospital costs for some
of the more than 400,000 Americans who undergo heart surgery each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot more options are available to patients,'' said Dr. Harry
DePan, chief of thoracic and cardiac surgery at Ellis Hospital in
Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the challenge is on consumers to ask questions about
new procedures that are anything but routine. Traditional
open-chest heart surgery has been performed for 40 years. Until
early last year, some minimally invasive techniques were still
considered experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons say more data are needed to determine the success of
these new approaches over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every patient is different,'' said Dr. Charles Canver,
director of the Heart Institute at Albany Medical Center.
``Patients should be informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Early studies are promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already seeing clinical outcomes with minimally
invasive surgery that are comparable to standard open-chest
surgery, which is remarkable for such new procedures,'' said Dr.
Renee Hartz, of Tulane University Hospital and Clinic in New
Orleans, at the Annual Meeting of the American Heart Association
last year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Krieger has no regrets about opting for Heartport, one
of the latest procedures that relies both on new and old
techniques, using patented equipment from a California
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of the beginning of what may become closed-heart
surgery,'' said Dr. Edward V. Bennett, who is pioneering the
technique at St. Peter's and has performed about 40 such operations
over the past year. ``We can do valve operations, bypass
operations. It's a technique that lends itself to a variety of
surgeries.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Krieger learned he needed heart surgery after an Oct. 13
angiogram showed a blockage in the left front of his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, on Oct. 28, the surgical team stopped Krieger's
heart for 51 minutes, using a heart-lung machine to circulate blood
while Bennett repaired two vessels in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of puncturing his aorta and attaching him to the machine
with hose-size tubes, the surgical team at St. Peter's Hospital
threaded catheters through an artery and vein in his leg to divert
the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to stop the heart, surgeons used another catheter,
instead of a traditional clamp, to deliver both medicine and a
device that inflates like a balloon to slowly cut off blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the same as with traditional open-chest heart
surgery: The surgeons had a dry and still area upon which to
perform the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference is recovery time. Krieger said he felt only
mild discomfort from his 3-inch wound.
</P>
<P>
   But this type of ``keyhole'' surgery isn't for everyone.
Although patients generally recover faster, there are potential
complications from the insertion of catheters in multiple sites.
</P>
<P>
   For people whose disease has spread beyond the main heart
vessels into other areas, particularly the legs, catheters can
serve to loosen up plaque and blockages that could set the stage
for a stroke or heart attack, DePan said.
</P>
<P>
   And while stopping the heart may aid in a surgeon's precision,
using the heart-lung machine can also cause complications,
including pneumonia, stroke and brain damage. ``It's a shock to the
system,'' DePan said. ``It damages blood elements. It also
activates an inflammation response.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid those problems, Canver is increasingly doing bypass
operations on beating hearts, a more radical technique that is also
considered a minimally invasive alternative to traditional
open-chest heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he did a triple-bypass on a 47-year-old patient
using a special platform to immobilize only the area he was working
on. To date, the beating heart operation has been most often used
for single-vessel repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Canver said he would soon be able to eliminate the heart-lung
machine in up to half of his cases. ``I'm very optimistic about the
future of technology,'' he said.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SIR VIDIA'S SHADOW &QL; 
 &UR; Paul Theroux (Houghton Mifflin, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Put a wig on Paul Theroux and he'll look suspiciously like Linda
Tripp. That's what his critics say, and you can't blame them for
aiming low. This book is the ballyhooed story of Theroux's
friendship _ we use the term without conviction _ with V.S.
Naipaul, Theroux's mentor and a fine writer but, by this rendering,
a rude, petty, offensive and detestable man. Their relationship
began in 1966, when Theroux was 25 and Naipaul 34, and ended last
year with an excruciating confrontation on a street in London. Now,
it's time for Theroux to bare all, to serve up the details of their
friendship and of its demise (it began, according to Theroux, when
Naipaul remarried after his first wife died, and commenced to
selling off first editions of some of Theroux's books, which he had
inscribed to Naipaul). It has been said by some people who know
both men that Naipaul deserves all of this animosity. For those
readers, this book will be delicious. The rest of us are left to
squirm, and wonder whether two writers ever deserved each other
more. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN &QL; 
 &UR; Alice Munro (Knopf, $24)
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, an optometrist named D.M. Willens drowned when his car
went into a cold, dark river. It was an accident, innocent enough,
the town's people think, until a dying woman tells her nurse
another version that sheds new light on the dead man and on the
dynamics of illicit behavior in the town itself. But is the woman
telling the truth, or are these just the ravings of a dying mind?
And what of the nurse _ what will she do with the burden of what
she knows? Once, in a rare interview, Alice Munro confessed that
she read the tabloids when she stood in line in the supermarket,
that she loved gossip and had been known to peruse ``People''
magazine. Add to that the fact that she is one of today's most
gifted and elegant writers of fiction, and the combination is
almost too good to be true. This is her ninth collection of
stories. It is marked both by her understated virtuosity and by
that rare quality of the best fiction _ her work makes us feel as
if we are sitting in her company, giving ourselves over to her
voice, listening as she tells us a story. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ALONG THE ARIZONA TRAIL &QL; 
 &UR; M. John Fayhee (Westcliffe, $39.95)
</P>
<P>
   Fayhee chose an odd time to walk the Arizona Trail _ he began in
October 1997, fully two years before the trail was set to be
dedicated, and before several sections of the trail even were up
and running. Only about 550 miles of the projected 750-mile trail
were walkable then, some less than others. But Fayhee liked it that
way, and his account of his two months hiking north-to-south
through Arizona from the Utah to Mexico borders is both amiable and
informative. The Arizona Trail was the brainchild of Dale
Shewalter, a Flagstaff fifth-grade teacher who envisioned a
long-distance trail that would cover Arizona's topographic,
biologic, historic and cultural diversity. Most of the
organizational work is in the hands of the Arizona Trail
Association. For information, you can write to it at P.O. Box
36736, Phoenix, AZ 85067. Or read this book, with great photographs
taken along the trail by Jerry Sieve, who lives in Carefree. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; LEGENDS &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by John Miller (New World Library, $29.95)
</P>
<P>
   We have to quibble with some of the selections. Twiggy _ now,
there's a (begin itals) legend. (end itals) The subtitle of this
book is ``Women Who Have Changed the World, Through the Eyes of
Great Women Writers,'' which brings us to another little oddity,
the choice of Isabella Rossellini to do an essay about Greta Garbo.
As great writers go, we'd say Isabella is a pretty face. There are,
however, some other interesting combinations. Gloria Steinem on
Marilyn Monroe. Elizabeth Hardwick on Billie Holiday. Joan Didion
on Georgia O'Keeffe, Alice Walker on Zora Neale Hurston, Diane
Johnson on Audrey Hepburn, Terry Tempest Williams on Rachel Carson,
Janet Flanner on Bette Davis, Cynthia Ozick on Gertrude Stein. None
of these brief essays (accompanied by big photos) are profound, but
they aren't meant to be. It's the chemistry that counts. With an
introduction by that well-known great writer, Anjelica Huston. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MY BROTHER &QL; 
 &UR; Jamaica Kincaid (Noonday, $10)
</P>
<P>
   New in paperback is Kincaid's complex book about her brother's
death from AIDS, about her early life in Antigua and about her
mother, whose difficult presence has haunted all of her daughter's
books. If you'd prefer lighter reading, try ``My Favorite Plant:
Writers and Gardeners on the Plants They Love,'' an anthology
edited by Kincaid, who is an avid gardener. Contributors include
Maxine Kumin, Katharine S. White, William Carlos Williams, D.H.
Lawrence and Ian Frazier. ``I hope the reader will have some
satisfaction,'' Kincaid writes in her introduction. ``Not complete
satisfaction, only some satisfaction. A garden, no matter how good
it is, must never completely satisfy. The world as we know it,
after all, began in a very good garden, a completely satisfying
garden _ Paradise _ but after a while the owner and the occupants
wanted more.'' &QL;

TASTINGS: CHALONE VINEYARD PINOT BLANC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an interview 22 years ago, Richard Graff, for many years a
principal in Chalone Vineyard of Monterey, Calif., said he made
pinot blanc because he liked it and because it was cheaper than
chardonnay. ``A lot of people can't afford $9 for a bottle of white
wine,'' he said, ``and even though our pinot blanc is expensive, at
$6.50 it can reach a lot more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalone pinot blanc is three times as expensive now, but it is
still much less than the winery's chardonnay ($47.95 for the 1995
Reserve), and it is still well liked. With good reason. It has the
intensity and richness of a good chardonnay, with a freshness all
its own and without the heaviness and pervasive taste and smell of
oak that is sadly common to many California chardonnays.
</P>
<P>
   Pinot blanc will never replace truly great chardonnay in
California, Burgundy or anywhere else. But it is nice to know that
anytime you want a refreshing change of pace, it's there.

<P>
   ST. MICHAELS, Md. _ They eat well all year on the Eastern Shore,
and they never eat better than at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The Shore has always been a world unto itself. Its people are
not rich and never have been, except for the few wealthy ``come
heres,'' as the natives call them, who have made this their
headquarters for duck hunting or sailing, and the fewer-still old
aristocratic families, some of whom have lived in their fine old
houses since Colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   But the truck farms, orchards, marshes and coastal waters of
this isolated domain have always provided the raw materials for a
rich and singular regional cuisine, known far and wide for dishes
based on oysters and crabs and game birds.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the first parts of the United States to be
settled by the English, and its identification with food stretches
back to 1614, when Capt. John Smith sent 17 men from Jamestown
across Chesapeake Bay to establish an outpost, where salt was
extracted from sea water in huge kettles over wood fires. Back past
that, actually; the word ``Chesapeake'' means Great Shellfish Bay
in the language of the Susquehanna Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The identification remains intact, even in back-road place
names. The hungry, thirsty traveler need not lose heart on reaching
Temperanceville, Va., because Bivalve, Fruitland and Widgeon are
not far away.
</P>
<P>
   In spring, the Shore supplies Washington and Baltimore with shad
roe, one of the great regional delicacies, and in summer, it sends
truckloads of sweet Silver Queen corn and beefy tomatoes
(``matuses,'' some of the locals call them) to urban markets.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving in this land of abundance means trees still daubed
with the ruddy colors of autumn, the gold-and-silver light of the
low-hanging sun reflected off still ponds and a few magnolias and
roses of sharon still in bloom to brighten days already brisk but
not yet cutting cold.
</P>
<P>
   It also means holiday feasts, either home-cooked or eaten in
restaurants like 208 Talbot in St. Michaels, where the Thanksgiving
menu will include a voluptuous dish of warm local oysters, served
in their shells, bathed in a champagne sabayon. At Eastville Manor
in Eastville, Va., dinner will feature an appetizer of grilled
green tomato slices from the restaurant's garden, sandwiched around
a small, succulent crab cake, and a world-class apple pie with an
oatmeal crust, made from home-grown apples and pecans.
</P>
<P>
   Plus turkey, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazingly fertile place,'' said Melody Scalley, who
owns Eastville Manor with her husband, William, the chef. ``The
growing season lasts almost forever. The fish and shellfish are
always the freshest. That oyster you just ate came from Oyster,
Va., which is 10 minutes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut by innumerable rivers, creeks and inlets, flat as a Kansas
prairie, the Shore occupies the bulk of the Delmarva Peninsula,
which hangs like an elk's tooth on a key chain, in John Gunther's
phrase, between the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay. Part
Maryland, part Virginia, it contributes the ``mar'' and ``va'' to
Delmarva, which also includes most of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Largely rural despite its proximity to urban population centers,
it has only recently been invaded by the malls and superstores.
Interstate highways, main-line railroads and big airlines pass it
by, and so does much that is gaudy and vulgar in modern American
life. Only for geese, ducks and other waterfowl does it lie along a
major route: the great Atlantic flyway.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the northern part of the region, across the bay from
Baltimore, the succulent blue crabs, uncomfortable in the
increasingly chilly water, have burrowed into the sand. Purists
here won't touch crab meat again until spring, knowing that what is
shipped in has probably been pasteurized to retard spoilage. But
farther south, down toward Norfolk, Va., the water is warmer, and
the crab meat remains superb.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Chincoteague and select oysters, now right at
their peak. The big, briny Chincoteagues, with their long, deep,
crinkly shells, have been American classics for more than a
century; trundled halfway across the country in horse-drawn wagons,
they were great favorites of Abraham Lincoln, who served them at
oyster roasts during his years in Springfield, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   There are apples and pears and pumpkins and squash, country hams
and bacon, and rockfish, of course, which come in as crabs go out.
These are the same creatures, more or less, that New Yorkers and
New Englanders call striped bass, although people here swear that
those from the Bay are a little sweeter, a little more delicate, a
little less oily than their Yankee cousins. (The name rockfish,
they say, comes from the Maryland town of Rock Hall, where the fish
were once so plentiful that they rendered nets superfluous.)
</P>
<P>
   There are fresh turkeys _ yes, free-range birds, never frozen,
faintly gamy, raised by a few rugged individualists on small farms
in the very shadow of imperial-size poultry-production facilities
owned by the Hertz and Avis of the broiler industry, Tyson and
Perdue.
</P>
<P>
   There might even be a wild turkey for the family table, courtesy
of a friendly hunter, or a mallard or a black duck from the
freezer.
</P>
<P>
   No wild goose, though. That used to be a Thanksgiving tradition
for some Shore natives, because this is the migration season for
the big honkers, and you can see them in their thousands not only
in reserves like the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, near
Cambridge, Md., but also in farmers' fields, eating beans and
kernels left on the ground after harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with dwindling populations of Canada geese, however, the
authorities have imposed a ban on hunting overwintering birds.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is the centerpiece of Thanksgiving here as elsewhere,
sometimes served with sauerkraut, a custom that seems to have
migrated across the water from Baltimore, which has a large
population of German origin.
</P>
<P>
   But geography means that seafood plays a larger role on the
Shore than in Ohio or Oklahoma. At 208 Talbot, which occupies a
handsome brick house dating from 1870, holiday diners will be able
to choose several other main courses if they wish. Among them are a
slab of pan-seared rockfish perched on a potato pancake _ potatoes
are another big crop on the Shore _ topped with wild mushrooms and
surrounded by a silken pool of oyster cream.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said Candace Chiaruttini, the effervescent major
domo of the restaurant's dining room, 70 percent of her
Thanksgiving customers will order turkey, if past years are any
guide. They will be served slices of white meat and dark meat from
a roasted free-range bird raised by the Gadow family on a farm near
Harmony, Md., about 20 miles east of here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The stuffing? ``Just a generic bread-based blend, with a fair
amount of sage,'' said the chef, Paul Milne, who owns 208 Talbot
with Ms. Chiaruttini. They have learned from experience, she said,
that anything fancier, like a sausage or oyster stuffing, ``causes
big trouble because everyone has some kind of dietary
restriction.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone except the terminally allergic will probably start with
the gloriously rich oysters, Milne's showpiece. Four elongated
shells, nestled into a platter of salt, point north, south, east
and west; in each is a plump oyster, a tablespoon of sabayon, whose
champagne base lends a slight contrasting note of acidity, and
fragments of ham and pistachio nuts (which come from a good deal
farther afield than the other ingredients).
</P>
<P>
   I have never eaten better, except possibly the oysters in
champagne sauce that have long been the glory of La Maree, the fine
seafood house near the Russian Church in Paris. A dab hand with
sauces, Milne.
</P>
<P>
   His feast-day soup will be squash, thin rather than thick, sweet
at first sip, then tart, flavored with apple chunks and lots of
thyme.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, plus vegetables, plus dessert, comes for $48 a
head, served by an unusually sweet young staff. If you go, you can
enjoy a stroll before or after eating in St. Michaels, whose mostly
white-frame Colonial and Victorian houses have somehow been
converted into restaurants and bed and breakfasts and outfitters
for hunters without looking the least bit touristy.
</P>
<P>
   St. Michaels has been a boating center for two centuries. In the
War of 1812, sleek two-masted St. Michaels privateers tormented the
British fleet. Hoping to put the shipyards here out of action, the
British attacked at night, but the canny townspeople hung lanterns
in trees. That caused the British cannon to overshoot and gave St.
Michaels a handy slogan: ``The Town that Fooled the British.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, you can sample the marine tradition by visiting the
Blackwater reserve, with its geese, ducks and bald eagles, a drive
of 45 minutes; or the fleet of skipjacks, the only sail-powered
fishing boats left in the country, moored at Tilghman Island, 20
minutes' drive in the other direction, or the Chesapeake Bay
Maritime Museum, just a few blocks' walk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I happen to have a Virginia-born wife, named Betsey, and
she insists that I tell you that Virginians, not the citizens of
the Massachusetts Bay Colony, ate the first Thanksgiving dinner. So
I'm telling you. But I must add, even at the peril of banishment to
the Midwest wilderness whence I sprang, what Frances Pollard,
librarian of the Virginia Historical Society, said about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   It is indisputably true, she said, that Captain John Woodlief
and 37 other settlers arrived at what is now Berkeley Plantation on
the James River on Dec. 4, 1619, two years before the doings at
Plymouth, bearing orders stating that the day of the ship's arrival
``shall be yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of
Thanksgiving to Almighty God.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that in 1963, President John F. Kennedy, a
Massachusetts man, after all, signed a piece of paper establishing
Berkeley as the site of the first official Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' Ms. Pollard added bravely, ``we don't have
any real evidence that the people at Berkeley actually ate or drank
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginians have been making up for that oversight for the last
250 or so years, not least in the tiny portion of the commonwealth
that occupies the southern tip of the Eastern Shore _ just two
counties, total population about 45,000. This year, it seems safe
to say, few on the Shore will eat better than those at Eastville
Manor, a rambling old white frame house down the road a bit from
Eastville (population, 108), whose mellow old brick courthouse,
built in 1730, houses (and displays for people who ask) the oldest
continuous set of county records in the country, starting in 1632.
</P>
<P>
   Scalley, who renovated the house himself, used to cook at the
Four Seasons Hotel and at Nora's, two of Washington's better
restaurants, and it shows. His holiday guests will be offered not
one but four appetizers, served on a large plate, then tuck into a
feast that costs a mere $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Pride of place, in my view, goes to the crab cake sandwich, with
little batons of Smithfield ham scattered on top and basil butter
underneath. Which is not to dismiss the oyster patty, a tiny,
delicate nibble composed of a puff-pastry cup with an oyster from
Oyster and a bit of oyster liquor inside, and a restrained garlic-
and sherry-scented cream sauce; the corn fritter, with remoulade
sauce, or the assortment of seven raw vegetables, most from the
garden, arranged in a cup formed by half a Purple Beauty pepper,
also from the backyard, like all the herbs.
</P>
<P>
   This is not only a surprisingly sophisticated restaurant to find
in an out-of-the-way spot, but it is also a restaurant of strong
regional identity. Perhaps that is to be expected in a state
obsessed with the past. The great Virginia historian Douglas
Southall Freeman once said that ``all eastern Virginians are
Shintos under the skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The mid-meal salad was as light as a cloud, composed of organic
field greens custom-grown for the manor by John Johnston, over near
the Atlantic coast in Wachapreague. The delectable biscuits, no
bigger around than a half dollar, were made from local yams. And
one of the main-course vegetables was a gratin containing a
hitherto secret Eastern Shore ingredient. (Ms. Scalley, who takes
some care not to uptown her predominantly local clientele, called
the dish a casserole, not a gratin, but it was a knockout by any
name.)
</P>
<P>
   So here's the secret: besides the usual cream and a bit of
parmesan, besides a few garden-variety potatoes and a few early
turnips to add a sharpish accent, Scalley uses several Hayman
potatoes. These are slightly sweet white potatoes, unique to this
region, as far as I know, which must be ``cured'' for four to six
weeks in a room where the temperature stays at 75 degrees and the
humidity at 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next week, Haymans will be available in the New York
area, at Gourmet Garage and the Vinegar Factory in Manhattan and at
Kings in New Jersey. Or you can always head down here for a taste;
then you will have a chance to sample Scalley's truly incredible
apple pie and visit the serenely lovely boxwood gardens of nearby
Eyre Hall, a manor house occupied by the same family for 10
generations.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant 208 Talbot is at 208 North Talbot Street, St.
Michaels, Md., (410) 745-383, www.208talbot.com. Open for dinner
Wednesday through Sunday, also for brunch on Sunday. Street signs
do not clearly distinguish between North Talbot and South Talbot,
so there are two buildings marked 208 Talbot; the restaurant is at
the far end of town, on the way to Tilghman Island.
</P>
<P>
   Eastville Manor is at 6058 Willow Oak Road, Route 631, near the

   ROASTED BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Paul N. Milne, 208 Talbot &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours  &QL;
</P>

FOR EASE, ROAST ONLY THE BREAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: recipe at end of article)  
 (also see TURKEY-STUFFING, TURKEY-TIPS, DRY-TURKEY)  
 (bl)  
 By MARK BITTMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are plenty of reasons to cook a whole turkey breast for
Thanksgiving rather than an entire bird. It cuts roasting time at
least in half, reduces the hassle of carving and makes the
overabundance of leftovers somewhat less absurd. It also frees you
to create interesting side dishes.
</P>
<P>
   A breast of about three pounds is fine for a party of four,
while one weighing six pounds or more can serve about 10. And yes,
there are usually enough leftovers for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the greatest advantage to roasting a breast is that
you can produce white meat that is truly moist _ as opposed to the
dried-out white meat that is the near-inevitable result of roasting
a whole turkey until the legs are cooked through. Perfectly cooked
white meat does not require tons of gravy to become edible.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer the kind of soggy dressing that results from
stuffing it into the turkey, just pile it under the cavity formed
by the breast bone. But dressing is best baked in a separate baking
dish, or around the turkey, so that it crisps up.
</P>
<P>
   Basting a turkey gives the skin added flavor, but it does
nothing to maintain interior moisture. So if a guest is on a
low-fat diet, baste with chicken stock, or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department recommends roasting white meat
poultry to 170 degrees, at which point, unfortunately, the meat is
unpalatably dry. Personally, I take my chances with a slightly
lower temperature, about 155 degrees, and have never regretted it.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY BREAST ON THE BONE
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   1 3- to 6-pound turkey breast
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil, melted butter or chicken stock
(optional)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place turkey in roasting pan;
brush with oil, butter or stock, and season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place turkey in oven, and roast for 40 to 60 minutes,
depending on size, basting with the pan juices (or a little more
chicken stock), every 15 minutes or so. Begin checking every few
minutes with an instant-read thermometer; turkey is ready when the
thermometer reads 155 degrees. Remove the turkey from the oven, and
let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes (during which time its internal
temperature will rise to about 160 degrees) before carving and
serving. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 10 servings. &QL;

HEFTY REDS AS A FAIR MATCH FOR THE BIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I see by the papers that the Dean of Westminster Cathedral in
London wants to eliminate the Christmas tree. It's a pagan symbol,
he says, never mind that the queen donates two trees to the
cathedral each year.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how the dean will wriggle out of this one, but I
can sympathize with him because I have something equally subversive
in mind: getting rid of the Thanksgiving turkey. Yes, that sacred
symbol of holiday plentitude and culinary ineptitude. It's time for
it to go.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, I forget about this annual outrage until a day or
two before it's on us again, when it's too late to drum up support
for my cause, or to push my preference for fried chicken. So since
I have to have turkey, I'd like to have good wine with it.
</P>
<P>
   But which one? First of all, let's keep it American. It's our
holiday, so why not drink our wines? And let's keep the prices
moderate _ around $20 or less.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of these wines are on my perennial list. Why not? They are
consistently good. A few are here for the first time, including two
from Gallo, of all people. Let's face it; they are making more and
more good wines in California these days.
</P>
<P>
   There is a belief in some circles that since turkey is poultry,
it should be paired with white wine. Not so. Its strong flavor will
tolerate some white wines, but it pairs best with robust reds, even
rustic zinfandels.
</P>
<P>
   Once, zinfandel would have been the odds-on favorite for any
American festival. Like most of us, its ancestors came from
elsewhere (Croatia, in its case), but now Americans are the only
people who make it and it deserves a special place at the
Thanksgiving table.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Frei Ranch Zinfandel by Gallo confirms that this huge
winery's commitment to quality is paying off. The wine is a bit
softer than might be expected from a full-bodied zinfandel, but the
color, the aroma and the taste are unbeatable. Niebaum-Coppola's
Edizione Pennino is a zinfandel named after the music publishing
house of Francis Ford Coppola's grandfather. The label is
Italianate, the wine Californian.
</P>
<P>
   Fetzer Vineyards is in Mendocino County, where some of the best
zinfandel grows. This winery's skill with the grape comes through
in its Barrel Select Zinfandel. Jedidiah Steele may have made his
name with chardonnay and his good pinot noir, but I think his heart
is in zinfandel. Try the 1996 Steele Zinfandel from the Pacini
Vineyard, in Mendocino, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot is still everyone's favorite American red wine. I'm less
overwhelmed than others but there are some good ones out there. The
Washington State winemakers have a special touch with merlot; they
give it a little more structure, a little more style. The Canoe
Ridge and Columbia Crest 1995's illustrate this. Robert Mondavi's
1994 Napa Valley is also a superlative merlot.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the leaner style are some Long Island merlots.
These wines impressed a group of prominent Bordeaux winemakers and
chateau owners when they toured the North Fork vineyards a few
years ago. Palmer and Hargraves are worth consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Rhone-style wines are flourishing in California. There are a
couple worth considering: Le Cigare Volant, from Bonny Doon
Vineyard in Santa Cruz, is Randall Grahm's homage to
Chateauneuf-du-Pape. It is a worthy evocation of the rich Rhone
style with a nice touch of spicyness. And there is petite sirah.
</P>
<P>
   No one is absolutely certain what the petite sirah grape really
is, although the weight of expert opinion seems to be on the side
of the durif, a little-known hot-climate grape in France. Whatever
it is, you will be certain you have opened an excellent bottle of
wine when you try Stags' Leap Winery's petite sirah, a solid
late-fall wine.
</P>
<P>
   Cabernet sauvignon still reigns as the king of California red
wines, and there are people who see no reason to drink anything
else. Even if your tastes are a tad more eclectic, there are
cabernets you should consider for your big dinner.
</P>
<P>
   With its 1994 Stefani Ranch, Gallo is a contender, too, along
with Fetzer's Barrel Select 1994, Beaulieu Vineyards' Rutherford
1995 and the St. Supery 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Trefethen Vineyards and the less-well-known Turnbull Cellars are
Napa Valley neighbors producing excellent, if different, style
cabernets. Both are particular favorites of mine. But then, so are
Robert Mondavi's Napa Valley cabernet and Simi Winery's Alexander
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   For die-hard white wine fans, there are some great chardonnays.
Never much of a California chardonnay fan, I must admit it goes
well with turkey. Estancia's Pinnacles chardonnay from the
mountains east of Monterey and Edna Valley's chardonnay from San
Luis Obispo are two elegant wines with enough substance to stand up
to any meal. Robert Mondavi's 1995 Carneros District is another
excellent buy.
</P>
<P>
   Franciscan Vineyards Oakville is always a good bet for price and
quality, and if you seek diversity, think of Benziger, which offers
a Napa chardonnay and a Sonoma chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   There are other good white wines _ pinot gris, sauvignon blanc,
pinot blanc. None are substantial enough for turkey. We can drink
them after I get rid of all these turkeys.

PSYCHIATRIST COLLABORATES WITH DALAI LAMA TO MAP PATH TO
HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The idea was for the book to show the Western world
the way to happiness by combining the common-sense insights of His
Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, with the scientific
knowledge and clinical experience of an inquisitive Jewish
head-doctor. But the literary world needed a lot of convincing that
this theological/psychological Odd Couple could be a commercial
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, I was unhappy'' about publishers' turndowns,
Phoenix psychiatrist Howard C. Cutler confesses. ``And the irony
was not lost on me that I'd spent years researching and writing a
book on happiness, only to receive all these rejections from agents
and publishers that were making me so unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had enough rejections I could wallpaper my bathroom with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler had retreated from his private practice in 1993 to focus
on collaborating with the Tibetan spiritual and political
leader-in-exile to create a practical guidebook to happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought, well, I can whip this book together in about
six months,'' Cutler recalls with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The process took 10 times that long, sorely challenging the
psychiatrist to heal himself along the way by taking to heart the
lessons of ``The Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Living''
(Riverhead, $22.95).
</P>
<P>
   The book finally hit stores this month, its jacket depicting the
63-year-old Dalai Lama projecting a warm smile that would seem to
belie the many sorrows he has had to overcome since leaving his
Himalayan homeland in 1959 in the wake of a failed uprising against
its military occupation by China.
</P>
<P>
   The smile is genuine, and it means the advice works, the doctor
vouches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, just talking with the Dalai Lama over the years,
my life seems to be happier than before,'' says the 44-year-old
Cutler.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reaction to the book has given Cutler and his mentor
reason to beam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is such a thing as an art of happiness, and this
is one of the best how-to books a reader will ever find,'' says the
American Library Association's ``Booklist.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is distilled from about 20 hours of private audiences
the psychiatrist had with the Dalai Lama, plus excerpts of numerous
public talks given by the Nobel Peace Prize winner during an
eight-day visit to Arizona in 1993 that Cutler was instrumental in
setting up.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the book is a comfortably conversational
exploration of such eternal ponderables as the purpose of life, the
elusiveness of inner contentment, and the inevitability of
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The co-authors waste no time in providing answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek
happiness,'' the Dalai Lama says in chapter one's opening line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether one believes in religion or not, whether one believes
in this religion or that religion, we all are seeking something
better in life. So, I think, the very motion of our life is towards
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It might sound selfish, but is it?'' Cutler asks.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with that and subsequent questions, the book observes
that there is a world of difference between happiness and pleasure;
that kindness and compassion are major components of the real
thing; that achieving happiness requires a continuous disciplining
of the mind; and that the key to coping with suffering is being
able to shift one's viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very utilitarian, practical stuff,'' Cutler says.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say the book is simplistic or preachy. Cutler
politely injects healthy doses of skepticism into the conversation
here and there, and he regularly cites scientific and psychological
studies that illustrate and reinforce the message.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the book are being divided between Cutler and a
trust benefiting the Tibetan exile community, the doctor says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dalai Lama is given top billing as co-author,
Cutler isn't even sure whether he read the final text after it was
reviewed by an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust you. I'm sure you did a good job,'' the psychiatrist
says the Dalai Lama told him.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler, who grew up as one of four children in the Scottsdale,
Ariz.,
</P>
<P>
   family of a construction contractor dad and a homemaker mom,
developed an interest in Buddhism as a teenager through encounters
with such works as Jack Kerouac's ``The Dharma Bums.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still the worst Buddhist student I know, comparatively
speaking'' says Cutler, emphasizing that the book is neither an
exaltation of Buddhist doctrine nor a scholarly tome on what makes
an unhappy mind tick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to implement some of the Buddhist principles in my
life, but for me, Buddhism seems more a psychology or mind science
than a religion. The elements that interest me most are its
common-sense approaches to the human condition and to training the
mind. I consider myself partially Buddhist, but still Jewish _
despite not attending services regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler completed bachelor's degrees in art and zoology at
Arizona State University in Tempe before heading off to medical
school at the University of Arizona in Tucson, intending to
specialize in internal medicine. Psychiatry turned out to be more
captivating.
</P>
<P>
   While visiting India for several months on a small research
grant to study Tibetan medicine, Cutler worked with the Dalai
Lama's older brother, who was in charge of the medical institute in
Dharamsala. Through him, the doctor met his future collaborator in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dalai Lama had certain qualities that struck me _ and
strike everybody who meets him: his friendliness, connectedness,
his ability to immediately put you at ease,'' Cutler recalls.
``Because of his position as both a political and spiritual leader,
I was expecting to meet someone like royalty. But he was so
down-to-earth, a genuinely kind, warm person who was incredibly
brilliant, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade, Cutler periodically saw the Dalai Lama in
this country and India, all the while urging him and his aides to
schedule an Arizona trip. The doctor eventually helped set up and
headed a foundation that co-sponsored the 1993 visit. By then, the
prospect of a book was firmly in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to any assumption that an increasingly complex society
is also increasingly unhappy, Cutler points out that surveys
through the years have shown a relatively stable happiness
quotient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around 30 percent say they are very happy, 10 percent say
they're miserable, and the rest are somewhere in between.'' Still,
he notes, ``Everybody wants to be happier than they are at this
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama talks open-mindedly both of universal truths and
everyday practicalities. Celibate all his life, he shows no
squeamishness in discussing sex in its many dimensions, from lust
to marital intimacy. He is not dogmatic about abortion. He has a
sense of humor. And he reveals that even he carries the burden of
at least one personal regret, having to do with his brother's
death.
</P>
<P>
   He is most disarming in a vignette from Cutler's introduction to
the book.
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrist, hoping he'll gain dazzling psychotherapeutic
insights, says he elaborately laid out for the Dalai Lama the case
histories of some of his most perplexing patients. He asks why one
woman in particular persists in self-destructive behavior, and
waits expectantly through a long pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' His Holiness finally responds with a shrug and
a laugh. ``You'll often find that there are no simple
explanations.''
</P>
<P>
   But every once in a while, there CAN be a simple resolution of
unhappiness over, say, publishers' rejections.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what got the book into print was, first, Cutler's
openness with friends over his dismay, then a large share of blind
luck (or was it predestination?), and, most of all, persistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine in New York got on the subway with her
mother, who sat next to a man holding a book she recognized,''
Cutler relates. ``She said something about what a good book it was,
and the guy said, `Yes, I edited it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler's friend soon was telling the book editor about the
psychiatrist's difficulties in finding an agent and publisher, and
the subway rider expressed immediate interest.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the book wasn't right for the specialized
focus of this particular editor's publishing house, but he did send
Cutler to a capable agent _ Stephen King's agent, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Now, besides the U.S. edition, ``The Art of Happiness'' will be
appearing in translations in Europe and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Will Cutler ever return to the psychiatric practice he wound
down five years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first of the year, I may resume a limited, part-time
practice. But I want to do another book,'' the doctor says.

MELTING CHOCOLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Sometimes when I melt chocolate, it gets a strange, grainy
consistency. Why? Can I still use it in recipes?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most likely, a drop of water made its way into your pot of
melting chocolate. When this happens, the chocolate seizes or
clumps together in an irregular, grainy mass.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific principle behind this reaction should be familiar
to anyone who has ever put a coffee spoon back into the sugar bowl
after stirring, according to Shirley Corriher, a food scientist who
wrote ``Cookwise'' (William Morrow, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate, like sugar, is composed of tiny solid particles,
which are suspended in cocoa butter. When chocolate liquefies, it's
the cocoa butter that melts; the chocolate particles remain solid.
If a tiny amount of water is introduced, it causes the particles to
clump _ just like that wet spoon in the sugar bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the solution is to add more warm water to the
chocolate. Ms. Corriher's rule of thumb is to add 1 tablespoon of
water to 2 ounces of chocolate. Vigorously whisk the mixture until
smooth, then use it in the recipe, subtracting the amount of water
added to the chocolate from the other liquids called for.
</P>
<P>
   One way that water might get into the chocolate in the first
place is if you melted it in a double-boiler. While many recipes
call for melting chocolate this way, the steam rising from the
bottom pot often finds its way into the chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   A better way to melt chocolate is to use a microwave oven on
three-quarters power (making sure to stir it every 30 seconds), or
to melt the chocolate with the liquid called for in the recipe,
provided it meets the 1-to-2 rule. You may have noticed that many
recipes call for melting chocolate with butter, cream or coffee.
This is why.

DRIED TURKEY MEAT: A DELICIOUS LINK TO THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see SIMPLE-COOKING, TURKEY-STUFFING, TURKEY-TIPS)  
 (bl)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, our Thanksgiving turkey was so perfectly cooked that
it practically ruined dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Like many cooks, we had succumbed to the mania for solving the
classic turkey dilemma: how to fully cook the dark meat without
drying out the white meat. Since we both spend the holiday with
Chris' sister, Susan, and her family, she joined us in the
research. After much consultation, we finally decided we had found
the solution.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact we had. Through a convoluted process that involved
raising and lowering the oven heat as well as turning the turkey
upside down, right side up, and from one side to the other as it
cooked, we thought we had reached turkey nirvana. When the bird was
sliced, not only were the thighs just right but the breast meat,
fully cooked with no trace of pink, virtually oozed juice. We all
exulted that this was one juicy, perfect bird.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one problem: nobody liked it all that much. When
the platter was passed around for second helpings, the white meat
went begging. Although technically excellent, this simply was not
the turkey that we all remembered from childhood Thanksgivings.
</P>
<P>
   When we spooned cranberry sauce onto slices of the breast, for
example, the juice didn't soak into the meat as it usually did.
Even the sandwiches we made the next day were disappointing; with
the meat so juicy, the added mayonnaise and cranberry sauce made
the triple-deckers we fashioned seem gloppy, rather than just
right.
</P>
<P>
   The experience brought home a lesson sometimes overlooked in
today's relentless search for culinary perfection: contrary to the
perfectly fine views you may encounter elsewhere, with something as
personal as cooking, making something just right can sometimes be
totally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This maxim is particularly applicable on holidays, when ritual
and memory are far more important than the actual quality of the
food being served. On these occasions, the turkey or roast or ham
is not so much a gustatory delight as a link to the past, a central
player in a rite that helps binds each of us to our own personal
history.
</P>
<P>
   This year we won't make the same mistake. Instead of fussing
over the turkey, we will return to cooking it just as our
grandmothers did. After sprinkling the breast with lots of salt and
pepper and rubbing it with butter, we will cover the breast with a
damp dish towel and put the bird into a 400-degree oven. Except for
re-wetting the towel once or twice with pan juices and taking it
off for the last hour of cooking, nothing else will be done to that
turkey for the next several hours except to just let it cook.
</P>
<P>
   With no worries about pampering the turkey, culinary efforts can
be devoted to making an array of chutneys and relishes to spoon
over the breast meat and moisten it. Classic Southern preparations
like chow chows or picallilies are excellent, and relishes
involving cranberries are also popular for obvious reasons. But
more adventuresome mixtures like chutneys, salsas or pickled fruits
are also very welcome. In fact, this approach is an easy way to
combine the requisite tradition with a bit of culinary innovation.
</P>
<P>
   As an added advantage, these condiments will provide the turkey
with some real flavor. Let's face it, turkey by itself, moist or
dry, is just not that exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another benefit of this approach is that all the relishes
can be made well in advance. This means that on Thanksgiving Day,
you can enjoy being with your guests or use your time to make
elaborate side dishes, depending on your temperament.
</P>
<P>
   So let's hear it for turkey with relatively dry white meat. It's
less work, it lets you observe tradition while also bringing
exciting new flavors to the table and _ if your culinary heritage
is anything like ours _ it results in a turkey that looks and
tastes like Thanksgiving.

   COMDEX _ LAS VEGAS _ The mood at Comdex _ from keynotes to the
show floor _ seems to be one of unbridled optimism about the future
of the computer industry. Also, maybe something out of the Dell
schmooze fest. (Mahoney, Austin American-Statesman) ETA: 5:30 p.m.

<P>
   SMALLBIZ _ AUSTIN _ The founders of Athens Group Inc. set out to
form a more perfect tech consulting company. One where everyone who
contributed got a piece of the company based on their hard work.
Athens' founder s have decided to throw out the hierarchial rules
at most companies and build a business based on democratic
principles. A look at their radical approach, which they claim is
especially suited to small firms in high tech. (Tyson, Austin
American-Statesman).

   CHRYSLER-BENZ _ ATLANTA _ The merger of Chrysler with the parent
of Mercedes Benz will be celebrated Tuesday with a special lunch at
the auto parts plant in Clayton County. Until now, the workers at
the plant have been focused on moving American parts and now they
are going uptown, it seems. (Earle, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BELLSOUTH-CABLE _ ATLANTA _ In the race to provide high-speed
lines to consumers, BellSouth's blazing competitor to cable modems
has apparently come out of the blocks, well, slowly. (Haddad,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BELLSOUTH-USER _ ATLANTA _ Eric Johnson was annoyed with his
cable service from MediaOne, so he signed up for BellSouth's
wireless cable.
</P>
<P>
   BELLSOUTH-INTERACTIVE _ ATLANTA _ BellSouth has quietly
terminated its Chamblee experiment with interactive cable service.
What was learned? What was gained? Why won't they do it again?
(Chambers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TECH-PATENT _ ATLANTA _ Patrick Herold believes his invention is
going to make the world a more pleasant place to wake up, ``one
morning at a time.'' Herold, an Atlanta businessman, was recently
issued U.S. patent No. 5,832,067 for a ``method and apparatus for
integrating telephone signals with an alarm clock.'' He calls it a
``new clock radio.'' But it's more than a clock radio. It's a
telecommunication device that delivers predetermined messages in
the morning when you awake _ more pleasant messages than commercial
radio broadcasts. (Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   Y2K _ Michael Cohn is worried about Year 2000, and that's
bothersome because Cohn spends his time in companies' war rooms and
Y2K trenches. (Chambers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   E-SHOPPING _ Let your fingers do the walking this holiday
season. In cyberspace, there are no crowds, no lines and you can
shop at 4 a.m. And you never have to worry about finding a place to
park. Electronic commerce is rapidly becoming a booming business.
(Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   E-SHOPPING-HOWTO _ So you've never shopped online before. Fear
not first time shoppers: If e-shopping was hard or scary, nobody
would do it and you wouldn't be able to order Gap sweatshirts
online. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   FBC-UFFOOT _ Steve Spurrier's signal system and play calling.
How does this work? Why is 5-9 backup Billy Young the signal man?
And what's that like? Does Spurrier confer with anyone about calls.
Receivers coach Dwayne Dixon seems to be the sideline confidante.
And what about Young? Does he have input? Is someone assigned to
pick up tossed visors? There was one game, maybe Auburn, where
Johnson stood in the shotgun and Spurrier leaned forward, took a
look at the defense, then sent in the play. Does Spurrier actually
read defenses? What's going on, what about those signals?
Everything about the Spurrier sidelne. (Dolch, Palm Beach Post).

lines up a lot, often changing them even during a game. Does that

   &UR; China Sets the Stage for a Birthday Party &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No, that big blue fence surrounding Tiananmen Square is not the
latest Christo project. The vast square in the heart of Beijing,
the scene of many of Communist China's greatest and worst moments
and a popular starting point for both Chinese and foreign visitors
to the city, will be closed until May for renovations. The brick
surface, too familiar to many a tourist's sore feet, is being
replaced with granite. And the street lights, decorative lights and
public address system will all be improved.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The renovations are part of China's preparations for the 50th
anniversary next October of the day that Chairman Mao, on Tiananmen
Square, founded the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
   One of the square's chief attractions, the Mao Zedong Mausoleum,
where throngs parade past the chairman's embalmed body and into a
gift shop selling Mao souvenirs, will be closed through March 15.
But the historical museums along the east side of the square will
remain open, and the daily ceremonies in which People's Liberation
Army soldiers raise and lower the national flag with military pomp
will continue uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No More Loitering At the Palazzo Vecchio &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The city of Florence has begun enforcing an old ordinance that
bans sitting, eating and drinking on the steps of the Palazzo
Vecchio. For a few months, traffic police and volunteers have been
patrolling the steps to enforce the law, politely asking tourists
to move along. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The steps, which face onto Florence's most famous square, the
Piazza della Signoria, have long been a favorite perch for tourists
taking a breather. The spot had become so popular that Mayor Mario
Primicerio revived enforcement of the ordinance, and now signs in
various languages have been put up near the steps, explaining that
lounging or eating will not be tolerated.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the city said that the steps should be respected
as a sort of open-air museum, not least because they are graced
with famous statues, including a copy of Michelangelo's ``David.''
But tourists need not despair: next to the Palazzo Vecchio is the
14th-century Loggia di Lanzi, which houses a remarkable collection
of Renaissance statues and which reopened this summer after a long
restoration. Tourists are welcome to sit on the stone benches that
line the loggia _ although eating and drinking are not allowed
there, either.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; San Francisco Expands Onto an Old Naval Base &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Treasure Island in San Francisco, which recently opened to the
public for the first time in nearly 50 years, will be illuminated
by thousands of twinkling lights during a holiday fair next month.
The free fair will run from 5 to 10 p.m. every weekend between Dec.
4 and 20, and will include choral performances, a Christmas tree
and wreath market, a bazaar featuring the work of local artisans,
and an illuminated procession of boats on opening night. There will
also be a flea and antiques market, which will continue every
Sunday throughout 1999, from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Situated next to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the
430-acre Treasure Island is a flat area with sweeping bay views. It
was created out of landfill for a 1939 international exposition and
became a naval base during World War II. When the Navy left in
1997, the city began to convert it to civilian use. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first step in the conversion _ the removal of toxic hazards
from the eastern part of the island _ is still under way, and the
details of long-term public access and development are being worked
out. In addition to the holiday fair, a strip of land along the
island's palm-lined western shore will be open on weekends through
the end of the year, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The area has a large
lawn with picnic tables, built-in barbecues and a view that takes
in the San Francisco skyline, Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Treasure Island can be reached by car by way of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which has exits from both directions.
For the holiday fair, parking will be $5, and there are plans for
bus service from San Francisco. Information: (415) 274-0660.

<P>
   &UR; For the Hardy: Arctic And Antarctic Tours &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Trips to either the bottom or the top of the globe will be
available through August. Marine Expeditions of Toronto will
conduct 16 Antarctic expeditions lasting 13 to 24 days each from
November to March, and Quark Expeditions of Darien, Conn., will
circumnavigate the Arctic Ocean beginning July 1.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fares for the Antarctic cruises begin at $3,495 a person in
double occupancy and include round-trip flights from New York,
Miami, Montreal and Toronto to Ushuaia, a two-night hotel stay in
Buenos Aires, a night in Ushuaia, lectures, shore excursions and
eight nights aboard one of three ice-class-rated vessels.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Arctic Ocean trip will go around most of Greenland. It will
be broken into four segments ranging from 12 to 19 nights and will
offer travelers a choice of one, two, three or all segments. The
first part of the trip begins in Longyearbyen, Norway, and ends in
Sondre Strom-fjord, Greenland. From there the cruise heads to
Resolute in Canada before heading westward through the Northwest
Passage to Provideniya, Russia. The final segment takes the
Northeast Passage back to Longyearbyen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fares range from $8,250 a person in double occupancy (for one
segment) to $36,790 (for four) and include hotel stays before and
after each segment, lectures, shore excursions and accommodations
on the Russian-built icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov. Those who sign
up for two or three segments receive a 5 percent discount. &QL;

   &UR; Thanksgiving at Plymouth, 377 Years Later &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the autumn of 1621, 51 Pilgrims and 90 Indians in the colony
of Plymouth held the three-day harvest feast now known as the first
Thanksgiving. This year both the town of Plymouth and Plimoth
Plantation, the living-history museum that recreates daily life in
the 17th-century colony, will have Thanksgiving celebrations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving Day in Plymouth, an hour south of Boston by car,
a Pilgrim's Progress will re-enact a procession of pilgrims from
the Mayflower Society Museum (which is closed for the season) at 4
Winslow Street to Burial Hill on School Street, where a prayer and
hymn service will take place from 10 a.m. to noon. An Indian rally
observing a Day of Mourning for the European settlement of North
America begins at noon on Cole's Hill and will be followed by a
march through Plymouth. Hourly, from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., Colonial
Lantern Tours, (508) 830-0230, is offering 90-minute walking tours
highlighting Plymouth's Pilgrim heritage ($8, children $6). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since Thanksgiving did not become a national holiday until 1863,
visitors to Plimoth Plantation will see the costumed interpreters
going about their normal farm and household chores, such as salting
cod and thatching two new dwellings. All three seatings of this
year's Victorian Thanksgiving Dinner and Thanksgiving Day Buffet
are sold out, but visitors can get snacks, including clam chowder
and turkey sandwiches ($4 each), in the Courtyard Celebration at
the Visitors Center. Reservations for 1999 Thanksgiving dinners can
made beginning next Aug. 1. Call (508) 746-1622, extension 366
(prices have not been set). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plimoth Plantation, open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., closes for the
season on Nov. 29 and will reopen on March 27. Admission to the
1627 Pilgrim Village and Mayflower II, a full-scale reproduction of
the Mayflower, is $18.50, $11 ages 6 to 12. Children under 6 are
free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information about all Thanksgiving week events in Plymouth is
available from Destination Plymouth, (800) 872-1620, or at

THE BOSS' RARE STUFF IN A BOXED SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, it's about the scope of one man's ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen wanted to do everything. He wanted to be the
Dust Bowl balladeer with the guitar on his back and the great
post-Elvis, post-Buddy Holly, American heartland rocker. He wanted
to be the guy who played the hot guitar solo and danced with the
girls in the front row, who spun wild, romantic Dylanesque stories
with characters with names like Zero and Blind Terry. And the guy
who sang the big, dramatic love songs, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, his talent was equal to the task. He really could
write sweeping generation-defining rock songs and slice-of-life
miniatures about broken-hearted single moms and Rust Belt families
loading up and moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Proof is captured on ``Tracks,'' his just-released 66-track
boxed set of demos, unreleased songs, alternate versions and
B-sides. One walks away from these CDs with the same sort of awe
one felt when encountering, say, ``Rosalita'' or ``Jungleland'' for
the first time. Spread over four CDs, and lasting more than four
glorious hours, ``Tracks'' is the treasure trove of unheard/rarely
heard/nearly forgotten Bruce material fans have been salivating
for: All (well, almost all) the songs we'd been hearing rumors
about for more than 20 years are here, from the savagely angry Rust
Belt rock of ``Roulette'' to the perfect celebration of Saturday
night that is ``Where the Bands Are'' to the great shaggy-dog tale
``Zero and Blind Terry.''
</P>
<P>
   The amazement one feels after taking all this in is not just
from the quality of the music, which is frequently superb.
``Tracks'' shows as well as any of the studio CDs Springsteen's
ability to age gracefully: Unlike almost everyone else making rock
'n' roll at age 49, he hasheld onto his eye for detail, his sense
of humor and his commitment to chronicling the large and small
details of American lives. Plus, he finally has committed to CD a
slew of terrific '80s B-sides like the gorgeous ``Be True'' and the
brisk rockabilly of ``Stand On It.''
</P>
<P>
   All of it is extremely worthwhile, but it is the first two CDs
that provide the biggest thrills. In the heady days of records such
as ``Born to Run'' and ``The River,'' Springsteen was hungrier, a
star on the East Coast and a supernova to watch for everywhere
else. In the mixture of the folkier, character-rich stories such as
1973's ``Bishop Danced'' and the full-throttle rockers such as
``Thundercrack'' and ``Restless Nights,'' Springsteen found his
most satisfying, wide-ranging voice. One hears echoes of ``West
Side Story'' in the characters and the street action, Roy Orbison
in the love songs and, everywhere, a great bar band playing the
best show of its life.
</P>
<P>
   Graced with excellent playing from saxophonist Clarence Clemons,
organist Danny Federici and pianist Roy Bittan, these songs have
the ring of classic Springsteen of the period. They are Americana
in the way Hank Williams is, classic blue-collar rock before the
term became hackneyed, with all the great drama of a John Ford
movie or one of Elvis' classic early singles.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Springsteen narrowed his scope a bit; the city boy
moved to the country, saw life in harder terms as the factories
stayed closed and the friends moved away. But there was still
plenty of humor and romance _ check ``Cynthia,'' his paean to an
unknown beauty that passes his way every day, or ``Frankie,'' a
seven-minute, Van Morrison-ish masterwork of seduction, to hear
examples of both. The songs on the second two discs are more often
about realistic, less broadly romantic one-on-one relationships.
Even as he grew up and struggled through various love affairs _ as
his core audience was doing at the time, too _ he still kept in
touch with the hard economic realities of the period and his New
Jersey environs.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of these four CDs it's possible to see ``Tracks'' as
the best of both worlds: A great stockpile of the stuff that, for
whatever reason, never made it to the studio records, and an
overview of his entire career and all that he brought to American
rock 'n' roll. Aside from a few small quibbles (e.g., skimpy liner
notes), this is just about perfect, an embarrassment of riches and
easily one of the great boxed sets. For once, Christmas really has
come early.

   If you insist on perfection, here is what I have learned after
roasting 40 turkeys in search of it: You must brine the turkey in
salt water the night before, and rotate it during roasting.
</P>
<P>
   A salt-water brine helps the turkey retain its juices and
pleasantly seasons it from the skin right down to the bone. It's a
simple process: dissolve two cups kosher salt (or one and a half
cups table salt) in two gallons of water in a clean bucket or large
stockpot.
</P>
<P>
   When the salt dissolves, drop in the turkey and refrigerate it
overnight. When you are ready to roast, remove it from the brine,
give it a quick rinse, and pat it dry.
</P>
<P>
   I have found a small bird, 12 to 14 pounds, tends to cook more
evenly and stays juicier. After the turkey has been rinsed, brush
the breast with melted butter, place it breast side down on a
V-shaped rack over a pan, then brush the back with butter. Roast in
a 400-degree oven for 45 minutes. Remove the turkey from the oven,
baste it with butter, and with a large wad of paper towels in each
hand, turn the turkey, wing up, and roast for 20 minutes. Remove
the turkey from the oven, baste again, and then turn the turkey so
that the other wing is up; roast for another 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the turkey again, baste, and turn it breast side up.
Roast until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 170 to 175
degrees in the leg-thigh area or when juices run clear when thigh
is pricked, 30 to 45 minutes. (The breast should register 160 to
165 degrees.)
</P>
<P>
   Larger turkeys (16 to 22 pounds) require a slightly different
technique. After its salt water bath, brush the breast with melted
butter, place it breast side down on a V-rack, then brush the back
with butter. Roast in a 250-degree oven for three hours, basting
the back every hour. Remove the turkey from the oven and, with a
large wad of paper towels in each hand, turn the turkey, breast
side up; roast an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees and roast until the
skin has browned and a meat thermometer registers 170 to 175
degree. For more than 22 pounds, you're on your own. &QL;

PARENTS OF DEAD BOY LOSE CASE AGAINST GUN MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ In a closely watched lawsuit, the parents of
a Berkeley teen-ager who was unintentionally killed by a friend's
handgun lost their bid to force a gun company to install safety
locks on all future weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Dix, whose 15-year-old son, Kenzo, was unintentionally
killed by a friend in 1994, was crestfallen when the jury ruled
against her Monday in the product liability suit she brought
against Beretta USA Corp. But she said she wasn't surprised and
that her will to continue fighting for safety locks on guns had
only been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new concept for people that guns _ which are so
dangerous and designed to kill _ can actually be made safer,'' she
said after the verdict was announced. ``The jury saw that the
person who bought and the person who used the gun were totally
negligent, and that's true. But the gun manufacturer has a
responsibility too. If there were safety mechanisms, they could
have prevented it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenzo Dix was killed four years ago by a 14-year-old friend, who
fired his father's unlocked 9mm semi-automatic handgun in play,
thinking it was empty.
</P>
<P>
   The friend had removed a loaded clip from the pistol before he
pulled the trigger, but a bullet remained in the chamber and killed
the Berkeley High School freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn and Griffin Dix had been seeking $7.5 million in
compensatory damages from Beretta, claiming the company's failure
to install an internal lock on its guns made it liable for Kenzo's
death. In a separate lawsuit, the Dixes settled with the friend's
father, Clarence Soe, for $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday morning, after a three-week trial and three days of
deliberation, the Alameda County Superior Court jury sided in favor
of Beretta. The decision in the landmark case could herald an
uphill battle for a spate of pending lawsuits against gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragic accident,'' said Robert Gebhardt, the lead
lawyer for Beretta. ``Everybody, including myself, was upset about
what happened to this boy and his family. But given the evidence,
and the law as presented by the judge, I think the jury did the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Bell, a member of the jury and a retired pastor from
Oakland, said the plaintiffs just hadn't made a compelling enough
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarence Soe left a loaded gun ready to fire in an unlocked
case in an open bedroom with no lock on the door. That was gross
negligence,'' he said. ``I don't think there's anything a company
can do if the owner is negligent. There's a mood in the country
that we'd like corporations to protect us from ourselves, but they
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dixes had argued the gun should have been designed with a
built-in safety device that would have prevented unauthorized users
from firing it, or alerted a user that a live round was in the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt argued that external locking devices are cheap and
easily available and that it was Soe's responsibility to install
one.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the jury was convinced that, in this case, even a
built-in lock would not have saved Kenzo Dix because there was a
bullet in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Gorovitz, the lawyer for the Dix family and legal director
for the Trauma Foundation at San Francisco General Hospital,
acknowledged that most external locks couldn't be activated with a
bullet in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gorovitz argued, Beretta should have built its guns
with locking devices that worked even with a round in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like this gun owner want the thing chamber-loaded, and
that's why they don't use other locks,'' he said. ``Our point is
you need to design locks for the way people actually use their
guns. If we didn't make that clear to the jury, that's probably why
they didn't rule in our favor. I'm very distressed to hear that.''

TEST KITCHEN: TAKING TURKEY'S TEMPERATURE

<P>
   When roasting turkey, some people prefer to wing it, relying on
a ballpark feeling for doneness. Others _ especially on major
holidays _ want precision. They want to know exactly what they're
getting and when they're getting it. And beyond the big day, they
want to keep track of subtle differences, so they can modify
temperatures a few degrees each time until they achieve perfection.
</P>
<P>
   For this, of course, they need a meat thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   Most meat thermometers are fairly accurate and vary only by two
or three degrees. Their ease of use, though, varies widely. I tried
instant read thermometers, which cannot remain in the oven, and
oven thermometers, which are inserted in the thickest part of the
meat at the beginning of cooking. And in the spirit of
Thanksgiving, I tried them out on a plain roasted turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoffritz meat and poultry thermometer, $9.99 at Zabar's,
2245 Broadway (80th Street), (212) 787-2000, and the Taylor basic
meat dial thermometer, $5.98 at Zabar's, both oven thermometers,
were clunky and difficult to read. They have thick shafts that left
holes so large the turkey looked like it had been shot, and the
thermometers were so top heavy I had to push them far down in the
meat just so they wouldn't fall out.
</P>
<P>
   The other oven thermometer, made by Polder, is a digital unit
that sits on a counter top or, with its magnet back, sticks on the
oven door. It has a thin metal wire that stretches to a long, thin
metal probe, which is inserted into the meat in the oven. It has
nifty features, beyond giving continuous temperature readings
without the cook having to open the oven door, like a timer and an
alarm that will sound when the desired temperature is reached. It
worked well and was very easy to read, but I found the wire
cumbersome, especially when it came time for basting. One wrong
move and the digital unit could topple to the floor, a pricey loss
_ it's $21.99 at the Vinegar Factory, 431 East 91st St. (York
Avenue), (212) 987-0885.
</P>
<P>
   Instant read thermometers can be troublesome, too. The Taylor
classic one-inch dial model, $9.98 at Zabar's, is the thermometer
that many chefs use. It is small and accurate and usually comes
with a clip to attach to a shirt _ you can be armed and at the
ready on Thanksgiving Day. And the shaft is thin, so you can test
the meat in several places without making it look like Swiss
cheese. But it takes about 45 seconds to give a reading _ so you
have either to take the roasting pan out of the oven entirely or to
stand there with the oven door open while the oven loses heat.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the least professional-looking thermometer _
Maverick's Redi-Chek electronic food probe _ proved to be the
easiest to use. Though it has a long shaft, which can be inserted
in the meat, it is only the quarter-inch metal tip that measures
the temperature. This allows you to pinpoint the center of the meat
and know that exactly that point will be measured.
</P>
<P>
   It also works the most quickly of the instant read thermometers.
You open the oven door, insert the thermometer, wait five seconds,
press a button, wait another two or three seconds and, when it
beeps, the temperature pops up on the digital display. The
thermometer can then be removed and the oven door shut, and the
reading will remain on the thermometer. Its only useless feature is
a bar at the bottom of the digital display, which reads ``medium,''
``medium-well'' and so on. (I'll avoid the temperature debate here,
but whatever point you deem correct, remember that turkey continues
to cook once it's out of the oven, so take it out when the
thermometer reads a few degrees below that.) The Redi-Chek is
$19.95 at Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome St. (Wooster Street),
(212) 966-3434.
</P>
<P>
   Testing these thermometers in a deep pan of 180-degree water
revealed another characteristic worth considering. First, I dipped
them just a half-inch into the water, then three inches. The two
instant read thermometers were not sensitive enough at the tip _
they gave a reading 20 degrees below what it was, which means that
when you insert them into a turkey, they may read the internal
temperature as lower than it is. This explained why, when I tested
them on a roasted pork tenderloin, which is only about an inch and
a half thick, they had such low readings, while the Redi-Chek
digital indicated the pork was done. And it was done.
</P>
<P>
   I put the thermometers to one last test: the drop. Thermometers
so often roll off counter tops, it seemed worth testing their
durability. I dropped each from counter-top height onto a tile
floor. The glass in the Hoffritz dial cracked straight down the
middle and a piece of plastic broke off the Polder. The others
survived unscathed. Again, the Redi-Chek has an edge. It lies flat
on your counter, so it can't roll off.

   NEW YORK _ Like a puff of smoke, Pearson's Texas Barbecue, the
only authentic barbecue pit in this city, will fade and vanish by
the end of the year. The smoke, in fact, is part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's, situated for almost seven years in the shadow of a
huge Con Edison smokestack (paradoxically perhaps) in Long Island
City, Queens, is being evicted. Its building, at 5-16 51st Ave.,
was sold earlier this year, and the new landlord, D&AMP;E Electrical
Contractors, which is housed next door to the restaurant, was not
able to work out a lease agreement with Pearson's.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Goldberg, the owner of Pearson's, said she might have been
able to extend the existing lease with a court fight but conceded
that the restaurant also had a continual problem with smoke, an
inescapable byproduct of authentic pit-cooked barbecue. The city's
Department of Environmental Protection received numerous complaints
over the years about the smoke and aromas from Pearson's, Ms.
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, they said you had to comply by a certain date, or you
have to get out,'' she said. Over the years, Pearson's had paid
fines, she said, but was unable to solve the smoke problem. With
just 20 seats, plus a small picnic area, Pearson's was too small to
invest in an elaborate exhaust system, which Ms. Goldberg said
would have cost a minimum of $30,000 and would have had high
maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Olynik, the owner of D&AMP;E, knows all about the smoke. ``It's
like a wood-burning monster back there,'' he said. ``The smoke
would come into our building, especially at night. We had to cover
all the windows and doors in plastic and duct tape, and workers
still complained.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Olynik said, ``I love the food _ it's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg said she hoped Pearson's would be able to reopen in
Manhattan next year. She is currently scouting sites in Greenwich
Village that would be big enough to justify investing in expensive
exhaust equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even considering NOT doing that in Manhattan,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, when Pearson's was known as Stick to Your
Ribs, it opened a restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue near 81st Street,
but the restaurant did not try to cook there, trucking in its
barbecue from Queens instead. The Amsterdam Avenue restaurant
closed after a fire in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   What about the impending loss of Pearson's superb smoky beef
brisket?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's further support for the notion that New York is
an abysmal barbecue town,'' said Ed Levine, one of Pearson's fans
and the author of ``New York Eats'' (St. Martin's Griffin, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leff, who lives in Queens and whose book, ``The Eclectic
Gourmet Guide to Greater New York City,'' has just been published
by Menasha Ridge Press, had a brighter view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing it makes me think of is the trend of Queens
places going to Manhattan,'' Leff said. ``On the other hand, it's
OK because it would cut down on the bridge-and-tunnel crowd in
Queens.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ It's almost always possible to write that a U.S.
presidential trip to Japan comes at a delicate moment in the two
nations' relations. This time it has the added merit of being true.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton begins a two-day visit Thursday, he will find deep
concern and misgivings not far behind the welcoming smiles of Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi, his besieged administration and his
dispirited populace.

   For the world's second-largest economy, heading into its fifth
year of financial stagnation and facing sharp internal political
challenge, is edgily uncertain about its own future and its

   There is geopolitical worry about Washington's fascination with
China, an immense undeveloped market and Japan's only rival for
regional dominance. Japan is still smarting from Clinton's decision
not to stop by either going to or from his ballyhooed trip to China
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And there is concern about the unceasing ``gaiatsu'' _ foreign
pressure _ that the Clinton administration is bringing to bear on
Japanese political and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been battered for more than a year with U.S. demands
to get its financial house in order and lead Asia out of economic
crisis. But even after almost $350 billion in economic stimulus
proposals in the last seven months there has been little
improvement in Japan's fiscal well-being and precious little
appreciation from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   That's a precarious position for Obuchi, who came to office
pledging, ``I will stake the life of my Cabinet on putting the real
economy on a recovery path.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, when Obuchi unveiled his latest plan _ a $196
billion dose of tax cuts, public works spending and merchandise
vouchers for the elderly and young families _ Vice President Al
Gore was in Asia demanding more from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region cannot recover without Japan boldly leading the
way,'' declared Gore in a speech that Clinton was to have delivered
if the Iraqi crisis had not kept him away from the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton picks up his tour with a Thursday-Friday stop in Japan
before going on to South Korea this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly the worst economic crisis in Japan since World
War II,'' a U.S. diplomat said. A senior U.S. politician who
visited Tokyo last week was shocked after detailed fiscal
briefings, saying: ``This economy is going down the tubes. The more
I see it, the more I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions over China and economic policy, the diplomat said,
add up to ``the uneasiest moment in U.S.-Japanese relations at
least since 1960'' when Japan's ruling conservatives overrode a
public outcry and signed a security pact with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have tried to set the stage for a harmonious meeting.
Clinton and Obuchi from their respective capitals Tuesday laid out
a new U.S.-Japan aid plan for Asia that focused on recapitalizing
the region's banks.
</P>
<P>
   But Obuchi is looking for a more personal embrace from the
leader of the only remaining superpower. In office only four
months, the prime minister's popularity has sunk, according to
polls, to near historic lows for a Japanese leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is in a deep funk,'' Yoichi Funabashi, chief diplomatic
correspondent of the newspaper Ashai Shimbun, writes in the current
issue of Foreign Affairs. ``Its economic debilitation, political
gridlock and rapidly aging population all contribute to a pervasive
pessimism and imperil its cherished identity as a non-nuclear,
non-weapon-exporting, economically dynamic, democratic, generous
civilian power. ... People genuinely fear for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Against that dire backdrop, Clinton's visit comes at a time of
deep division within Japan about fundamental issues of politics and
philosophy. At question is whether it is time for Japan to renew a
vibrant national political dialogue, which has been virtually
absent during the last four decades.
</P>
<P>
   That debate was essentially put on hold almost 40 years ago when
at the end of a bitter parliamentary wrangle, the Liberal
Democratic Party decided to align Japan irrevocably with the United
States in the Cold War. A kind of stagnant stability ensued, in
which Japan prospered financially but suffered a sort of political
emasculation.
</P>
<P>
   Motobumi Asai, a former Japanese diplomat who now teaches
international relations at Meiji Gakuin University, said the period
from 1960 to the present can be characterized as ``U.S. led, Japan
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a split among the senior U.S. strategists on what
effect a vigorous Japanese political debate would have on U.S.
interests. The camps break up into those who believe the United
States is better off with stability vs. those who believe the
United States cannot live with the inert political system that such
stability has produced.
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs that Japan has already begun to make its
decision. Voters last July denied the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party a majority in the upper house of the national legislature. It
was such a shocking loss that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Former diplomat Asai questions the ruling party's ability to
make any economic stimulus work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid to say it, but because of the incompetence of
Japanese conservative politics, I don't think they could come up
with a bold enough plan,'' Asai said. ``I am most fearful of the
debacle to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has been unstinting in his expressions of belief in
Japan's economic prowess.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when APEC met in Canada, Clinton declared, ``Japan
can lead Asia out of this (economic) difficulty with the strength
of its economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan has demurred, with Hashimoto, before he left office,
saying: ``We are not arrogant enough to see ourselves as a power in
Asia that can pull others up.''

   Ben Kass has visited about a dozen colleges this year, but Yale
was the one that most seemed like his future home. ``I felt like I
really fit in there,'' the Newton South (Mass.) High School senior
muses, recalling his two trips to the clubby New Haven, Conn.
campus. His mother, Ellen Kass, remembers that he even called her
from the railroad station. ``He told me, `If they would let me stay
right now, I'd do it,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't Ben Kass smiling as he sits at his kitchen table on
a recent afternoon? Especially after having sent his application to
Yale a few days earlier, thereby placing himself squarely among the
school's early-decision pool?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I wanted to apply early or I was forced into
it,'' laments the 17-year-old, whose grade point average is 4.25
out of a possible 4.5. ``I can't even be sure anymore. But I do
know that everyone I know is applying early to college, and
everyone says you ought to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to November, seniors, once a time when a tiny number of
you rushed to send off early-admissions packets to a small number
of colleges. No more. A trio of early-admissions programs, one of
which can leave applicants little choice but to attend the chosen
school, now keeps tens of thousands of you _ and your parents _ up
late at night, laboring over lengthy application forms and
gotta-be-perfect essays long before the last falling leaf hits the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be only the cream of the crop that applied early,''
points out Kim O'Byrne, a guidance counselor at Wellesley High
School, where about 40 percent of last year's seniors filed early
applications. ``But now that pool includes kids who might be
marginal candidates for a particular school. They feel that by
applying early, they're sending a message to a school that they
really want to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   It also used to be _ as far back as the 1960s _ that only the
Ivies and a few other top Eastern colleges offered early admission.
But during the current academic year, 410 colleges from Palo Alto,
Calif., to Unity, Maine, have either ``early decision'' or ``early
action'' plans, according to the College Board. That's an increase
of 23 percent over last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the College Board in 1996 introduced an October
session of the SAT, in large part to accommodate seniors planning
to apply to college in November instead of waiting for the normal
Jan. 1 deadline. About 365,000 students took the new test that
year, and the number swelled to an estimated 400,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Curran a 17-year-old senior at The Pingree School &UR;  &LR; in
Hamilton, Mass. who began visiting colleges more than a year ago,
is applying early to Middlebury College. Her deadline arrives
today.
</P>
<P>
   To have it any other way, she feels, would leave her at a
disadvantage. ``It's just the general belief that your chances are
better of getting into college if you apply early,'' she says. ``If
I hadn't fallen in love with Middlebury, I would have applied
somewhere else now, because I feel there's a lot of pressure to
apply early. Everyone feels their chances are better if they apply
early.''
</P>
<P>
   When, say, Ben Kass calculates his chances of being admitted to
Yale, it doesn't matter that he's an advanced placement calculus
student, because the math is simple: Although slightly more than a
third of this year's freshman class at Yale applied early, those
particular students represented only one-ninth of all applicants.
Highly regarded Massachusetts schools such as Amherst, MIT, Tufts,
and Williams typically fill a similar slice of their admissions pie
with early applicants (see chart). At Harvard, the figure is even
higher, around 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools deny that they have different standards for early
and regular applicants, arguing that the early birds tend to be
more qualified. But who's listening?
</P>
<P>
   And so, the heat is on. Horace Simmonds, 18, is a B-plus student
at Winchester (Mass.) High School whose senior year is starting off
with a quartet of top courses and several hours of homework a
night. He also works 15 hours a week at a local mailbox company. He
has taken the SATs twice this fall, and has labored mightily over a
600-word essay that was part of his early application to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Simmonds is still trying to visit other colleges on weekends,
should Brown reject him. ``I want to get the relief of knowing I'm
going somewhere,'' he says of his decision to apply in early
November. ``But right now, it's very hard. The hours are turning
into days.''
</P>
<P>
   Early-admission procedures have quickened the pace of adolescent
lives. Some kids are taking their first SATs as early as the fall
of their junior year, rather than waiting until spring. Many now
begin their road trips to prospective colleges during the spring of
their junior year instead of the following summer. And, as is the
case with Simmonds, the beginnings of their long-awaited senior
years are being filled with the rush to assemble applications,
collect recommendations, and compose essays _ not to mention taking
more SATs and perhaps adding another campus overnight or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are already under a lot of pressure these days, and
adding this on top of it doesn't do them any favors,'' says Dale
Eldridge, whose son, Dan, is an early applicant to Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But the wrinkle that really raises the pressure is the one that
is part and parcel of ``early decision'': A student can apply early
to only one college and agrees to enroll there if admitted.
Translation: Don't tell the college of your choice six months from
now that you've changed your mind about where you'd like to spend
what will likely be the most important four years of your young
life. Never mind that if you commit now, you probably won't know
what kind of financial aid you'll receive until next spring.

 UNDATED: ... next spring.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``As one of my wise old associate deans says, `Be careful of
early decision, because you might get in,''' says Bill Hiss, vice
president for administrative services at Bates College _ and a
self-described believer in early decision.
</P>
<P>
   Are teenagers ready to irrevocably choose a college nearly a
year before they actually go there? Matthew Lynch thinks he is, and
so the Pingree senior has made an early-decision application to
Duke after starting out last spring with a list of likely colleges
that totaled 50. His father, George, who in March helped him visit
11 Southern schools in 10 days, a trip that covered some 2,200
miles, agrees with his decision. ``I can't imagine him changing his
mind,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Linda Lynch, Matthew's mother, isn't so certain. Sitting
with her husband and only child at the dining room table one recent
evening, she voices her concern, over tea and homemade apple crumb
cake. ``He's a mature and responsible kid,'' she says of her son, a
B student who felt strongly that he wanted to make his college
selection early so he could go about the business of his senior
year in high school. ``But he's still a kid. And I worry that come
March, when this friend is going to college here and that friend is
going to college there, that he's going to wish he were someplace
other than Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits to colleges of an early, binding arrangement are
significant. For one thing, they lock up a sizable chunk of next
year's freshman class early in the game. For another, the schools'
``yield'' _ the percentage of kids admitted to a particular school
who actually enroll there _ is increased, an important factor in
college rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But some college administrators are troubled by the increasing
pressure that's being put on high school kids. ``The down side is
simply that these young men and women are still growing and
changing rapidly at this time of their lives,'' says Harry Payne,
president of Williams College. ``And gee, a year is a long time in
a young adult's life.''
</P>
<P>
   A student admitted under early decision can usually wriggle free
of the commitment only if the finanicial aid package he or she is
offered is insufficient. And colleges take a dim view of students
who apply for an early decision to more than one school. The
institutions involved invariably withdraw their offers of
acceptance in such cases, admissions officers say. In order to
ferret out miscreants, 30 to 40 independent schools, such as
Amherst, Williams, Wesleyan, and Dartmouth, share lists of the high
school seniors they admit by early decision.
</P>
<P>
   For Patrick English, a senior at Boston College High School, the
final decision between two schools was not easy. A top student and
captain of his cross-country team, English is a highly organized
kid who had decided even before entering high school that he
eventually wanted to apply early to college. Using a lined
notebook, he organized his possible choices this year into a kind
of tournament, complete with quarterfinalists, semifinalists, and
finalists. Then he meticulously listed the advantages and
disadvantages of his top two contenders, Dartmouth and the
University of Virginia. The former, for example, had a beautiful
campus but lousy weather. The latter offered friendly folks but had
some dorm rooms that were not air-conditioned. At times, Lynch
leaned toward Hanover, N.H. At others, he liked Charlottesville.
Meanwhile, the November deadline loomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I said to him, `Don't do this. Give
yourself more time,''' says Patrick's mother, Sally English. ``It's
so different now than when I went to college. It's part of the
whole accelerated pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick English eventually applied to the University of Virginia
_ ``I closed my eyes and I could see myself there'' _ and mailed
off his application 10 days early. He says he's comfortable about
his choice, and about making it now rather than later. ``I've just
always felt this need to apply early, to not have this ultimate
decision hanging over my head,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For some kids, however, the pressure of early application is
more than they want. Lauren Silva, ranked 20th in a Braintree
(Mass.) High School senior class of more than 300 students, would
not have been out of place in an early-application pool. She
visited eight colleges this year, especially liked Connecticut
College, and was prepared to apply early. ``I thought: `Everyone
else is going early, and if I don't I'll miss out,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But Silva changed her mind. She decided she wanted more time to
take her SATs again to improve her scores. She wanted more time to
work on her applications and her essays. And she wanted more time
to choose a college because, as she puts it, ``Whenever I visit a
school, I love it. I love them all.'' Says her mother, Helaine
Silva: ``She just wasn't ready. I'm pleased she's waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, however, more and more kids will be applying to
college early. And earlier. Wake Forest University, in
Winston-Salem, N.C., has an admissions option called ``early
decision single choice,'' whereby a student can apply any time
after the completion of his or her junior year in high school and
receive a decision within weeks. If accepted, the applicant must
agree to attend, meaning a college can be chosen some 14 months
before enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Too much too soon? Not to 17-year-old Meredith Katter, who
applied to Wake Forest in July, was accepted _ and made a
commitment _ during the first week of her senior year at
Lincoln-Sudbury (Mass.) Regional High School. ``Just getting the
whole thing out of the way was my main reason,'' Katter explains.
``All my friends are applying now, but I have it off my shoulders.
Wake Forest was a school I liked, but knowing that this was an
option definitely attracted me more.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ben Kass _ assuming he is accepted on or about Dec. 15, when
most early applicants begin to get the word from colleges _ Yale
may turn out to be the perfect choice. Maybe he'll like the
challenging academics, the friendly students, and even the jokes
about Harvard as much as he does now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a place I could be happy at,'' Kass declares as
he ponders the early commitment he's made and the push to get it
done, ``even if a month after I've been there I decide that UPenn
is really where I should have gone.''

WORKPLACE `DRAMEDY' IS INTROSPECTIVE, COMPLEX; NO WONDER NO ONE'S
WATCHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging by ``Sports Night's'' less-than-stellar ratings, a
number of TV viewers apparently don't grasp what its creators are
trying to do. Neither comedy nor drama, this tightly focused and
deliciously entertaining series about the inner workings of a cable
sports program is a small-screen anomaly: a dramedy with a
subversive smirk of self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the networks have pretty much given up on
programming that mixes emotional complexity, a wry sense of humor
and intellectual content. ``Sports Night'' actually shoves all this
into a mere half-hour. Just as glorious _ and, to some, as jarring
_ is its tendency to downplay that ill-placed laugh track or even
eliminate it. It's enough to make a viewer wonder if they've
stumbled upon something written by castaways from HBO's ``The Larry
Sanders Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Sports Night's'' true attraction lies in its dazzling and
often dizzying writing, which sets up the professional lives of
Cable Sports Center's employees _ their doubts, egos, insecurities,
and their overriding need to talklikethis in short, quick, punchy
sentences. It's as though they can't distinguish between real life
and the McNugget-style delivery of broadcast news.
</P>
<P>
   You should know the setup by now. ``Sports Night'' is ESPN's
acerbic ``SportsCenter'' in dramatic form. Produced by film scribe
Alan Sorkin (''The American President,'' ``A Few Good Men'')
``Sports Night'' zeros in on two anchors (Peter Krause as Casey,
Josh Charles as Dan) who report on athletic events while spewing
witticisms behind their desks, in meetings, in the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   These guys bleed sports, but they're not the couch-bound,
chip-munching slobs usually portrayed. They care. They're anchors,
but not pretty boys with nothing at the top of the mountain.
They're introspective, analytical, idealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity Huffman is Dana, the firm, fire-breathing producer who
can be both motherly and off-putting in the same sentence. Smart as
a whip and gorgeous, she's a double threat, in demographic terms.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Guillaume is Issac, the show's level-headed executive
producer who serves as referee and sits in his huge office
grumbling about ``cutting 17 million from the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Malina as Jeremy is, so far, the most appealing of the
crew, a producer and un-people person _ he's a research analyst
with a degree in applied mathematics. This explains his skills in
locating a co-worker's computer password. ``How many six-letter
words could there be?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Dana: ``Uh, 5,000?''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy: ``Fourteen thousand, two-hundred and change.'' He got it
on the 38th try.
</P>
<P>
   The password belonged to Natalie (Sabrina Lloyd), the sharp,
wide-eyed producer's assistant; they have a thing for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Sports Night'' never leaves the workplace, these
liaisons are inevitable (Dana and Casey are dancing a similar
romantic tango). How the writers can keep the proceedings engaging
while stuck in this fishbowl will be a challenge. (Not that it
can't be done: Those guys on ``Barney Miller'' hardly ever went
home.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's working. In fact, ``Sports Night'' offered one of
the most dramatic episodes of any series this season when the gang
butted heads over whether to do an interview with a football
superstar who grabbed Natalie during a locker room interview and
then exposed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Dana blackmails the guy, forcing him to agree to discuss a
sexual harassment incident in exchange for Natalie not pressing
charges. It's a coup for a third-place show. But as air time
approached, they all had to check their ethical radar.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson of ethics and ambition involved Jeremy, who
agreed to produce an edition of a hunting show _ although he had
deep qualms about killing animals. I could go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   As for the verbal aerobics, ``Sports Night'' is fond of
quick-hit banter and long speeches. This is where they must be
careful. The rat-ta-tat-tat rhythm is best enjoyed when you've
taped the show and have the luxury of rewinding. Otherwise, you
certainly missed Josh, Casey and Dana discussing blue margaritas at
a club named El Perro Fumando:
</P>
<P>
   Josh: ``El Perro Fumando?''
</P>
<P>
   Dana: ``The flaming dog ...''
</P>
<P>
   Casey: ``Smoking dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana: ``Not the flaming dog?''
</P>
<P>
   Casey: ``Dog's not gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana: ``I wasn't suggesting the dog was gay. I was suggesting
the dog was on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey: ``He's not smoking on fire. He's smoking a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   In come others: ``He's smoking a pipe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smoking a cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I say he's gay.''
</P>
<P>
   This makes ``Sports Night'' a different monster, but sometimes
the rapid-fire exchanges go on too long, and the show's general
earnestness often dwindles into cliched speeches and contrived
moral dilemmas. The pilot episode, in fact, was splendid until
Casey became unbearably mushy at its climax.
</P>
<P>
   My guess about the show's lackluster ratings is partly that
viewers are conditioned to expect a joke-heavy sitcom and partly
that it has a tough time slot. And viewers may have a lack of
patience for a series that doesn't make its motives clear.
</P>
<P>
   Many people I've talked with say they kinda like it, but the
series doesn't ``grab'' them. I suspect the absence of the
quick-striking ba-da-boom of jokes is what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   To me, one of the blessings of ``Sports Night'' is that
producers Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme (he directed episodes of ``The
Larry Sanders Show)'' allow their characters to express more than
TV's usual narrow range of hyped-up emotion. People here hesitate
and consider things. They acknowledge ambivalence and express
doubt. They ``think.''
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing concept, don't you think?

`ALAMO DIARY' CHALLENGING WAY CROCKETT DIED TO GO ON SALE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Pena) 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hand-written memoir of a Mexican officer, whose eye-witness
account of Davy Crockett's death challenges the time-honored, but
romanticized, version of the Alamo's capture, will be sold to the
highest bidder Wednesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   An auction catalog values the manuscript and associated
documents _ about 700 pages in all _ at $200,000 to $300,000, but a
spokesman for the Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield auction house described
that range as conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, ``With Santa Anna in Texas: A Personal Narrative of
the Revolution,'' Jose Enrique de la Pena, a junior officer in the
Mexican army, reported that Crockett was among seven Alamo
defenders executed after the fortress was stormed March 6, 1836.
</P>
<P>
   The book's authenticity has been challenged by historians and
others who believe Crockett fought to the death in the 13-day
siege, wielding his long-rifle, Betsy, like a bloody club.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work was written while de la Pena was imprisoned for
opposing the Mexican government in the late 1830s. It first was
published in Spanish in 1955 and in English 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Shaw, the auction company's vice president and director of
books and manuscripts, said scrutiny of watermarks on the
manuscript's pages indicates the paper was manufactured in Portugal
during the early 19th century. That finding, he said, lends
credence to historians who argue the work is not a 20th-century
forgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a forgery, there was one hell of a forger at work,''
said James Crisp, a North Carolina State University history
professor and leading proponent for the work's authenticity. ``I've
been completely convinced for several years that it is authentic
and legitimate. That doesn't mean that it's accurate, but only that
it is what it says it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisp, a native Texan, is author of the introduction of the
book's most recent English-language edition, published last year by
Texas A&AMP;M University Press.
</P>
<P>
   John Peace Jr., a University of Texas regent and avid collector
of Texana, purchased the fragile hand-written manuscript and
associated documents from the widow of a Mexican rare books dealer
in 1973. He died the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1970s, the manuscript had been on loan to the
University of Texas at San Antonio, where it had been the
centerpiece of the Peace Collection, which consists of some 900
books and 500 documents detailing almost 300 years of Texas
history.
</P>
<P>
   Peace's son, San Antonio rare books dealer John Peace III,
withdrew the diary and associated papers from the library last
year, contending that the university had not lived up to its
agreement with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that UTSA, you know, is the type of venue where
extensive research will occur,'' Peace said. ``In 25 years, there's
been no complete translation. Only about a third of it has been
translated. There also has been some concern about handling.''
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with his mother, Peace said he opted to put the
material up for sale through Cheever Books, which he manages.
Although several collectors offered to buy the memoir, none was
willing to pay the $250,000 asking price, Peace said.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield approached Peace about arranging an
auction last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kelly, director of UTSA's John Peace Library, denied
that the manuscript, known as the ``Alamo Diary,''has been
neglected. ``Certainly not,'' he said. ``It has not been kept under
a barrel. Carmen Perry, the first translator, was a librarian on
our staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kelly opined, ``It's not a trophy piece like a letter
from Sam Houston or Davy Crockett. It's not something you put on
the wall. It's nothing particularly attractive. Not a display
piece. Not the Magna Carta. It's a very important document, but
inaccessible. Hard to read. Pretty fragile shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the original no longer is in the library's collection,
Kelly said researchers still may read it on microfilm or computer.
And although discussions have been held about the possibility of
buying the material, Kelly said it is uncertain whether the
University of Texas System will join in Wednesday's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield's Shaw said placing the manuscript and
related papers for auction has triggered a cascade of media
attention. ``We've never seen anything like it before. We didn't
anticipate this,'' he said. ``We didn't have the faintest idea what
we were in for.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the auction house has been contacted by the Today
Show, the Wall Street Journal, a Mexican television network and
several Texas newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective bidders include institutions and private collectors.
``We've had a few calls from London,'' he said. ``We don't know
what to make of it. We had a guy come down from Philadelphia who's
looking at it for his own collection. I can't talk about who he is,
but he has a lot of money. We'd like to see Texas step up to the
plate and take care of things.''
</P>
<P>
   While the decision to sell the memoir at auction has stirred
controversy in library circles, that conflict pales when compared
to the storm stirred by the the manuscript's contents.
</P>
<P>
   Since first published in English in 1975, de la Pena's work has
been roundly criticized by academics and the public alike.
Historian Crisp suggested that largely is because it challenges the
mythic version of the Alamo's fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``All cultures have myths,'' he said. ``It's a story repeated
over and over again. The action of the stories, the villains and
heroes carry a lot of weight. It's not so much whether Davy
Crockett died at this time or five minutes later, it's that he
willingly laid down his life so that others might live and
prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Pena's assertion that Crockett did not die in glorious
battle is supported by letters from a Galveston camp for Mexican
war prisoners and by an account from Santa Anna's personal
secretary, Crisp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As historians,'' Crisp said, ``we don't simply repeat stories
that feel good. We look as closely as we can at the fragmentary
evidence. We sort through all the contradictions, the lies,
propaganda, false stories and rumors and try to say, `OK, here's
the evidence we have.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just stick to the heroic view of American history, we
can come to think that we're now living in the worst of times,'' he
added. ``We will have a false view of what those real people were
really like.''

SELF-CLEANING TOILETS A HIT IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The French company that makes self-cleaning
public toilets likes San Francisco. It's a city that flushes.
</P>
<P>
   And San Francisco likes the toilets, with neighborhoods
clamoring for more.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, residents and visitors have flushed the
20 JCDecaux toilets in San Francisco 1.5 million times _ or, an
average of 86 times per day, per toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the statistics to be found in a review of the
city's contract with JCDecaux prepared by Harvey Rose, the Board of
Supervisors' budget analyst. The report analyzes proposed
amendments that would extend the contract with the French company
to 2016.
</P>
<P>
   The company has installed 20 toilets under a two-year trail
project that ends next year. It costs 25 cents to use the toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract, the Paris-based company provides the toilet,
and installs and maintains them at no charge to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, Mayor Willie Brown's press secretary, said the
mayor supports extending the contract for 18 more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels that the toilets are very popular and the program has
been very successful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Moy, manager of the Department of Public Works' Bureau
of Street Use and Mapping, said the agency considers the project a
success, based on the widespread use of the pots.
</P>
<P>
   Moy gave JCDecaux high marks for maintenance. She also applauded
the company for distributing 60,000 free tokens since the program
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty neighborhood groups are clamoring for the addition of
toilets,'' Moy said. ``People have been waiting for a long time to
get to the point where we could add more.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois Nion, senior vice president of JCDecaux San Francisco
Inc., said the city's flushing rate of was well ahead of European
cities, which average 50-60 flushes per day per toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Nion attributed the superior U.S. flush rate to climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to Germany or Sweden, where it's snowing a lot in
winter and it's getting dark very early, you don't have so many
usages, because people aren't staying outside,'' Nion said, noting
that use depends primarily on foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In San Francisco, the wintertime is pretty mild, so we have
good usage in the winter.''

 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The great American gift for invention meets its match
in the turkey, the great American bird. The turkey itself is not
the problem, it's the yawning chasm within, a black hole in the
culinary universe that somehow manages to absorb and deaden
anything that wanders near its force field, making ``stuffing''
synonymous with ``dry, volumetric bore, often tricked out with
oysters in a hopeless search for personality.''
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely solution to the stuffing crisis has emerged in an
unlikely place _ Nougatine, the cafe at Jean Georges, where a
savory, steaming square of bread pudding rounds out a dish of baked
poussin and roasted carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Within the bread pudding's custardy interior lurk surprises _ a
nugget of wild mushroom, a long seam of sauteed spinach, chewy
deposits of Swiss cheese, bits of leek and Swiss chard. A
sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on top gives a light crunch to each
bite. Within, it's all soft, fragrant comfort food.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the restaurant's executive chef, says
he thinks of the dish as cousin to the farinette, a traditional
omelet from the Auvergne region of central France, where a single
egg would be stretched with flour, mixed with milk and then cooked
like a pancake. Eaten with a chunk of cheese, it made a
workingman's afternoon meal.
</P>
<P>
   The farinette appears on the menu in the main dining room of
Jean Georges, wrapped around escargots and molten raclette.
</P>
<P>
   In the cafe, the farinette idea comes back down to earth, in a
form that Americans will have no trouble understanding. Hereabouts,
it's called stuffing _ or, technically, dressing, since it's not
actually inside the bird. And in late November, it doesn't take a
genius to know exactly what to do with it.

<P>
   As a child in France, I had heard that Thanksgiving was a feast
for family and friends, that it celebrated the harvest and that it
always included a turkey. It wasn't until I came to America nine
years ago that I realized that, to be a real Thanksgiving feast,
the turkey had to be accompanied by stuffing (preferably with
chestnuts), sweet potatoes (with or without marshmallows),
cranberry sauce (with or without nuts) and pumpkin pie. Of course,
we will have all those things on our Thanksgiving table, but this
year I'm adding a newcomer: my squash and fennel tartlets.
</P>
<P>
   I've been playing around with the idea for years. My original
thought was to have rounds of puff pastry spread with star anise
pastry cream and some candied fennel, and topped with lemon sorbet
and a few pistachio nuts. I'd occasionally mention the idea to
other French pastry chefs, and the response was always the same:
``It's too crazy. Forget it.'' But I couldn't get the idea out of
my head.
</P>
<P>
   This year, I thought I'd try out my dessert on an American
audience. Unfortunately, Test 1 was a flop _ the anise pastry cream
was too strong for the fennel, but without it the puff pastry and
fennel were too dry. Three tests later I thought of pumpkin pie,
and got the idea to use a butternut squash puree in place of the
pastry cream. Since I didn't want the usual spices that go into
pumpkin pie _ they, too, would overwhelm the fennel _ I selected
squash puree au naturel, mild, smooth and almost as rich and
buttery as the pastry cream it replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The squash was the right choice, but the tartlets lacked
acidity, a problem solved with the lemon sorbet and a splash of
lime juice in the puree. Then, just when I thought I was done, I
realized that the pistachio nuts were too bland.
</P>
<P>
   First, I toasted them; their flavor was better, but their color
was lost. Then I omitted them _ but the tart needed crunch.
Finally, I tossed them in egg white and sugar and baked them until
they were bumpy, crackly and lightly caramelized. Voila! Nuts with
looks, taste and enough crunch for the tart.
</P>
<P>
   Use store-bought puff pastry and sorbet _ the puree, fennel and
crunchy nuts will be child's play.
</P>
<P>
   SQUASH AND FENNEL TARTLETS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   \ cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 egg white
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup shelled and skinned pistachio nuts
</P>
<P>
   { pound packaged puff pastry
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 1 lemon, cut in broad strips
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 1 orange, cut in broad strips
</P>
<P>
   1 clove
</P>
<P>
   1 star anise
</P>
<P>
   2 small bulbs fennel, trimmed and cut into thin slices
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 butternut squash (about 1{ pounds), peeled, seeded and cut
into }-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   \ cup apple cider
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   2 cups lemon sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Line a baking sheet with
parchment paper. Place confectioners' sugar in a small bowl. Spoon
half the egg white onto a plate (discard other half). Toss
pistachios in egg white to coat them; then toss them in
confectioners' sugar until they are lightly coated and do not stick
together. Place nuts on baking sheet, and bake until they are brown
and start to crack. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   2. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees. On a lightly
floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry to [-inch thickness,
and cut into eight 4-inch circles. Place on a parchment-lined
baking sheet, and put a lightweight wire cooling rack on top of the
pastry to keep it from puffing too much. Bake until golden, 5 to 6
minutes. Cool to room temperature on a rack.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a large saucepan, combine sugar, lemon zest, orange zest,
clove and star anise with 1 cup of water. Place over high heat, and
bring to a boil. Turn off the heat, cover and allow mixture to rest
5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the zest and spices, and
return mixture to a boil. Add fennel, and reduce heat to
medium-low. Poach fennel until it is translucent, about 15 minutes.
Cool fennel in the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   4. While fennel is poaching, place a large skillet over medium
heat. Melt the butter, and add the squash. Saute until the squash
is very tender, about 15 minutes. Add the cider, and continue
stirring until cider evaporates. Transfer squash and pan juices to
container of a blender. Add lime juice, and process until mixture
is smooth.
</P>
<P>
   5. With a small spoon, hollow out the center of each pastry
round, leaving some pastry for a base. Fill each hollow with about
2 tablespoons of squash puree. Top with poached fennel, placing
some around edge of tartlet, then mounding some in center. Scatter
pistachio nuts on top of tartlet and around plate, and top each
tartlet with a small scoop of lemon sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings.

   Where French Fries Are the Main Course
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An eye-catching sign with a twirling ``B,'' designed
by Milton Glaser, announces B. Frites, 1657 Broadway (51st Street),
a Belgian-style french-fry shop that has just opened. Skel Islamaj,
who once cooked at Jean Georges, is behind this enterprise, in
partnership with Jordan Lewis, who is in the real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   Islamaj, a Belgian, fries his potatoes with special Belgian
equipment; the fries can then be slathered with Vandemoortele
mayonnaise, imported from Belgium, or a dozen or so other toppings.
He uses Marrist Piper potatoes, the closest to the Belgian Bintje
variety he prefers. Islamaj said that there will soon be enough
Bintjes grown commercially in the United States for him to make a
switch.
</P>
<P>
   The fries are as good as they look, golden and burnished, crisp
and greaseless, with a smooth texture and good potato taste. They
come in three sizes _ $2.25, $3.50 and $4.50 _ with free mustard,
ketchup and mayonnaise; special sauces, like mango-ketchup and
peanut, are 50 cents each.
</P>
<P>
   And to keep the fat on the fire, Pommes Frites, the shop in the
East Village that got the whole frites trend off the ground, has
rented the space at 724 Seventh Ave. (48th Street), which had been
occupied by New York French Fry. It expects to open its first
branch there Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Turkeys for the Needy
</P>
<P>
   A handsome 17-inch platter by Villeroy &AMP; Boch could show off
your Thanksgiving turkey and also provide a turkey for the needy.
The company is donating $12 of the $149 price of each platter to
Share Our Strength, the national organization that supports food
programs for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the turkeys will be donated to Food for Survival, a
food bank. Platters in the French Garden pattern are at Villeroy &AMP;
Boch stores and at Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   The Villeroy &AMP; Boch stores also have other patterns for which
the contribution will be made. The program will continue through
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to donate a turkey is by making a $10 contribution
to City Harvest's annual drive; the goal this year is 6,000
turkeys. The $10 (cash, check or supermarket gift certificate made
out to City Harvest Turkey Drive) buys one turkey. The address is
City Harvest, 159 W. 25th St., New York 10001.

<P>
   The memory of a brief conversation nags me whenever I think
about Asia's future. The conversation took place shortly after the
Tiananmen Square crackdown, during a secret meeting with a leader
of China's underground democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   We met in a quiet corner of a Beijing restaurant, where he
tapped the table suspiciously to see if it was bugged. This was a
man whose vision I admired, so I listened intently when the
waitress stepped away and he leaned forward to disclose his plans
for promoting human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kill Japanese,'' he said brightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kill Japanese businessmen. That'll scare them
so they won't invest here. And then the government will really be
screwed!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not serious?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're serious. We can't demonstrate these days and
we can't publish. The only thing we can do for democracy is kill
Japanese businessmen.''
</P>
<P>
   I protested that it seemed odd to promote human rights by
murdering innocent businessmen. But he just smiled at my
narrow-mindedness, with a ``you-will-never-understand-Asia'' grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're Japanese,'' my friend said dismissively. ``Japanese
devils.''
</P>
<P>
   He never did kill anyone. But the vitriol in his voice
underscored Asia's historical tensions, which are especially
intractable because they exist between peoples, not governments.
</P>
<P>
   While Asia has seemed remarkably peaceful since the end of the
Vietnam War, the peace is a fragile one, concealing dormant
antagonisms and disputes that could still erupt. Now the recent
economic crisis has increased the risk of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   With nations as with households, tempers fray when the money
runs out. And insecure regimes may try to boost their legitimacy by
picking a fight, distracting discontented citizens with military
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the tension in Asia lies Japan's failure to
apologize meaningfully for its wartime brutality. While anti-Japan
sentiment among the Chinese and Koreans has deeper roots, it
largely derives from Japan's behavior before and during World War
II. Japan must therefore come to grips with its past before the
region can move forward.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for Americans (not to mention the Japanese) to fathom
how deep the historical fault lines run. Some assume that Asia's
resentment of Japan will die with the World War II generation. In
another decade, they think, with the old folks gone, the issue will
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes that should visit a certain hill in Kyoto,
one few Japanese know of and few guidebooks mention. Of course,
every Korean knows about it.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Ear Mound, it contains the ears and noses of perhaps
100,000 of their countrymen whom Japanese warriors slaughtered in
the late 16th century. The few Japanese who have heard of it
consider the Ear Mound a grisly but irrelevant relic of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot say that cutting off ears or noses was so atrocious
by the standards of the time,'' argued a plaque at the site in the
1960s (eventually removed after Koreans complained). To most
Koreans, however, the Ear Mound is another example of Japanese
brutality _ and Japan's reluctance to face up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at Japan continues to simmer in its former victims in
Asia, from Indochina to Indonesia. The hostility is only moderate
in most Asian nations, and almost nonexistent in Taiwan, but
remains dangerously intense in Korea and China. The signs are
everywhere in these two countries. When foreigners learn Chinese,
they are sometimes taught that the character ``hen,'' for hatred,
represents the feeling Chinese have for the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, South Korea, in violation of trading rules, bans the
import of Japanese books, movies and magazines. Elderly Koreans,
schooled in Japanese during the occupation, often refuse to speak
the language.
</P>
<P>
   The resentment has provoked minor crises. When a Beijing
newspaper ran an expose on Chinese waitresses kneeling to serve men
in Japanese restaurants _ as do all waitresses in fine Japanese
restaurants _ a wave of public fury arose at the idea of Chinese
prostrate before their ancient enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, in Tianjin, four Chinese employees of a Japanese
software company refused to work on a computer game about World War
II, which they denounced as a monument to Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The four became local heroes when the company threatened to fire
them, and the Japanese eventually backed down.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Beijing newspaper poll, 51 percent of Chinese
rank Japanese businesses as the least desirable employers. Only 4
percent cite American firms.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many Chinese and Koreans hate Japan? World War II is
an obvious explanation, as is Japan's stubborn failure to show
contrition for its behavior. Japan has never adequately apologized
for the war. Indeed, a sizable segment of the population feels
little remorse and vehemently opposes any apology.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese, especially in rural areas, firmly believe their
country did nothing particularly bad during the first half of this
century. Seisuke Okuno, a former cabinet minister who led 161
members of the Diet (Japan's legislature) in opposing an apology
for World War II, suggests that if any country is guilty of war
crimes it is the United States, for dropping atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's purpose for invading its neighbors was, he insists,
entirely noble: ``These countries had been colonized and oppressed
by whites. Our purpose was to free and stabilize them.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of this view was dramatically demonstrated by the
success of the film ``Pride,'' Japan's biggest box-office hit of
early 1998, which paints wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo as a
national hero. Tojo comes off as a kind and honorable man, thrust
into war by the West and then unfairly executed as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   While real questions remain about the fairness of the Allied
war-crimes tribunals, one cannot imagine such a movie being made
about Hitler or Goebbels, or even a similar depiction of General
Westmoreland and the American role in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese diplomats insist that movies like ``Pride'' are merely
a tribute to pluralism, and that their country has apologized many
times for its wartime conduct. But Japan's statements of regret
always end up sounding hollow and calculating, as if they come from
some committee in the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, then Prime Minister Tomichi Murayama did make a genuine
effort to wrench a forthright apology from the Diet, but the result
only undermined the party line on Japan's supposed contrition.
Drafters of the resolution replaced the word ``apology'' with
``hansei,'' and ``aggressive acts'' with ``aggressive-like acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling, legislators ascribed the acts in question to all
countries, not just Japan. Even in this gutted form, only 230
members of the 511-seat chamber voted for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing at the start
and end of every conversation and many times in between _ which
makes the reluctance to apologize for the war even more remarkable.
If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a nuisance, even when
they are not, why will they not show regret for the slaughter of
millions?
</P>
<P>
   Apart from cultural explanations, such as a Confucian reluctance
to speak critically of one's elders, there is a more obvious
answer: Nations, even more than individuals, hate to say sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, after all, has never formally apologized for
enslaving Africans, invading Mexico and Canada, stealing Texas,
colonizing the Philippines and Guam or carpet-bombing Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most Japanese know very little of their country's dark
past, and thus may be genuinely ignorant of what there is to
repent. For decades, the Japanese government urged textbook
publishers to excise any hint of the brutalities committed by the
army. Thanks to court intervention, recent Japanese textbooks have
improved somewhat. But they skimp on details, giving youngsters
little sense of the horrors committed in their country's name.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is unrelenting anti-Japanese propaganda in
Asian schoolbooks and Asian society. Common Chinese and Korean
epithets characterize the Japanese as dwarfs, pirates, charlatans
and crooks. This racism arises from history, but can also be
attributed to jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Asian countries envy Japan's economic and past military
success. For proud nations like Korea and China, which helped
civilize and educate Japan in the first place, it has been galling
to see the upstart outstrip its tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Asia, of course, is not the only continent where the past
overshadows the present. French-German rivalry plagued modern
Europe for decades, making stability impossible until that
relationship improved. Like France and Germany in the interwar
years, China and Japan now stare suspiciously at each other across
a gulf of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   High stakes freight every American action in Asia with intense
symbolic value. Thus the recent U.S. effort to boost military
cooperation with Japan sent China into a sulk. And Japan felt
snubbed when President Clinton flew to Beijing but neglected to
drop by Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering Asian fear of Japan, while irrational, remains genuine
and can shape policy. According to Chinese officials, China
downgraded Russia as a security threat at the end of the Cold War
while upgrading Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, as is now known, the West drifted close to war with
North Korea _ though few Americans realized it at the time _ and
probably only the intervention of Jimmy Carter prevented armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States prepared for battle, it quickly became
clear that Japan could not be counted on to negotiate a solution or
give military support. It even was unclear whether Japan would lend
doctors to treat wounded GIs or send ships and planes to help
rescue Americans in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Japan, Germany was forced long ago to confront its past;
victim countries like France and Israel scrutinized every German
statement and protested when dissatisfied. Until recently, Japan
never faced such scrutiny, thanks in part to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Cold War over and Asia fracturing, the United
States should encourage Japan to confront its responsibility,
apologize and provide some redress to its former sex slaves and
other victims who are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   So far Japan has refused to pay official compensation to the
``comfort women,'' insisting that such issues have already been
settled on a government-to-government level.
</P>
<P>
   That argument has some legal, but no humanitarian, basis. A
forthright Japanese apology and an attempt to help its victims
would allow Japan to play a more important international role.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, most Americans held virulently racist
opinions of the Japanese, much worse than the stereotypes held by
Chinese or Koreans today. A 1944 poll found that 13 percent of
Americans favored the extermination of all Japanese people after
the war (the question was never asked about Germans), and according
to another poll from late 1945, 23 percent of Americans regretted
that Japan had surrendered before more atomic bombs could be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such hatred, American racism toward Japan has largely
dissipated in the years since the war. Japan surrendered and
accepted American occupation and involvement. The bond subsequently
forged between these former adversaries has come to be described as
the most important bilateral relationship in the world, bar none.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan could overcome American racism in 1945, it can overcome
the animosities that linger in Asia in 1998.

<P>
   The memory of a brief conversation nags me whenever I think
about Asia's future. The conversation took place shortly after the
Tiananmen Square crackdown, during a secret meeting with a leader
of China's underground democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   We met in a quiet corner of a Beijing restaurant, where he
tapped the table suspiciously to see if it was bugged. This was a
man whose vision I admired, so I listened intently when the
waitress stepped away and he leaned forward to disclose his plans
for promoting human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kill Japanese,'' he said brightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kill Japanese businessmen. That'll scare them
so they won't invest here. And then the government will really be
screwed!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not serious?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're serious. We can't demonstrate these days and
we can't publish. he only thing we can do for democracy is kill
Japanese businessmen.''
</P>
<P>
   I protested that it seemed odd to promote human rights by
murdering innocent businessmen. But he just smiled at my
narrow-mindedness, with a ``you-will-never-understand-Asia'' grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're Japanese,'' my friend said dismissively. ``Japanese
devils.''
</P>
<P>
   He never did kill anyone. But the vitriol in his voice
underscored Asia's historical tensions, which are especially
intractable because they exist between peoples, not governments.
</P>
<P>
   While Asia has seemed remarkably peaceful since the end of the
Vietnam War, the peace is a fragile one, concealing dormant
antagonisms and disputes that could still erupt. Now the recent
economic crisis has increased the risk of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   With nations as with households, tempers fray when the money
runs out. And insecure regimes may try to boost their legitimacy by
picking a fight, distracting discontented citizens with military
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the tension in Asia lies Japan's failure to
apologize meaningfully for its wartime brutality. While anti-Japan
sentiment among the Chinese and Koreans has deeper roots, it
largely derives from Japan's behavior before and during World War
II. Japan must therefore come to grips with its past before the
region can move forward.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for Americans (not to mention the Japanese) to fathom
how deep the historical fault lines run. Some assume that Asia's
resentment of Japan will die with the World War II generation. In
another decade, they think, with the old folks gone, the issue will
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes that should visit a certain hill in Kyoto,
one few Japanese know of and few guidebooks mention. Of course,
every Korean knows about it.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Ear Mound, it contains the ears and noses of perhaps
100,000 of their countrymen whom Japanese warriors slaughtered in
the late 16th century. The few Japanese who have heard of it
consider the Ear Mound a grisly but irrelevant relic of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot say that cutting off ears or noses was so atrocious
by the standards of the time,'' argued a plaque at the site in the
1960s (eventually removed after Koreans complained). To most
Koreans, however, the Ear Mound is another example of Japanese
brutality _ and Japan's reluctance to face up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at Japan continues to simmer in its former victims in
Asia, from Indochina to Indonesia. The hostility is only moderate
in most Asian nations, and almost nonexistent in Taiwan, but
remains dangerously intense in Korea and China. The signs are
everywhere in these two countries. When foreigners learn Chinese,
they are sometimes taught that the character ``hen,'' for hatred,
represents the feeling Chinese have for the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, South Korea, in violation of trading rules, bans the
import of Japanese books, movies and magazines. Elderly Koreans,
schooled in Japanese during the occupation, often refuse to speak
the language.
</P>
<P>
   The resentment has provoked minor crises. When a Beijing
newspaper ran an expose on Chinese waitresses kneeling to serve men
in Japanese restaurants _ as do all waitresses in fine Japanese
restaurants _ a wave of public fury arose at the idea of Chinese
prostrate before their ancient enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, in Tianjin, four Chinese employees of a Japanese
software company refused to work on a computer game about World War
II, which they denounced as a monument to Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The four became local heroes when the company threatened to fire
them, and the Japanese eventually backed down.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Beijing newspaper poll, 51 percent of Chinese
rank Japanese businesses as the least desirable employers. Only 4
percent cite American firms.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many Chinese and Koreans hate Japan? World War II is
an obvious explanation, as is Japan's stubborn failure to show
contrition for its behavior. Japan has never adequately apologized
for the war. Indeed, a sizable segment of the population feels
little remorse and vehemently opposes any apology.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese, especially in rural areas, firmly believe their
country did nothing particularly bad during the first half of this
century. Seisuke Okuno, a former cabinet minister who led 161
members of the Diet (Japan's legislature) in opposing an apology
for World War II, suggests that if any country is guilty of war
crimes it is the United States, for dropping atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's purpose for invading its neighbors was, he insists,
entirely noble: ``These countries had been colonized and oppressed
by whites. Our purpose was to free and stabilize them.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of this view was dramatically demonstrated by the
success of the film ``Pride,'' Japan's biggest box-office hit of
early 1998, which paints wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo as a
national hero. Tojo comes off as a kind and honorable man, thrust
into war by the West and then unfairly executed as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   While real questions remain about the fairness of the Allied
war-crimes tribunals, one cannot imagine such a movie being made
about Hitler or Goebbels, or even a similar depiction of General
Westmoreland and the American role in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese diplomats insist that movies like ``Pride'' are merely
a tribute to pluralism, and that their country has apologized many
times for its wartime conduct. But Japan's statements of regret
always end up sounding hollow and calculating, as if they come from
some committee in the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, then Prime Minister Tomichi Murayama did make a genuine
effort to wrench a forthright apology from the Diet, but the result
only undermined the party line on Japan's supposed contrition.
Drafters of the resolution replaced the word ``apology'' with
``hansei,'' and ``aggressive acts'' with ``aggressive-like acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling, legislators ascribed the acts in question to all
countries, not just Japan. Even in this gutted form, only 230
members of the 511-seat chamber voted for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing at the start
and end of every conversation and many times in between _ which
makes the reluctance to apologize for the war even more remarkable.
If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a nuisance, even when
they are not, why will they not show regret for the slaughter of
millions?
</P>
<P>
   Apart from cultural explanations, such as a Confucian reluctance
to speak critically of one's elders, there is a more obvious
answer: Nations, even more than individuals, hate to say sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, after all, has never formally apologized for
enslaving Africans, invading Mexico and Canada, stealing Texas,
colonizing the Philippines and Guam or carpet-bombing Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most Japanese know very little of their country's dark
past, and thus may be genuinely ignorant of what there is to
repent. For decades, the Japanese government urged textbook
publishers to excise any hint of the brutalities committed by the
army. Thanks to court intervention, recent Japanese textbooks have
improved somewhat. But they skimp on details, giving youngsters
little sense of the horrors committed in their country's name.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is unrelenting anti-Japanese propaganda in
Asian schoolbooks and Asian society. Common Chinese and Korean
epithets characterize the Japanese as dwarfs, pirates, charlatans
and crooks. This racism arises from history, but can also be
attributed to jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Asian countries envy Japan's economic and past military
success. For proud nations like Korea and China, which helped
civilize and educate Japan in the first place, it has been galling
to see the upstart outstrip its tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Asia, of course, is not the only continent where the past
overshadows the present. French-German rivalry plagued modern
Europe for decades, making stability impossible until that
relationship improved. Like France and Germany in the interwar
years, China and Japan now stare suspiciously at each other across
a gulf of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   High stakes freight every American action in Asia with intense
symbolic value. Thus the recent U.S. effort to boost military
cooperation with Japan sent China into a sulk. And Japan felt
snubbed when President Clinton flew to Beijing but neglected to
drop by Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering Asian fear of Japan, while irrational, remains genuine
and can shape policy. According to Chinese officials, China
downgraded Russia as a security threat at the end of the Cold War
while upgrading Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, as is now known, the West drifted close to war with
North Korea _ though few Americans realized it at the time _ and
probably only the intervention of Jimmy Carter prevented armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States prepared for battle, it quickly became
clear that Japan could not be counted on to negotiate a solution or
give military support. It even was unclear whether Japan would lend
doctors to treat wounded GIs or send ships and planes to help
rescue Americans in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Japan, Germany was forced long ago to confront its past;
victim countries like France and Israel scrutinized every German
statement and protested when dissatisfied. Until recently, Japan
never faced such scrutiny, thanks in part to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Cold War over and Asia fracturing, the United
States should encourage Japan to confront its responsibility,
apologize and provide some redress to its former sex slaves and
other victims who are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   So far Japan has refused to pay official compensation to the
``comfort women,'' insisting that such issues have already been
settled on a government-to-government level.
</P>
<P>
   That argument has some legal, but no humanitarian, basis. A
forthright Japanese apology and an attempt to help its victims
would allow Japan to play a more important international role.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, most Americans held virulently racist
opinions of the Japanese, much worse than the stereotypes held by
Chinese or Koreans today. A 1944 poll found that 13 percent of
Americans favored the extermination of all Japanese people after
the war (the question was never asked about Germans), and according
to another poll from late 1945, 23 percent of Americans regretted
that Japan had surrendered before more atomic bombs could be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such hatred, American racism toward Japan has largely
dissipated in the years since the war. Japan surrendered and
accepted American occupation and involvement. The bond subsequently
forged between these former adversaries has come to be described as
the most important bilateral relationship in the world, bar none.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan could overcome American racism in 1945, it can overcome
the animosities that linger in Asia in 1998.

<P>
   Perilously, the fate of Russia now rests on the shoulders of its
increasingly fragile president and fragmented coalition government,
out of the West's control.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that the IMF's loans to Russia were imprudent and
wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF failed to stem the Russian collapse not because its
reform package was flawed but because Russia's domestic woes _
combined with its sensitivity to the global slump in oil and
commodity prices _ were too severe to prevent market panic.
</P>
<P>
   Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia been as large as its
$40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, investors would probably not
have fled. Instead, Russia's fiscal position was so delicate that
investors decided $22 billion was not enough to guarantee success.
</P>
<P>
   During the early stages of the global financial contagion that
began with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997, Russia
escaped a ruble devaluation thanks to previously pledged IMF
support and investor demand for high-yield Russian Treasury bonds.
But when the IMF failed to help sustain the ruble in the spring and
early summer as it came under pressure from Russia's large budget
deficit and first postcommunist trade deficit, investors panicked.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting capital flight out of Russia and other emerging
markets produced a $2 trillion to $3 trillion decline in the value
of global stock-market capitalization and caused a correction in
American fixed-income instruments and corporate bond markets so
large that even sophisticated hedge funds like Long Term Capital
were eventually hit.
</P>
<P>
   With the Russian crisis threatening to spiral out of control,
the IMF assembled a $22 billion package for Russia in July, over
the objections of many of its own officials. The United States had
to lobby the IMF to relax its conditions for lending to Russia on
the grounds that Russia was ``too nuclear to go bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the IMF's announcement of the loan, however, events
turned against the fund. The communist-dominated Duma refused to
pass measures essential for reform, such as tax increases. In
addition, the price of oil continued to slide as OPEC members
failed to cap crude production, while the ongoing turmoil in Asia
depressed commodity prices further and increased investor
skittishness over emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   New York hedge funds and Russian banks took advantage of the new
IMF loan to withdraw from the market and take their dollars
offshore. In the end, the IMF program failed to rescue the ruble
and prevent a government default because investors decided that
Russia was too expensive to save.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's reformers might have been able to lay the groundwork
for a more sound market economy, however, if the IMF had offered a
package the size of its 1995 Mexico proposal. The Russian economy
had begun to pick up, and direct foreign investment was poised to
expand before the collapse in oil and commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   A sustained upturn would have reduced the government deficit and
increased public support for reform while supporting the ruble. But
since the IMF package failed, Russia is now headed for
hyperinflation and an economic collapse so severe that it threatens
Russia's fledgling democracy. The events unfolding in Russia
profoundly shock the Russian people, deal a blow to the reformers
in other former Soviet republics, and crush investor confidence in
all countries on its periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Russia still deserves Western assistance as a defeated but
potentially dangerous nuclear power. The West, however, has yet to
create an effective framework to aid a country whose political
institutions are still reeling from 70 years of command economy
mismanagement and a corrupt redistribution of state assets after
communism's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, the reformers who dominated the government in July
did not have enough time to establish market credibility and
challenge the iron grip of Russia's business oligarchs before the
slump in oil and commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a new team has taken over that is deeply divided
over policy and liable to print money to finance the budget. The
resulting hyperinflation could either set the stage for the
reformers to return or spark a nationalist backlash.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the magnitude of the global market collapse after
the Russian default illustrated how badly the market had misjudged
Russian credit and the capacity of the IMF and the U.S. Treasury to
intervene effectively. Their inability to save Russia demonstrated
the limits of their power and caused investors to reassess risk all
around the world. Countries such as Brazil and Venezuela had to
hike interest rates immediately to discount the risk of immediate
default.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting rise in borrowing costs was so severe that a Latin
American recession will be unavoidable in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's critics, including Republican members of Congress,
charge that its only mission is to rescue bankers from their own
foolishness and encourage reckless lending to countries undeserving
of international support. Other commentators lambaste the IMF's
assistance to countries under authoritarian regimes, such as
Suharto's Indonesia, and see IMF funds as nothing more than
financial aid for dictators.
</P>
<P>
   But these critics fail to grasp the larger historical
implications.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia does revert back to authoritarian rule and a command
economy, historians will say that the West lost Russia because it
was not prepared to spend enough to ensure its successful
transition into a market economy. The United States stands right in
the middle of this debate, having used the IMF since the Cold War
as a proxy agency for American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether with Mexico in 1995 or Asia in 1997, the United States
has decisively shaped the IMF agenda, calling for the
liberalization of trade and investment in countries that would
otherwise resist implementation of these policies through bilateral
channels.
</P>
<P>
   As Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in February,
``The IMF has done more to promote America's trade and investment
agenda in Korea than 30 years of bilateral trade talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has asked Congress to provide more
than $18 billion in new IMF funding to help expand its total
capital to $280 billion, but the House continues to refuse. If
America fails to provide its share, the IMF will have to find other
means of funding, such as borrowing in commercial paper and bond
markets or greater contributions from other members, that would
inevitably reduce U.S. influence.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn Japan proposed creating an Asian monetary fund to
bolster the resources available to the region's troubled countries.
The U.S. Treasury rejected that idea because it feared it would
establish an institution that could compete with the IMF _ and thus
weaken American control. Congress must decide whether America wants
to pay the cost of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Great economic crises do not occur in political vacuums. In the
1930s, depression led to global war and cost millions of lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia today, the streets of Jakarta have already seen
bloodshed and attacks on ethnic Chinese. While China has mostly
stayed aloof so far, it has formally indicated its concern to the
Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
   If civil war were to break out in Indonesia, it would disrupt 40
percent of the globe's shipping _ including energy supplies for
Japan and electronic goods for the world _ that passes through its
waters. The economic crisis may strengthen the hand of extremist
Islamic parties and pose new foreign policy problems for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The great difference between today's economy and the emergence
of the modern market economy a century ago is the speed and
frequency with which money moves across borders. As the shocks
following the Russian default have shown, economists still cannot
fully comprehend the consequences of a global financial system that
can move capital so quickly and cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has evolved into an institution that assumes some basic
functions of a global central bank without provoking needless
debate about whether the world needs a global currency or political
union. It still has much to learn from the revolution in technology
and financial behavior in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, the IMF remains the best solution in an imperfect
world. If the IMF did not exist, governments would be frantically
debating today whether to establish such an organization.

escaped a ruble devaluation thanks to previously pledged IMF
support and investor demand for high-yield Russian Treasury bonds.
But when the IMF failed to help sustain the ruble in the spring and
early summer as it came under pressure from Russia's large budget
deficit and first postcommunist trade deficit, investors panicked.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting capital flight out of Russia and other emerging
markets produced a $2 trillion to $3 trillion decline in the value
of global stock-market capitalization and caused a correction in
American fixed-income instruments and corporate bond markets so
large that even sophisticated hedge funds like Long Term Capital
were eventually hit.
</P>
<P>
   With the Russian crisis threatening to spiral out of control,
the IMF assembled a $22 billion package for Russia in July, over
the objections of many of its own officials. The United States had
to lobby the IMF to relax its conditions for lending to Russia on
the grounds that Russia was ``too nuclear to go bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the IMF's announcement of the loan, however, events
turned against the fund. The communist-dominated Duma refused to
pass measures essential for reform, such as tax increases. In
addition, the price of oil continued to slide as OPEC members
failed to cap crude production, while the ongoing turmoil in Asia
depressed commodity prices further and increased investor
skittishness over emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   New York hedge funds and Russian banks took advantage of the new
IMF loan to withdraw from the market and take their dollars
offshore. In the end, the IMF program failed to rescue the ruble
and prevent a government default because investors decided that
Russia was too expensive to save.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's reformers might have been able to lay the groundwork
for a more sound market economy, however, if the IMF had offered a
package the size of its 1995 Mexico proposal. The Russian economy
had begun to pick up, and direct foreign investment was poised to
expand before the collapse in oil and commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   A sustained upturn would have reduced the government deficit and
increased public support for reform while supporting the ruble. But
since the IMF package failed, Russia is now headed for
hyperinflation and an economic collapse so severe that it threatens
Russia's fledgling democracy. The events unfolding in Russia
profoundly shock the Russian people, deal a blow to the reformers
in other former Soviet republics, and crush investor confidence in
all countries on its periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Russia still deserves Western assistance as a defeated but
potentially dangerous nuclear power. The West, however, has yet to
create an effective framework to aid a country whose political
institutions are still reeling from 70 years of command economy
mismanagement and a corrupt redistribution of state assets after
communism's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, the reformers who dominated the government in July
did not have enough time to establish market credibility and
challenge the iron grip of Russia's business oligarchs before the
slump in oil and commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a new team has taken over that is deeply divided
over policy and liable to print money to finance the budget. The
resulting hyperinflation could either set the stage for the
reformers to return or spark a nationalist backlash.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the magnitude of the global market collapse after
the Russian default illustrated how badly the market had misjudged
Russian credit and the capacity of the IMF and the U.S. Treasury to
intervene effectively. Their inability to save Russia demonstrated
the limits of their power and caused investors to reassess risk all
around the world. Countries such as Brazil and Venezuela had to
hike interest rates immediately to discount the risk of immediate
default.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting rise in borrowing costs was so severe that a Latin
American recession will be unavoidable in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's critics, including Republican members of Congress,
charge that its only mission is to rescue bankers from their own
foolishness and encourage reckless lending to countries undeserving
of international support. Other commentators lambaste the IMF's
assistance to countries under authoritarian regimes, such as
Suharto's Indonesia, and see IMF funds as nothing more than
financial aid for dictators.
</P>
<P>
   But these critics fail to grasp the larger historical
implications.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia does revert back to authoritarian rule and a command
economy, historians will say that the West lost Russia because it
was not prepared to spend enough to ensure its successful
transition into a market economy. The United States stands right in
the middle of this debate, having used the IMF since the Cold War
as a proxy agency for American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether with Mexico in 1995 or Asia in 1997, the United States
has decisively shaped the IMF agenda, calling for the
liberalization of trade and investment in countries that would
otherwise resist implementation of these policies through bilateral
channels.
</P>
<P>
   As Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in February,
``The IMF has done more to promote America's trade and investment
agenda in Korea than 30 years of bilateral trade talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has asked Congress to provide more
than $18 billion in new IMF funding to help expand its total
capital to $280 billion, but the House continues to refuse. If
America fails to provide its share, the IMF will have to find other
means of funding, such as borrowing in commercial paper and bond
markets or greater contributions from other members, that would
inevitably reduce U.S. influence.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn Japan proposed creating an Asian monetary fund to
bolster the resources available to the region's troubled countries.
The U.S. Treasury rejected that idea because it feared it would
establish an institution that could compete with the IMF _ and thus
weaken American control. Congress must decide whether America wants
to pay the cost of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Great economic crises do not occur in political vacuums. In the
1930s, depression led to global war and cost millions of lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia today, the streets of Jakarta have already seen
bloodshed and attacks on ethnic Chinese. While China has mostly
stayed aloof so far, it has formally indicated its concern to the
Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
   If civil war were to break out in Indonesia, it would disrupt 40
percent of the globe's shipping _ including energy supplies for
Japan and electronic goods for the world _ that passes through its
waters. The economic crisis may strengthen the hand of extremist
Islamic parties and pose new foreign policy problems for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The great difference between today's economy and the emergence
of the modern market economy a century ago is the speed and
frequency with which money moves across borders. As the shocks
following the Russian default have shown, economists still cannot
fully comprehend the consequences of a global financial system that
can move capital so quickly and cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has evolved into an institution that assumes some basic
functions of a global central bank without provoking needless
debate about whether the world needs a global currency or political
union. It still has much to learn from the revolution in technology
and financial behavior in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, the IMF remains the best solution in an imperfect
world. If the IMF did not exist, governments would be frantically
debating today whether to establish such an organization.

GOING HER OWN WAY

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the outside, there's nothing remarkable about
June Wayne's studio-home.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in an aging commercial-residential neighborhood off
Santa Monica Boulevard, a few blocks from Hollywood Memorial Park
Cemetery, the monolithic structure melts into the surrounding
anonymity of nondescript houses and a generic strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's done with malice aforethought,'' Wayne says, only
half-jokingly, of her 5,000-square-foot abode, which she designed
herself in 1967. ``I wanted it to be so banal people wouldn't
notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the appearance is deceptive. Once past the building's
inscrutable exterior, you step through a courtyard into Wayne's
airy, cathedral-ceilinged living quarters, which are anything but
impersonal.
</P>
<P>
   The floor space is dominated by a massive lighting table strewn
with color slides. Overhead, huge windows pour light onto a
collection of antique Latin American santos and Wayne's own
mysteriously distinctive paintings and lithographs.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, the Chicago-born artist thought of abandoning
her spacious Southern California digs and moving to Paris, because
``it's easier to be an eccentric'' there.
</P>
<P>
   But at the start of her ninth decade on the planet, June Wayne
is taking the long view of her situation. Nearly as famous for her
independent, unconventional career path and outspoken,
proto-feminist politics as for her art, she is doing what she's
always done: standing her ground.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a pair of visitors around, the 80-year-old artist is a
much larger presence than her petite size would indicate. Funny,
opinionated about everything, alternately self-assertive and
self-effacing, Wayne is still a dynamic figure.
</P>
<P>
   And although her environs have turned gritty lately, she has no
intention of uprooting herself and leaving behind what she calls
``my neighbors'' _ Rudolph Valentino, Cecil B. De Mille and
Hollywood Memorial Park's other habitues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever my work is, is where I'm at,'' she says
philosophically. ``I'm really not interested in being very visible.
I have lived very quietly nearly all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her passion for privacy, it may be hard for Wayne to
disappear into her studio over the next few months. On Thursday,
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will open a 50-year survey of
her multifaceted career. ``June Wayne: A Retrospective'' will
showcase Wayne's output of lithographic prints, paintings,
tapestries and collages.
</P>
<P>
   It also will explore Wayne's pivotal role in making Los Angeles
an internationally regarded center for lithography as director of
the Tamarind Lithography Workshop, named after the street where
Wayne still keeps her studio. (Tamarind has since relocated to
become the Tamarind Institute of the University of New Mexico.)
</P>
<P>
   Under Wayne's energetic leadership from 1960 to 1970, the
nonprofit Tamarind (launched with Ford Foundation money) almost
single-handedly resurrected the method of printing from stone and
metal surfaces, which had become a virtually extinct art form in
the postwar United States. Subsequently, Tamarind-trained master
printers and their students have branched out and started such
ateliers as Gemini, Hamilton Press and L.A.-based Cirrus Editions.
</P>
<P>
   Putting her own career on hold, Wayne drew together artists from
around the world to make lithographs with master printers trained
at Tamarind. Its ranks at one time included such artists as Ed
Moses, Clifford Smith and Serge Lozingot. In organizing and
administering such an ambitious group undertaking, Wayne drew on
her own experiences as an artist for the federal Works Progress
Administration in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Carlson, LACMA's senior curator of prints and drawings,
offers a twofold explanation of why it has taken 40 years for Wayne
to get this retrospective, organized by the Neuberger Museum of Art
in Purchase, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is that June has always been a very, very independent and
largely self-taught artist,'' he says. ``That means that she has
not fallen into any of the art movements that in the past 40 years
or so have had such publicity: op art, pop art, abstract
expressionism, color field. None of those brackets explain her. And
because she isn't bracketed, I think that a lot of critics have not
known what to make of her.''
</P>
<P>
   The second, ``more mundane reason,'' Carlson says, is that when
Wayne founded Tamarind, she was still a fairly young artist who had
done a substantial amount of work ``but had not, I would say,
achieved her full potential.''
</P>
<P>
   While such male contemporaries as Jasper Johns, Robert
Rauschenberg, Ellsworth Kelly and, on the West Coast, Edward
Kienholz, Ed Ruscha and others were solidifying their reputations,
Wayne was taking her own art off the commercial market so as to
avoid any conflict of interest with the Tamarind printers. When she
resumed her career in the early 1970s, Carlson observes, ``there
was a lot of catching up to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To a degree, Wayne's recognition is still catching up with her
reputation. Reviewing the current retrospective when it opened at
the Neuberger, a New York Times critic described Wayne as a
``renowned but little-known figure.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wayne finds such descriptions irksome, she's not complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not implying that I'm neglected; I'm not,'' says the
artist, who has had more than 70 solo exhibitions of her work in
the U.S. and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right about now, I'm getting a lot of attention. I have no
doubt that two years from now, the klieg lights will have gone
somewhere else. So I'll have time to do all those nice paintings I
have in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Wayne has always gone her own way, maintaining
an eccentric, outsider perspective both as an artist and as a woman
outside the macho, self-absorbed theatricality of so much modern
and contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Raised by her divorced mother, Dorothy Kline, and her Russian
immigrant grandmother, Wayne grew up in a household where, she has
written, ``men vanished.'' She dropped out of high school at 15 and
supported herself with various factory jobs.
</P>
<P>
   She had her first solo exhibition in Chicago in 1935. These
early paintings, using palette knives to apply jagged swatches of
color, depict austere scenes of unemployed men and Chicago industry
at the height of the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only in the late 1940s, after studying in Mexico,
working for the WPA and relocating to Los Angeles, where she did
production illustration for the aircraft industry, that Wayne began
creating the more stylized, surrealistic and illusionistic works
for which she is widely known.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by everything from the writings of Franz Kafka and
John Donne to organic chemistry, magnetic fields, atomic fission
and DNA structure, Wayne developed what Neuberger director Lucinda
H. Gedeon has described as a highly personal ``lexicon of
symbols.'' Her works communicate neither through iconography nor
simple illustration, but in more complex, expressionistic images
that often combine scientific precision with an imaginative,
experimental spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Gedeon compares Wayne's outlook to that of Leonardo da Vinci,
whose curiosity about science and nature could inspire drawings of
intensely detailed flora and fauna, as well as fanciful renderings
of preposterous war machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne's sights remain fixed with equal intensity on two sites
_ the smallest visible unit and the indeterminably vast vista _
that together enfold microcosm and macrocosm,'' says an essay in
the exhibition catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of Wayne's most popular works, ``The Dorothy
Series,'' is her least characteristic. Produced between 1975 and
1979, this 20-print suite pays homage to Wayne's mother,
illustrating significant episodes from her life with prints
composed of bits and pieces: family photographs, old report cards,
scraps of writing, 1920s sheet music and so on, all bathed in a
pastel atmosphere that affectionately keeps its distance.
</P>
<P>
   Though she was pleased by the series' recent mobbed reception in
Cincinnati, Wayne says she's ``really not interested very much in
myself per se.'' She has no interest in ``being a personality,''
because ``I can't compete with Marilyn Monroe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me what I would really want, I want to do my work
and I would like a great big pot of money to do it with,'' she
says, laughing.

 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The only daughter of Fidel Castro walks into a
midtown French restaurant looking disheveled, out of sorts, lost.
</P>
<P>
   She is an hour and 20 minutes late. She said she had lost her
way going to Times Square in the subway from an apartment in
Jackson Heights, Queens, where she was temporarily staying. She
knows she has to pose for a picture right after lunch; yet, she
complains, she forgot to wear makeup, and her ensemble _ loose
black jeans and a sweatshirt _ can only be called, even in the
kindest terms, young urban chic.
</P>
<P>
   Like her father, Alina Fernandez, 42, has long fingers and a
darkness in her eyes that makes her appear distrustful.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her father, she has no power, no money, no home, not even
a famous last name. But she has stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the children of famous men and women often do, Ms.
Fernandez has written a book that has just been released _ a
tantalizing prospect for anyone who is curious about the private
life of Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Yet very little in the book is about Castro himself. As the
title accurately reflects, ``Castro's Daughter: An Exile's Memoir
of Cuba'' (St. Martin's Press) is the story of Ms. Fernandez and
the Cuba she knew for almost 40 years, the years her father has
been in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my biography, not his,'' she said. ``But it is his name
that sells, not mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fernandez, who said she never had her father's direct
telephone number, visited his house only once and spent very little
time with him and his family, seven sons by three women. Since she
left Cuba in 1993, disguised as a Spanish tourist with a false
passport, the two have not spoken, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even before she left, relations were strained, in part
because Ms. Fernandez did not like Castro as a father or as a
political leader. In 1989, while still living in Cuba, Ms.
Fernandez began to criticize Castro's government publicly and
became a fixture in the dissident movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just another exile with a story to tell,'' she said,
eyeing her bowl of lettuce with suspicion. ``I'm nervous today, and
when I'm nervous I can't eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fernandez ordered a tuna salad with dressing on the side,
but she had the waiter return the tuna to the kitchen. Too big, she
said. Instead, she asked for a glass of red wine. She fingered her
cigarettes nervously and, as soon as the lunch crowd had left, she
lighted up and asked for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   She has long had a troubled relationship with food. She said she
was anorexic for a while and was once so sick that one of her four
former husbands may have saved her life by putting bits of
half-chewed food into her mouth, as if she were a bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy being Fidel Castro's daughter,'' she said with
a sigh. ``In Cuba or here. When people see the child of their
executioner, it reminds them of him. When I see his victims, I
can't help feeling some tension, some guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   There was pain in her voice, and a touch of boredom, too, as she
told her story. Ms. Fernandez was born in 1956, from a liaison
between Castro and Natalia Revuelta, a beautiful, rich socialite
married to a doctor, Orlando Fernandez, who gave Alina his last
name.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Revuelta fell in love with Castro, who was then married to a
woman named Myrta Diaz-Balart, in the heyday of the insurrection
that propelled him to power in 1959. The two met when Ms. Revuelta,
who knew that Castro was an opposition leader, sent him a key to an
apartment she kept in a ritzy Havana neighborhood so that he could
use it to plan his underground activities.
</P>
<P>
   When Castro was caught and sent to prison in 1953, Ms. Revuelta
and Castro corresponded in secret until, one day, he mailed to his
wife a letter intended for Ms. Revuelta and vice versa. Ms.
Diaz-Balart filed for divorce and later left the country.
</P>
<P>
   Once Castro seized control of the government, Dr. Fernandez also
left the country, with the couple's older daughter, Natalie,
leaving Ms. Revuelta in Havana with Alina. While Castro visited his
mistress and daughter quite often in the early years of the
revolution, he never offered to marry Ms. Revuelta and never
treated his daughter as such.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he offered to give his daughter his last name, it
was too late. Alina, then 12, told him she preferred hers.
</P>
<P>
   As her book makes clear, Ms. Fernandez was the victim of her
father's mood swings. Sometimes he appeared to care for her; most
times, he ignored her. On occasion he brought her gifts, Balzac's
complete works in Frenchy and a doll that looked like him. A few
times, he called her to the presidential palace to admonish her for
her rebellious character. But, Ms. Fernandez said, there was no
pattern to his behavior, making it impossible for her to even
attempt to please him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived my life as if I were any other Cuban in a country with
no food, no electricity, no good-paying jobs, no freedom to move,
not even freedom to leave if you didn't like it,'' she said.
``Being his daughter meant only that I was watched all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also meant that despite her rebelliousness and obvious
dislike of her father's government, she was never jailed, as many
dissidents were. Nor was her life like everyone else's. Jobs were
available when she wanted them, and competitive swimming and ballet
schools readily accepted her as a child. But her father rarely sent
her money and, like most other Cubans, she said, she had to
struggle to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to read Ms. Fernandez's personality. During the
course of one interview, she seemed shy and frightened, a needy
child longing for attention that she knows she will not get. But
she also comes across as resentful, openly criticizing people who
were once close friends, and, she says, who attempted to use her or
control her. And then, she can be warm, too. In conversation, she
is smart and witty, an inquisitive writer with a sarcastic streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alina is a story in damage,'' said Wendy Gimbel, a New York
writer whose own book about the Revuelta family was released early
this year. In Ms. Gimbel's book, ``Havana Dreams: A Story of
Cuba'', Ms. Fernandez is not a likable character. She comes off as
unstable, greedy and uncaring.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Valle-Vallejo, a writer and Spanish teacher who has
known Ms. Fernandez since childhood, says that for much of her life
Ms. Fernandez was punished for being her father's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, he said, Ms. Fernandez was resented by people who did
not like her father, envied by those who wished they were related
to Castro and mistrusted by virtually everyone else. She had few
friends and even fewer privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the world knew the truth about the history of this young
woman, perhaps her situation would be different,'' he wrote in a
newspaper column in 1988, the year Ms. Fernandez began her
desperate attempt to leave Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she was married to a Mexican citizen and wanted to
travel to Mexico. Her father denied her request. The marriage ended
in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, aided by Spanish friends with ties to human rights
organizations, Ms. Fernandez left Cuba, leaving her only child, a
daughter, Mumin, behind. Soon after, Castro allowed his
granddaughter to leave. Now 20, she lives in Miami with her father.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stay in New York, Ms. Fernandez moved to Spain.

SEASON'S HOTTEST SANTA 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some screenplays turn around practically
overnight. Others sit around for years. And the screenplay for
``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' has been knocking around so long
that Jonathan Taylor Thomas may have found a role he was literally
born to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original script was written 17 or 18 years ago,'' said
Thomas, 17. ``The film we made was pretty different from the
original version. The basic premise stayed the same, but ... every
scene changed a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, star of the sappy holiday road flick, became involved
with the script about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first version he saw was about a flaky college kid who was
well past his fourth year in school. Then, to tailor it for young
Thomas, the setting was shifted from a college to a prep school.
But, in the end, Thomas plays Jake as a college con man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny,'' he said, ``it wasn't supposed to be a
college, it was supposed to be a prep school, a boarding school.
But, when they screened the film, (test audiences) thought that it
was in college ... and we had to adapt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney didn't have to go far to find a star for the Christmas
movie about a kid's soul-searching journey. Thomas is best-known
for his role as Randy Taylor on ABC's hit sitcom ``Home
Improvement,'' a show produced by Disney. And the sitcom's star,
Tim Allen, was tapped to star in Disney's last successful yuletide
movie, ``The Santa Clause'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home'' will have a long way to go to match the
popularity of ``The Santa Clause.'' It ranked sixth on the
box-office chart, earning just $3.9 million its first weekend out.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't blame Thomas, whose performance is solid,
bordering on charismatic, despite having to put up with some
uncomfortable situations during production.
</P>
<P>
   He was stuck in a Santa suit for virtually the entire movie,
which was filmed during the summer months in Palmdale and
Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sweating and miserable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Christmas trees here, a little tinsel and fake paper
snow imported from England and summer became winter, Hollywood
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' he said. ``They do a lot of films in and
around Vancouver, but even the tourists who went through town had a
good laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who announced he would leave ``Home Improvement'' before
the start of this, its eighth, season, will appear in one more
episode, which is coincidentally the Christmas episode.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappiness was not what drove him away from the vehicle that
made him a star. He says he was just ready for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go back to school,'' said Thomas, who lives in the
West Valley. ``I wanted to be with my friends and go to football
games. I'm more concerned with getting ready for college now, and
now I'm also able to work on my film career better because it's
more conducive with my school schedule. If something comes along,
and it fits in with school, then great.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he wants to study political science or history at
either an Ivy League school or perhaps Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   He also will appear as a gay Las Vegas street hustler in the
independent film ``Speedway Junkie,'' which is expected to make an
appearance at the Sundance Film Festival in January.
</P>
<P>
   The role will be a major departure from the smart-mouthed,
clean-cut kid Thomas played on ``Home Improvement,'' an image that
made him a breakout star and a pinup boy for teen-age girls around
the nation.

TALK RADIO LINEUP FALLING INTO PLACE AT KRLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; That new talk format at oldies KRLA-AM (1110),
spearheaded by longtime KABC-AM (790) personality Michael Jackson,
will debut Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   KRLA, which once took part in bringing the Beatles to the
Hollywood Bowl in the early '60s, will lead off each day with
syndicated host Don Imus, who exits adult standards KLAC-AM (570).
</P>
<P>
   Although the new format debuts at the end of the month, midday
host Jackson won't start until the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Once the lineup falls into place, Dr. Toni Grant will follow
Jackson at noon, with G. Gordon Liddy coming in at 3 p.m. KRLA will
also broadcast Anaheim Angels and L.A. Kings games. Ed Tyll starts
at 10 p.m. in a simulcast of his KLSX-FM (97.1) program.
</P>
<P>
   CBS Radio-owned KRLA and KLSX are sister stations and
advertisers will be offered combination spots.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who recently resigned from KABC after more than 30
years, said last week that his 9 a.m.-to-noon show will feature
interviews with ``high-caliber'' guests and newsmakers. In
addition, the program may also be syndicated.
</P>
<P>
   The new all-talk station will target a more traditional 35-to-64
age group in contrast to the much younger audience sought by KLSX,
KRLA/KLSX general manager Bob Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 18 months, we did 250 calls a week to English-speaking
adults, 25 to 64, and asked them what they felt was missing in
terms of music on the AM dial and they answered, `Nothing','' Moore
explained. ``Because the truth is, once you take away KRLA and
KLAC, you have no more music on AM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also asked what people felt was missing in terms of talk on
AM and their overwhelming response was, `Michael Jackson, Monday
through Friday'.''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYLIST IN HIS HANDS: Keith Cunningham has been named program
manager at album alternative Channel 103.1. ``I've seen firsthand
how powerful this format can be when it's marketed and programmed
properly,'' says Cunningham, who comes to Channel 103.1 on Nov. 30
from KBPI in Denver, where he is currently assistant program
director and director of marketing and promotions.

THE ART OF GETTING DUMPED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Meet him at a party.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him if you look fat.
</P>
<P>
   Drive by his house.
</P>
<P>
   Beg him to come over.
</P>
<P>
   Be honest, girls. How many of these things have you done shortly
after that chance encounter with a man who could become your
boyfriend?
</P>
<P>
   If any of these sound familiar, you're probably well on your way
to losing the man of your dreams, say Michele Alexander and Jeannie
Long, who've made getting dumped an art form in their book, ``How
to Lose a Guy in 10 Days: The Universal Don'ts of Dating'' (Bantam;
$6.99).
</P>
<P>
   Alexander and Long, both 28 and roommates in Los Angeles,
hatched the idea for the book after a long night of drinking and
flirting had netted them nothing but the beginnings of a hangover.
</P>
<P>
   Bemoaning that they hadn't met any men who were even remotely
boyfriend material, they pulled out a copy of last year's
best-selling book ``The Rules'' that promises to teach women the
secret of snaring a well-behaved husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about how ridiculous and manipulative it is,
and we were saying we should write a book about what girls really
do and what we do best, which is losing a guy,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, they had assembled about 100 dating no-no's
that they stapled together to give out as Christmas presents to
friends. One of those friends called a literary agent, and shortly
thereafter, Alexander and Long had a book deal.
</P>
<P>
   What are their tips for getting rid of the guy you met last
night?
</P>
<P>
   Day 2: At breakfast, sit on the same side of the table as him.
Accuse him of flirting with the waitress.
</P>
<P>
   Day 3: Tell him he reminds you of your dad.
</P>
<P>
   Day 4: Ask him if you can have a drawer.
</P>
<P>
   Day 5: Call his mom and introduce yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Day 6: When you call him, never announce yourself _ from now on,
it's ``me.''
</P>
<P>
   Day 7: Join his gym. Anytime you ``accidentally'' run into him,
call it a ``ka-winky-dink.''
</P>
<P>
   Day 8: Tell him you met your last boyfriend on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Day 9: Fly your parents in to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   How many of these dating faux pas will Long and Alexander admit
to? More than a few, although their friends provided additional
sure-fire dumping tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup, I've constantly done splits in front of him to show him
how limber I am,'' Alexander said. ``That's my biggest move. And
I've joined his gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Long clearly didn't want to reveal her worst dating moves, but
her writing partner did it for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeannie, you've stayed at his house until you were forced to
leave,'' Alexander offered helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the risks you run when your writing partner is
also your roommate and your best friend since junior high.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, though.
</P>
<P>
   Day 10's advice: Tell him he's changed and you don't even know
him anymore. Confront him. Yell, cry. Throw your shoe at him,
collapse on the hood of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Go to a party. Meet someone else _ and start back at Day 1.

`THE WIDOW KILLER': HOW A MURDER MYSTERY TURNS INTO AN ALLEGORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Publication notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are in the world of evil and evil retaliation in this new
novel by the distinguished Czech playwright Pavel Kohout, whose
works were banned for 20 years in his own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Widow Killer'' takes place in the final months of World
War II. Prague senses its imminent liberation, but the evil of the
occupation is reincarnated in the evil of having been occupied.
</P>
<P>
   A murderer is loose in the city, a deranged but resourceful
figure who performs a series of ritual slayings, gruesome in their
details, of German and Czech widows and then, when the Germans
begin to withdraw, anoints himself the avenger of his wounded
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a kind of moral reversal takes place in which the
victim and the victimizer, the Czech and the German, change places,
the one becoming criminal as the other strives to atone for his
misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   What starts out, in other words, like a murder mystery, a taut
and suspenseful thriller, turns into a powerful and gripping
allegory by a writer steeped in the tragic lessons of Czechoslovak
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Widow Killer'' is also a provocative book, provocative if
only because one of Kohout's two main characters is a German
policeman who is a liaison between the criminal police in Prague
and the Gestapo. This representative of the Reich, a man at first
inclined to assume that the death camps are a nasty rumor,
transforms himself into a good man as he helps the police try to
catch the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of Kohout's success in this novel that this
transformation, which might have come across as contrived, a sappy
illustration of human universality, is persuasive in a book that is
solidly grounded in both history and psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in February 1945 when the murderer kills a
German resident of Prague, the Baroness of Pomerania and the widow
of a German general who turned against Hitler. On the day of the
murder, an Allied bomb has landed in the city and destroyed some
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the turmoil caused by the bomb, a young
Czechoslovak assistant detective named Jan Morava is assigned by
the Germans to investigate the murder. He is supervised in the case
by Chief Inspector Buback, a German police official from Dresden
who works in the Prague Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans claim to be eager to capture the murderer to insure
the safety of German civilians in Prague. The real reason is that
Buback's superior, the Gestapo chief in Prague, wants to collect
information about the Czechoslovak police, the only group in the
city that could make serious trouble for the Nazis as the Allied
and Soviet Armies approach.
</P>
<P>
   As the story unfolds and the murderer adds to his list of
victims, Kohout's story shifts increasingly to the freighted
relationship between Buback and Morava as they try to find the
murderer. Morava, an intelligent, discreet Czech patriot who hates
the German occupiers, marries his girlfriend, Jitka, who also works
in the Prague police department.
</P>
<P>
   Buback takes a fancy to the young woman and tries to seduce her.
So the two men are rivals over more than politics. But their common
task leads them to a grudging admiration for each other and to a
sense of their commonality in the face both of a malignant
occupation and the malignant Czech murderer at loose in the city.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Kohout's story effective is, in part, the complicated
authenticity of its background. ``The Widow Killer'' provides a
vivid portrait of Prague as the era of Nazi occupation ended and
the uncertain future yawned. Kohout evokes the complicated
political situation, which included not only the Nazi efforts to
hold onto Prague as an escape route for their troops on the Eastern
front but also the deadly competition between Czechoslovak
democrats and Communists, both of whom know that the end of Nazi
power is only days away.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the story is the intense, suppressed resentment
of the Czechoslovaks toward the occupiers and the inclination of
some of them to take on a kind of personal megalomania, embodied in
the Prague murderer, more mysterious in its way than the Nazi
political cruelty that inspired it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adolf Hitler was the product of a deranged nation's political
will, horrible but explicable, and therefore defeatable,'' Morava
thinks at one point. ``The unknown and unpredictable widow
slaughterer stripped the thin veneer of civilization from mankind
and threatened to return humanity to its savage prehistory.''
</P>
<P>
   The denouement of Kohout's book comes against the background of
the five-day Prague uprising in May 1945 when the Czechoslovaks,
led by the Communists, took control of the city from the weakened
and demoralized German troops. Morava and Buback become allies in
two senses: one, to catch the widow killer, and two, to prevent the
Czechoslovaks from taking on the murderous aspects of the departing
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The action is worthy of a thriller whose ending it would be
unfair to give away here. But this is a novel written by a former
dissident from Czechoslovakia, most of whose postwar history does
not inspire optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kohout leaves us with a brief and bitter afterward,
indicating that the end of ``The Widow Killer'' was really just a
new beginning for Czechoslovakia, one in which, at least for a
time, good and evil become ever more indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   ``History proves that the worst atrocities are always committed
by the keepers of a sacred truth, who truly believe in their
mission,'' Morava's Czechoslovak superior, a consistent moral voice
in this novel, says at one point. ``And that mission includes
destroying all other truths _ which, of course, are nothing but
lies _ along with anyone who supports them.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement would seem to be Kohout speaking through the
character that represents him in this book, which, like its author,
is deep and pessimistic but not unaware that humankind, sooner or
later, can learn something from the mistakes of the past.

A MERGER OF MUPPETS AND RELIGION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can Kermit (the frog), Merlin (the wizard) and Trapper John
(M.D.) coexist on the same cable channel, cheek by jowl with
ethicists and professors of religion?
</P>
<P>
   The Jim Henson Co. and Hallmark Entertainment, already partners
in television ventures, took over 45 percent ownership of the
Odyssey Channel Monday. Henson and Hallmark shows will be added to
Odyssey's lineup of faith-and-values programs.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Loesch, former chief of the Fox Kids Network who became
president of the Henson Television Group in February, was named
president and chief executive of the new Odyssey Channel. She said
it would be a family network, but geared to adults rather than
children.
</P>
<P>
   Odyssey is also owned by the Liberty Media Corp. and the
National Interfaith Cable Coalition, a consortium of 70 religious
denominations and faith groups that founded the channel in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Henson-Hallmark partners had been seeking a cable channel,
and Odyssey's appeal lies in its 30 million subscribers and
low-profile name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since not a lot of people know about the channel, we can
broaden awareness and make it mean more to a broader group of
people,'' Ms. Loesch said. ``With these two bulletproof brand
names, Henson and Hallmark, to brand the channel, you don't have to
explain a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It will have 4,000 hours of programs from the Hallmark and
Henson libraries, including Hallmark's television specials like
``Merlin,'' ``Gulliver's Travels'' and, appropriately enough, ``The
Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   It will continue to carry religious and spiritual programs,
including its documentary series ``Landmarks of Faith.'' The new
partners agreed to keep a minimum of 40 hours of faith-and-values
programming a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our religious programming doesn't represent narrow doctrine or
dogma,'' said Wilford V. Bane, chairman of the religious
coalition's management group. ``It is not designed to proselytize
or attract people to a specific point of view but help see their
sense of values and religion and spiritual beliefs are part of
their daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   Its new look is to be ready next spring. Henson and Hallmark are
investing $100 million in the channel, and the channel itself
expects to invest $200 million over the next three to five years in
new programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Henson and Hallmark will continue to make programs for
other television outlets around the world, executives of both
companies said.

A SLEW OF SILLY AND SERIOUS MUST-HAVES FOR THE SMALLEST OF
CONSUMERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Parents of the world rejoice! Giving birth has never
been easier. Well, maybe not the actual birthing part, but
everything that comes afterward is a cinch _ and lightweight,
compact, safe, educational, convenient, fast and odor-resistant to
boot. It's child rearing a la the 21st century, on its way to a
baby boutique near you.
</P>
<P>
   A mind-boggling expanse of consumer goodies for infants,
toddlers, and moms and dads debuted recently at the 29th annual
International Juvenile Products Show in Dallas _ perhaps the only
place to see businessmen pulling potty-training seats out of their
briefcases.
</P>
<P>
   Innovations, real and hyped, abounded inside the International
Apparel Mart, where retailers (a k a ``buyers'' in industry lingo)
flocked to view the latest offerings from 340 kid-stuff companies.
Most of the new items will be introduced in stores within several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some people might dismiss Splat Shields,
Baby-Coo-Shoes and Preemie Gift Sets as so much materialistic
hooey, fobbed on self-conscious consumers by a capitalist
conspiracy determined to make parents feel inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, those Rattlin' Toes play socks were sooooo cute!
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and how about the mountain-gear-inspired baby jumper on the
bungee cord? So very Everest! Plus, wouldn't it be cruel to force a
kid to eat off plain dinnerware when Todd Parr's zoo animals can
make mashed peas chic?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it was easy to get caught up in the everything-for-baby
frenzy, even for the pre-parenthood attendee. Some of this stuff
appeared truly revolutionary. Take the Bizzy Belt, a colorful gizmo
with three Velcro straps, two for toy attachments and one for a
bottle. The belt aims to prevent Junior from chucking his pacifier
into Grandma's soup.
</P>
<P>
   Avent, a company out of Illinois, thinks it has revolutionized
the breast-feeding industry with its Isis breast pump, which looks
a little like a space-age air horn. No batteries, no electricity,
and ``petal massagers'' to stimulate milk flow. Inside the Avent
booth, the Isis is displayed like a crown jewel, in a clear
rotating case, surrounded by business people intent on talking
``suction.''
</P>
<P>
   A crib is a crib is a crib, right? Not so to Jean Kasem,
significant other to Casey ``Countdown'' Kasem and baby
entrepreneur. Kasem's Little Miss Liberty Round Crib Co. of Beverly
Hills exceeds the everyday, to say the least. The booth's featured
item, denoted by flashing red spotlights and a Harley-Davidson
motorcycle parked crib-side, is the '70s Rock-N-Roll, an all-chrome
baby bed with canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Round cribs mimic the shape of the womb and aren't as scary to
new dads, Kasem says, especially when the beds come in steel. Kasem
describes her coordinating infant bedding line as breaking the mold
when it comes to dust ruffles and comforters: ``I'm more of a
wildcatter.''
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: strollers.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmaljunga booth is akin to a Bentley showroom, with lots of
shiny chrome ``chassis'' and hunter-green fabrics. The Emmaljungas,
made in Sweden, look like fancy shopping carts with hoods and have
names such as the Viking and the Jupiter. The company woos
prospective clients into its lair with tavern games: score 62
points shooting a basketball through a bottomless bassinet and win
free delivery!
</P>
<P>
   Baby goes high tech with e-Stork, the kind of idea that makes
the rest of us dullards smack our heads and whine, ``Why didn't I
think of that?'' For $40, Kathryn and David Besemer will whip up a
Web page for your new arrival with a private Internet address to
send to friends and family. Pick a design, fill out the stats and
send the Besemers up to eight photos with captions. Within three
days, you'll have an e-kid.
</P>
<P>
   For a few bucks more, the Besemers will add a 30-second sound
clip, a Ga-Ga Byte, and/or a 30-second video, er, ``kideo.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety category runneth over with sun shields (for car
seats, strollers and joggers) and fireplace cushions (to protect
kids from brick and stone edges). The Door Mouse prevents toddlers
from slamming doors on their fingers. The BuckleAlert!, an industry
award winner, lets parents know each time a child buckles or
unbuckles her seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   A few fledgling manufacturers had no booths and worked the show
like strolling minstrels. Dallasite Michael Carr, scanning the
crowd for potential opportunities, nabbed this reporter with the
promise of a breaking story. Carr then introduced said reporter to
his wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   From her black vinyl bag, Laura Carr pulled an entrepreneurial
inspiration that was several years in the making. The TeePee Cover
consists of a band of plastic the width of a toilet paper roll that
Velcros into place, adjusting to the size of the roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boys both liked to take wads of toilet paper and stuff it
in their mouths,'' Laura Carr explains. The TeePee Cover basically
prevents t.p. tampering, and retails for $9.95 through the
Perfectly Safe catalog.
</P>
<P>
   It all begs the question: How did parents ever get by without
this stuff?

AMY, LIKE OTHER CHILDREN WITH AIDS, TRIES TO KEEP SICKNESS SECRET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The little girl is telling you that her life is normal but don't
use her name, don't mention the name of her school or where she
lives.
</P>
<P>
   And in a way, it is true. Her life is normal. Like most little
girls her age, she loves to roller skate, loves pink, loves Barbie
and ``The Little Mermaid.'' She dreams of becoming a ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   But there on the kitchen counter are the medicine bottles.
Zerit. Epivir. Prilosec and three others. These, you might say, are
the keepers of her anonymity, because as long as she can keep the
pills down, no one will know she is the little girl with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   So let's call her Amy.
</P>
<P>
   Amy is 11, and after her mother died, doctors discovered she was
a carrier of the deadly virus, the same virus that killed her
mother. Now Amy lives with her sister, the same sister who has
cared for her since she was a toddler because her mother had her
mind on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strange the way it happened,'' Amy's sister remembered.
``One day we were planning my mom's funeral and the next day (Amy)
started showing signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy was 8 years old and suddenly, without warning, she was
feeling tired, throwing up, breaking out in cold sweats. She went
from 60 pounds to 40 in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1996. Now, more than two years later, no one can say
for sure how Amy contracted the deadly virus. Her sister believes
it was transmitted perinatally from their mother.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, Amy's case is not unique. More than half of
pediatric AIDS cases in the United States are the result of
maternal transmission, said Peter Velasco, director of
communications for the National Minority AIDS Council. And despite
steep declines _ some 43 percent, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta _ between 1992 and 1996,
the majority of perinatally acquired AIDS cases continues to occur
among Hispanic and African-American children. Amy is one of the
African-American cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, in the United States, this type of situation is
still too common,'' said David Harvey, executive director of the
AIDS Policy Center for Children, Youth and Families. ``Women are
learning about their HIV status after they're diagnosed with HIV,
and in this situation we have a child who was totally missed until
after her mother, sadly, passed away.''
</P>
<P>
   TRUST AND BETRAYAL: She's never laid eyes on you before, but Amy
talks as if you're her best friend. She handles every question
about her life with the ease of a trained speech writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told one girl once that I had HIV, and when she got mad at
me for something, she told,'' Amy said matter-of-factly. ``I had to
transfer to another school.''
</P>
<P>
   HIV, she says, makes her different, makes it difficult for other
people to accept her. So no one must know she has AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Amy wants to tell her story so that people understand
that although she is sick, she is still just a little girl. She
also wants people to know that AIDS is still a disease to be
reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Amy says she understands what having AIDS means. She understands
that there is no cure and that she might die. But the two sisters
say they don't talk about an end, because they are not without
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I just haven't looked at the downside,'' said Amy's
sister, who supports the pair with her salary from a part-time job
and Social Security and SSI payments. ``I really don't think it'll
come to that point. I just have so much hope, because she's doing
really good.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Amy says, she leads a relatively normal life.
She has friends over for sleepovers, she was recently treated to a
trip to Disney World, and she enjoys watching movies. She can even
cook some things, like noodles and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   For this story, she shared her scrambled egg recipe. ``I get a
bowl and crack the eggs,'' she explained. ``I mix it and put salt
and pepper in it and pour it in a skillet. Don't let it sit there.
You got to keep them moving so they won't stick.''
</P>
<P>
   `LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE': As of December 1997, there were 8,086
reported pediatric AIDS cases in the United States. Of those,
Velasco said, 23 percent were Hispanic, 18 percent Anglo and 58
percent African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, more than 50 percent of black children with AIDS
were infected by a mother using drugs. Many of them mature into
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge these children face is that in some cases, they
live longer than their parents,'' said Harvey. ``So, in addition to
dealing with very significant death and loss in their family, they
also must endure ongoing chronic health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even something as simple as a cold can pose serious problems for
children with AIDS. Amy's sister monitors situations like these
closely, she said. Otherwise, Amy is ``fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do stuff like normal people,'' she said. ``Everything
like playing with my friends, roller skating, jumping rope and
playing in the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are things about her life, about living with AIDS,
that Amy doesn't like. Taking medicine is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Amy takes six pills twice a day, with water or juice. Unless she
gets sick, she has to see her doctor once a month, more often if
her blood count falls and she needs a transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, her sister said, Amy quietly refused to take her
medication, hiding the pills or replacing them in the bottle when
she wasn't looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stress the importance of her taking her medicine,''
her sister said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a common problem among pediatric AIDS patients, Velasco
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to get children to comply to such strict
medical regimens,'' he said. ``To deal with that, a lot of
companies are trying to test drugs more on infants and develop
liquid medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials say, significant advances have been made
recently in preventing HIV infection in newborns by offering
therapy options such as zidovudine, commonly known as AZT, to
expectant mothers during pregnancy, labor and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the focus on prevention of transmission, Harvey
worries that children living with HIV and AIDS might be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think the pediatric AIDS epidemic is over,'' he said.
``They are wrong.''

   HILLSBORO, Texas _ The paranormal has long been a fascinating
subject, but when it comes to being in close proximity with such
activity, I'll admit it: I'm a fraidy-cat.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the lamp next to my bed stayed on when I recently
spent the night at Hillsboro's Tarlton House of 1895. I was
spending the night alone on the third floor, exactly where the
house's builder supposedly had committed suicide some 50 years
before.
</P>
<P>
   I had known the house's history. I had heard stories and read
journal reports of former guests who had heard and seen things go
boo in the night. And yes, it all creeped me out a little too much.
</P>
<P>
   Each time I awoke during the night _ a strange phenomenon itself
for this rock-solid sleeper _ I looked around the room and checked
the shadows before closing my eyes again.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarlton House is one of many buildings in Texas with a few
good ghost stories in the attic. While many concern buildings long
vacant, old hotels or residential homes, some involve houses that
today serve as bed-and-breakfasts, offering exquisite
accommodations, tantalizing comfort food _ and a slight walk on the
ectoplasmic side, which, lit lamp notwithstanding, is exactly what
I came for.
</P>
<P>
   The `friendly ghosts': I took an extra breath the afternoon
before, and then rang the doorbell of the Queen Anne Victorian
mansion. Complete with ornate gables, dormers, grand chimneys and a
landscape full of leaf-shedding trees, the Tarlton House was the
very picture of a horror movie house.
</P>
<P>
   The only missing elements were thunder and lightning. And the
hunchbacked butler.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I was greeted by the sweet, smiling face of Pat
Lovelace, who, with her husband, Bill, bought the house and took
over the establishment in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovelaces are the fourth owners since the Rhodes family
converted the house to a bed-and-breakfast in 1985. But they're
only two in a long line of owners since Greene Duke Tarlton first
built the estate more than 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tarlton moved to Hillsboro from Louisiana, bringing with him
such architectural innovations as a cypress foundation and
triple-hung shutters. Other interior details of note include
molding, archways, banisters and mammoth sliding doors crafted of
Texas pine, and seven coal-burning fireplaces, three of which are
on the first floor and feature both tile work imported from Italy
and ornately carved oak mantels. One, in the front sitting room,
showcases classic egg-and-dart molding, a style that originated in
ancient Greece and was widely used in medieval and then late-1800s
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer and son of a physician, Tarlton had seven kids with his
two wives. One child died at age 2; another died during childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons unknown, his second wife refused to live in the
house and had a smaller frame house built next door, where she and
Mr. Tarlton stayed. The children stayed in the big house with the
governess.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the ghost stories start. In 1931, the second wife
died of pneumonia. The next day, Tarlton's body was found in the
third-floor attic. The obituary cited pneumonia as the cause, but
the rumor was that it was really suicide. Tarlton had just lost not
only the woman he loved, but also most of his money in the stock
market crash.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, the children had grown and moved away, and for the
most part the house remained vacant for years until the 1950s, when
it became a boardinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the '70s, the Morris family purchased it. In a June
1998 B&AMP;B journal entry, Cari Hester, the Morris' granddaughter, who
spent the night in the second-floor Floral Suite, wrote that she
remembered staying at the house as a child and her grandmother
talking about ``the friendly ghosts'' most often seen, heard or
felt in the attic, which has since been remodeled to accommodate
guests in three rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Hester's writing, her friend Josephine wrote: ``I heard
conversations from 12:30 a.m. (to) 3 a.m. of a man and woman
talking in another room. I never felt threatened, just that they
were a friendly presence that was a part of this house.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Moyer, the Rhodes' former housekeeper, who now provides a
massage service to the bed-and-breakfast guests, says that she was
once making the bed in the third floor's Tower Suite when, at the
other end of the hall, she saw Tarlton, hands on knees and sporting
a ghoulish grin. When she went downstairs to check on her son,
William, he talked about the ``other children'' in the house he had
been playing with.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer insists she and her son were alone in the house at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight months since Pat Lovelace bought the house,
unexplained incidents have continued to abound, she says. One guest
saw a little girl in a white dress and bow walking down the stairs.
In Abby's Attic _ the room where Lovelace believes Tarlton killed
himself _ guests have said that they've felt someone pulling on the
sheets and patting the end of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Despite such stories, or perhaps because of them, the house has
been very successful as a B&AMP;B. It boasts seven full guest rooms and
one smaller guest space, the Duck Loft. Each room has a bathroom
with claw-footed bathtub and/or shower. The Lovelaces also
occasionally host Murder Mystery weekends at the house, in which
game-players investigate the untimely demise of one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelace, who describes herself as one who takes a holistic
approach to life, says that she hasn't experienced anything
paranormal herself, but she's open to it. ``I think of myself as
spiritual, but also pretty grounded,'' she says. ``If there are
ghosts here, they're comforting ones.''
</P>
<P>
   `BE KIND TO HIM': The truth is, I'd rather not see a ghost at
all, comforting though he or she may be. I was uneasy as I went to
sleep that night as the sole guest at the Tarlton House. Though I
chose the Tower Suite, I also chose to sleep on the side of the bed
from which I couldn't look down that hall where Moyer claims she
saw a sneering Mr. Tarlton.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the journal entries before I went to sleep, I thought
about what 12-year-old Matt recently wrote in the diary of the
haunted B&AMP;B: ``We saw it walking from the hall to the bathroom and
back. Three of us saw it in the same place at once. He's not
harmful, he's friendly. Be kind to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyish imagination aside, it didn't sound like he was writing
about the household cats.

   THE HIGHLANDS MANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A former Confederate soldier, Basil ``B.C.'' Clark built this
glorious Victorian house in Marlin for his wife, Sallie, in 1900.
The outstanding feature is the living room's 50-foot-high ceiling,
topped with the original stained-glass dome. The glasswork shows
cherubs, all but one with eyes closed, holding a leafy branch
shaped like the letter C _ for Basil and Sallie Clark, and now,
coincidentally, for Don and Dorothy Cline, the current owners.
</P>
<P>
   The bed-and-breakfast has five stately guest rooms, each
furnished with Victorian antiques.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, it apparently also has some ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Basil Clark was found dead on the premises in
1915, the victim of a 10-gauge shotgun wound. While reports were
that it was a suicide, the weapon was delicately _ and mysteriously
_ laid across his chest, something that could not have happened had
he shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the widowed Sallie, an outgoing socialite known for
always having a flask in one hand and a young stud on her arm,
moved to California with her adopted son Rat (so nicknamed, it's
said, because he gnawed off most of his toes as a child). After
Sallie died, her body was shipped back to Marlin, where it's buried
next that of her beloved dog.
</P>
<P>
   Among other paranormal sightings, Don Cline reports that former
residents and guests have seen the figure of a child standing under
a tree in the front yard and that one man felt something physically
shaking his bed. The next-door neighbors claim to have heard a
tapping at one of their windows, only to look out and see a lady in
white pointing toward the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous and lengthy poem called The Clarks of Highland
Acres tells a lot about the house and its early days, including the
fact that one of the carpenters who helped construct the dwelling
had but one arm _ and a hammer attached to the stub of the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should these walls tell of days gone forever,
</P>
<P>
   Would these ceilings speak of what they have seen;
</P>
<P>
   Could the windows reveal what is hidden,
</P>
<P>
   When the acres are again turning green?''

   WHITE OAK MANOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, a little girl died in this quaint Greek Revival
home. Rose bushes are continually planted on the grounds in her
memory. A friend of writer Clara Jones also died here, but today,
the most eerie thing about the manor is the massive 200-year-old
white oak tree in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   The Judge's Chambers on the second floor feature a bay window
facing the tree. Its long, fingerlike branches come eerily close to
the admirer, reminding at least one reporter of the famed
``Poltergeist'' tree.
</P>
<P>
   If it were violently storming _ and if that bed weren't so
comfortable and wouldn't make you instantly fall asleep _ that tree
would keep many a guest awake at night, wondering what would happen
if the tree took an evil turn.
</P>
<P>
   The home is just one of the spooky historic buildings in the
small and haunted town. While you're there, stop by the Excelsior
hotel, the oldest in the state. Rumor has it that Steven Spielberg
made his crew leave the hotel during the filming of ``Sugarland
Express'' when the rocking chair in his room seemed to take on an
(after)life of its own.

THE PUMPKIN ESCAPES FROM THE PIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: recipes in 2ndtake)  
 (bl)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During its brief season, the pumpkin lives literally
for the holidays. Most people know it as pie _ flaky pastry with a
dark, miraculously heavy filling of spices, cream, pumpkin and
sugar. Traditional, yes. But the pumpkin has much more to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the potato, the pumpkin is the most malleable and
perhaps the most dynamic of autumn foods. It can be cut into cubes
and sauteed so that it remains firm. It can be braised in a meat
dish, absorbing the cooking juices and slackening its shape. It can
be mashed and left chunky and starchy. It can be pureed and thinned
to a silky sauce.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most interesting of all, it teeters between sweet
and savory, fruit and vegetable. Though it tastes vegetal, it
welcomes sugar as readily as salt and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not sink into the shadows of a dish. The pumpkin has
big flavor, which allows it to withstand both adornment and
austerity. Consider two dishes at the restaurant Etats-Unis on
Manhattan's Upper East Side. In a pot roast of beef with apples,
chilies and bacon, slabs of pumpkin soak in the cooking juices,
absorbing some of the heat of the chilies but maintaining their own
raw integrity. And in a twice-baked souffleed pumpkin pudding,
cubes of pumpkin are enveloped in a rich, creamy cloud flavored
with Roquefort. But the pumpkin is not lost: you can taste a little
in every bite.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a pumpkin is nothing without a creative cook. Pumpkin
puree and pumpkin soup are on the menus at countless New York
restaurants, but a few chefs have managed to extract its essence in
original ways _ ways that may prompt a reconsideration of the
Thanksgiving menu.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Brennan, the chef at Picholine, on West 64th Street,
makes pumpkin-prune pancakes that are absolutely ethereal. Oddly
shaped and thin, they are as light as whipped cream on the tongue,
their rich, buttery pumpkin flavor a sly touch. Brennan serves them
with slices of venison and shredded Brussels sprouts sauteed with
minuscule cubes of bacon, apple and pumpkin. But Brennan said the
pancakes, which he drops like batter into a nonstick pan and
quickly sautes, would also go well with turkey.
</P>
<P>
   At 27 Standard on East 27th Street, Babette Audante, the chef,
takes an unusual tack with soup, using pumpkin as a garnish rather
than the base. Chunks of bright orange roasted pumpkin rest like an
island in the middle of an earth-colored Jerusalem artichoke soup.
It is soothing and rich, and the sweetness of the artichokes
challenges that of the pumpkin, keeping each bite interesting.
</P>
<P>
   A dish at Savoy in Soho is a reminder that pumpkin can also
stand alone, honest and untethered. David Wurth, the chef de
cuisine, roasts slices of pumpkin with a little olive oil, salt and
pepper and serves them alongside a leafy salad of mustard greens
sprinkled with nut oil and walnut pieces and a smear of soft curd
goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Wurth, Brennan and many other chefs favor the cheese pumpkin, an
heirloom variety that has been resurrected in restaurant kitchens
over the past few years. It is flat, with a pinkish-tan skin, and
usually weighs five to eight pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's oranger, it's brighter and it's denser,'' Brennan said,
``so you can add things to it without it losing its flavor. You can
puree it, add a little cream or chicken stock, and the flavor
doesn't get diluted.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the cheese pumpkin is not widely available, it is sold in
many green markets and some specialty stores. Joel Patraker, the
assistant director of the Greenmarket program in New York City,
suggested looking for one without gashes or bruises and with the
stem still attached. If it has soft spots or discoloration, but all
you're planning to do is chop it up for soup, ``then just negotiate
for a better price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs have also taken to a small, squat pumpkin called the
Jack-Be-Little. It is about the size of a bagel and its meat is
gently flavored and plentiful, so it can be roasted or steamed
whole, and it makes a perfect serving for one. It is available at
most green markets and grocery stores, and even at garden centers.
(Some Jack-Be-Littles, though, are grown for decorative purposes,
so it's best to ask if they have been treated with chemicals.)
</P>
<P>
   Bill Telepan, the chef at Judson Grill, on West 52nd Street, has
created a devilish dish with this tiny pumpkin, inspired by a
recipe by Andre Daguin, formerly a chef in Auch, France, in which a
large pumpkin is baked with foie gras. Telepan fills a
Jack-Be-Little with foie gras and roasts it. Once it cools, he
scrapes the fat off the top and mixes it with chopped hazelnuts,
walnuts and herbs. The pumpkin is served warm, with quenelles of
the hazelnut mixture on the side. Warm, thin toast is provided for
transporting it all. It's too bad beds aren't, too, because, though
the dish is delicious, that's about all you can handle afterward.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to dessert, chefs find themselves on shakier
ground. Tempted by heady spices like nutmeg and cinnamon and rich
fillers like eggs, evaporated milk and heavy cream, it is just too
easy to make a stodgy pumpkin dessert _ like many pumpkin pies,
pumpkin cheesecakes and pumpkin mousses.
</P>
<P>
   Early American settlers are not to blame for the leaden pumpkin
pie that started it all. ``Actually, contrary to popular wisdom,''
said Karen Hess, a culinary historian in Manhattan, ``pumpkin pies
were made in England long ago, in the late Elizabethan period.''
And though the pumpkin pie was not part of the original
Thanksgiving meal, she said, settlers probably began making it soon
after for the holiday. ``It's the right season _ put it that way,''
she said. ``The pumpkins were there and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hundred years later, chefs are beginning to toss
tradition aside. The pumpkin desserts at Picholine, for instance,
are exuberant and refined, and only tinged with nostalgia. And they
can teach anyone a thing or two about pumpkin. For instance, while
most pumpkin ice creams are all about pumpkin and spice, Damon
Brunette, the pastry chef, makes one that is like an eggy custard.
The flavor of pumpkin surfaces only after a few moments. He serves
it with a scoop of equally subtle chestnut ice cream on top of a
flat sugar-coated puff pastry cookie.
</P>
<P>
   And his roasted Jack-Be-Little pumpkin with a maple panna cotta
is so gorgeous you almost don't want to eat it. First he bakes the
miniature pumpkins, filled with a spiced milk to infuse the flesh.
He discards the milk, then refills them with a maple cream that is
so fragile an autumn breeze could break it apart. Around the
pumpkin are strewn a compote of glistening prunes, apricots, figs
and cherries like a scattering of fallen leaves.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps the most finessed pumpkin dish around. And maybe
it's not the most reverent dish to serve on Thanksgiving Day. But
it shows the dimension the pumpkin has, and frankly I'd take it any
day over a pumpkin pie.

   WASHINGTON _ Former Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis
Sullivan on Tuesday announced the formation of a new nonprofit
advisory group, which Sullivan said will inject ``dispassionate
analysis'' into emerging public health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, now president of Morehouse Medical School in Atlanta,
said the group's first initiative will be to host a daylong
workshop on children's health next month.
</P>
<P>
   Other medical school researchers and former government health
officials will join Sullivan as ``distinguished fellows'' of the
organization, which will be known as the Public Health Policy
Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said his regret over decisions he had to make as HHS
secretary on the issue of silicone breast implants _ decisions he
now believes were wrong _ was part of his reason for setting up the
new group.
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns that they could leak and cause immune system
disorders, silicone breast implants were suspended from the market
by the Food and Drug Administration in 1992, when Sullivan was HHS
secretary under then-President Bush. The issue of their safety
remains controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced to make some decisions in the absence of health
data,'' Sullivan said of the silicone breast implant issue.
``Subsequent studies have shown there's no scientific basis for
believing immune problems result from silicone breast implants.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to issuing policy recommendations, the group will
offer scientific symposia and workshops and host ``town hall''
discussions of health issues, Sullivan said. Funding will come from
grants from the National Institutes of Health, foundations,
corporations and industry associations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an independent body which establishes its own
agenda,'' he said. ``We will draw from the best scientific data
available. We will not be pro-industry or anti-industry. We will be
pro-public health.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Sullivan on the group's distinguished fellows are:
former National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety
director J. Donald Millar of Atlanta; epidemiology professor
Patricia Buffler of the University of California-Berkeley; John
Graham, director of the Harvard University Center for Risk
Analysis; Maria New, chair of the department of pediatrics of
Cornell Medical Center in New York; and former U.S. Surgeon General
Antonia Novello.
</P>
<P>
   The children's health workshop will be at the National Academy
of Sciences Dec. 10.

ANGRY MALAYSIA LASHES OUT AT GORE'S CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Declaring that it would hold the United
States responsible for outbreaks of ``lawlessness,'' Malaysia
Tuesday excoriated Vice President Al Gore for a speech here in
which he praised simmering protests against Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Malaysia's foreign minister said that Gore's
remarks on Monday were a ``gross interference in the internal
affairs of the country and a brazen violation of the basic tenets
of relations between sovereign states.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Malaysians hold dearly the harmony and stability which they
have painstakingly built up through the years,'' said the foreign
minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. ``Malaysians would hold the United
States accountable for any rupture of harmony arising from this
irresponsible incitement.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at a regional summit meeting of Pacific Rim
countries, Gore accused Malaysia of suppressing freedom.
</P>
<P>
   As Mahathir and other Malaysian officials seethed in the
audience, Gore saluted anti-government protesters as brave people.
He even invoked the rallying cry ``reformasi,'' which was coined
during Indonesia's student movement and is now chanted here to
protest the jailing of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister,
Anwar Ibrahim who is being tried on sex-related and corruption
charges. He was ousted in September after a power struggle with
Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's blunt words, and Malaysia's enraged reaction, have left
this meeting of Pacific Rim nations in a shambles. At the
gathering, called the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
discussions of how to lower trade barriers or rein in global
capital flows were scarcely heard Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there were sharp divisions over whether the vice
president had taken a principled stand in defense of human rights
or hijacked a meeting intended to be devoted to the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's prime minister, Jenny Shipley, accused Gore of
practicing ``megaphone diplomacy,'' while officials from Singapore
and China offered more subtle criticism of the speech _ reaffirming
that they would stick to economic matters and not wade into the
affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   However, the President of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada, said
in an interview, ``I feel the same way as the Vice President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't interfere in Malaysia's domestic problems, but I've
said human rights and due process of law transcend all
boundaries,'' said Estrada, who earlier threatened to boycott the
meeting to protest Anwar's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, Estrada met with Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah
Wan Ismail, defying a stern warning by Mahathir that visiting
dignitaries should not use the summit meeting to get involved in
the Anwar dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her that it was a great sacrifice on the part of Anwar
for the future of freedom,'' Estrada said of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't tell you if he will receive a fair trial.
Hopefully because of the media, it will help.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gore's speech was meant to be a call to arms, however, it had
a muffled echo on the streets of Kuala Lumpur. About 500 people
gathered in a neighborhood near Gore's hotel this evening to chant
and wave placards calling for Mahathir to step down. But they did
not carry through on a threat to march to the luxury hotel where
the Vice President was staying.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have assembled in front of a mosque here nearly every
weekend since Anwar was arrested. And while this was the first
rally held during the week, it lacked the size or intensity of
previous protests.
</P>
<P>
   People here said the demonstrators may have been discouraged by
a phalanx of riot policemen who stood three deep across the road,
wielding bamboo batons and glaring from behind plastic shields. Two
red trucks with high-pressure water cannon stood as a silent
warning in front of the police barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters said they were heartened by Gore's remarks. ``It
helped our emotions,'' said a middle-aged woman who would give only
her first name, Marina. ``It helped inspire people.'' She said that
when she and her friends saw a tape of the Gore speech on CNN, they
broke into cries of ``reformasi.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some political analysts who support Anwar said they
were troubled by the stridency of the speech. They said Gore might
have played into the hands of Mahathir, who has used anti-Western
jeremiads for years as a means to galvanize his mostly rural
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This speech may have given ammunition to Mahathir to discredit
the reform movement, in the sense that he can now say it is
sponsored by the U.S.,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of
political science at the University of Malaya.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir did not respond to Gore's remarks _ ignoring shouted
questions as he and leaders of 20 other nations posed for photos
before meeting in a Moorish-style hotel on the outskirts of Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Gore contended that the vice president's speech was
no different from President Clinton's performance in Beijing last
July, when he pointedly challenged the Chinese government's human
rights record in a televised news conference with President Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the furor over his words, Gore did not retreat
Tuesday. ``My point is very simple,'' he said. ``These economies
have some very difficult choices to make. Democracy and freedom are
essential prerequisites for making those choices.''

MINING THE RELICS OF JOURNEYS PAST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22)

 Christa Worthington writes about the arts, antiques and design.  
 By CHRISTA WORTHINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the legions who drive sport utility vehicles to
work on Wall Street, wear high-tech mountain gear to suburban
barbecues and keep Jon Krakauer's Everest adventure story, ``Into
Thin Air,'' on the best-seller list, another spectator sport is
catching on: collecting exploration art.
</P>
<P>
   That rubric covers the paraphernalia used by the great explorers
_ their oxygen cylinders, packing crates, rations cups, Holy Bibles
and climbing shoes _ as well as photographs, paintings, maps and
charts, many of which were drawn on the spot of previously
uncharted terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The genre spans nearly 500 years of exploration from the early
sea voyages of the 1400s to the Everest climbs of the 1950s. But
only recently have such artifacts been marketed under the heading
of exploration art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a whole new audience of people who are just
interested in that word exploration,'' said Nicholas Lambourn,
associate director at Christie's. ``It reflects what's going on in
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Lambourn began ``Exploration and Travel,'' a sale
held twice a year at Christie's in London, featuring topographical
pictures, books and manuscripts. Selling the idea of exploration,
Lambourn added, ``has brought us new material, especially from the
Antarctic field.''
</P>
<P>
   While map and book collectors are generally interested only in
the objects themselves, fans of exploration art are often attracted
by the narratives they evoke _ the more harrowing the better. ``The
Ravine of the Desert,'' an 1838 landscape, set in Mexico, by the
British painter Daniel Thomas Egerton, commanded $243,193 at a
recent Christie's sale. The biographical detail that the artist and
his female companion were murdered there by bandits in 1842 no
doubt buoyed the price.
</P>
<P>
   Anything touched by a famous explorer has a talismanic quality.
A plywood packing case is a treasure if it traveled with the
British adventurer Sir Ernest Shackleton on his Nimrod expedition
to the South Pole in 1907. It sold at Christie's last year for
$20,000 _ 20 times the pre-sale estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Relics related to the Antarctic martyr, the gallant Capt.
Lawrence E.G. Oates, a volunteer on the British explorer Robert
Scott's final expedition to the South Pole, have a following among
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Slowed by frostbite, Oates sacrificed himself by walking out
into a blizzard so that the others in the party could continue.
(They eventually perished, too.) ``I'm just going out now, and I
may be some time,'' Oates had famously said. Even a monogrammed
canvas bathtub he used in the Boer War recently fetched $2,898.
</P>
<P>
   Other oddball artifacts have new viability on the market: petrol
lanterns and medicine bottles, for example, left behind in huts
blackened by blubber-fueled fires. At a recent Christie's auction,
two pair of woolen mittens belonging to the commanding officer of
the Commonwealth Transarctic expedition of 1955-1958 were part of a
lot that sold for about $575.
</P>
<P>
   But exploration art has come to comprise more than historical
artifacts. With the globe now thoroughly conquered, the concept of
exploration has branched into the surreal. Witness the installation
artists Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick, who joyfully document
explorations that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently they depicted an imaginary Siberian expedition
undertaken by a so-called Royal Excavation Corps.
</P>
<P>
   It is recorded with panoramic, sepia-toned photographs and
diaries along with texts awash in magic realism and artifacts like
a bark covered in python skin. Photographs stamped with the the
corps' ``official'' seal feature actors dressed as explorers and a
local shaman; the pictures are creased in the manner of old charts
that were carried and abused en route.
</P>
<P>
   Antique postcards are altered for the artists' purposes, and
some of the picaresque protagonists depicted in the plot did exist
in life. Called ``The Circular River: the Siberian Expedition
1944-46,'' the work is on display at Monique Knowlton gallery in
Soho through next Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is a giant forgery,'' said Kahn, 34. ``We
don't mind it being known as a forgery as long as no one asks how
we do it or which characters are real.'' The team's works have been
bought by the Fogg Museum of Art at Harvard University and the
Philadelphia Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the next frontier in exploration-art collecting?
Artifacts of early aviation, including canvas fragments from old
planes and hot-air balloons, are avidly sought. Atlases of sea
charts are more popular than maps because they have actually been
used by navigators during a voyage, said Selby Kiffer, senior vice
president of American manuscripts at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Space artifacts, too, have been tapped by Sotheby's, in a 1993
sale of memorabilia from the Russian space program. Among the items
were satellites, space suits and moon dust, which alone sold for
$440,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kiffer suggested that arm-chair adventurers might next turn
their attention to explorations below the sea. ``The field I
haven't seen much in is undersea exploration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe Kahn and Selesnick have it right: all that's really
left to be explored is the mind.

FLAMBOYANT HEIRESS' WARDROBE TO BE SOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To the unsophisticated, the beaded jacket and
floor-length skirt is a pale lime green. But this is couture, a
Mary McFadden original.
</P>
<P>
   At $3,000, designer outfits are never lime. The color is celadon
_ a delicate green.
</P>
<P>
   The evening ensemble belonged to Margaret Lesher, whose
mysterious drowning death last year in an Arizona lake got more
headlines than her life as a flamboyant heiress and socialite.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, much of Lesher's extraordinary wardrobe _
appraised at $1 million _ will go on sale at Labels, a new
consignment boutique in Walnut Creek, Calif., that specializes in
upscale and designer women's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   For the fashion set, the budget-minded and the nosy, The
Margaret Lesher Wardrobe Collection is a heady event, with more
than 300 eager shoppers jamming the store's phone lines since the
sale was publicized on a television news program weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The entire 1,200-square-foot store will be dedicated exclusively
to Lesher's outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving it a full curtain-call,'' said Lynn Hayworth, 29,
the store's owner, who has spent a month inventorying and pricing
the two truck-loads of garments.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, this weekend's sale is only about half of the
heiress's entire wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel, Oscar de la Renta, Escada, Scaasi, Versace, St. John,
and Mondi are just a few of the designers whose suits and gowns
filled the four, room-sized closets in Lesher's Orinda mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Until January, the sale will feature only Lesher's fall and
holiday clothing, her evening gowns, and her skiwear _ 1,000
outfits, 400 pairs of shoes, 100 handbags, 50 of her trademark
hats, 150 scarves and belts, and 1,000 pieces of costume jewelry,
and still counting.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is like a museum showcasing the wonders of needle
and thread _ and a bottomless wallet. Trim of beads, sequins,
rhinestones, embroidery and pearls. Leopard prints, suede tassles,
silk ruffles, mink tails, feather boas, braided epaulets. Patent
leather, Mongolian lamb, cowhide, silver fox, ostrich and
crocodile. Silk, satin, lace and wool of every color and texture.
Everything imaginable _ except, of course, polyester.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like every girl's dream, to come in and play dress
up,'' said Cherie Curliano, 32, one of the store clerks and an
opera singer, enviously looking at a black lace, ruffled Scaasi
gown with a Spanish flamenco look.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was doing opera,'' she added wistfully, ``I'd wear this
to play Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the outfits look like they've never been worn, and some
of them haven't. Price tags still dangle from the sleeves of
several suits _ like the $4,685 Neiman Marcus tag on the
three-piece Chanel suit of black and sable plaid with cabochon
buttons and a coppery-gold lame blouse.
</P>
<P>
   The outfits will be sold at about one-third of their original
price, a bargain for some folks, but hardly cheap. The Mary
McFadden ensemble will be one of the most expensive. And although
some costume jewelry and knockabout sandals will be priced as low
as $8, the average price will still be high, in the $700 to $800
range, Hayworth said.
</P>
<P>
   For women who can afford to drop a mortgage payment on a jacket,
there is something in every size, from 4 to 14. Alas, aspiring
Cinderellas must be a shoe size of 9 or 9 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The sale begins Saturday night with an invitation-only gala,
with another champagne and hors d'oeuvres party early Sunday. Later
Sunday, the doors will open to the public. The sale will continue,
refreshed by new arrivals, for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   The western wear favored by the former Texas beauty queen who
died while on a camping trip with her new cowboy husband won't go
on sale until January. A few months later, Lesher's spring outfits
and swimwear will be on display.
</P>
<P>
   Lesher's estate will get the bulk of the profits from the sale,
but some of the proceeds from this weekend's events will go to one
of her favorite charities, the Battered Women's Alternative, a
nonprofit group for victims of domestic abuse.

THE JFK ASSASSINATION, REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conspiracy buffs won't leave President John F.
Kennedy's murder alone, thanks to Oliver Stone, assassination
conferences, the release of formerly confidential government
documents and even an offensive new book that blames his death on
First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday it will be 35 years since JFK died in a Dallas
motorcade from a rifle bullet that shattered his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about what really happened that terrible day has
been kept alive all this time by hundreds of books, speeches,
movies and documentaries, ranging from the serious to the
frivolous. And there is no sign that conspiracy fatigue will ever
set in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the theories about who killed Kennedy, and how and why,
are mindless claptrap peddled to make money or attract publicity.
But there are just enough unanswered questions and contradictions
on the record to keep the rumor mill grinding and many Americans
mystified.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to quell persistent public suspicions of a
government coverup, a JFK Assassination Records Review Board was
created by Congress in 1992. Its mandate was to release previously
classified documents that might have any conceivable relationship
to Kennedy's death, which turned out to amount to more than 4
million pages.
</P>
<P>
   The board went out of business this fall apparently without
turning up anything startling, although it will take serious
historians years to sort through the detailed records. Some
suggestive facts were disclosed: Attorney General Robert Kennedy's
involvemenet in trying to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba, for
instance, was confirmed. But that does not prove Castro ordered Lee
Harvey Oswald to kill JFK in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   So many official probes of the assassination have been conducted
at practically every level of government that the paperwork alone
is staggering. Yet no review of the initial Warren Commission
investigation has found convincing evidence that its illustrious
members were wrong to conclude in September 1964 that Oswald,
acting alone, shot JFK.
</P>
<P>
   This has not prevented conspiracy buffs from indulging in all
manner of flights of imagination. They blame the CIA, the FBI,
Lyndon Johnson, Castro, the military industrial complex, the mob,
right-wing fanatics, left-wing fanatics, whatever strikes their
fancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition on Political Assassinations will hold its fifth
annual conference this weekend in Dallas, featuring lectures by
so-called ``experts'' on JFK's death and long-time critics of the
Warren Commission. Plenty of other groups also periodically hold
seminars and conferences to rehash the latest theories and
pseudo-facts.
</P>
<P>
   It is filmmaker Oliver Stone, however, who has done more to
distort the historical record than any other single individual. His
despicable movie ``JFK'' was initially advertised as revealing the
true story about the assassination at last. But it was a vile
slander accusing Johnson of benefiting from a sinister plot by
Vietnam War hawks to kill Kennedy because Kennedy meant to pull out
of the conflict. Even though Stone made that up, a young generation
who never knew Kennedy or Johnson was influenced by its cynical,
unfounded message.
</P>
<P>
   But just when we think we've run through every outrageous
scenario, something else comes along. A new book called ``Oh,no ...
Jackie-O!'' argues that she was so unhappy with her faithless
husband that she plotted with Aristotle Onassis, whom she later
married, to have Kennedy killed. The author writes under the
pseudonym January Jones to keep her identity secret, for which she
has good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, she states flatly that ``no one can prove who killed
Kennedy.'' Nonsense; it was Oswald, and his assassin role has been
proved over and over again. Not even the House Assassinations
Committee, which had set out to question the Oswald conclusion,
came up with a credible alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jones'' repeats a ridiculous old rumor that more than three
shots were fired, suggesting the possibility of a second gunman.
Nonsense again. As the Hearst White House correspondent, I was in
the press bus in Kennedy's motorcade in Dallas that day and I
distinctly heard only three shots.
</P>
<P>
   Her theory is that a love-smitten Onassis, with Jackie's
approval, hired the ``best contract killers in the world'' to take
out Kennedy. She has no evidence, only assumptions about the first
lady's greed and the Greek tycoon's ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, this will probably not be the end of it. Who's left to
accuse? Somebody will think of something.
</P>
<P>
   Correction: Oops. I had a senior moment last week in a column
about the Bush brothers, George W. and Jeb. I wrote that Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis ran against Ronald Reagan in
1980. Dukakis ran in 1988 and was badly beaten by then Vice
President George Bush. Reagan defeated President Jimmy Carter in
1980 and Walter Mondale in 1984.

JOE BAUM'S COMPANY WILL SOLDIER ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Joseph Baum died in October, this city lost one
of its great restaurant legends. But his company remains, as does
his attention-grabbing flair in projects he had been developing
with his partners.
</P>
<P>
   When people think of Joe Baum, many of them think first of the
Rainbow Room, which he reopened in 1987 after two years of
renovation. But before his death, the BE Group, a partnership of
Baum and David Emil and their families) had lost its lease,
effective the end of this year, when Cipriani International will
take over.
</P>
<P>
   As for Windows on the World, the other high-profile space run by
the BE Group, the news is centered on Cellar in the Sky, which has
been closed for months. When it reopens in January, renamed Wild
Blue, it will have an a la carte menu of simple, forthright fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe always wanted a great aged prime steak or a special
lobster dish, and we'll have that,'' said Michael Lomonaco, the
chef.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Immer, the award-winning sommelier, plans to offer scores
of wines by the glass that can be matched with the food. ``But
we're not doing precise matches this time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Blue will be entered directly from the elevator lobby on
the 107th floor, where Milton Glaser's pastel beaded curtain has
now been removed. A warmer, more relaxed decor is being designed by
Larry Bogdanow.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Vogt, who had been the manager of Patroon, has been hired
to manage the Windows on the World restaurants, including Wild
Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Baum was also planning to take American cocktails to London.
Next year, the BE Group will be opening a two-story cocktail lounge
and wine bar with a limited menu near Berkeley Square in London, a
project being designed by David Rockwell. And the group is also
scouting for a restaurant space in midtown Manhattan. Plans are for
Charles Baum, Joseph Baum's son who is the general manager of the
Rainbow Room, to run it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rainbow Room, there will be no New Year's Eve gala this
year, breaking a 10-year tradition. The Rainbow Room will close to
the public after dinner on Dec. 19, and the last private party is
scheduled for Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, Cipriani International will become the new
leaseholder. Giuseppe Cipriani, who heads the company, said the
complex would reopen in about two months after some refurbishing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new management, the Rainbow Room will be used mainly
for private parties and will be open to the public only on Friday
nights and for Sunday brunch. To handle the private parties, the
Cipriani organization has hired Herbert Rose away from the Hotel
Pierre, where he was the catering director.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Room's three levels will be turned into two, to
allow more seating. The Promenade Bar will undergo the biggest
change and become another look-alike branch of Harry's Bar in
Venice, with low tables and chairs. The 40-seat restaurant will
offer the typical Cipriani menu, featuring carpaccio and risotto.
The actual bar will be moved away from the windows, so more tables
will have a view. The restaurant will be open for breakfast, lunch
and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Gone will be the intimate Rainbow and Stars cabaret; that space
will be used as a reception area for private parties. But Cipriani
said that there might eventually be a cabaret in another room.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Room's chef, Waldy Malouf, is planning to open
Waldy's next year at 25 West 56th Street, with Emil. It will be a
190-seat multilevel restaurant with an open kitchen. With its
hearth cooking and showy presentation (whole fish and suckling
pigs), it's another project in which Baum's influence will continue
to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is feeling sad and conscious of the loss of Joe,''
Emil said. ``There's no replacement for Joe.''

 &HT;    FINALLY, THE WORLD HEARS MONICA'S VOICE
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finally, an eavesdropping world heard Monica
Lewinsky's voice on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded, well, ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Giggling at times, sobbing at others, using phrases that evoke
her generation _ ``then I started to feel, like, okay'' _ Lewinsky
speaks in the familiar tones and cadences of millions of young
women from Suburbs, USA, as she discusses her affair with President
Clinton in telephone conversations that she thought were
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The throatier, smoker's voice at the other end of the line _
sometimes motherly, sometimes manipulative _ is that of Linda
Tripp, the middle-aged confidante whose 22 hours of secret tapes
fueled a relentless investigation that moves on to impeachment
hearings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Since transcripts were made public earlier, the tapes released
by the House Judiciary Committee provided little new information.
Even the expletives deleted from the transcript were removed. But
the tapes did answer one of the few remaining questions of the
long-running White House scandal _ what does Monica sound like?
</P>
<P>
   ``If people were looking to hear someone who appeared to be an
airhead, well, that's not the case,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a
member of the Judiciary Committee. Disregarding ``the content'' of
what was being discussed, he said, the women sound ``like two
average citizens talking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans may be somewhat surprised, but (the taped
voices) come across _ unfortunately perhaps _ as very normal,''
said Barr, a leading proponent of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after the earlier Capitol Hill drama surrounding release
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigative findings, the
tapes were largely greeted with a yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, everybody knows what's on these tapes,'' said Joe
Lockhart, the White House press secretary. ``My guess is that most
people around the country won't be paying much attention. But the
people who are obsessed with this story, this will just be a day in
heaven for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes received immediate airplay on MSNBC, CNN, Fox News and
talk radio, where Starr's investigation and the impeachment process
have been programming staples for 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the American people can hear and see evidence
directly, it enhances their understanding'' of the case, said Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the tapes on TV, however, is eerily like
eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tapes represent the American people's best look at how
invasive this investigation has been,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler,
D-Fla., a Judiciary Committee member who opposes impeachment. ``I'm
hearing people say they are repulsed by the very nature of
listening to other people's conversations. In their gut, they know
it's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   With the hindsight from watching the scandal unfold, irony hangs
heavily on many exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm sticking a knife in your back,'' Tripp says _
as she explains why she wouldn't lie under oath about Lewinsky's
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Lewinsky asks, ``You know what's really weird? I
keep hearing these double clicks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my gum,'' said Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, okay,'' said Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Tripp warns Lewinsky, ``I'd be careful what I'd
say on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of the ordinary even extends to the sound track behind
the conversations _ baseball games on TV, or Tripp's dog, Cleo,
making a noisy nuisance of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's voice ranges from sexy, as she rehearses a tape for
Clinton, to mimicking the New York ``coffee talk'' voice from
``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, her words can barely penetrate her sobs. ``My
heart was hurting before. I just can't do this any more,'' she says
at one point.

WALTER WINCHELL ON TV, THE MEDIUM THAT DEFEATED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Few indisputable points can be made about Walter
Winchell. One is that in his day, from the late 1920s to the '50s,
he added extraordinary zest to the language of tabloid journalism.
In his abundantly syndicated column, newly married couples were
``welded'' or ``lohengrinned,'' or ``Adam-and-Eveing it.'' A
pregnant woman was ``infanticipating,'' and with her mate would
soon join ``the mom and population.'' If a couple broke up,
Winchell found them ``sharing separate tepees.''
</P>
<P>
   And all of this would assume huge importance if it happened
anywhere near Broadway, which in his parlance was, of course, ``the
main stem.''
</P>
<P>
   But his creation of a language that caught the gaudy syncopation
of Tinseltown and the Great White Way doesn't come close to
explaining his lingering presence as a cultural benchmark. At the
pinnacle of his success, in the 1940s and early '50s, Winchell's
column appeared in about 2,000 newspapers and his radio program was
the top-rated program on the air, beating out ``Jack Benny'' and
``Fibber McGee and Molly.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter century after Winchell died, lonely and
angry, denuded of power and pen, often reviled and more often only
half remembered, his story has proved to have resonant staying
power _ what he might refer to as long legs. With steady frequency,
writers and filmmakers examine his life, which, in an era drenched
in celebrity journalism, has new relevance.
</P>
<P>
   The latest of their efforts is an HBO movie starring Stanley
Tucci to be shown beginning Saturday. Also in line is Martin
Scorsese, who has an option on Neal Gabler's critically praised
book ``Winchell: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity.''
Michael Herr's fictionalized rendering of Winchell's life remains a
cult favorite. And those who remember what Winchell referred to as
the ``oh so long ago'' can recall Burt Lancaster's ruthless and
somewhat demented version of Winchell, J.J. Hunsecker, in the 1957
film ``Sweet Smell of Success'' and the rat-a-tat-tat cadences of
James Cagney and other actors influenced by Winchell's vocal
rhythms more than half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   His voice was a break-neck staccato. And his trademarks _ a
snap-brim fedora on his head and a cigarette dangling from his
mouth _ almost turned into a stylistic cliche of a certain type of
big-city ``Front Page'' journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many great themes here of power and revenge and
extracting revenge and then paying the price for it,'' said Steven
Zaillian, who has contracted to adapt Gabler's book for Scorsese.
``He was monstrous but vulnerable in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Winchell came from a family of Jewish immigrants from Russia and
grew up in East Harlem. He first escaped New York immigrant poverty
as a vaudeville hoofer. As a youth he began submitting one-liners
and news to Billboard, then a stage trade paper. That led to a job
as a columnist for the The Vaudeville News and, in early 1924, to a
column called ``Your Broadway and Mine'' for the sensationalist The
Evening Graphic. Less than a decade later, by then enormously
popular, he signed on with The Daily Mirror, a Hearst tabloid, for
a daily Broadway column.
</P>
<P>
   Through it, in a world not yet transformed by television, he
amassed extraordinary power, often wielded ruthlessly, as a
purveyor of gossip, innuendo and pointed opinion delivered between
ellipses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one surveys this culture of Monica Lewinsky and O.J.
Simpson and constant gossip and salaciousness, and one tries to
trace the roots, you find yourself at Walter Winchell,'' Gabler
said recently. ``He was not only present at the creation of this
modern journalism but in many respects he was the creation.''
</P>
<P>
   From Table 50 at the Stork Club _ he never picked up the tab _
Winchell held court like a prince, beckoning prizefighters, movie
stars, debutantes, royalty and gangsters to his table. He demanded
to know what they were doing but talked most of the time himself.
</P>
<P>
   He mingled with the mob _ he conducted interviews with Al Capone
and palled around with Frank Costello _ and defiantly dominated a
Broadway world that no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest coups took place in August 1939 when Louis
(Lepke) Buchalter, who was described by J. Edgar Hoover as ``the
most dangerous criminal in the Untied States,'' surrendered to him.
Buchalter was electrocuted in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's reach into politics and the sporting world was also
huge. Early in his career he adored the New Deal, was a firm
supporter of civil rights and repeatedly denounced Hitler and
fascism far sooner than more Establishment journalists did.
</P>
<P>
   His two favorite public figures were President Franklin D.
Roosevelt and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Shortly after the 1932
presidential election, Roosevelt asked Winchell to the White House,
where he thanked him for his support and told him to call whenever
he wanted. From then on Winchell flattered Roosevelt in print, but
the columnist was far better known for invective. A New York Post
series about him in 1952 led him to attack the paper ferociously as
the ``Poo,'' the ``Compost,'' the ``Postinko'' and the
``Postitute.'' He called the newspaper's columnists
``presstitutes,'' and his constant attacks on the newspaper's
editor, James Wechsler, were even worse.
</P>
<P>
   For a while he seemed power-mad. Through his radio show and his
aggressive push for a military buildup before World War II, he
viewed himself as nothing less than the nation's savior. His
personal behavior was marked by tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he deigned to wave or something, you'd go over to shake his
hand,'' David Brown, the producer, told Gabler, concerning
Winchell's behavior at the Stork Club. ``If he ignored you, you
wouldn't go near him because he'd be very rude.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s Winchell had become obsessed with communism and,
through his friendship with Roy Cohn, embraced McCarthyism. He also
launched a series of shrill attacks against the singer Josephine
Baker, who created front page headlines by announcing that she had
been snubbed at the Stork Club because she was black. The event
turned into a cause celebre, stirring up rival columnists,
including Ed Sullivan, who once said over the radio, ``I despise
Walter Winchell because he symbolizes to me evil and treacherous
things in the American setup.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Although he narrated the television series ``The Untouchables,''
by 1959-60, Winchell's career was in a rapid slide. His radio show
was canceled. Jack Paar, on ``The Tonight Show,'' called him ``a
silly old man.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, after a devastating 114-day newspaper strike, The Daily
Mirror folded. Hearst's Journal-American took Winchell on as a
columnist, but he was despondent and felt he never really belonged
to that newspaper. He hung on but in May 1967, Hearst Corp.
informed him that his services were no longer needed on what was
then the World Journal Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   As his career hurtled through its ups and downs, his son
committed suicide, a daughter, Walda, suffered mental imbalance,
another daughter, Gloria, whom he had adopted and adored, died of
pneumonia, and his wife turned reclusive. He died of cancer in 1972
and was buried with only one person, Walda, at his graveside.
</P>
<P>
   In the HBO drama, Tucci plays a complex, witty and paranoid
Winchell who not only transformed entertainment journalism but was
also a populist who aggressively used his columns and Sunday night
radio show to champion what he called ``Mr. and Mrs. America,'' the
underdog. The drama is based on the book ``Walter Winchell: His
Life and Times,'' by Herman Klurfeld (Praeger, 1976), who wrote
many of Winchell's columns and worked for him for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Paul Mazursky, also stars Christopher
Plummer as Roosevelt and Glenne Headly as Dallas, a composite of
the many women in the columnist's life.
</P>
<P>
   Klurfeld, who is 82 and lives in Boca Raton, Fla., said in a
telephone interview that he was ambivalent about his former boss.
``Gossip was only a small part of his column, maybe 20 percent,''
said Klurfeld. ``He broke some of the biggest stories. He wrote
about politics. He fought anti-Semitism when it wasn't so
fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved working for him; we had like a father-son
relationship, but he was an egomaniac, he was stubborn and in the
end he was fooled by an evil devil named Roy Cohn.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Winchell's ``chumship'' with Cohn, as the columnist once
put it, that led to his support of McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's impact on tabloid journalism today _ and even
Establishment journalism _ remains unquestioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not just invent the modern gossip column,'' Gabler
wrote. ``He became an opinion maker because he understood, as no
one else then seemed to, the bitter subtext of the gossip he
purveyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabler said Winchell ``understood that gossip, far beyond its
basic attraction as journalistic voyeurism, was a weapon of
empowerment for the reader and listener.'' He continued: ``Invading
the lives of the famous and revealing their secrets brought them to
heel. It humanized them, and in humanizing them demonstrated that
they were no better than we and in many cases worse.''
</P>
<P>
   As detailed in the HBO drama, Winchell's downfall in the late
1950s and '60s was a result of several overlapping factors. After
the Stork Club incident involving Josephine Baker, The New York
Post ran a series detailing, for the first time, Winchell's hunger
for power and his relationships with and defense of Hoover and
Sherman Billingsley, the owner of the Stork Club.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Winchell's personal demons made him vulnerable.
``He was an egomaniac,'' Klurfeld said. ``Old age didn't creep up
on him. Overnight he became a sick old man.''
</P>
<P>
   What was perhaps most damaging to Winchell, Tucci said, was the
columnist's inability to accommodate himself to television.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was young he was really handsome, a kind of Don Juan.
Women were crazy about him,'' Tucci said. ``He was actually a movie
actor for a while. But when he got older and tried television, he
looked like some strange, nervous elf. He was from a different time
and people recognized that. He kept wearing a hat, and people
stopped wearing hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see the tapes, he never stopped moving, he looked a
little crazy. People in the audience laughed. When you hear that
voice, it's exciting. But when you see him doing it, it's like a
madman.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian recalled seeing a photograph of Winchell caught in a
riot at the 1968 Democratic convention. By this time he was a
has-been, his column vestigial, his broadcast long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always wanted to be a legitimate reporter, and here he was,
with hippies and police and young reporters, wearing his fedora hat
with a press thing in it, and he was sort of falling over, and the
caption identified him as an unidentified reporter,'' Zaillian
said. ``It had to be the last nail in the coffin, but maybe he
would say that this was his grandest moment. He was actually
identified as a reporter.''

   As the United States lurches toward the next century, it's hard
to know what to worry about first: impeachment, Iraq or the chance
that every computer in the country will unite in one disastrous
mixup on Jan. 1, 2000. So many worries, so little time till the
millennium.

   ``America 1900'' recalls a more optimistic turn of the century,
documenting January through December 1900 in kaleidoscopic, often
spellbinding detail. Though this episode of ``The American
Experience'' makes no explicit comparisons with today, viewers can
easily draw their own resonant conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious hint at how the country has changed comes early
in David McCullough's narration. ``Cynicism and self-pity were not
in style'' in 1900, he says. Instead, ``people felt exhilarated by
the possibilities of America.'' Since cynicism is so pervasive in
today's media culture (a culture so crowded there seems little room
for self-pity), it is startling to be carried back to a time when
optimism and hope were the national watchwords.
</P>
<P>
   That hopefulness is a decidedly American view, in bold contrast
to the fin de siecle anxiety commonly ascribed to Europe at the
same time. The United States was ``the most prosperous nation on
earth,'' McCullough explains, and a dominant world power.
Technological advances came with dizzying speed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``America 1900'' also charts the powerful undercurrents,
including flagrant racism and child labor, that marred any chance
at a perfect society.
</P>
<P>
   Though moving pictures were still new in 1900, this show is
overflowing with rich black-and-white film and photographs,
creating what feels like a total immersion in the period.
Newfangled inventions like X-rays, automobiles and phonographs were
altering ordinary lives. Horse-drawn carriages plodded alongside
trolley cars. Women wore long dresses even when indulging in the
new craze for hiking.
</P>
<P>
   And President William McKinley, who in his youth had been a
Civil War hero, shook the hands of 2,600 people who lined up to
greet him in the White House at his annual New Year's reception.
There was only one guard on duty.
</P>
<P>
   The confounding sense of rapid change was an overwhelming,
inescapable emotion. As McCullough notes, ``Men and women who had
taken six months to cross the country in covered wagons now made
the trip in six days'' by train.
</P>
<P>
   ``America 1900'' is most astute when it imagines the
psychological effect of such turns. John M. Staudenmaier, one of
the historians on the program, posits how the average person of
1900 feels as electricity, indoor plumbing and other whirlwind
advances improve his life: ``I am surrounded now by systems that
make me an idiot because I do not know how they work, nor do I know
how to fix them.'' (That should comfort everyone struggling to
program a VCR.)
</P>
<P>
   Proceeding in a blithe, roughly chronological style, the show
often stops to focus on selected individuals and their stories. The
Loumas, a family of Finnish immigrants, lost nine members during a
mining disaster in Scofield, Utah. Frances Benjamin Johnston made a
career for herself as a photojournalist, at a time when the field
itself was primitive and few women had careers at all. Her work,
included here, ranges from a portrait of Mark Twain to images of
exhausted women working in a factory in Lynn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The horrors of the age were often as conspicuous as its
progress. Some of the most nightmarish photographs here are of
lynchings: in one, dozens of white men pose proudly for the camera
while a black body hangs from a nearby tree. Many Americans of the
last century took such injustices for granted; many others saw them
as bumps on the road to a better future.
</P>
<P>
   At three hours, ``America 1900'' is a bit long, and occasionally
repetitious as it circles back in time to pick up the thread of a
story. Yet whenever it begins to drag, some energizing detail pops
up. When McKinley won re-election in November 1900, in many cities
the news was relayed by giant stereopticons projecting his image on
screens on the sides of buildings (a low-tech anticipation of
Jumbotrons everywhere).
</P>
<P>
   In 1901, McKinley was assassinated in Buffalo, N.Y., while at
the Pan-American Exposition, a symbol of hope and progress.
``America 1900'' points out the irony, then chooses to end with a
display of New Year's fireworks and the promise of the fresh
presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. This final note of optimism seems
forced, though. It is McKinley's murder that carries the dominant
tone of the new American century, in which assassination would be
merely one of its violent hallmarks.

NEW BOOK EXPLORES A LIFE OF FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To the uninitiated, it appears that Diane Von
Furstenberg, former wife of a prince, fashion mogul, mother and
grandmother-in-waiting, has lived a charmed life.
</P>
<P>
   With a well-traveled passport, she is by choice an almost
stateless person who has lived where she wanted, when she wanted.
Her lovers have included Richard Gere, Ryan O'Neill and her Swiss
boarding school roommate. She has been known to drop everything for
love, including a burgeoning couture business at her posh Fifth
Avenue boutique, which she abandoned to move to Paris for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't missed much since she came to the United States three
decades ago as the young bride of a German playboy prince _ not
Malcolm Forbes' fabled 75th birthday party in Morocco; not the fall
of the Berlin Wall (with billionaire Mort Zuckerman); not the Paris
collections with her pal, celebrity cobbler Christian Louboutin;
not Studio 54; or dinner at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That she is beautiful, ageless and exotic is a given. Just look
at her photographs. Note how sculptured her face is. And how
timeless. She could be Asian, Native-American, Incan, Greek. But
she's a woman of Jewish ancestry who married a German prince and
has been genetically blessed with a slim, willowy body and the
best-looking legs since Trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Von Furstenberg, 51, has sketched out her adventures in a new
book: ``Diane, A Signature Life,'' for Simon and Schuster, written
with Linda Bird Francke, who, 20-plus years ago, wrote both the New
York Magazine and Newsweek cover stories on Diane and then-husband
Prince Eduard Egon von und zu Furstenberg. On the last leg of an
eight-city tour, she sits in the filtered light of a San Francisco
morning, dressed in one of her signature wrap dresses _ this one a
leopard print in Army fatigue colors _ her legs encased in
knee-high suede boots, her fingers decorated with large square
rings and her luxuriant, naturally curly hair, blown-dry straight
and shoulder-length.
</P>
<P>
   She's spent the weekend visiting friends. She saw Dame Edna
Saturday night (``He was ... er, interesting ... a fine actor held
prisoner by that role. I don't get it'') and had dinner with friend
Denise Hale at Farallon. At the end of her bookstore appearances,
she's off to Cuba on her best friend Barry Diller's boat (he owns
the USA Networks). She's already met Fidel Castro some years ago
(to whom she said, ``Your mother named you well'' and of whom she
says, ``He's not as macho as you'd expect.'')
</P>
<P>
   The business at hand is talking about The Book, The Dress and
The Life and the so-called Newsweek curse.
</P>
<P>
   She was 29 when her picture appeared on the front cover of
Newsweek in one of the wrap dresses (5 million of them sold) that
revolutionized dressing for American women at that moment in time.
It was one of those dual symbols, both of Women's Liberation and
the Sexual Revolution. A little cotton jersey wrap, printed up in
colorful patterns, that took a ``girl'' anywhere, including bed (it
was so simple to slip off and on _ no buttons).
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me there was this `cover jinx' which definitely
happened to me,'' Von Furstenberg said. ``First of all, it was
exhilarating. I'm 29 years old, I have two adorable children, lots
of exciting boyfriends, I had just fallen in love with Barry Diller
and had crossed the world to be with him. I had dinner at the White
House. I was living the American dream because I had always wanted
to have a man's life in a woman's body.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cover was, in Von Furstenberg's words, ``the kiss of
death. It meant overexposure. I had wanted to diversify my
business, but had a partner who kept producing dresses. And I found
myself with $4 million in inventory we couldn't sell. I fired my
partner and I had to deal with it by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born Diane Halfin 51 years ago in Brussels _ to Lily
Nahimias, a concentration camp survivor who had the numbers from
three camps tattooed on her arms (she had them removed, took the
reparations money from the German government and bought a sable
coat with it) and Leon Halfin, who spent the war in Switzerland.
Her upbringing was haute-bourgeois. Swiss and English schools,
multilingual education. A privileged life. Her mother never said a
word when she married into a German royal house, although her
father-in-law expressed his disapproval by going to the wedding,
not the reception.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the dress company was born. ``I have had three
children,'' Von Furstenberg said. ``My son, my daughter and my
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a princess (even by marriage) got her through doors that
would have been closed to commoners. Like Vogue's _ Diana Vreeland
declared the simple wrap dress ``absolutely smashing.'' ``When I
came to New York, I was a young, pretty princess and it's easier to
get into Diana Vreeland's office that way,'' Von Furstenberg said.
``How many other Euro-trash, as we call them, have gone to Miss
Vreeland's and tried to sell something? I sold 5 million of that
dress!''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the company name has gone through licensing
problems, but Von Furstenberg took it back and spruced it up with a
new wrap dress for her daughter Titania's generation. And she took
on a new business associate: son Alexander's wife, Alexandra.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I was so dedicated,'' Von Furstenberg
said. ``I am even now and I am amazed _ everyone around me gets
tired. I'm 51, but I'm supposed to look good. I guess it's the
attitude.''

`STOREFRONT HITCHCOCK': WHIMSICAL SONGS AND GAWKING PEDESTRIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.)  
 (fb)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least as intriguing as the songs the English folk-rocker
Robyn Hitchcock performs in Jonathan Demme's intimate concert film
``Storefront Hitchcock'' are the surreal vignettes the singer spins
out between numbers. A typical flight of fancy is his meditation on
the gradual disappearance of the Isle of Wight as its shoreline is
steadily eroded.
</P>
<P>
   Its science-fiction fantasy is peopled with ghosts of the dead
dating back to Cro-Magnon times who hover over water covering what
used to be land. The darkly futuristic dream ends in a vision of a
world ruled by computers in which human life as we know it is
extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's twisted commentaries have corollaries in his
extensive catalog of seriously whimsical songs, which have made him
a popular cult figuresince the late 1970s when he recorded with his
first group, the Soft Boys. In the '80s, Hitchcock formed another
band, the Egyptians. In 1996 he released an acclaimed solo album,
``Moss Elixir.''
</P>
<P>
   If those songs are lyrically too esoteric to have broad mass
appeal, most of Hitchcock's albums have sold at least 100,000
copies. Think of the Beatles' playful surrealism fused with the
spaced-out fantasies of Hitchcock's idol, Syd Barrett of Pink
Floyd, spruced up with the historical imagination of Al Stewart at
his most fanciful, and you have some idea of the flavor of
Hitchcock's arty folk-rock ruminations.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying himself on guitar and joined in the film for
several numbers by two frequent collaborators, Deni Bonet (on
violin) and Tim Keegan (on guitar and backup vocals), Hitchcock
sings in a sour British twang that suggests a cross between John
Lennon and David Bowie at their most sardonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storefront Hitchcock,'' which opens today at the Film Forum,
was filmed in a 14th Street storefront in Manhattan over two days
before an unseen live audience. For much of the film, Hitchcock
performs standing with his back to a window, through which a steady
stream of traffic can be glimpsed. Occasionally pedestrians stop in
front of the window and gawk.
</P>
<P>
   The film plays subtle tricks with time that reflect the
playfulness of Hitchcock's lyrics. At one point, the clear glass of
the window is replaced with colored panes. From song to song, the
props surrounding the singer keep changing. There are candles in
one number, a mirror ball in another and an odd sculpture of a
tomato in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storefront Hitchcock'' is unlikely to spur a commercial
resurgence for the 45-year-old singer, whom Demme obviously
appreciates with the same enthusiasm he brought to the Talking
Heads in his other rock-concert film, ``Stop Making Sense.'' But it
still captures the sensibility of this smart, quirky folk-rocker in
the most appealing possible light.
</P>

 &HT;    BARBECUE MAY HAVE HELPED MAJORITY WHIP DeLAY
 &HT;    595 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Note to future political leaders: It's the
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe comes straight from the office of House Majority Whip
Tom DeLay, the only Republican leader in the U.S. House of
Representatives who is unopposed in his bid for re-election today.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay of Texas also happens to be the only Republican leader who
feeds the rank-and-file members when the leaders decide everyone
should work late.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's found a way to turn chicken doo-doo into chicken salad,''
said U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, who was elected to the House
the same year as DeLay and House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas. ``As part of the collective leadership, DeLay is in on the
decisions to keep members here late. Armey gets blamed, but DeLay
holds the barbecue in his office. Everybody goes over and eats his
chicken and pecan pie and grouses about Armey.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as Republicans choose the House leadership for the next
two years, Armey is facing tough competition for his No. 2 job from
Reps. Steve Largent, R-Okla., and Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who holds the No. 4 job in the House
but no barbecues, is in danger of being knocked off by Rep. J.C.
Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republicans are competing for the No. 5 job.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., abandoned the No. 1 job
after Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., announced a challenge Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   No one is making a run at DeLay's No. 3 job.
</P>
<P>
   ``His lack of opposition has nothing to do with the fact that he
feeds us barbecue almost every Wednesday,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, in a denial that was undermined by his admission that he
is a big fan of barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Smith and other House members from Texas make a
credible case for DeLay's easy re-election beyond chicken and
chopped beef on a bun. Even Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of
Austin, who is far from DeLay on the political spectrum, has good
things to say about the majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have big differences with him, but on a personal level, he's
always been cordial,'' Doggett said, noting that cordiality with
Democrats will be important as DeLay takes charge of rounding up
Republican votes in a House where the GOP holds only a six-vote
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republican members, DeLay gets points for:
</P>
<P>
   _ Honesty. ``He doesn't mince words. He's very direct,'' Smith
said, recalling DeLay's admission to House members that he had
encouraged the aborted coup against Gingrich 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't go around people's backs. He doesn't have a hidden
agenda. ... That's all you can ask for around here,'' Smith said,
``getting it straight and getting it true.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Constituent services. Barton said DeLay is the best among
current House leaders for remembering what members have asked for,
whether it's a chance to offer an amendment to legislation or a
boost for a project back home. Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas,
suggested DeLay has something more than a good memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think he's got eyes behind his head,'' Bonilla
said. ``He knows everyone's personal desires, their quirks, their
districts. He knows who smokes and other personal habits. He knows
people up and down, but most important, he communicates with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Being a darned good whip. ``I've been involved with three
Republican whips,'' said Barton, who helped round up Republican
votes for former House Minority Whip Trent Lott, R-Miss., now
majority leader in the Senate, and for Gingrich, when he was
minority whip in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the inside and outside,'' Barton said, ``and Tom
DeLay is as good as Lott and Gingrich were.''

   IRAQ-US-OPED _ WASHINGTON _ In the cat-and-mouse game between
President Clinton and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, it is no
longer clear which one is the cat. Almost nothing is cockier than a
cat playing with its cornered prey. The supremely confident feline
amuses itself by allowing its captive just enough running room to
give the illusion of an escape. Then down comes the paw. And the
cycle continues until the prey exhausts itself. By all rights, the
commanding role in the U.S.-Iraq game belongs to the leader of the
superpower whose armed forces crushed the Iraqi military during the
Gulf War. U.S. warplanes can fire off cruise missiles and strike at
the heart of Iraq _ Baghdad _ at will, and American flyers own the
skies over Iraq. But has the wily president of this middling-sized,
arid country with a population less than California's become the

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 was only a little
propeller-driven plane that fell in an obscure hayfield in west
Georgia: 10 people died, 19 survived. In terms of lives lost,
certainly it was not on scale with TWA Flight 800 and Swissair
Flight 111. More than 200 people died in each of those crashes. Yet
the ASA crash is writ large across many lives. Nearly two-thirds of
the people aboard survived _ a miracle gift _ and so this crash is
not
</P>
<P>
   only about death, but life.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter Gary M. Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from
Georgia to Maine to Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview
survivors of ASA Flight 529. He also canvassed investigative files
of the National Transportation Safety Board and testimony taken
during the ensuing litigation. Pomerantz vivdly describes the 9
minutes and 20 seconds of horror aboard that doomed aircraft as it
fell to earth, the fire that consumed the broken fuselage, as well
as how the tragedy has reshaped lives.

across the room, Barrington thought about those who died in the
crash: people he did not know but might have saved. That included
Jim Kennedy. Now, realizing funerals were only a day away,
Barrington's thoughts took him to the grave sites of Kennedy and
the others. ``Did you do everything you could to help my father/my
mother/my son?'' He imagined a grieving family asking him this
question. Barrington thought, ``Unless you died in the attempt, you
did not try hard enough.'' He heard himself say aloud, ``I'm
alive,'' and so the answer had to be, ``No, I didn't do everything
I could have done.'' This admission brought tears and sobs. He fell
from his chair to the floor. (Pomerantz, Atlanta

INDIANAPOLIS MUSEUM BUYS GAUGUINS FROM COLLECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (rl)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indianapolis may have little in common with Pont-Aven, the
picturesque village in Brittany that Paul Gauguin painted into art
history more than a century ago, but Tuesday the Indianapolis
Museum of Art acquired 17 paintings and 84 prints by Gauguin and
his Pont-Aven followers that will forever link the two towns.
</P>
<P>
   The museum purchased the paintings, which are valued at about
$30 million, from Samuel Josefowitz, a retired 77-year-old Swiss
businessman and well-known collector, with the help of a $20
million challenge grant from the Lilly Endowment, an Indianapolis
philanthropy. The museum is raising about $10 million to complete
the purchase. Josefowitz, a trustee of the museum since 1990, is
contributing an undisclosed amount to that effort and is donating
all of the prints, which are estimated to be worth more than $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   The artworks, which capture a pivotal moment in modern art,
vastly upgrade the Indianapolis museum's holdings, which are strong
in old masters, watercolors by J.M.W. Turner, Chinese and African
art and Neo-Impressionist paintings by the followers of Georges
Seurat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of the Pont-Aven things with the
Neo-Impressionist things will give us examples of the two competing
schools of modernism from that era that you won't find anywhere
else in the United States,'' Bret Waller, the museum's director,
said. The museum, whose collection includes Cezanne's ``House in
Provence,'' van Gogh's ``Landscape at St. Remy,'' Seurat's
``Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe'' and two other
Gauguins, can now claim to be a regional center for late
19th-century French art.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his home in Lausanne, Switzerland,
Josefowitz said that making a difference was an important
consideration in deciding to part with these artworks. ``I'm very
happy that the Indianapolis museum has a chance to expand,'' he
said. ``For a big museum this wouldn't be such a major thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition also fit the requirements of the Lilly
Endowment, which had previously agreed to finance a purchase that
significantly enhanced the museum's profile as a cultural
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Among the museum's new treasures are Gauguin's ``Flageolet
Player on the Cliff,'' ``Still Life With Profile of Laval'' and
``Christmas Night''; Emile Bernard's ``Pont-Aven Seen From the Bois
d'Amour'' and ``Breton Women at a Wall,'' and works by Maurice
Denis, Paul Serusier, Henry Moret and Jan Verkade. The museum plans
to unveil the paintings and prints in a show beginning next March.
</P>
<P>
   While the public associates Gauguin most strongly with his days
in Tahiti, many art historians consider his time in Pont-Aven,
which he first visited in 1886, to have been more formative. ``It
was in Pont-Aven _ not in Paris or anywhere else _ that Gauguin
became Gauguin, the father and grandfather of modes of feeling and
utterance that have counted for a great deal in the art of our
century,'' wrote John Russell in The New York Times in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   There, together with Bernard, Gauguin formulated the principles
of Synthetism, which fused the artist's subjective reaction to
nature with his sense of design. Artists of the School of Pont-Aven
made works with simple shapes and rhythmic surface patterns,
unshadowed lighting and flat colors inspired as much by imagination
as by nature.
</P>
<P>
   Josefowitz, who was born in Lithuania, is a former chemical
engineer who made his fortune as a co-founder of mail-order book
and record clubs in 21 countries. He assembled most of his
Pont-Aven collection in the 1950s and '60s, when few people
recognized the significance of the movement. In the mid-1990s, the
collection toured several American cities, including Indianapolis,
San Diego, Baltimore and Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Josefowitz said that he had not intended to sell the works but
that he had nevertheless suggested the idea when Ellen Wardwell
Lee, the museum's chief curator, called him in September 1997 to
ask about acquiring a Neo-Impressionist work from his collection.
``I said, `Maybe you should think about making a Pont-Aven room
instead,''' Josefowitz recalled. He had met Ms. Lee in 1983, when
she was doing research for a catalog of the museum's
Neo-Impressionist collection, and they had forged a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Once he and the museum agreed in principle, Josefowitz said he
let Ms. Lee choose the works she wanted. But there were some
reservations. ``He wanted to hang on to some for his family,'' said
Ms. Lee, who was also in Lausanne, supervising the packing.
Although Josefowitz frequently lends his art to museums _ two
paintings going to Indianapolis had just been returned from an
exhibition in Munich _ Ms. Lee said that ``we are not robbing any
museum, we are robbing Sam's walls.''
</P>
<P>
   But not completely. Josefowitz also owns collections of
Post-Impressionist works by the Pointillists and by the Nabis, a
group of French artists, of old master drawings and of African and
pre-Columbian art, and they fill the walls of his home in Paris and
another near Oxford, England, as well as the one in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   The art world can only continue to wonder where these works will
eventually go. ``This whole thing was very impromptu on my part,''
Josefowitz said. ``I'm planning to enjoy the rest of my collection
for many years, though some will eventually go to other museums and
some more to Indianapolis.''  &QL;

THEODORE ROSZAK AND THE MAKING OF A KINDER CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BETH WITROGEN McLEOD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ It's a fine fall day to be visiting Theodore
Roszak in his Berkeley Hills home, which commands a sweeping view
of the San Francisco Bay. Just as majestic is his view of the
baby-boom generation and its mandate for changing the world.
</P>
<P>
   Roszak, the author of more than a dozen works including 1969's
landmark ``The Making of a Counter Culture,'' has just published
``America the Wise: The Longevity Revolution and the True Wealth of
Nations'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1998, $25, 272 pages). It is an
extension, from his vantage now as a 65-year-old, of the
groundbreaking bestseller that called a generation of dissenters
``the matrix in which an alternative, but still excessively fragile
future is taking shape.''
</P>
<P>
   A professor of history at California State University at
Hayward, Roszak is a long, lean and gentle man who speaks
thoughtfully yet with gusto and easy laughter. His strong, elegant
hands punctuate points with certainty as he pronounces his faith in
the continued promise of the now-aging ``me generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't care to categorize his position as
optimistic, it is nevertheless positive. In his new book, Roszak
has renamed the baby boomers ``the New People,'' the beneficiaries
of modern technology and science who will be living longer and
healthier, and who will become natural advocates for a shift in
values _ ones based in the wisdom and compassion that only older
age can bestow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great irony of the baby-boom generation is that it stamped
our society with an identity almost as if young people were never
going to get old,'' Roszak says of the '60s idealists. ``But in
fact the baby boom might be seen as raw material for aging. Youth
seemed to be our destiny, but we're struggling with an identity
that doesn't fit us anymore: The fastest growing demographic
population is people over age 85.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America the Wise'' is an incisive social history of
entitlements and politics, economics and marketing _ the
reallocation of wealth and corollary social values. Chapters
discuss volunteerism and the new retirement, seniors' rights, the
ethics of long-term care and end-of-life issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the book especially is an appeal for compassion and nobility
in the face of the demographics of aging, which foresee a doubling
of the over-65 population in 30 years in the United States alone.
Although graying is a global phenomenon, Roszak is most interested
in boomers, whom he sees as harbingers of a new society.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a burden, he believes, their mass aging is an
unprecedented opportunity to remake society. It is not only a
matter of numbers; it is also the spirit and character of the
largest generation in history, the 76 million people born between
1946 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those who survived the '60s are going to survive into
their 70s and 80s, so the historical influence of these same people
is going to be great,'' Roszak says. Americans will be forced to
rethink their attitudes about life and death, wealth and
well-being, cooperation and competition. The cult of youth will
have to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a society where numbers and power are destined to gravitate
steadily in the direction of age,'' he writes, ``one cannot write
off the views and values of the senior generation as mere youthful
effervescence; nor can one simply wait for the insurgents to grow
up and move along in life. ... A new world is opening up before us
_ not across the seas, not in outer space, not in cyberspace, but
in time. ... The future belongs to maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Roszak's ``longevity revolution,'' midwifed by high-tech
medicine and science, instructs that more people are living longer,
but also that families are shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unprecedented that a generation of this size will
survive into old age; there has never been a society in human
history that has had more people above the age of 50 than below,''
he writes. ``This marks a long-term shift toward aging that is not
reversible; we're headed toward a permanent senior dominance of our
political, cultural and social life. It's not going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roszak insists that the boomers' well-honed skepticism of
expertise and distinctly vocal character will pioneer a fresh
identity and shape a new world _ a wiser world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't define wisdom in some exalted way that says you have
to be a King Solomon or Albert Schweitzer. I'm talking about a
pretty commonplace fact that the longer you live, the more knocks
you take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people keep learning all the way through life. By the
time they're in their later years, they have actually learned a
lot. The problem is not that people don't get wiser; the problem
with wisdom is that we don't give it a chance to be heard because
we're a society that listens to `experts.' And experts are usually
young, competitive people building careers, fast with the facts and
the data, and we think they know better. It's not that the wisdom
is not there; it's that we don't listen to it.''

 &HT;    JOE CAMEL GENERATION PUSHES UP COLLEGE SMOKING LEVEL
 &HT;    430 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cigarette smoking among college students has
increased sharply, a trend that seems to correspond to alleged
targeting of adolescents by cigarette company advertising beginning
in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health will report
Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association that a
survey last year of more than 14,000 college students showed a 28
percent increase in cigarette use since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The group likely will push the incidence of smoking-related
disease higher in the future, the researchers said. In addition to
lung cancer, smoking is implicated in numerous health problems,
ranging from heart disease to sexual impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Increases were found in all student groups, regardless of age,
sex, year in school, race or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a dramatic rise in smoking among all college students
and at all types of colleges,'' said Henry Wechsler, principal
investigator in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the last time the Harvard group surveyed college
students, the rate of smoking was 22 percent. The 1997 rate was 28
percent, coincidentally a 28 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise in college student smoking appears to be a
consequence of the rise in adolescent smoking that occurred earlier
in the 1990s,'' Wechsler and his co-researchers wrote in the
medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college students surveyed in 1997 were high school seniors
between 1993 and 1996, during which time high school seniors'
smoking prevalence rates rose progressively following a decade of
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   And the increase in high school smoking rates in the mid-1990s
could be traced to increased smoking by preteens and early
teen-agers a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused tobacco companies of targeting adolescents
with advertising, because most people who haven't started smoking
by age 18 don't start.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard group found that only 11 percent of the students
said they started smoking in college.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, designed primarily to measure college students'
drinking habits, also included smoking questions. Results of the
drinking survey have not been released.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Camel, R.J. Reynolds' laid-back, convention-ribbing
advertising cartoon character, came to the United States in 1988,
after use in European advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings should be a source of concern to those
interested in reducing tobacco use among young people,'' authors of
the study wrote. ``The increase in smoking first seen in middle
school and high school has reached the college population.''

HISPANIC-LEADERSHIP (Phoenix) - The absence of leadership was
glaring. Thousands of Latinos turned out in masses to celebrate Dia
de la Raza and call attention to rising anti-Hispanic sentiments
sweeping the country _ anti-immigration legislation, affirmative
action bans, bilingual education assaults. But among them, not a
single Latino elected official was present _ even though one event
was held at Wesley Bolin Plaza, across from Arizona's Capitol. The
same thing happened when thousands of immigrants spent three days
gathered outside the Federal Building in downtown Phoenix last year
to force lawmakers to extend an immigration provision that would
allow them to remain in the United States while seeking legal
residency. The crowds spilled into the streets. Still no officials
came to address them. ``Why don't they come?'' ask Doreen Vegas,
who joined the protest one day and was facing deportation. ``Can't
they see that we need them?'' It's a scene that Valley Latinos say
happens again and again. Latino political prospects are bleak. All
this in a state with a burgeoning Hispanic population. By JULIE
AMPARANO. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

WESTERN-PRIMARY (Undated) - Arizona is joining a Western effort to
make the Rocky Mountain states a major player in the 2000
presidential contest. The Western Presidential Primary Task Force
is expected to approve a regional primary on March 11, 2000. Eight
states, including Arizona, would participate. Former Gov. Fife
Symington, who engineered Arizonas' first GOP presidential primary
in 1996, is likely to cry foul. State GOP and Democratic chairs of
Arizona, though, support the idea. By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will

SEPTUPLETS (Undated) - ``Seven from Heaven'' details life with the
famous McCaughey septuplets, who turn 1 year old on Nov. 19, the
same day the book is available. We are part of the hour-long press
conference phone interview with the mom and hear about how life is
with the magnificent seven. With SEPTUPLETS-SIDE. By KELLY
ETTENBOROUGH. Story will move in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SEPTUPLETS-SIDE (Undated) - One would think that turning down a
million dollars when one has eight children to raise would not be a
wise thing. The McCaugheys, though, didn't want to ruin their
reputation by doing an interview with a tabloid. Although the
McCaugheys aren't saying how much is in their bank account, they do
have a lot of donations, they're moving into their new house in
November. Kenny's doing a commercial and they are doing some
selective endorsements and interviews. As Bobbi says, ``Kenny's
still working.'' By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH. Story will move in the
``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ I first read about Keith Olbermann
jumping ship from MSNBC to Fox Sports News last week in the sports
section of the newspaper. I read a follow-up story in the features
section. Fitting, because for his fans, his quitting as host of
``The Big Show'' resonates across all sorts of boundaries. By BILL
GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOOK-DALAILAMA (Phoenix) _ The idea was for the book to show the
Western world the way to happiness by combining the common-sense
insights of the Dalai Lama with the scientific knowledge and

theological/psychological Odd Couple could be a commercial hit. By

49ERS RECEIVER FINDS THE HEALING PROCESS TAKES TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The flinching may stop soon, the wariness
in Jerry Rice's game, the sliver of fret that intrudes on the
receiver's Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety is common among football players in the year after a
major knee injury. They play on the repaired joint, lift weights
with it, feel its elasticity, its strength, and tell themselves
that they can trust it again.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't, not really. At least not in the company of
suspicious characters, like the bonecrushers across the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dealing with that now,'' Rice said Monday in the locker
room of the San Francisco 49ers, ``and that is something I face
every game, knowing that that (a blown-out knee) can happen to me
all over again. It's almost like you're fighting those monsters in
your head. You say to yourself: Just go out and be aggressive and
do all the right things. But sometimes you find yourself being a
little hesitant out there. You say to yourselves those monsters are
not going to be there, but then when it comes to the game, it
basically creeps into your head.''
</P>
<P>
   The monsters have a limited vocabulary. ``Can you still take a
hit?'' They don't say much more. They don't have to. That's a
rattler of question.
</P>
<P>
   In the Niners' loss to Atlanta on Sunday, Rice dropped a
potential touchdown pass. Eugene Robinson, a hovering defensive
back, seemed to be preying on Rice's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Rice reviewed the game tape on Monday, and it hurt him to watch,
wounding him in a place far more sensitive than his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take pride in going out there and making those difficult
plays, and I didn't do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Rice has taken the biggest hit of all.
People _ sportswriters, fans, opposing players _ have started to
write his professional obituary. The refrain: Jerry Rice isn't
Jerry Rice anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Like any blow, this one stunned at first. But he's picking
himself back up again _ by not pretending that things are the same
as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``After taking a year off, it takes a while before you get back
into sync again,'' he said. ``Will I get back into sync? I hope so
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be so easy for him to lapse into denial. Most players
do it, treating every error as an aberration. Football players hate
to admit that they're afraid of anything. But an unconfronted fear
remains an unresolved one.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his critics would say that age, as well as the effects
of last year's injuries, have blunted Rice's edge. These people
need to call NFL Films and order up a highlights reel on Darrell
Green and Albert Lewis, both 38, both still blisteringly fast. Rice
is 36. He will be better at 37 than he is now. The injury will be
gone.
</P>
<P>
   That's the formula for knee injuries: A year to fix the body,
then a year to banish the monsters. Garrison Hearst, the Niners'
running back, went through it in Arizona. He wasn't himself until
two seasons after his knee gave out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I was OK,'' he said, ``but mentally...''
</P>
<P>
   He sounded haunted by the memories. Of course, at the time, he
was playing for Buddy Ryan, who thought that all offensive players,
healthy or not, deserved a trip to the glue factory, like lame
horses. They were no use to him. So Ryan tormented Hearst, made his
recovery that much more hellish.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mariucci won't be part of Rice's nightmares. He stood up
for him on Monday, reminding the assembled news media that Rice
leads the NFL in receptions _ including a 65-yard one for a
touchdown Sunday. He made the point almost plaintively, as if to
say: ``What more do you expect?''

   BALANCHINE-BALLETS (Undated) _ It isn't a trivia question to ask
which of George Balanchine's ballets were on the first program when
the New York City Ballet officially came into existence on Oct. 11,
1948. As virtually every City Ballet subscriber knows by heart, the
triple bill consisted of ``Concerto Barocco,'' ``Orpheus'' and
``Symphony in C.'' The same program will inaugurate the City
Ballet's mammoth 50th-anniversary year on Tuesday night at the New
York State Theater, just as it marked the 40th anniversary. By Anna
Kisselgoff.

   FILM AND VIDEO

<P>
   CENTRAL-STATION-FILM (Undated) _ Walter Salles's ``Central
Station'' is a film that manages to be both intimate and epic,
local and universal. The movie, which opened Friday, is a portrait
of present-day Brazil as seen through the tale of an older woman
and a young boy who meet in Rio de Janeiro's train station and who
strike out on a journey into the hinterlands to find the boy's
father. By Laura Winters.

   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews ``Little Me'';
``Chicago'' and ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   KIDMAN-THEATER (Undated) _ It will come as no surprise to Nicole
Kidman's screen admirers to learn that she also looks sexy and
beautiful on stage, not least when scantily dressed. Yet this
unremarkable discovery threw British newspapers into a veritable
swoon this fall when she made her first stage appearance in 11
years. True, sex (italics)is(end italics) the theme of the play,
``The Blue Room,'' David Hare's loose adaptation of Arthur
Schnitzler's turn-of-the-century play ``Reigen,'' or round-dance,
now better known as ``La Ronde.'' Ten characters (Ms. Kidman and
the British actor Iain Glen each play five) engage in a daisy-chain
of sexual encounters. By Alan Riding.

<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   LA-FRENCH-MUSIC (L'anse De'prien Noir, La.) _ The vital French
music of the region _ 22 parishes called Acadiana _ hasn't been
shunted to the museum, to be occasionally dusted off and propped on
a sterile stage. French music thrived here because of South
Louisiana's isolation, both physical and cultural. But what
happened here is not an isolated event. Often damned for its
take-no-prisoners mass culture, the United States has always found
room for local, often country, musics: the strong fiddling
tradition that grew up around Galax, Va.; the African-American
fife-and-drum bands of Northern Mississippi; the Mexican-American
conjunto born along the Texas-Mexico border. And the omnivorous
popular culture has never been shy about borrowing (stealing?) from
the locals, as Cajuns know. By Dana Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-FAME (Undated) _ Is it desperation among music marketers
or just the nature of celebrity that has turned career building
into such spasms of sudden success and sudden obscurity? Selling
and buying the star is a musical process as old as Franz Liszt, but
the ascent to belovedness has become more vertical. A certain
hysteria is in the air, with audiences needy for something to love
and promoters eager to supply it. By Bernard Holland.
</P>

   ART

   ZEN-ART (New York) _ ``The Art of 20th-Century Zen,'' an
exhibition that opened on Thursday at the Japan Society, gives a

master calligrapher-painters. By Kay Larson. &QL;

<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-TV (London) _ The words book and television tug against
each other in a fairly obvious way, but I still can't help smiling
at the sassy paradox implicit in the designation Book TV. That's
what C-Span 2 calls the round-the-clock weekend programming it
introduced in September, displacing reruns of the United States
Senate, the estimable show this cable network carries live on most
weekdays. By Will Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   CANDID-CAMERA (Monterey, Calif.) _ ``Candid Camera'' _ at least
a collateral precursor of such varied fin de siecle phenomena as
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ATM surveillance cameras,
nannycams, FBI sting operations, ``The Truman Show'' and Linda
Tripp _ remains an absolutely noncontroversial, even beloved
institution. And undoubtedly this is why CBS, struggling with the
other broadcast networks to attract a larger share of a shrinking
audience, has chosen to return to its roots and revive this
51-year-old franchise. By Andy Meisler.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   EXPLORATION-ART-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ For the legions who drive
sport utility vehicles to work on Wall Street, wear high-tech
mountain gear to suburban barbecues and keep Jon Krakauer's Everest
adventure story, ``Into Thin Air,'' on the best-seller list,
another spectator sport is catching on: collecting exploration art.
That rubric covers the paraphernalia used by the great explorers _
their oxygen cylinders, packing crates, rations cups, Holy Bibles
and climbing shoes _ as well as photographs, paintings, maps and
charts, many of which were drawn on the spot of previously
uncharted terrain. The genre spans nearly 500 years of exploration
from the early sea voyages of the 1400s to the Everest climbs of
the 1950s. By Christa Worthington.

A RASCAL PHILOSOPHER SEDUCED BY THE SPIRIT OF HIS ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy _ Poor Casanova! On the 200th anniversary of his
death, even the city of his birth seems embarrassed to remember him
for the single trait that made him famous. Instead, Venice has
chosen to celebrate him not as the legendary libertine and Latin
lover but as a traveler, writer, freethinker, diplomat, spy,
mathematician, gambler, gourmand and emblematic dilettante of
18th-century Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he was also all these things. Indeed, had he not been a
writer of some talent, he would have left no greater legacy than
broken hearts, cuckolded husbands and illegitimate children.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, had his 12-volume memoir, ``L'Histoire de Ma
Vie,'' or ``The Story of My Life,'' not detailed his seduction of
women of all ages and social condition (and his genuine love for
some of them), he would certainly have been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, a somewhat revisionist portrait of the infamous
rake that is presented in ``The World of Giacomo Casanova: A
Venetian in Europe, 1725-1798,'' an exhibition at the Museo del
Settecento Veneziano in Ca' Rezzonico through Jan. 10. Rejecting
what they call ``stale cliches'' about the man and his behavior,
the show's organizers have focused on Casanova's wanderings, with
only one gallery dedicated to his wooing.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary exhibition might even be a tad opportunistic
since Venice hardly treated him kindly during his lifetime. He was
imprisoned in the dreaded Piombi or Leads jail in July 1755, and
although he escaped 15 months later, he could not return to Venice
until 1774. Eight years later, he was again forced to flee and this
time was never allowed back. In fact, he became a ``Venetian in
Europe'' as much by accident as by choice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, traveling clearly suited his restless spirit. In 1734, he
studied law in Padua, and then, while preparing for a career in the
Roman Catholic Church, he visited Corfu, Calabria, Naples and Rome,
discovering on the way that being a young cleric was no impediment
to torrid affairs. At the age of 21, though, he left the church
and, while earning his keep as a violin player in a local
orchestra, he turned to a life of pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Scandals soon drew him to the attention of the State
Inquisitors, forcing him to hop town from time to time and thereby
expanding his horizons of passion. On one trip to France in 1750,
he became a Freemason, an association that later provided him with
crucial connections across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But in Venice, as much as his philandering, it was his apparent
links to magic and the occult that finally landed him in the Leads
in 1755.
</P>
<P>
   After his daring escape from jail, Casanova had little choice
but to travel. It is this grand tour _ of love affairs, partying,
gambling and deal-making, but also of brief stints in prison,
predawn flights from creditors and failed confidence tricks _ that
Ca' Rezzonico's exhibition tracks through a series of paintings of
the cities he came to know, starting with views of Venice itself by
Canaletto, Guardi and others.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying each oil are amusing quotations from Casanova's
memoirs. Beside Saint-Quentin's 1755 painting of ``The Entrance to
the Tuileries From Louis XV Square,'' Casanova offers: ``In France,
nothing is real; everything is appearance.'' And beside Ricci's
painting of the Mall in London, Casanova explains: ``The island
called England is actually a sea with vast sand banks, and those
who sail there must navigate it with care.''
</P>
<P>
   With a cityscape of Dresden by Bellotto comes the reminder that
Casanova considered the Saxons decidedly ungallant. A painting of
the somber Escorial Palace by Michel-Ange Houesse brings the
suggestion that Casanova enjoyed Madrid: ``The men in Spain have a
mentality conditioned by an infinity of prejudices, while the women
are in general more open. Both, however, are subject to passions as
vigorous as the air they breath.''
</P>
<P>
   While hardly a figure of social distinction, Casanova frequently
arranged to meet people of power. Portraits of some of these are
also in the show, among them Catherine the Great of Russia, Louis
XV of France, Madame de Pompadour, Empress Maria Theresa of
Austria, King Stanislav of Poland and Pope Clement XIII. Of the
tsarina, Casanova wrote: ``Without being beautiful, she knew how to
please with her charm, her friendliness and her intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he would have delighted in including a member of
royalty among his conquests. In practice, they came from all
classes, from marquise to chambermaid, from landowner to convent
girl. ``Seducing is not my main characteristic,'' he wrote
immodestly in his memoirs, ``because I have always done this
unconsciously after first being seduced myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In London in 1763, though, he met his match in Marianne
Charpillon, a young Swiss prostitute. While he fell for her, she
refused to surrender, and took his money. She broke his heart.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his life of loves, the exhibition displays some
paintings of 18th-century women by Longhi, Boucher and Fragonard in
suggestive poses as well as jewelry, snuff boxes, watches and an
assortment of silk items of clothing. ``The main occupation of my
entire life has been cultivating the pleasures of the senses,'' he
wrote. And in truth, these also included good food and good
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Venice in 1774, he already considered
himself enough of a writer to pen a fierce attack on Voltaire,
although he was forced by penury to spy for the very government
that once jailed him. And in due time it turned against him and
forced him anew into exile.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a youngster, he now wanted a patron more than
adventure. In 1785, he met Count Josef Karl von Waldstein, who
offered him a job as librarian at Dux castle near Prague. In 1787,
he met Mozart and, according to some accounts, may have offered
first-hand experience to help revise the libretto of ``Don
Giovanni,'' written by his old friend, Lorenzo da Ponte. It was in
Dux that he wrote his memoirs, in French, albeit only recounting
his life until 1774. And it was in Dux that he died in 1798.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the mid-19th century that Casanova became a
synonym for seduction, but since then he has been a constant
subject of fascination and opprobrium. He has inspired numerous
films, a good many of them spoofs, while his life keeps providing
writers with raw material.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Flem treated him gently last year in her book, ``Casanova:
The Man Who Really Loved Women'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux). This
year's new books include Andrew Miller's ``Casanova in Love''
(Harcourt Brace), just published, and, in France, Philippe Sollers'
``Casanova l'Admirable'' (Plon).
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all their caution, the organizers of the Venice
exhibition continue to view Casanova as a potentially pernicious
influence. Visitors to the museum's bookshop can buy the customary
catalog, T-shirts and posters. But they can also pick up free
condoms with Casanova's name on the packet, accompanied by a
written warning of the risks posed by AIDS to latterday Casanovas
who engage in unsafe sex.

`CHICAGO': A NEW STAR'S COOLNESS TRANSFORMS A REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ute Lemper has a face that instantly turns to black
and white in your memory. On the stage of the Shubert Theater,
playing the murderous vaudevillian Velma Kelly in the hit revival
of ``Chicago,'' this German-born cabaret star gives the impression
that she has been personally lighted by George Hurrell, the
old-style Hollywood portrait photographer who wrought such miracles
in bringing out cheekbones.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem quite real, that face, more like a surreal
composite of studio stills of, say, Dietrich and Lombard. Her
eyebrows penciled into exclamations of ironic surprise, her mouth
like a carefully painted scar, Ms. Lemper, who won an Olivier Award
in this role in the London company of ``Chicago,'' is glamorous,
for sure, but she also appears to be commenting dryly on the very
idea of glamour.
</P>
<P>
   The same, coolly distanced attitude transfuses every aspect of
her performance in ``Chicago,'' which just celebrated its second
anniversary on Broadway, and it definitely adds another, more
worldly level to a satiric show that celebrates the artifice of
show biz.
</P>
<P>
   As a cabaret singer, Ms. Lemper specializes in the work of Kurt
Weill, and she brings more than a touch of the alienating stance
associated with Brecht, Weill's longtime collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking her swizzle-stick legs into impossible angles, speaking
out of the side of her mouth in perfect American gangsterese,
singing with period panache, she's like a highly intelligent
visitor from another world who has made a thorough study of the
local customs. Even doing that undulating, arm-waving walk so
particularly associated with Bebe Neuwirth, who won a Tony in the
same part, she appears to be deconstructing herself into Cubist
fragments. She's not likable in the way that Ms. Neuwirth was, but
you can't take your eyes off her.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of all possible productions, Ms. Lemper's
performance would be of a piece with the show around her. This may
have been the case in London (I didn't see ``Chicago'' there), but
it isn't here. Her imported European intellectualism is in direct
contrast to the manner of her co-star, Karen Ziemba, who plays
Velma's rivalrous fellow con and man killer, Roxie Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ziemba is aglow with all-American enthusiasm, sending out
rays of warmth instead of cool laser beams. If Ms. Lemper is
Dietrich, Ms. Ziemba is June Allyson, taking on a bad-girl role and
loving it.
</P>
<P>
   This can be disorienting when the actresses share the stage.
It's like watching one of those commercials in which figures from
old movies are spliced into contemporary images. Yet while you sigh
for the blissfully synchronized teamwork of Ms. Neuwirth and Ann
Reinking, who originated the role of Roxie in this production, you
still don't leave feeling you've been served leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   The revival is not the near-perfect piece of machinery the show
was when it opened. The corps de ballet, for instance, is
definitely more ragged. And there's a sense, at the moment, that
the cast is working a shade too hard to sell the show, when the
production demands a slightly contemptuous insouciance.
</P>
<P>
   But among Broadway musicals, ``Chicago'' remains the best adult
entertainment in town. Since the show is conceived as a
self-conscious series of vaudeville turns, it can accommodate
different styles of performance in a way most musicals could not.
And for all its satiric cynicism, and the temperature-lowering
presence of Ms. Lemper, it still bubbles with the joy of
performing. And, ah, what a score.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Lemper and Ms. Ziemba, there is now, most
conspicuously, Brent Barrett as the silver-tongued lawyer Billy
Flynn. He has persuasively reconceived the role, for which James
Naughton won a Tony, in a younger, hungrier vein. He brings to mind
one of those eager, slightly sinister big-band singers of the
1940's, with the hint of a predilection to violence behind the
toothpaste smile, and his voice is first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McGowan and R. Bean (who does florid wonders with vocal
embroidery), in the respective roles of Roxie's hapless husband and
a saccharine sob sister, are appropriately antithetical as the most
real and unreal characters in the production. But the revival's
solar center is now Marcia Lewis, its one remaining original
principal.
</P>
<P>
   As Mama Morton, the proudly corrupt prison matron, Ms. Lewis is
as vital and deliciously nasty as she was in 1996, giving the lie
to the notion that long runs make stale actors. Her delivery of her
first-act solo, ``When You're Good to Mama,'' mixes a highly
polished, sardonic style with a roguish ease, the sense that she's
complicitously sharing a joke with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   That sums up the appeal of ``Chicago.'' Two years down the road,
even in this somewhat lopsided incarnation, it still leaves you
grinning.

IN INTERVIEW, BLAIR SEES HOPE FOR OVERTHROW OF SADDAM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair said Tuesday that Britain had
evidence of growing opposition to President Saddam Hussein inside
Iraq that would seem to give the Clinton administration's new call
for his overthrow a better chance of success than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his 10 Downing Street office, Blair said, ``I
don't want to go into the detail of that too much, because that is
obviously something we should discuss with the Americans, and we
are not issuing promises here that we can't keep.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a buildup of concern within Iraq over the
incredible damage he is doing to his own country. Now he may try to
explain what has happened over the weekend, as he always does and
even did at the end of the gulf war, as a wonderful victory, but
our assessment is that the claims against him are only
increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991 the Central Intelligence Agency has come up with at
least six plans to undermine the Iraqi leader, but they have fallen
victim to quarrels among exile groups or have been crushed by
Hussein's Republican Guards.
</P>
<P>
   British security services have assisted propaganda campaigns by
organizations like the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition of a
dozen opposition groups based in London.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Blair told Parliament that Britain would join the
American effort to strengthen coup-prone Iraqi dissident groups, a
move that represented a shift in British policy from one of
containing Hussein to one of trying to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said Tuesday that he fully supported the decision to call
off the planned air strikes on Saturday and discounted the view
that the events of the weekend had left Hussein more forceful than
ever. Blair had given the go-ahead for British Tornado
fighter-bombers to join American aircraft and cruise missiles in
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were called off after the Iraqi leader sent word to
the United Nations that he was prepared to resume cooperation with
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, including some heads of government, think
that Saddam Hussein wanted us to strike, that it would boost his
position enormously _ that he was really encouraged by the
possibility and that we were playing into his hands if we struck,''
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't buy any of it,'' he added. ``What the weekend proved
is that the thesis is complete nonsense. This is a dictator who,
when he saw we really were prepared to take action, completely
crumpled. Now no one can seriously think in terms of the stream of
clarifications _ written and oral _ that they were giving that they
were anything other than pretty desperate not to be attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair pointed to what he called another ``lesson for the
future'' drawn from the experience. ``There were people, even on
our own side, who were asking, `Do you really intend to carry this
thing through?''' Blair said. ``Well, I don't think there can be
any doubt about that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were literally minutes away from the attack taking place,
and the authorization had been given. So I think all those things
put us in a stronger position for dealing with this thing in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he found analyses that placed the United States and
Britain in the same position with Hussein as after the last
confrontation ``clever but ultimately not very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In February when the memorandum of understanding was entered
into, there had been a buildup over a period of months,'' he said.
``This time there was really only two weeks between the 30th of
October and the decision to use force. Next time there won't be any
negotiation at all _ there will just be action. And I think by
having built that strong base, by showing the international
community that we were prepared to give every chance for Iraq to
come back into compliance, that we've strengthened our hand.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of whether there was any hope that the Iraqi
leader might now keep cooperating with the United Nations
inspectors, Blair said: ``Again, let's be very blunt here. Nobody
relies on Saddam Hussein's good faith, because he doesn't have any.
It doesn't follow from that, however, that now that he knows _ and
I think he must surely understand and believe that we will take
action _ that he will not come back into compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about charges that France might have tipped Hussein off to
the timing of the attacks, Blair said, ``The thought is there on
paper, so obviously I have read it. I simply don't know if that is
the case, and I hope it's not the case. I mean I can't believe that
any country close to us would do such a thing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his 18 months in office, Blair has sought to make Britain a
leader in European social and economic politics even while the
country is staying out of the European monetary union, which begins
in January. Asked in the interview if the perception that Britain
was close to the United States aided or inhibited the country's
efforts at associating itself more closely with Europe, Blair said,
``I am a passionate believer that Britain does not have to choose
between a relationship with the European Union and a relationship
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is really central to Britain's future, that we
have to play a role to bring the U.S. and E.U. closer together in
terms of understanding and cooperation across a whole range of
issues, because you only have to look at this Iraq situation again
to realize that if it weren't for the U.S., the world would be a
far less secure place.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one level the European Union understands this, but it's
important that we in Britain, if we are key players in Europe, are
positive constructors and reinforce that sense.''
</P>
<P>
   As for monetary union, he said his government was bent on
preparing Britain for the beginning of the new European currency,
the euro, next year and for the day when a promised referendum is
held in Britain on whether the country should forsake the pound for
the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's stepped-up activity in recent weeks in this regard has
been widely interpreted as signaling acceptance of the decision
that its entry is no longer in doubt, just its timing.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he still anticipated that any action would be after
the next national election, or after about 2001. The British
economy is performing better than most economies in Europe, and
convergence at the moment would be detrimental to London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary union cannot be conceived of except politically, but
it can't work except economically,'' Blair said. ``So we have set
the test for us, we've eliminated all the barriers of principle,
we're preparing the country, we're out there. We will publish in
the next few weeks a national changeover plan to show people how it
could work, but we have to reserve that final position until we see
the clear economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's status in European capitals has grown because
center-left governments have come to power in most of them and
because of the attraction of his vaunted ``third way,'' which
promises reduced state spending and regulation and growing
opportunities for private enterprise. The most recent new arrival
on the continental scene, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany,
made it a point to come to London on his first trip abroad after
taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Blair conceded Tuesday that there were contradictory approaches
cohabiting the center-left rubric but argued that the many
conceptual similarities would ease agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the values that underpin our policies of social
justice, of community and of social cohesion are all very
important,'' he said, ``and we need totally new ways of, for
example, reforming welfare and tax and benefit systems to encourage
greater work and less dependency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got that opportunity and there are big structural
changes that we can make in Europe, and I believe that it's easier
for center-left parties to make changes. But that's a theory that
has got to be tested now in practice.''

   The Stones will be rolling again come Jan. 25. That's when the
band led by Mick Jagger starts its third North American tour in
three years. The ``No Security Tour'' will play at indoor arenas
rather than huge stadiums _ the Rolling Stones' first arena tour in
more than 20 years. The tour, through April 10, stops in Toronto
and 24 U.S. cities. New York and Los Angeles are not included, but
Anaheim, Calif., and Hartford, Conn., are.

   Mickey Mouse, who turns 70 Wednesday, is getting a niche in the
National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Along with the
1931 James Cagney gangster film ``The Public Enemy,'' Dennis
Hopper's 1969 counterculture classic ``Easy Rider'' and Sydney
Pollack's 1982 comedy ``Tootsie,'' Mickey's 1928 debut film,
``Steamboat Willie,'' is among 25 films chosen this year for their
contributions to American cultural history. They bring to 250 the
total in the registry, created by Congress in 1988 to celebrate
American films and call attention to the need to preserve them.

   Dishing Dirt
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it comes to the New Victory Theater, that Times
Square ornament dedicated to children, there's plenty of dirt to
discuss. The dirt _ 15 tons of it _ was dumped at the New Vic's
doorstep Tuesday and wheeled inside to create a rustic landscape
for the Young Vic Theater Company from London and its production of
``Grimm Tales'' opening on Friday. Playing through Jan. 3, the show
retells stories of Cinderella, Rumpelstiltskin, Little Red Riding
Hood and others in the Grimms' gritty fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Anniversary
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Luciano Pavarotti will celebrate the 30th anniversary
of his Nov. 23, 1968, Metropolitan Opera debut with a gala
performance at the opera house at 3 p.m. Sunday. It will include
fully staged acts from operas featuring Pavarotti in three of his
most famous roles: Nemorino in Donizetti's ``Elisir d'Amore,''
Rodolfo in Puccini's ``Boheme'' and Radames in Verdi's ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   One critic called it ``a spiral of crumpled boxes,'' but a hotly
debated avant-garde design by the Berlin-based architect Daniel
Libeskind for an extension to the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London has won approval from local planning officials. Residents of
South Kensington complained that the extension was out of character
with their neighborhood ... In Paris, a strike at the Musee d'Orsay
entered its second week Tuesday, shutting visitors out of a popular
exhibition of 85 paintings by Vincent van Gogh and his role model,
Jean-Francois Millet. Among other concessions, unions are demanding
a bonus for employees who deal directly with the crush of visitors.

IN A MOZART OPERA, A PERKY CHARACTER OUT OF ROSSINI
</HEADLINE>
 (For release on Sunday, Nov. 22)  
 (fb) 
By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it desperation among music marketers or just the nature of
celebrity that has turned career building into such spasms of
sudden success and sudden obscurity? Selling and buying the star is
a musical process as old as Franz Liszt, but the ascent to
belovedness has become more vertical. A certain hysteria is in the
air, with audiences needy for something to love and promoters eager
to supply it.
</P>
<P>
   Poor David Helfgott and his halting pianistic gifts are a vague
memory, where just last year frantic concertgoers reached out to
touch him. Helfgott's theme song, the Rachmaninoff Third Piano
Concerto, has left the pop charts and gone quietly back to its
middling place in the repertory. The meteor that was the Gorecki
Third Symphony in the early 1990's sits idly in the pages of the
Schwann record catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden fame is about expectation. A gift appears, shining with
promise. The more lavish the promise, the more likely that it will
be broken. Where there is substance behind the promise, sensible
retrenchment to a more manageable line of defense is possible: the
career burns, but at a lower wattage. When celebrity is in the
personal story _ in Helfgott's case, his troubled childhood and
mental illness _ celebrity is brief, for a story survives only so
many repetitions.
</P>
<P>
   One recent convulsion of success is embodied by Cecilia Bartoli,
an earthy Italian mezzo-soprano with all the bel canto moves and a
lot of personal charm. With her admirable command of rapid-fire
execution and pointed, if smallish, voice, Bartoli has made
everybody happy: audiences, impresarios and presumably herself.
</P>
<P>
   I first heard her sing Haydn eight years ago at the Metropolitan
Museum. Vividness, absolute command, dead-on musicality: one woke
up. Not that European operatives had not already spotted Bartoli.
Music from ``La Cenerentola'' quickly became her trademark, and the
Bartoli career and Rossini's comic opera remain handcuffed
together.
</P>
<P>
   Bartoli began to record songs and arias, and to ply the recital
routes across the country. The public came running. Public
television, always interested in the instantly recognizable
performer, added Bartoli to its stable of pledge-week attractions:
Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, Luciano Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
   The tease of expectation helped make Bartoli big, for here was a
wildly promising opera singer who sang (italics) from (end italic)
operas but rarely (italic) in (end italic) them. We knew about
``Cenerentola''; we knew what an ideal Rosina she was for any
``Barber of Seville.'' So surely these were staging points for a
big opera career to come. What wonders might await when those
blessed days onstage came our way at last. Euphoria implied
limitlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The blessed days began to arrive when the Metropolitan Opera
staged Mozart's ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' with Bartoli not as the expected
Dorabella but in the relatively minor part of Despina. Given to us
was the bouncy charm and high-energy comedy promised. Next the Met
put on its own ``Cenerentola.'' Bouncy charm and high-energy comedy
were with us once more. And now more Mozart at the Met, ``Le Nozze
di Figaro.'' Bartoli, as Susanna, has wowed a grateful public with
her bouncy charm and high-energy comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing the Bartoli charm from a single Rossini character has
been exhilarating, but there is a problem. Mozart is not Rossini,
and Susanna is not Rosina. Bartoli either does not seem to know the
difference or cannot do anything about it if she does.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's ``Susanna'' is sly, funny, conflicted, alternately
strong-willed and weak. She is a complete human figure, created to
touch us; Rosina is a comedic machine, made to make us laugh.
Bartoli's Susanna is somewhat of a clown, though one who cries real
tears in ``Deh vieni'' in Act IV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figaro'' may not be the next step for Bartoli at all but may
instead be a declaration of limits. One senses in these latest
Mozart appearances a point of reconsideration and retrenchment, and
it is being perceived on both sides of the footlights. Revise
heroine worship to qualified admiration. Another mania healed, a
little sanity restored.
</P>
<P>
   If Manuela Hoelterhoff's droll account of the Bartoli phenomenon
(``Cinderella &AMP; Company'' from Knopf) is any indication, Bartoli
may be relieved to have the madness over, even if the downgrade
from superstardom cuts into her leverage, often highhanded, over
impresarios, conductors and directors. Millions of dollars have
come her way in a short time, and I'll bet she still has most of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Bartoli's operatic gifts are as winning as ever, and long may
she reign as a superior Rossini comedienne. Away from the opera
stage, she is a bright light for the Baroque and the Rococo. But as
an opera performer, Bartoli can only be who she is, and who she is
occupies a small corner of the repertory. Opera characters don't
inhabit Cecilia Bartoli; she inhabits them. Dress her up like
Violetta, and she will assuredly act like Cecilia Bartoli. John
Wayne got away with it. On the other hand, the genius of Groucho
Marx does not extend to ``King Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many other shooting stars around; maybe a few
asteroids, but that's about it. Big management is pushing hard for
Arcadi Volodos, a young Russian pianist of freakish virtuosity and
not a hint of Bartolian charm. Flaming briefly was the young tenor
Roberto Alagna, but after misguided marketing efforts, Alagna has
retreated meekly to the side of his wife and sometime singing
partner, the imperious Romanian Angela Gheorgiu. Bartoli's appeal
dwarfs such aspirants, but enough is enough. I think we shall love
Bartoli more wisely in the next few years and maybe just as well.

JEROME ROBBINS: TRIBUTE TO A PERFECTIONIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Ballet paid tribute Monday night to
Jerome Robbins, a towering innovator in American ballet and musical
theater and, with George Balanchine, one of the company's
co-founding choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before ``Jerome Robbins: A Memorial'' was scheduled to
begin, long lines stood outside the New York State Theater and the
audience that crowded the auditorium was rewarded with an eloquent
performance of ``Dances at a Gathering,'' one of Robbins' greatest
works, and a succession of tributes.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who died July 29 at the age of 79, was repeatedly
declared a perfectionist and one of the geniuses of 20th-century
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry defined perfectionist,'' said Schuyler Chapin, the city
commissioner of cultural affairs. Several speakers emphasized
Robbins' meticulous concern for detail, then added that his
insistent demands resulted from a total devotion to dance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the choreographer Twyla Tharp remembered that ``to me, he
was only kind, generous and wise.'' Chita Rivera, who created the
role of Anita in ``West Side Story'' on Broadway in 1957, called
Robbins ``the driving force of my career'' and discovered that when
working with him, ``if we did exactly what Jerry said, we would be
perfect.'' Reminiscing about ``West Side Story,'' she said that to
create a sense of rivalry between the warring factions in this
updated ``Romeo and Juliet,'' the performers cast as members of the
musical's rival street gangs always rehearsed separately and were
never allowed to speak to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Martins, City Ballet's ballet master in chief, recalled
that as a boy in Denmark, seeing the film version of ``West Side
Story'' made him want to come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The lighting designer Jennifer Tipton said, ``Working with
Jerry, I learned that movement and light went together in a way I
never before realized.'' Mentioning how Robbins would send her an
amaryllis every Christmas, she said she regarded him as a friend as
well as an artistic mentor.
</P>
<P>
   So did Jean-Pierre Frohlich, one of City Ballet's assistant
ballet masters. Looking back on his 30 years with company, he said
that he went from being a student to a friend of Robbins. And
always, he added, ``I was a sponge, soaking up all he gave.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his death, Robbins asked that people wishing to establish
memorials to him contribute to the New York City Ballet Emergency
Fund for Dancers and to Bide A Wee, the pet-adoption agency. Robert
LaFosse, a principal dancer with the company remarked: ``Dogs
always put Jerry in a good mood. He loved dogs to come to
rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing his memories of Robbins as ``a time necklace,''
Dr. Daniel Stern, one of the choreographer's old friends,
poignantly described how Robbins died peacefully at home, hugging
his friends and with a dog at his side and Bach on the phonograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dances at a Gathering'' received a beautifully nuanced
interpretation, led by Damian Woetzel as the sensitive youth whose
first entrance establishes the ballet's sense of wonderment. The
other members of the cast were Helene Alexopoulos, Monique Meunier,
Kyra Nichols, Miranda Weese, Wendy Whelan, Kipling Houston, Philip
Neal, Jock Soto and Christopher Wheeldon; Richard Moredock was the
pianist.
</P>
<P>
   On this occasion, more than the usual 10 dancers gathered
together. During the finale, the stage gradually filled with
members of the New York City Ballet and the curtain fell with the
company assembled in Robbins' honor.
</P>
<P>
   The evening also included readings of tributes from Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who said that Robbins ``changed the way we have
come to appreciate ballet and dance,'' and from ballet star Mikhail
Baryshnikov, who remembered the intensity of Robbins' presence in
rehearsal, ``even the squeak of his sneakers.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Wind advisories for gusts as high as 50 mph were issued for
parts of the southern Rockies Tuesday while snow advisories were
posted for parts of the northern Rockies. The concurrent advisories
were prompted by a potent Pacific low pressure system advancing
toward the Great Basin. Wednesday, the slightly weakening system
will churn across the upper Middle West, producing a variety of
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Light to moderate snows will fall across parts of the Dakotas
and northern Minnesota as relatively moist winds from the south are
forced to rise over a steadfast dome of low-level cold air. South
of the stripe of snow, steady, chilly rains will fall north of a
warm front associated with the low across portions of the upper
Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   To the south of the warm front, a few clusters of showers and
thunderstorms will sprout from the middle Mississippi Valley
southwestward toward northern Texas as a cold front wedges under
and lifts marginally moist air. Because of the lack of
accessibility to a rich supply of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico,
most showers and thunderstorms will not be heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of dense fog and low clouds will shroud the central and
eastern Gulf Coast states Wednesday morning. Fog and low clouds
will gradually but steadily dissipate during the day in all but a
few areas.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will move from east to west
across the southern half of Florida as winds from the east put a
sea-breeze front on a collision course with warm, humid air poised
over interior areas.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Arctic Sunset
</P>
<P>
   When the sun sets Wednesday at Barrow, Alaska, it will not rise
again until noon on January 24, 1999. The start of the long arctic
night at Barrow, the northernmost weather station in the nation,
signals the start of a process which brings bitter winter air
masses to the lower 48 states. Frigid air destined for southern
latitudes forms as the sunless polar regions continually radiate
heat into space. However, the air temperature since September has
averaged nearly 12 degrees above normal. In fact, readings have
been in the teens for the past week, while normal maximums are
close to zero degrees.

   FBC-AUBURN-OLEARY _ Auburn athletic director David Housel has
contacted Georgia Tech athletics director Dave Braine for
permission to discuss Auburn's coaching vacancy with George
O'Leary. (Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 8-10.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-UFFOOT _ Steve Spurrier's signal system and play calling.
How does this work? Why is 5-9 backup Billy Young the signal man?
And what's that like? Does Spurrier confer with anyone about calls.
Receivers coach Dwayne Dixon seems to be the sideline confidante.
And what about Young? Does he have input? Is someone assigned to
pick up tossed visors? There was one game, maybe Auburn, where
Johnson stood in the shotgun and Spurrier leaned forward, took a
look at the defense, then sent in the play. Does Spurrier actually
read defenses? What's going on, what about those signals?
Everything about the Spurrier sidelne. (Dolch, Palm Beach Post).

   FBC-GATECH-WAKE _ ATLANTA _ After scoring 40 points in five
straight games, the Georgia Tech offense has struggled in its last
three games. Most of the struggles can be attributed to the
opponent (Florida State and Clemson have two of the ACC's top
defenses), but nagging injuries have also hampered the Jackets.
Tech appears to be healthy heading into its final two games and
looks to rebound on offense Saturday against Wake Forest. (Rogers,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   FBC-FLA-FLASTATE _ GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Profile on Florida
quarterback Doug Johnson, who appears to be coming into his own
just in time for the big game with Florida State. Johnson has had
two straight great games, including 460 yards passing against
Vanderbilt. He was the hero in last year's upset of the No. 1
Seminoles (Barnhart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   FBC-GASOUTHERN _ After playing for 11 straight weeks, top-ranked
Georgia Southern takes a week off before opening the Division I-AA
playoffs next week. The Eagles will have home-field advantage for
the first two weeks of the playoffs. (Reese, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   FBN-FALCONS _ ATLANTA _ There is one thing worth mentioning
about upstarts and championship wannabes in the NFL: Some can't
handle prosperity. So what do Falcons coaches and veterans see in
this team to make them believe they won't face that problem?
(Winkeljohn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BASKETBALL
</P>
<P>
   BKC-DRIESELL _ ATLANTA _ Georgia State University coach Lefty
Driesell is set to join an elite group as he prepares to begin his
36th season of college coaching. Driesell has 699 career wins and
needs one to become only the 11th coach in college history to win
700 games. Now in his second season at Georgia State, the
66-year-old Driesell has been the savior of a Panther program that
only had three winning seasons in 34 years before his arrival.

<P>
   HKN-PANTHERS _ What goes into putting together a hockey team's
lines? Do you try to put veterans with veterans, rookies with
rookies, or mix 'em up. Within a line, what are the different
responsibilities? Panthers coach Terry Murray tends to mix his
lines up a lot, often changing them even during a game. Does that
prevent players from having enough time playing together to develop
a rapport on the ice? And what ever happened to the practice of
giving lines nicknames, like the Rangers' GAG (Goal-a-Game) line,
the Red Wings' Production Line, the Bruins' Kraut Line? (Biggane,
Palm Beach Post).

   FED-RATES (Washington) _ The Federal Reserve cut interest rates
again by a quarter of a percentage point Wednesday to help keep a
gradual economic slowdown from turning into a recession, but
signaled that it does not anticipate further rate reductions
anytime soon. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BUDGET-ACCORD (New York) _ A budget agreement is reached
between the City Council and the mayor. By Abby Goodnough.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL (Jerusalem) _ Despite speeches of condemnation by almost
every deputy, the Israeli parliament is expected to approve the
American-brokered peace plan by an overwhelming majority Wednesday
night, reflecting the widespread, pragmatic acceptance here of the
partitioning of the land of Israel. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-NUKE (Krasnoyarsk-26, Russia) _ More than 30 years ago,
this nuclear city was a bastion of privilege for the Soviet Union's
scientific elite. It remains closed to the world. But these days it
is an impoverished ward of the state, and a worry for Russia and
the United States, who fear Russia's best scientists will leave for
aspiring nuclear powers like Iran and Iraq. (A Special Report). By
Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-STARR (Washington) _ Developments as Kenneth Starr
prepares for his Thursday testimony before the House Judiciary
Committee. By Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   MONICA-VOICE (Washington) _ A presidential scandal that was
never long on mystery or romance surrendered perhaps its last
tantalizing secret Wednesday. What for the last ten months had been
heard only by select prosecutors, grand jurors, relatives and
waiters chattered, sobbed and wheedled around the world Wednesday.
Monica Lewinsky's endlessly tape-recorded voice _ like so much of
her uniquely interrupted, scrutinized life _ became public
property. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   DIET-ADS _ For the first time, the Federal Trade Commission is
issuing a set of advertising guidelines aimed specifically at the
nation's booming dietary supplement industry. While they do not
represent a significant change in policy, they outline provisions
in which supplement makers can be fined for making fraudulent
claims. By Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKERS-CANNOTQUIT (Sycamore, Ill.) _ To be a smoker in America
today is to be an outcast. It means being viewed as weak,
offensive, and, perhaps most of all, dim-witted. These are people,
after all, who do not seem to have the sense to come in from a
toxic thunderstorm. Most people who have never smoked cannot fathom
why anyone would put a cigarette in their mouth, one after the
next, and draw the noxious fumes. It should be simple to stop. But
almost anyone who has smoked heavily knows otherwise. By Dirk
Johnson.

NEW ENTERTAINMENT CHIEF AT FOX  
 NEWS-MAGAZINES UPDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fox network made it official Tuesday, appointing Doug Herzog
to replace Peter Roth as president of its entertainment division.
Herzog readily admitted that his background as a cable television
executive has not provided a wealth of experience in programming a
network prime-time schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot to learn,'' Herzog said in a telephone
interview. He is fresh from three years leading the Comedy Central
channel to consistently greater importance; and his appointment,
coming only three weeks after NBC named as its new entertainment
president Scott Sassa, another executive who built his reputation
in cable, says something about the direction of network
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a bit of a sea change going on,'' Herzog
said. ``Scott is a cable guy, too. This is clearly a tribute to
what cable has been able to do. I think it says the networks want
to maybe combine the cable approach with the resources of a
network.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he meant by the ``cable approach,'' Herzog said,
``risk-taking, a willingness to look at things differently.'' With
cable, he said, access to money and to the top levels of talent
could be limited, forcing cable programmers to look in new places
for shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cable, we always used to wonder what we would do if we had
all that network money,'' Herzog said. ``But sometimes it isn't
about money. Sometimes it's just about a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the case with ``South Park,'' the animated
series that Herzog brought to Comedy Central last season, all but
changing the channel's standing overnight, from an obscure, little
regarded channel to a dynamic emerging one.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog spent 17 years in cable, beginning with CNN before a long
stint at MTV, where he rose to become head of programming. He
steered MTV into trying regular shows, and that resulted in MTV
phenomena like ``Unplugged'' and ``The Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he moved on to become president of Comedy Central.
Again Herzog's programming instincts led to significant advances.
Beyond ``South Park,'' he initiated talked-about shows like ``Win
Ben Stein's Money'' and ``The Daily Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Herzog acknowledged that he did not feel entirely
comfortable jumping into the higher-stakes network system.
Referring to Sassa at NBC, he said: ``I think maybe Scott and I
will take a program development seminar at UCLA. We can commute
together.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herzog does enter the job with some sense of what is working
at Fox and what isn't. He said that he had ``enormous respect'' for
Fox talents like David Kelley, creator of ``Ally McBeal,'' and
Chris Carter, creator of ``The X-Files'' and ``Millennium,'' and
that he was looking forward to working with them.
</P>
<P>
   Of Fox's chronic problem in developing a live-action comedy to
go with its animated hits like ``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the
Hill,'' he said: ``I think you've got to look at different ways of
being funny. I don't think I'm offending anybody by saying that the
sitcom genre needs to be updated.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Fox's reliance on sometimes lurid video specials like
this month's ``When Good Pets Go Bad'' and ``World's Worst
Drivers,'' he said: ``On the one hand, they can be audaciously
brilliant. On the other hand, you can get too dependent on them. I
think they're a little like heroin. You can get stuck on them.
There's an old programming adage: Anything worth doing, is worth
overdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Fox executives have expressed reservations about this
genre of special, even though the shows perform spectacularly well
for the network in selected spots on the schedule during ratings
sweeps months. But the shows are not favorites of advertisers, they
do not sell well in foreign markets, and every time a network fills
an hour with one, that is an hour that has not been used to develop
what might be the next ``X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog said he would work through the end of the year at Comedy
Central, filling out his contract there. No successor has been
named at the channel. He will join Fox on Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job is absolutely about hit shows,'' he said. ``I know
that from my experience with `South Park.' If I can find hits at
Fox, I'll be successful. If I can't, I'll just be another
programmer looking for a job.''
</P>
<P>
   _ BILL CARTER &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Don't Stop Traffic
</P>
<P>
   Are news-magazine programs reaching the saturation point? The
Nielsen ratings for this season would proclaim yes, but the people
who produce ``48 Hours'' and ``Fox Files'' are paying no attention.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings for the seven other news magazines are down this
season from the comparable period last year. But CBS' ``48 Hours''
has been an exception to that trend, and ``Fox Files,'' which went
on the air only four months ago, just got a 22-episode renewal and
an unusually sumptuous new ``set,'' Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Dec. 3, ``Fox Files,'' seen on Thursdays at 9 p.m.,
will function without a formal set. Its introductory and
between-story segments with its co-hosts, Catherine Crier and Jon
Scott, will be taped amid the terminal's hurly-burly.
</P>
<P>
   Jabbing an elbow at networks that have spent millions building
or redesigning studio sets, Roger Ailes, chairman of Fox News,
said, ``We have a $200 million set, and we paid zip,'' referring to
the amount spent on the recent renovation of the landmark terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this show to be a little grittier and down at the
street level, so we're going where the people are,'' Ailes said.
New York City's rules, he added, were: ``We have to keep moving. We
can't stop traffic. We have to adjust to the flow of the operation
there rather than set up a fixed location that blocks entrances or
exits.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Fox Files'' and ``48 Hours'' took advantage of the summer
months when rival programs relied heavily on reruns, to snare new
viewers. ``48 Hours'' appeared twice weekly during the summer, and
its producer, Susan Zirinsky, said she thought that had led more
people to sample the program.
</P>
<P>
   For the first eight weeks of this season, ``48 Hours,'' on
Thursday nights at 10, has seen its Nielsen ratings rise by 14
percent in households and 11 percent in total viewers. Meanwhile,
all four editions of NBC's ``Dateline'' (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
and Friday) have slipped, compared with the same period a year ago,
with declines ranging from 12 percent to 29 percent. ABC's two
editions of ``20/20,'' on Wednesdays (where it was known as ``Prime
Time Live'' last year) and on Fridays, have slipped by 10 to 12
percent in households and total viewers.
</P>
<P>
   And the granddaddy of them all, CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' has slipped
a little, too, but only by 3 percent in households and 4 percent in
total viewers.

CANDIDATES FOR MAJORITY LEADER PLOT SECOND-BALLOT STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Candidates in the three-way race for the House
Republican leader's job plotted their ``second-ballot'' strategies
Tuesday on the assumption that none would win the required majority
on the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, and his two
challengers, Reps. Steve Largent, R-Okla., and Jennifer Dunn,
R-Wash., were busy telephoning colleagues to roundup support for
the Wednesday vote.
</P>
<P>
   Largent and Dunn launched their bids to replace Armey after
House Republicans suffered an embarrassing loss of seats in the
Nov. 3 election, cutting their majority in the House from 228-207
to 223-212. House Speaker Newt Gingrich resigned in the aftermath,
and Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, is virtually unopposed in his bid to
succeed Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Party leadership slots in the Republican caucus will be
determined by majority vote of all 223 Republicans in the new 106th
Congress that convenes in January; if all are present, the winner
would need 112 votes in the secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Another contest pits Republican Conference chairman John
Boehner, R-Ohio, against challenger J.C. Watts, R-Okla., a gifted
orator, former professional football player and the only black
Republican in Congress. Boehner is reported to have a slight
advantage but the contest is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Largent and Dunn were hoping that Armey would fall short of the
112 votes on the first round, forcing a second ballot between the
two highest vote getters in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   That could throw open the entire election because many pledges
of support expire after the first round, freeing the members to
start all over again in making their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Armey apparently was growing nervous that the voting might go
into a second round because many members reported he has been
calling them over the last couple days to ask their support in a
second-round ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Largent, a former professional football star who came to
Congress with the upstart class of 1994 and announced his bid for
majority leader three days after the Nov. 3 election, said in an
interview Tuesday that ``more than a dozen'' members who have
pledged to support Armey on the first ballot have promised him
their vote on any second ballot. Largent also said he has
commitments from dozens of Dunn's first-ballot supporters to vote
for him if there is a second ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very strong undercurrent of `we want change,'''
Largent said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hart, Largent's press secretary, said he expects Armey's
support ``will hemorrhage after the first ballot'' if he doesn't
get a majority. ``It will be a vote of no confidence'' and members
will be looking to switch their votes in a second round, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be head-to-head against Armey on the second ballot,''
Hart said, a prediction that assumed Dunn would be eliminated after
placing third on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Largent said he and his staffers have been ``strategizing and
developing a game plan,'' talking until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. each
morning following a 10 p.m. conference call each night with a team
of 26 fellow members who support his bid.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said Largent's staff is working with the intensity of a
``two-minute drill,'' a football term for a last-minute push to win
a game.
</P>
<P>
   The reception area in Largent's office showed evidence of a
marathon campaign. Couches and countertops were littered with Stay
Alert caffeine chewing gum and dozens of containers of congealed
carry-out food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very competitive,'' said Largent, a former wide receiver
for the Seattle Seahawks. ``All the adrenaline and juices are
flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent says he doesn't ``see a losing scenario,'' but added if
he fails to win the post it will have been a good learning
experience.
</P>
<P>
   As Largent and Dunn dueled to unseat Armey, their staffs have
maintained a sense of humor. Largent's office recently delivered
pizza to Dunn's office and Dunn's staffers returned the favor by
delivering Gatoraid and salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Largent and Dunn, who as vice chairman of the Republican
Conference is number five in the GOP leadership, have kept in
frequent communications. On Monday, Dunn rejected Largent's
suggestion that she throw her support behind him in exchange for a
leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dunn, the first woman to run for the House majority
leader's job, has focused on rounding up second-ballot supporters
since she announced her candidacy on Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into this with a second-ballot strategy,'' said Dunn's
spokeswoman Kara Kindermann, adding that Dunn realized when she
entered the race late that many members had already pledged their
first ballot support weeks earlier. ``All calls have been on the
second ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dunn fails in her bid for majority leader, she will not
attempt to reclaim her current seat of vice chairman for the
Republican conference, Kindermann said, adding, ``That would be
stepping backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Kindermann said Dunn doubts Largent's claims that he has more
second-ballot votes than she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure how sophisticated their vote counters are,''
Kindermann said, adding that Largent ``was out catching passes when
(Dunn) was building the Republican party.''

A SEARCHING JOURNEY INTO THE HEART OF BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)  
 (bl)  
 By LAURA WINTERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One morning in late 1996, Brazilian film director Walter Salles
was waiting for a flight in Rio de Janeiro when he was approached
by a 9-year-old shoeshine boy. At the time, Salles was preparing to
shoot his third feature film, ``Central Station,'' the tale of an
older woman and a boy who meet at Rio's train station and then
strike out on a journey into the hinterlands to find the boy's
father.
</P>
<P>
   Fernanda Montenegro, Brazil's doyenne of stage and film, had
agreed to play the woman, Dora, but Salles had still not found
anyone to play Josue, the child. ``In one full year we had tested
1,500 boys,'' he said. ``I was getting desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoeshine boy, Vinicius de Oliveira, had other concerns,
however. ``It was raining that day, and I wasn't making any
money,'' he recalled, speaking through an interpreter at the
Toronto Film Festival. ``I couldn't shine Walter's shoes because he
was wearing sneakers, but I asked if he could lend me some money so
I could eat and I would pay him back. He told me, `I'll give you
the money to buy a sandwich, but you also have to do a screen test
for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Vinicius finally showed up for the test, he brought his
friends with him, ``the entire fraternity of shoeshine boys from
the airport,'' Salles said, laughing. He chose Vinicius for the
role because, he said, ``I was looking for a boy who knew what the
battle for survival was, but who had not lost his innocence in
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot even say that I found Vinicius. It's more honest to
say that he found me.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how ``Central Station'' was made, over a vast
territory, with a small budget and crew and many novice
collaborators, embodies the theme of the film itself: the triumph
of steadfastness over adversity. Both a portrait of present day
Brazil and a two-person drama, ``Central Station,'' which opened
Friday, manages to be intimate and epic, local and universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I woke up with this idea of a film about a quest,''
said Salles, 42. ``It was the search for a father that a kid had
never met, the search of an old woman for the feelings that she had
lost and the search somehow for a certain country that was not the
country I was living in anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Salles' work is informed by the search for identity, both on a
personal and national level, a concern stemming largely from his
own background. Born in Brazil to a banking family, he spent part
of his childhood abroad, in France and the United States, where his
father was a diplomat. When he returned to Brazil, he eventually
decided to become a documentary filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   This combination of an outsider's perspective and an insider's
understanding has shaped Salles' work. ``I think the fact that I
have been raised in several different countries has given me both a
sense of continuous exile and a desire to understand my own
culture,'' he said recently in New York, speaking in fluent
English.
</P>
<P>
   The dark-haired Salles, who has kind eyes and a ready laugh, is
both warm and disarmingly modest. ``When you come from a privileged
part of Brazilian society, as I do, you have to opt either to be
part of that culture of indifference or to understand what the
country really is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His movie comes at a time when Brazilian cinema is once again
flourishing. After a period of forced inactivity in the early
1990s, when the government of President Fernando Collor de Mello
froze individual bank accounts and shut down the state film agency,
film production has risen to approximately 40 films a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of everyday life that ``Central Station''
depicts is harsh. In the film, Dora is a bitter woman who makes her
living in Rio's Central Station, writing letters for illiterate
people. She takes their money but discards the letters. One day she
writes a letter for a mother and her little boy ( de Oliveira).
When the mother is killed in an accident outside the station, Dora
tries to sell the boy for adoption. Realizing that she has instead
sold him to a sinister organization in which he may come to harm,
she rescues the boy and the two set out on a bus trip to find his
father.
</P>
<P>
   For Salles, Dora is the epitome of modern Brazil, with its
``culture of cynicism.'' But as Dora grudgingly develops a bond
with the boy ``she begins to understand that the boy's route and
the boy's ordeal are comparable to her own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The growing friendship between these two _ more comradely than
mother-son _ is, for Salles, a symbol of a Brazil where solidarity
and compassion may be buried but are still present. His film is not
utopian, but it celebrates the diversity both of the land and of
what Salles calls the ``human geography'' that Dora and Josue
encounter on their journey.
</P>
<P>
   When the screenplay of ``Central Station,'' based on an idea of
Salles' and written by Joao Emanuel Carneiro and Marcos Bernstein,
won a prize sponsored by the Sundance Institute and the Japan
Broadcasting Corporation in early 1996, it attracted the attention
of Arthur Cohn, the Swiss independent producer who has won five
Academy Awards (one for Vittorio De Sica's ``Garden of the
Finzi-Continis'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Like De Sica, Walter's approach is humanistic,'' said Cohn.
``De Sica taught me that there were four main points to making
significant films. One was to cast actors who are right for the
part, not just those with big names. Two was to shoot the film on
authentic locations. Three was that sex, violence or special
effects are not necessary unless they're intrinsic to the story.''
He smiled. ``Four was not to listen to everybody's advice, but to
follow your intuition.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn signed on as producer, and with his principal cast finally
in place Salles started the collaborative rehearsal process he had
favored with his second film, ``Foreign Land'' (1995). ``It's a
work almost like that of theater,'' said Ms. Montenegro, 69, in New
York. ``For two months we sat around a table, reading and
discussing the script.''
</P>
<P>
   The long preparation allowed Salles to move quickly and to
improvise once filming began in November 1996. During the filming
of Ms. Montenegro's scenes in the railroad station, several
passersby took her to be an actual letter-writer and asked her to
write letters for them, scenes that made it into the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In following the journey of Dora and Josue, Salles had to move
his team from Rio to remote regions of northeast Brazil, to the
states of Bahia and Pernambuco. ``The transport from one place to
another sometimes took three days on dirt roads,'' said Salles.
``It was like being in a circus for several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nor were conditions easy, due to the extreme heat and the
poverty of the villages where Salles was filming. Yet the welcome
that his crew received allowed the unforeseen to occur, as in a
scene where Dora and Josue come upon a religious pilgrimage in full
swing. Salles had the actual pilgrims recreate this candlelight
vigil, which takes place every year in the town of Cruzeiro do
Nordeste. ``As 1,000 people came together, candles in hand,
praying, the scene immediately became real,'' recalled Ms.
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Salles is a largely self-taught filmmaker. After studying
history and economics in college in Brazil, he attended only one
year of film school, at the University of Southern California,
before returning to Rio in 1981 to make documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   His move toward feature films was gradual. In 1989, he directed
``Exposure,'' starring Peter Coyote and based on the Brazilian
writer Rubem Fonseca's novel ``High Art.'' ``Foreign Land,'' about
two young Brazilians bereft in Lisbon, delved into the themes of
physical and spiritual voyage and of loss leading eventually to
self-discovery. ``Sometimes I am asked why I was so pessimistic in
`Foreign Land' and why I open the possibility of optimism with
`Central Station,''' Salles said. ``But the films portray different
moments of Brazilian reality.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``When you see films today, it seems that most of the
characters endure a situation they cannot control,'' he said.
``Here I wanted to show that tough as life may be, it can be
possible to transcend this initial adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   This hopeful message may explain the wiespread appeal of
``Central Station.'' The film has been a big success in Brazil,
where it has been seen by more than a million viewers, but it also
had positive audience response at the Sundance, Toronto and Berlin
film festivals. In Berlin last February, it won the prize for best
film and Ms. Montenegro was named best actress. ``During the
screenings we held in Toronto, I saw tears rolling down people's
faces,'' said Ramiro Puerta, the programmer for Latin American and
Spanish films in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens around the world, Salles' own life these days
resembles a road movie. But even in the wake of ``Central
Station's'' success, he has no plans to relocate from Rio _ where
he lives in a forested area outside the city with his six large
dogs _ or to change his thematic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   With Daniela Thomas, a co-director of ``Foreign Land,'' Salles
has written and directed a short feature called ``Midnight,'' and
he will work again with Arthur Cohn on two films still being
written.
</P>
<P>
   Embarking on these projects, Salles seems to want to explore
further the need for connection _ whether between individuals or
between peoples _ that ``Central Station'' embraces. `` `Central
Station' is much more about brotherhood than it is about a specific
country,'' he said. ``Even as an artist, you need to know that what
you do is part of a larger whole. You need to be part of a
dialogue.'' He smiled. ``In Brazil, we have this expression: `One
bird alone does not announce the spring.'''

GORE'S COMMENTS OVERSHADOW APEC MEETING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Lurking in the background at almost any
international economics conference is the dreaded topic of politics
and its ability to get in the way of making fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum has
prided itself on keeping judgmental political assessments as far
off stage as possible, a neat trick given the varying ideological
hues of the nations involved.
</P>
<P>
   But Vice President Al Gore's siding with the anti-government
movement in conference host Malaysia has at least temporarily
breached the firewall. And his comments overshadowed the economic
work of the annual meeting that ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declared that democracy was the pillar on which true
economic prosperity and progress must be founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among nations suffering economic crises, we continue to hear
calls for democracy and reform,'' Gore said, including
``reformasi,'' the cry of the Malaysian protest movement whose
chief aim is an end to the 17-year-rule of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear (the calls) today _ right here, right now _ among the
brave people of Malaysia,'' Gore said in a speech Monday night to
the APEC Business Summit.
</P>
<P>
   His comments ignited a firestorm that swirled around the APEC
leaders' meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's foreign minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, issued a
formal statement calling Gore's remarks a ``brazen violation'' of
diplomatic norms and a call ``to lawlessness'' by advocates who
want to overthrow Mahathir's ``constitutionally elected
government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Malaysians do not take kindly to sanctimonious sermonizing
from any foreign quarter, especially the United States, a country
which is known to have committed gross violations of human
rights,'' Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended his comments and drew solid backing from the White
House, where spokesman Joe Lockhart said the vice president echoed
President Clinton's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy and self-government ``is the American message,'' Gore
said Tuesday, ``and I am proud to deliver it here and anywhere I
go.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said Gore ``did not intend to associate
himself with a particular agenda'' of any Malaysian faction.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the vice president chose a loaded word in
``reformasi,'' which has come to be associated with the
anti-Mahathir activists.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has been fueled by Mahathir's dismissal in
September of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his subsequent
arrest on corruption and sodomy charges, allegations Anwar claims
were trumped up to stunt his political appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-government demonstrators have regularly clashed with police
since Anwar's arrest, including a couple of times during
conferences in advance of the APEC leaders' meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's trial was suspended during the APEC meeting, but several
delegates, including U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
held supportive visits with his wife, Azizah Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   APEC leaders were split over Gore's statement _ its substance,
timing, possibility of provoking a backlash and introduction of
politics into the economic conference.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who spent much of a
40-minute meeting with Mahathir on Tuesday criticizing the arrest
of Anwar, questioned Gore's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't necessarily achieve desirable outcomes by constantly
hectoring other nations in order to change they way they run their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong suggested Gore's comments
should have been made directly to Mahathir or his ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders who want to bring up political issues should do so at
bilateral meetings rather than using the regional economic forum,''
Goh said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippines President Joseph Estrada, who met with Anwar's wife,
backed Gore. ``As the president of a democratic country, I go along
with his opinion,'' Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
   Lim Kit Siang, opposition leader in Malaysia's parliament, said
Gore would not have had to make the comments if Mahathir had been
more responsive to calls for democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling of national embarrassment that a foreign
leader should be talking about the need for democratic change in
Malaysia on our own soil,'' Lim said.
</P>
<P>
   APEC analysts said Gore's comments could hurt the organization's
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an unspoken rule that APEC members didn't
interfere with internal matters,'' Darby Higgs, of Monash
University in Melbourne, Australia, told CNN. ``The United States
coming in and lecturing on what (the Asian countries) regard as
internal matters is, I think, quite dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Malaysian human rights activists were not looking for
Gore's comments to have any great effect, and some worried that the
vice president's remarks could prove counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome such statements,'' said Elizabeth Wong, coordinator
of Voice of the Malaysian People. ``But very frankly I don't think
it will have any direct effect on the human rights cause in
Malaysia. It's just encouraging to know that other people are
thinking about you.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has always been a target of the liberal
critics of APEC's drive toward a global economy. A borderless
financial world, critics argue, will be created for the already
wealthy multinational corporations and at the expense of the poor
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Even before leaders of the 21 member economies arrived in the
Malaysian capital, the Far Eastern Economic Review described the
session as ``the APEC summit no one wants.'' As the leaders leave
Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday that seemed a prescient view.

ELISABETH OWENS, 79, FIRST WOMAN GRANTED TENURE AT HARVARD LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elisabeth Ann Owens of Falmouth, &UR;  &LR; Mass., the first woman granted
tenure at Harvard Law School, died of Parkinson's disease Sunday in
Falmouth Hospital. She was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Owens was a professor at Harvard Law School from 1972 until
her retirement in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, dean Robert C. Clark described her as a ``pioneer, both
in her scholarship that helped develop the field of international
tax law, and in her appointment as the first tenured woman
professor at Harvard Law School.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Boston, she graduated from Girls Latin School and Smith
College, and did graduate work in economics at the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, she was an economist for the Office of
Price Administration, the State Department, and the Bureau of the
Budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I had no intention of becoming a lawyer,'' she said
in a profile published in the summer 1988 issue of the Harvard Law
Journal. ``After a year the war came along and I went to Washington
to work as an economist and procedures analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that I wanted to practice law,'' she said. ``It was
that lawyers had the reputation of being the only ones who
understood the English language ... although I have long since
learned that this is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Yale Law School in 1951, she practiced
with the firm of Hill, Barlow, Goodale &AMP; Adams for several years
before becoming a research assistant to professor Stanley S. Surrey
at Harvard Law School in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign tax credit became a focus of her work, she said,
because ``at one point Professor Surrey asked me, `What is a
creditable tax law?' My answer turned into three books.''
</P>
<P>
   She was the author of the textbook ``Foreign Tax Credit'' and
co-author of the two-volume text ``The Indirect Tax Credit.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves two sisters, Margaret Harris of Falmouth and Mary
Bemis of Randolph, Mass.; and two brothers, Cornelius Owens of West
Roxbury, Mass. and Graham Owens of Yarmouth, Mass.

</P>
<P>
   You must pay for some services, such as recommendations from
Wall Street analysts. Monthly subscriptions go for $9.95, with a

</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Personal
Finance'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13.95) by Kenneth M. Morris and Alan
M. Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   By far the best road map on personal finance for beginners.

features crisp layouts, simple charts and vivid photo illustrations
that help the reader digest some complex subjects.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Get A Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your 20s and 30s''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $11.00) by Beth Kobliner.
</P>
<P>
   A cool guide for young folks rollerblading out of school. The
33-year-old Kobliner, a Brown University graduate who studied
literature, is proof that anyone with a college degree and some
brain matter can master their finances.
</P>
<P>
   This well-written primer is filled with helpful tips on money
management, from escaping credit card debt to picking a mutual
fund. Also good for older readers getting started on all things
financial.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Consumer Reports Money Book'' (Consumer Reports Books,
$29.95) by Janet Bamford et al; ``Making the Most of Your Money''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $30) by Jane Bryant Quinn; ``The Money Book of
Personal Finance'' (Warner Books, $24.95) by the Money editors;

<P>
   You can't go wrong with any of these money encyclopedias. You
can hire a financial adviser for $100 an hour _ or read these and
teach yourself the basics.
</P>
<P>
   The books by Consumer Reports and Money magazine boast chapters
by many authors. The book by Quinn, Newsweek's personal finance
columnist, is the most enjoyable read. And Tyson's book has the
cutest graphics.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Money Makeovers: How Women Can Control Their Financial
Destiny'' (Doubleday, $24.95) by Christopher Hayes and Kate Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   This stimulating book, by psychologist Hayes and New York
journalist Kelly, blends academic theory and real-life practice.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news from the authors: Fear of failure and the unknown
are the biggest hurdles to women's financial success.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Women can be better investors than men because of
their patience, intuition, networking and goal-setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Smart Money Moves for African-Americans'' (G.P. Putnam, $12)
by Kelvin Boston; ``The Black Woman's Guide to Financial
Independence'' (Penguin Books, $15.95) by Cheryl Broussard.
</P>
<P>
   A former IDS/American Express financial planner and the host of
PBS's ``Color of Money'' series, Boston offers many strategies for
wealth building in this first-rate guide.
</P>
<P>
   He writes, ``Many African-Americans are fixated on living a
pious life, the Porgy and Bess syndrome: I got plenty of nothing,
and nothing's plenty for me. Well, I don't think so. Having plenty
of nothing means just that _ no savings, no home and no retirement
accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The book by Broussard, an investment adviser at Cheryl Broussard
&AMP; Co. in Oakland, Calif., also is a great starting point for anyone
wishing to build a strong financial foundation. It contains good
worksheets and clear explanations.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``New Families, New Finances: Money Skills for Today's
Nontraditional Families'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $14.95) by Emily Card
and Christie Watts Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Are you a single parent? A divorced person? A grandparent? A
racial minority? This book is for those who don't fit the ``Father
Knows Best'' mold of the old-fashioned nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the financial advice is generic. But at the end of each
chapter, the authors give tips tailored for nontraditional groups.
</P>
<P>
   Single parents, for example, should make sure they carry enough
health, life and disability insurance. Or couples with vast age
differences should have separate investment portfolios best suited
for their stages of life.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Gay Finances in a Straight World'' (J.K. Lasser and The
Advocate, $19.95) by Peter M. Berkery Jr. and Gregory A. Diggins.
</P>
<P>
   While gays and lesbians face the same financial challenges as
everyone, they also must grapple with troublesome legal issues
because they can't marry. Plus, they face discrimination from
financial companies, the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   One example: People applying for insurance must list a
beneficiary, someone with a vested financial interest in their
lives. Typically this means a family member or a business partner.
Unlike heterosexuals, gays often find their beneficiaries are
turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The authors give concrete advice for gay and lesbian couples to
deal with that situation and others.
</P>
<P>
   This book has handy worksheets and real-life examples by
Berkery, a financial writer, and Diggins, an accountant and a
certified financial planner.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A conservative group tried Tuesday to derail
President Clinton's plans for an $850,000 settlement of Paula
Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit by charging that the source of
the funds would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The president plans to use $450,000 from a Chubb Group insurance

from Clinton friends and supporters.

court in Little Rock, Ark., to reject the payment arrangement
unless the president uses personal funds or takes out a bank loan
at market rates. The payment plans outlined in published reports
would constitute influence-peddling and an illegal gratuity to a
public official, said the brief.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lucas, counsel for the Clinton's legal defense fund,
said Tuesday the rules of the fund would allow such a payment, but
that there has been no request yet. Lucas said the fund observes
federal ethics rules for the president and first lady.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fund would have to raise more funds. The cost of
the Jones settlement comes on top of more than $6 million in
accumulated legal expenses for the Clintons. About $4.5 million was
still unpaid as of the middle of August.
</P>
<P>
   Chubb's decision to pay just over half of the Jones settlement
is a change of course for the insurer, which discontinued its
participation a year ago when the Jones lawsuit was dismissed by
the district court. A Chubb spokeswoman, citing a company policy
that forbids discussing clients, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, both Chubb and the State Farm Insurance Co. split an
estimated $1 million in legal costs for defending Clinton, whose
private lawyer Robert S. Bennett charges $500 an hour. State Farm
stopped contributing in September 1997, after Jones dropped the
charge of defamation of character, the only allegation that fit
under the State Farm ``umbrella'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Such high-coverage insurance policies have grown in popularity
in recent years as a form of extra protection against major
lawsuits for personal liability that may not be covered by
homeowner or auto policies. Clinton purchased his State Farm policy
shortly before he moved into the White House. It is not known how
long he owned the Chubb policy.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly popular umbrella coverage is usually taken out
by people with large assets to protect, insurance experts say.
State Farm, for example, insures 26.7 million households and holds
1.5 million such ``umbrella'' policies. The coverage includes
negligence, libel and other liability.
</P>
<P>
   However, they generally exclude deliberate wrongdoing such as
illegal discrimination.

 &HT;    Baker leaves PSC for position with MindSpring Enterprises
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When MindSpring needed someone to head its lobbying
efforts, the upstart corporation played it straight.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Baker, like most lobbyists, has a mind honed in law school
and a career steeped in policy.
</P>
<P>
   Baker leaves the Public Service Commission, becoming MindSpring
Enterprises main policy man Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the five-person commission, Baker helped regulate
the utilities and telecommunication industries. He was elected to
the commission in 1994, as part of a small wave of highly educated
people who started replacing the good old boys that had sat on the
PSC for years. Recently, Baker headed the commission's
telecommunications committee.
</P>
<P>
   At MindSpring, the south's largest Internet service provider,
Baker will head the company's effort to expand into new markets and
offer other kinds of high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Baker is an advocate of competition in the telecommunications
market. In 1995, he was named to the Communications Committee of
the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. Baker
also was recently picked as one of four members of the
Federal-State Universal Service Joint Board, where he worked with
the Federal Communications Commission on telephone rates.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who lives in Atlanta, was named by Georgia Trend magazine
named as one of the 75 Georgians Who Were Leaders in their Fields''
for 1996. He earned his undergraduate degree at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore in 1984 and studied law at Washington and
Lee in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's six-year term on the Public Service Commission was up in
2000.

 &HT;    BellSouth sees great potential in cable marketBy Michael E.
Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to the market for cable television,
BellSouth believes it is shaking a tree with low-hanging fruit _
much of it ready to drop from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Competing cable companies in metro Atlanta are skeptical, but
BellSouth says it has had ``hundreds of thousands of calls'' from
potential customers since the June launch of wireless cable service
_ too many for the company to serve right away, said John Hartman,
vice president of BellSouth Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been enormous interest,'' he said. ``If we were to
serve everybody who had expressed interest, we would be well into
next year or beyond. We have frustrated a lot of customers who want
our service.''
</P>
<P>
   To minimize customer frustration, BellSouth has ``scaled down''
areas to be served and then targeted marketing to hit only
customers who can get the service, Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless cable is something of an oxymoron, since the service is
a little of both. The service is more precisely known as metro
microwave distribution system, or MMDS, with its signals
transmitted via radio waves to a receiver on the customer's roof or
in a tree. BellSouth spent $43.5 million to buy the company that
held the license to provide the service, then poured millions more
into building a digital system.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a defensive and offensive weapon rolled into one
in the war for market share. In its nine-state region, BellSouth
means for wireless cable to protect its own customer base while
attacking the multi-billion-dollar cable business.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has four antennas beaming signals to metro Atlanta.
But thousands of homes are behind buildings or hills and cannot
receive those signals. Still, BellSouth believes the technology can
connect up to two-thirds of metro Atlanta, a formidable chunk of a
huge and growing market.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the challenge, area cable companies are pumping hundreds
of millions of dollars upgrading lines for high-speed digital
services, along with juiced-up television. In addition the poor
quality of their lines, cable companies are vulnerable because of a
lingering reputation for poor service. Cable executives acknowledge
customer animosity. ``We have not pleased all our customers, but we
are working hard to regain their confidence,'' said Dale Ordoyne,
MediaOne vice president. ``We would like our customer service
standards to be upheld at a higher level. We are improving, but we
are not where we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ordoyne questioned the success of BellSouth's offering.
MediaOne has seen only a handful of its 540,000 customers defect,
he said. ``We track customers that migrate to our competitors, and
we have seen only minimal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials in October told analysts in a New York
briefing that the company has over 100,000 cable customers in the
region, including wireless systems in Atlanta and New Orleans, some
wired cable in DeKalb County and three other developments. That
figure would indicate that BellSouth has tens of thousands of
customers in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's programming line-up is not radically different from
its rivals _ at least, where rivals have upgraded their systems.
There are the usual networks, sports, various history and science
and a host of premium channels _ for an extra fee _ along with
enough pay-per-view options so a user can avoid waiting very long
for a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Prices appear comparable, too. BellSouth is charging between
$100 and $200 for installation _ an up-front expense similar to a
cable upgrade or purchase of a satellite dish. Depending on the
package, BellSouth's service costs between $35 and about $80 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth believes it has an advantage in the way a user can
``navigate.'' A viewer can see what else is showing without
switching from the channel he or she is watching. The system also
shows viewers how much longer a show will be on. Channel surfers
can see what a station is showing even if they land there during a
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot emphasize that too much,'' Hartman said. ``It changes
the way you watch television.''
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne's upgrade will offer a system with a similar navigator
_ with better pricing, Ordoyne said. For instance, a household will
not pay more hooking up multiple televisions, the way they do for
BellSouth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rivals do not quite go head-to-head. For one thing, MediaOne
provides the first piece of its advanced video offering _ which
includes more channels and choices _ to 200,000 homes out of the
925,000 homes it passes. Its two-way broadband service, which
includes the option of telephone service, is available to 70,000 of
those 200,000 homes, Ordoyne said.
</P>
<P>
   But as time passes, BellSouth and its cable rivals will pit
their best technologies against each other in more and more places.
The confrontation promises to get tougher while the stakes grow.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, BellSouth's reputation as a ubiquitous and reliable
provider of dial-tone is a lure to customers tired of crashing
cable systems. But if wireless cable does hit any snags, it could
tar the company's overall image. BellSouth has had a century to
hone its phone network. Can it deliver similar reliability with a
new technology?
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth declines to say how long it will be before this
service is profitable or how much of the market it expects to pick
off, but clearly, the company is confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy market shares are absolutely attainable,'' Hartman
said. ``If we thought this was a single-digit penetration business,
we would never have gone into it.''

 &HT;    BellSouth's experiment a lesson
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Several months ago, BellSouth quietly pulled the plug
on its experiment in interactive cable, concluding that much of it
was not going to make money _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-month trial in Chamblee and DeKalb County, Ga. once
touted as a peek into the future of two-way television, convinced
the company, which for a century has specialized in phones, that it
could deliver entertainment to the home.
</P>
<P>
   But features like ``true video-on-demand,'' which gave users
control of movies on demand, are not readily profitable, said John
Hartman, BellSouth vice president. ``It was not utilized to the
degree that would support it from an economic standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   With blazingly fast connections, the Chamblee video-on-demand
feature let viewers start a film when they wanted, suspending and
restarting the action at any time. For $1 less, BellSouth offered
the more typical pay-per-view with pre-ordained starting times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given no price difference, people would like to have more
control,'' Hartman said. `` We found that consumers didn't mind
adhering to a schedule. But it wasn't worth an extra dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth also overestimated how fast some technology costs
would fall, while not foreseeing how quickly others would rise, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the larger surprises, especially the growth
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers had new alternatives for entertainment,'' Hartman
said. ``It undercut the way we presented content at the time. What
was cutting-edge became commonplace.''
</P>
<P>
   When the trial ended, most of the users agreed to stay customers
of BellSouth Entertainment, Hartman said. They receive the same
programming delivered by BellSouth's wireless cable service.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing number of homes signing up for high-speed data
and entertainment from cable and satellite companies, BellSouth
still sees a future in such services. But to usher them into homes,
the company will use different technology than used in the Chamblee
trial. In fact, the company has evolved a patchwork strategy using
several kinds of high-speed technologies. All have strengths, as
well as limitations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wireless cable service: Launched in June to provide television
and movies, it is also capable of two-way data transmissions. The
service area for wireless cable is limited by the company's
license, as well as by obstacles like hills and buildings that
block the signal to some homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital subscriber lines (DSL): These lines are being offered
to Internet service providers as a way to use copper phone lines
for high-speed data. But DSL _ even according to optimists _ will
work on no more than 70 percent of phone lines. Pessimists put the
number far lower. Cable companies will also argue that ADSL is
slower than their cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Integrated fiber in the loop: BellSouth's ambitious and
expensive effort to rip out some old phone lines and replace them
with fiber. The project will reach about 200,000 homes in the next
year in Miami and Atlanta, with still more in the following year,
Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar fiber lines are built into neighborhoods with about
80,000 homes each year in BellSouth's nine-state region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a single pipe that can carry all the services _ voice,
video and data,'' Hartman said. ``This is more robust than (the
Chamblee trial). We have a new option today.''

 &HT;    BellSouth winning friends with wireless cable service
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eric Johnson was annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   His cable television service was unreliable, with outages just a
bit too frequent. The picture was not crisp. A technician told him
the connection had been shoddily installed, so he called a MediaOne
supervisor, left a message and never heard back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it and they had problems with it,'' he said. ``But
what took me over the edge was the poor customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he knew MediaOne was bringing its broadband service to
his neighborhood, he decided not to wait. Instead, he called
BellSouth several weeks ago and signed up for its wireless cable
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely fed up with MediaOne, so I was looking for
alternatives,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He gives BellSouth rave reviews for the service he received but
also for what came before: the care with which the office treated
his order and the way the technicians treated the installation. ``I
was quite impressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Boland, director of the Georgia Tech Center for Distance
Learning, said he almost went with a digital satellite service
before choosing BellSouth's wireless cable for his Peachtree City
home.
</P>
<P>
   The price was lower, and the choices included more local
channels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After he ordered, he was surprised that technicians spent seven
hours at his house getting the service right. That day _ clearly
costly to BellSouth _ was a sign that the system is not as simple
to launch as adding a few more lines of dial tone, but also that
BellSouth seems ready to do what it takes to compete, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that BellSouth will make the system work and
they will be responsive to their customers,'' Boland said.

 &HT;    Home Depot's increase in profit beats expectations
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot's third-quarter earnings beat expectations
with a 31 percent increase in profit, thanks to a strong housing
market that continues to drive new customers to stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock rose 62 1/2 cents to $48 Tuesday on the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot reported a profit of 26 cents per share
against 20 cents in the year-ago period. The company was expected
to earn 25 cents a share, according to the average estimate
determined by a First Call survey of analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, the world's largest do-it-yourself home improvement
retailer, reported third-quarter net income of $392 million, up
from $299 million a year ago, before a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sales increased 24 percent to $7.7 billion, up from $6.22
billion a year ago. Sales at stores open at least one year
increased 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The non-recurring, pretax charge in the year-ago period was $104
million, which primarily related to a settlement of a gender
discrimination suit.
</P>
<P>
   After accounting for the charge, net income was $236 million, or
16 cents per share, in the 1997 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse, the No. 2 home improvement
retailer, also reported third-quarter earnings that exceeded
estimates. North Wilkesboro, N.C.-based Lowe's announced Monday its
earnings rose 32 percent to 33 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot and Lowe's both continue to benefit from low interest
rates and a boom in mortgage refinancing, which is spurring sales
of new and existing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners also are spending more money on improvement projects
such as decks and window replacements.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months, Home Depot earned $1.2 billion, or 79 cents
a share, against $853 million, or 57 cents a share, including the
charge. Sales totaled $22.96 billion in the first nine months
against $18.43 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot announced Tuesday it plans to open 13 stores in
Canada next year. During the third quarter, the company opened 38
stores, including its first outside North America.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot operates 717 stores, including six Expo Design
Centers. The company plans to have more than 1,300 stores by 2001.

 &HT;    Expert alarmed that Y2K hasn't generated enough concern
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Cohn is worried about Year 2000, and that's
bothersome because Cohn spends his time in companies' war rooms and
Y2K trenches.
</P>
<P>
   He's a former manager at IBM responsible for that company's Year
2000 consulting efforts in the Southeast. Today he has his own
millennium consulting company, MDY (which stands for month, date,
year).
</P>
<P>
   In his travels throughout Georgia and the nation, Cohn has
compiled a list of six mistakes companies make over and over again
on their Year 2000 projects.
</P>
<P>
   First, ``companies still don't have a confident representation
or estimate of the embedded chip problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And ``there's a tremendous assumption that resources will be
available in 1999, when there'll be a supply crunch that affects
not only their vendors but companies' own personnel who may be
lured to other jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Third, organizations still casually trust their vendors and
suppliers. They're simply not asking the right questions, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such queries might include: ``How do we test your product in our
environment? Or does your product think there are 365 days in Year
2000 when in fact there are 366?''
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, companies simply aren't taking the time to really dig
into the readiness of their critical suppliers, Cohn says.
</P>
<P>
   Next on his list: Organizations also have a false sense of
confidence, the attitude that ``we've always made deadlines before,
and we'll get the job done this time, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This problem is a different situation,'' Cohn warns. ``The
whole world has the same deadline, meaning that the pressure and
the chaos will be like never before.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifth, firms are also coming up short on quality and testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fixing Year 2000 requires tremendous precision, and quality
usually decreases as deadlines approach,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, organizations, in Cohn's view, aren't managing their
Y2K projects on a daily basis and with a fine-toothed comb.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask them, 'Are you further ahead this Friday than you
were last Friday?' they'll answer, 'Yes,' but they're not sure why.
They aren't measuring what they've done and what they still need to
do,'' Cohn says.
</P>
<P>
   He adds, by way of a caveat: ``I'm like a doctor. I only see the
sick patients. The well ones never call me, which means there may
be plenty of companies out there in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, his predictions for 1999 are: ``It'll be a
crazy, stress-filled year, with a crazy pace.
</P>

FED CUTS SHORT-TERM RATES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve policy-makers Tuesday cut
short-term interest rates for the third time in seven weeks, a move
that analysts said was aimed at easing a potential credit crunch
for US businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The cut is also an early Christmas present for consumers, who
will likely see credit card interest rates fall just in time for
the gift-buying season. The Fed trimmed the Federal Funds rate,
which banks charge each other on overnight loans, to 4.75 percent,
down a quarter point. That should prompt lenders to cut rates on
home equity, auto and other short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
   More important, analysts said, the rate cut should also make it
less expensive for businesses to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   That had become a concern in recent months, as events like the
Russian economic meltdown and the collapse of a major US hedge fund
scared investors away from all but the safest investments _ even
from high-quality US corporate bonds. As investors poured money
into safe Treasury bonds, which are backed by the US government,
businesses found that they had to pay ever-higher rates to induce
investors to buy their bonds, making it expensive to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a credit crunch developed even though the US stock
market has soared more than 1,400 points since August, and while
Japan, Brazil and other major nations showed signs of regaining
their financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have become risk-averse,'' said Greg Jones, chief
economist for Briefing.com, an economic analysis firm. ``The market
as a whole sees slower growth ahead and thinks that corporations
will default in greater numbers. So they're demanding a higher
yield on bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that the Fed has been easing rates, interest
rates for some businesses are still higher than they were a year
ago,'' said Nicholas Perna, chief economist at Fleet Financial
Group Inc. Corporate bonds ``are viewed as being much more risky
than six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the Fed noted the potential credit crunch in
a brief statement explaining its rate cut. ``Although conditions in
financial markets have settled down materially since mid-October,
unusual strains remain,'' the Fed statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds initially rallied on news of the rate cut but fell back
later in the day. The 30-year Treasury bond fell 94 cents per
$1,000 of face value and the yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, closed at 5.30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks had a mixed day. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed
sharply after the Fed announcement, erasing what had been an
80-point decline. But the Dow ended the day at 8,986.28, down
24.97, while both the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq rose.
</P>
<P>
   Major commercial banks also reacted quickly to the news, cutting
the rates they charge their best customers by a quarter point, to
7.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Fed also said that with its latest rate
cut, ``financial conditions can reasonably be expected to be
consistent with fostering sustained economic expansion while
keeping inflationary pressures subdued.'' Some analysts read that
comment to mean that the Fed is through with rate-cutting for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has cut rates two other times recently, on Sept. 29 and
Oct. 15, each time by a quarter point.
</P>
<P>
   Because it takes several months for a rate cut to ripple through
the economy, the Fed may also have trimmed rates now in
anticipation of an economic slowdown next year.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Latta, principal US economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI
in Lexington, Mass., predicts that gross domestic product will grow
only 1.7 percent next year, and Perna forsees growth of under 2
percent. That compares to 5.5 percent, 1.8 percent and 3.3 percent
growth in the first three quarters of this year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, said that there is no slowdown in sight,
so the rate cut was not warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake. The economy is strong,'' said Allan Meltzer,
an economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who leads
the Shadow Open Market Committee, which monitors Fed policy.
</P>
<P>
   Latta said she would have waited until February to cut rates.
``The economy has a lot of momentum,'' she said. ``The stock market
has bounced back well. Consumers don't need more encouragement to
borrow. They're in over their head now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meltzer said the amount of money in circulation is growing
rapidly, which also argues against a rate cut now. A burgeoning
money supply can be a precursor to inflation, which might only be
exacerbated by lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   While many economists say inflation is well in check, Meltzer is
less sure. He says a big drop in oil prices and other commidities
has made inflation seem lower than it really is. Instead of more
common measures, he looks at something called the ``median rate of
inflation,'' which tracks the mid-range of price trends in all
sectors of the economy. The median rate of inflation is rising at
2.7 percent a year, Meltzer said.
</P>
<P>
   That is far higher than the 1.6 percent rate for the first 10
months of 1998 reported Tuesday by the Labor Department. The
department also said Tuesday that the consumer price index rose a
modest 0.2 percent in October, seasonally adjusted, suggesting
there is little threat to the economy from inflation.

 TJX EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS; BJ'S sees 16 PERCENT GAIN  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though sales at many of its older stores did not match its
usually torrid pace, TJX Cos. of Framingham, Mass. so skillfully
managed its apparel inventory that it was still able to beat Wall
Street's expectations for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Profits before a charge rose 25 percent to $133.6 million, or 40
cents on a diluted earnings-per-share basis. The average estimate
of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. was 37 cents.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Oct. 31, overall sales rose 7.4 percent to
$2.03 billion. But at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, TJX's two largest
chains, sales at stores open for at least a year were up only 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   TJX president and chief executive Bernard Cammarata noted that
the chains were facing strong comparisons with last year's sales as
well as ``unusually warm weather patterns that affected apparel
sales during much of the quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this modest sales gain, operating income for the two
chains grew by 20 percent, Cammarata said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our superior bottom-line performance is
attributable to excellent inventory management,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of sales at stores open for at least a year, other
TJX divisions turned in strong performances, including its
HomeGoods chain and its chains in Canada and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Wright, the new TJX chain aimed at moderate-income
families, has ``gotten off to a great start,'' TJX added.
</P>
<P>
   TJX may face a challenge during the upcoming holidays, said Legg
Mason Wood Walker analyst Sally H. Wallick.
</P>
<P>
   In general, department stores had a soft third quarter as they
attempted to sell their goods at full price.
</P>
<P>
   If department stores become aggressively promotional and begin
offering big December discounts, they could take some business away
from offprice retailers such as TJX, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, TJX shares rose 13/16 to close
at 23 1/2.
</P>

   &QL; 
BJ'S WHOLESALE CLUB &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BJ's Wholesale Club Inc., the Natick, Mass. operator of 91
warehouse club stores, said Tuesday its profits rose 16.2 percent
to $14.4 million for its third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At stores open for at least a year, sales were up 5.8 percent,
and overall sales improved 11.4 percent to $828 million for the
quarter ended Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   BJ's recently adopted an accounting change that alters the way
it reports the dues members pay to shop at its stores.
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter earnings were adjusted to factor in this
accounting change and to make for apples-to-apples comparisons
between the 1998 and the 1997 third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting change ``has no impact on the big picture,'' said
Tucker Anthony analyst Steven A. Richter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is really executing well,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On an earnings-per-share basis, BJ's reported net income of 38
cents per diluted share, a penny above the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to report BJ's 22nd consecutive quarter of
improved operating income,'' said BJ's president and chief
executive officer Jack Nugent in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   BJ's also announced it repurchased 724,300 shares of common
stock during the third quarter, at an average price of $36.14 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, BJ's shares rose 5/16 to close
at 39 7/16.

   (EDs: Corrects Web addresses to delete `www' in address lines for
CBS MarketWatch; Yahoo Finance and Microsoft Money Central)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As millions of baby boomers and Generation Xers
hit their peak earning years, they are seizing hold of their
personal finances and doing it for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But learning how to grasp financial planning takes some
homework. Here's a sampling of popular how-to books and
consumer-friendly Web sites that can help:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   This site has it all: Investment portfolios. Insurance.
Retirement and wills. Market research from Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Articles and advice are grouped into clever subjects. One recent
report, called ``A Financial Guide to Marriage: For Love or
Money,'' had tips on raising children, saving for college, coping
with divorce and caring for parents. Good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   You must pay for some services, such as recommendations from
Wall Street analysts. Monthly subscriptions go for $9.95, with a
30-day free trial.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Personal
Finance'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13.95) by Kenneth M. Morris and Alan
M. Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   By far the best road map on personal finance for beginners.
Sharp writing. Clear definitions. Hands-on advice. The book
features crisp layouts, simple charts and vivid photo illustrations
that help the reader digest some complex subjects.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Get A Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your 20s and 30s''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $11.00) by Beth Kobliner.
</P>
<P>
   A cool guide for young folks rollerblading out of school. The
33-year-old Kobliner, a Brown University graduate who studied
literature, is proof that anyone with a college degree and some
brain matter can master their finances.
</P>
<P>
   This well-written primer is filled with helpful tips on money
management, from escaping credit card debt to picking a mutual
fund. Also good for older readers getting started on all things
financial.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Consumer Reports Money Book'' (Consumer Reports Books,
$29.95) by Janet Bamford et al; ``Making the Most of Your Money''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $30) by Jane Bryant Quinn; ``The Money Book of
Personal Finance'' (Warner Books, $24.95) by the Money editors;
``Personal Finance for Dummies'' (IDG Books, $16.95) by Eric Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   You can't go wrong with any of these money encyclopedias. You
can hire a financial adviser for $100 an hour _ or read these and
teach yourself the basics.
</P>
<P>
   The books by Consumer Reports and Money magazine boast chapters
by many authors. The book by Quinn, Newsweek's personal finance
columnist, is the most enjoyable read. And Tyson's book has the
cutest graphics.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Money Makeovers: How Women Can Control Their Financial
Destiny'' (Doubleday, $24.95) by Christopher Hayes and Kate Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   This stimulating book, by psychologist Hayes and New York
journalist Kelly, blends academic theory and real-life practice.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news from the authors: Fear of failure and the unknown
are the biggest hurdles to women's financial success.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Women can be better investors than men because of
their patience, intuition, networking and goal-setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Smart Money Moves for African-Americans'' (G.P. Putnam, $12)
by Kelvin Boston; ``The Black Woman's Guide to Financial
Independence'' (Penguin Books, $15.95) by Cheryl Broussard.
</P>
<P>
   A former IDS/American Express financial planner and the host of
PBS's ``Color of Money'' series, Boston offers many strategies for
wealth building in this first-rate guide.
</P>
<P>
   He writes, ``Many African-Americans are fixated on living a
pious life, the Porgy and Bess syndrome: I got plenty of nothing,
and nothing's plenty for me. Well, I don't think so. Having plenty
of nothing means just that _ no savings, no home and no retirement
accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The book by Broussard, an investment adviser at Cheryl Broussard
&AMP; Co. in Oakland, Calif., also is a great starting point for anyone
wishing to build a strong financial foundation. It contains good
worksheets and clear explanations.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``New Families, New Finances: Money Skills for Today's
Nontraditional Families'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $14.95) by Emily Card
and Christie Watts Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Are you a single parent? A divorced person? A grandparent? A
racial minority? This book is for those who don't fit the ``Father
Knows Best'' mold of the old-fashioned nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the financial advice is generic. But at the end of each
chapter, the authors give tips tailored for nontraditional groups.
</P>
<P>
   Single parents, for example, should make sure they carry enough
health, life and disability insurance. Or couples with vast age
differences should have separate investment portfolios best suited
for their stages of life.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Gay Finances in a Straight World'' (J.K. Lasser and The
Advocate, $19.95) by Peter M. Berkery Jr. and Gregory A. Diggins.
</P>
<P>
   While gays and lesbians face the same financial challenges as
everyone, they also must grapple with troublesome legal issues
because they can't marry. Plus, they face discrimination from
financial companies, the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   One example: People applying for insurance must list a
beneficiary, someone with a vested financial interest in their
lives. Typically this means a family member or a business partner.
Unlike heterosexuals, gays often find their beneficiaries are
turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The authors give concrete advice for gay and lesbian couples to
deal with that situation and others.
</P>
<P>
   This book has handy worksheets and real-life examples by
Berkery, a financial writer, and Diggins, an accountant and a
certified financial planner.

 &HT;    Computer industry looks forward to bright 1999
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Crowded into a second-floor meeting room that is
closer to the constant ringing of slot machines in the Las Vegas
Hilton than the main Comdex hall, tiny Crossroads Systems Inc. of
Austin, Texas, believes it has the closest thing to a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old company makes thin boxes, called routers, that
transfer data stored on tape drives to light so it can be accessed
by a form of fiber-optic technology at extraordinary speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The routers are being used by Compaq Computer Corp.,
Hewlett-Packard Co., and several other large companies as a way to
get immediate access to back-up, mission-critical data in the event
of a system crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold out of product this fall,'' said said Bob Livolsi,
Crossroad's vice president for marketing between meetings with
current and potential customers at Comdex Fall '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fundamentally nowhere a year ago. We're growing very
fast now.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar declarations of optimism are being heard throughout
Comdex, which drew an estimated 220,000 participants to Las Vegas,
despite severe economic problems in Asia that threaten to infect
the West's economies. Show officials say that while overall
registration is up about 8,000 from last year, the number of
visitors from overseas declined.

<P>
   According to some estimates, North America and Western Europe
account for three-fourths of all sales in the $140 billion PC
industry. International Data Corp., the analyst and consulting
concern in Framingham, Mass., forecasts a growth rate of about 15
percent next year in the number of computers shipped.

<P>
   More than three-fourths of home PC users say that browsing the
Web and using e-mail are primary uses for their PCs.

<P>
   ``We're changing peoples' lives, connecting them together from
Maine to Mainland China,'' Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates a
standing-room-only audience of more than 7,000 during his keynote
address that opened Comdex.
</P>
<P>
   Gates predicted that even desktop PCs will have offer up to 64
processors working together, and that clusters of 64 PCs working in
tandem will offer not only tremendous computing power but back-up
to shield against system failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC will go far beyond what any system has been able to do
in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps predictable that Gates, who rode Microsoft DOS and
Windows operating systems to become the world's richest man, would
see bright prospects for the industry. But even companies that are
familiar with industry downturns are looking ahead with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, the perennial and distant No. 2 in the global
microprocessor industry, is more bullish than most.
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining visitors in a quiet room away from the clamor of
the exhibition hall, AMD workers showed how the company's K6-2
chip, an enhanced 3-D chip running at 400 megahertz, outperformed
Intel Corp.'s 450-megahertz Pentium II. Next door, more smiling
employees previewed the K7, which AMD says it will ship in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The K7, which was designed at AMD labs in Austin, will run
faster than 500 megahertz, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the PC market picking up quite well this year and
next,'' said David Somo, a director of product marketing AMD.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs about 4,300 people in Austin, expects
to ship 12 million processors this year. The goal for next year is
at least 20 million as the company begins to invade the server and
workstation market for the first time with the K7.
</P>
<P>
   With Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co., Packard-Bell Corp. , Acer
and other PC makers buying its K6 chips, AMD chips were in 44
percent of desktop computers sold through retail channels in
September, Somo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude of everyone at AMD is very optimistic,'' Somo
said.

ANOTHER RE BUILDING JOB  
 NAU PROGRAM RISES FROM ASHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona State basketball Coach Rob Evans, who revived the sport
at Mississippi, isn't the only program builder in the state. Far
from it.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has been good for so long it's hard to remember when the
Wildcats were bad, but UA was 4-24 the season before Lute Olson
arrived in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, what Ben Howland has done at Northern Arizona is
just as dramatic as that job and the one Evans did at Ole Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Howland became head coach at NAU before the 1994-95 season,
inheriting a program bearing the weight of eight straight
non-winning seasons. The Lumberjacks had won the Big Sky Conference
title only once, in 1986 under Jay Arnote, and never made the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After Howland withstood two losing seasons installing his system
and recruiting his type of players, the Lumberjacks went 21-7 in
1997 and won the Big Sky. Then they went 21-8 and won the Big Sky
again in 1998. NAU also won the conference tournament, thus earning
its first NCAA Tournament appearance.
</P>
<P>
   There, in a first-round West Regional game in Boise, Idaho,
15th-seeded NAU led No. 2 Cincinnati before losing on a three-point
basket with four seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Howland said, ``We respect everyone and fear no
one,'' but roles have been reversed somewhat. Going into tonight's
game against Evans and ASU at Wells Fargo Arena, NAU is favored to
win a third straight Big Sky title and to return to the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The secret's out. The would-be giant killers have bulked up. And
the bigger you get, the harder it is to sneak up on anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little more of a marked man than we were,'' Howland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ASU knows what's in store. Evans, although not
personally acquainted with Howland, is familiar with his adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear a lot about other guys in more high-profile
situations,'' Evans said, ``but he's as good as those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Howland's philosophy is recruiting good kids,
solid citizens. A lot of coaches say that, and some actually mean
it. But can they also find players with skills? Howland can. NAU
has led the country in three-point shooting the past two years and
was second nationally in field goal percentage last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for kids who can shoot the ball,'' he said. ``Recruit
to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks play a disciplined offense, and their defense
relies more on tenacity and toughness than quickness and full-court
pressure. If it sounds a lot like the philosophy espoused by Utah
Coach Rick Majerus, it's no coincidence. Majerus and Howland are
good friends, and Howland freely acknowledges being a Majerus
disciple and, uh, borrowing heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``I've really tried to copy and steal as much as I can
from him,'' Howland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's one of the premier coaches in the country. I've
spent a lot of time studying what they do, not only on the floor
but off the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   By choice and by design, and for the sake of chemistry, Majerus
doesn't always recruit pure talent. Neither does Howland, although
it isn't always by choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it is targeting the right kid,'' Howland
said, ``and we've recruited quite a few kids who were
under-recruited.''
</P>
<P>
   Or kids who were non-recruited by any Division I schools, such
as starting forwards Ross Land and Billy Hix.
</P>
<P>
   This is Howland's first head coaching job at the Division I
level, and, at 41, he has become a hot item. He was mentioned last
year in connection with several jobs, notably California-Santa
Barbara, where he worked for 11 years as an assistant. Other offers
are sure to come.
</P>
<P>
   Howland downplays that, saying he's happy in Flagstaff and is
concerned only with his next opponent. ASU has won 10 straight
against the Lumberjacks dating to the 1985-86 season, but if ever
Howland has the team to end that, this is it.
</P>
<P>
   And everybody knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our program is respected now,'' he said. ``When I
first got the job, the phone rang off the hook because everyone
wanted to schedule us. It hasn't been quite that easy the last few
years.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Baptists say no to endorsement of homosexual behavior
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Columbus, Ga. _ Georgia Baptists meeting in their annual
convention here voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to exclude churches
that condone homosexual behavior but failed to remove churches that
practice charismatic worship.
</P>
<P>
   The two issues were included in an amendment to the constitution
of the Georgia Baptist Convention, the 1.2 million member state arm
of the Southern Baptist Convention. The provisions of the amendment
were voted on separately, and each required a 2/3 vote to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees approved with a show-of-hands vote the exclusion of
any church ''which knowingly takes, or has taken, any action to
affirm, approve, or endorse homosexual behavior.'' A similar vote
not to recognize as part of the convention churches ''which
encourage members to speak in tongues or to participate in the
practice of 'being slain in the spirit,' or to engage in worship
practices that are divisive and disruptive'' was too close to call
and required a paper ballot. With 1,190 ''yes'' votes and 747
''no'' votes, it fell about five percent short of the required 66.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gerald Harris of Eastside Baptist Church in Marietta
headed the committee that drew up the amendment. In presenting it
to the convention, he told Baptists they should match condemnation
of homosexuality with compassion for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unanimous verdict of scripture is that the practice of
homosexuality is a sin,'' he said, ''however homosexuals are
included among neighbors we are commanded to love.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Baptists should deplore ''meanness, revulsion,
rejection, violence, scorn and contempt'' directed toward
homosexuals, he said, and should stand for ''judicial and civil
equality of homosexuals, but not special rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment, ''is not an attempt to monitor churches
or tell churches what to do. . . ,''he said, ''but we do feel we
have a responsibility for maintaining the integrity of our
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Baptists have passed resolutions against homosexual
practice before but this year's vote establishes an official
standard for churches.
</P>
<P>
   Having that standard included in the convention's constitution
''gives us a concrete means of dealing with a problem which we did
not have in place until this time,'' said the Rev. Oscar Cope,
pastor of First Baptist Church in Fairburn and chairman of the
convention's executive committee. ''At any time, we could have had
someone get up on the floor of a meeting and want to oust a church
on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   By anticipating such a concern instead of dealing with it on the
floor of a meeting, Baptists can put in place an orderly process
''to resolve problems in a Christ-like manner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bill Self, pastor of John's Creek Baptist Church in
Alpharetta warned the convention that to speak about homosexuality
''is very perilous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a bottom-up people, not a top-down people,'' he said.
''I want to ask one simple question: this year the homosexual _
who's next?''
</P>
<P>
   Executive committee member the Rev. Frank Page of Warren Baptist
Church in Augusta quipped back to Self, ''we are a top-down people
because we take our direction from the very top and it is the word
of God.'' And, he said, ''It's a legitimate question, 'Who's next.'
Anyone who desires and follows a direction directly opposed to the
word of God _ they are next.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in favor of limiting charismatic worship practices in
Baptist churches, executive committee member the Rev. Mike Everson
of Second Baptist Church in Warner Robins said the convention needs
''clearly defined lines about where we should stand as Baptists.
There are churches in the state of Georgia that are practicing
being 'slain in the spirit,' barking like dogs, roaring like lions.
. .We are not telling churches they can't do that. They ought not
to be doing that and calling themselves Baptists.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Ron Hinson of First Baptist Church in Blakely
called the proposal ''a can of worms.''
</P>
<P>
   ''How can we determine in a specific location, week by week,
what might occur, whether a congregation is truly approving or
promoting that type of activity?'' he asked. ''I would question
whether we have a real capacity to do that.''

SO FLEETING IS THE CHANCE TO DO GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   (Undated) _ Poverty, being
inconsiderate, refuses to take the convenience of the rest of us
into account.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One chilly morning not long ago a woman and her two children sat
on the bus stop bench outside the newspaper office. She waited for
someone passing to notice her so she could ask a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where there's a church that's feeding people?''
she finally asked a man going into the building.
</P>
<P>
   The man was in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly businesses here,'' he told her. ``I'm sorry, but I'm
late for a meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know. You wouldn't have a couple of dollars, would you?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at the woman, and her daughters _ one of them 7 or 8
years old, the other smaller. The children seemed neat, scrubbed.
He wondered how clean people like that wound up asking for handouts
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this one's birthday,'' the woman said, running her hand
through the hair of the smaller one. ``I need to get them something
to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The man took out his wallet. Two dollars was exactly what he
had, and he gave it. /{But what good's two bucks?/} he was
thinking. /{There ought to be some place for them to go./} He
looked at his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he said again. ``Why don't you go in the
newspaper office and talk to the guard at the front desk. Maybe
somebody will know where you can get help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' the woman said. She took her two children by
their hands and started toward the door of the building. The man
went on to his meeting. But he found, later, that he could not get
that hungry little family out of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   People like that, he knew, didn't need someone to give them a
couple of dollars and point them somewhere. They needed real help.
Careful help _ the kind that makes some kind of difference.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment he'd rushed to keep seemed suddenly unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   So he checked with the guard at the desk, who'd telephoned
upstairs. A reporter had told them where they might go for a meal.
</P>
<P>
   The man went to that place and asked about them, but they hadn't
shown up. ``I have kids myself,'' said the woman serving lunches.
``I'd remember a family like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried some of the other shelters. It was no use, though. The
woman and two little girls hadn't been seen.
</P>
<P>
   It's astonishing the way a city can swallow up three people on
foot so quickly, so completely. Where had they gone? Where does
thistledown go when it's blown away on an autumn wind, never to be
seen again?
</P>
<P>
   After two hours of looking, the man went back to his office and
sat feeling useless and guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the woman wasn't what she'd seemed to be, he tried to tell
himself. Maybe she was really a con artist, who'd driven off in her
fancy car parked just around the corner. Some politicians would
have you believe that about people down on their luck.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew it wasn't true. He'd looked in the woman's eyes when
she asked for money, and it was clear how hard the asking was. Her
eyes had been frightened and ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   /{Damn it,/} he thought. /{It was the little one's birthday!/}
He remembered his own daughters at that age.
</P>
<P>
   And there was nothing at all he could do about it now. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That's the trouble with poverty. Awkwardly it presents itself _
usually at an unhandy moment in our crowded and important days. The
chance to do some decency is briefly offered, and there are a few
intuitive natures who seize upon it like a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us hesitate. And the chance is lost for good.

LONG-IGNORED SET OF 10 COMMANDMENTS CREATES BIG FLAP IN SMALL
TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ Street widening and dog ordinances are the
kind of sticky issues that normally create turmoil for a municipal
government, but at City Hall here, everybody's learning a new rule.
</P>
<P>
   Thou shalt not move the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The five-foot-tall granite monument, with the inscription that
starts out ``I am the Lord thy God,'' has stood outside the door of
City Hall for most of the past 40 years, and for most of that time
it was all but ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know it was there,'' Mayor Steve Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the city moved it. Then talk arose of banishing it from
public property. Then it became the center of a dispute unlike any
in recent city memory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just about everybody in town knows about the Ten
Commandments monument.
</P>
<P>
   Threats of lawsuits are flying as fast as passes from the Kansas
State football team, the American Civil Liberties Union is looking
into concerns about the mixing of church and state, and some are
accusing the local media of stirring up the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the problem reaches back to 1958, when the Eagles
Lodge donated the monument to the city.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy did not begin to simmer until late 1997,
during remodeling and expansion of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the Commandments out of harm's way during the
construction, workers hauled the monument away and stored it
temporarily. A few calls came in from those curious about the
statue's fate.
</P>
<P>
   As the project wrapped up last month, contractors reinstalled
the Commandments, but in a somewhat more prominent place, where
everyone walking into the building would see them.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Mercury checked in with a Page 1 story about the
monument, pointing out that such a display posed potential legal
problems for the city. Two days later, a second article noted
complaints about the monument.
</P>
<P>
   And a radio station urged residents who wanted to express
themselves to call City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went downhill from there,'' the mayor said. ``By the ninth
and 10th day, it was getting downright nasty. Some of the comments
were getting hateful, from both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Final city tabulation: 912 calls, 272 signatures on petitions,
27 letters and 29 e-mails. Overwhelming sentiment: Don't fool with
the commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be able to vote next year, and I will vote against
anyone who votes in favor of removing the display,'' one resident
of the city of 37,477 wrote. ``And I will advise all of my friends,
who are also Christians, to do likewise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take a stand on the side of Christianity and a
nation that was built on biblical principles,'' one woman wrote the
mayor. ``We hope you'll vote to leave the tablets where they
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics surfaced too. ``I am personally offended by the presence
of the Ten Commandments,'' one man said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would remove it from city property,'' said Lyman Baker, a
Kansas State University English instructor who hopes to join a
lawsuit against the city. ``It's an establishment of religion. This
is not being anti-religious.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Manhattan City Commission decided on a
3-2 split to move the monument several yards away.
</P>
<P>
   So this week the Ten Commandments stand closer to their original
location, still by the door to City Hall but in a slightly less
prominent location than last week.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Gary Greer blames /{The Mercury/} for stirring up
an issue he claims didn't exist before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a reporter in Manhattan who is very critical of the
city,'' he said. ``The paper tried to make a big deal out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercury news editor Ned Seaton said his paper pursued the story
about the relocation of the monument and the potential legal
ramifications ``as a good newspaper does.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Seaton, ``When you're writing a story about the Ten
Commandments in front of a building that symbolizes the government
in Manhattan, it at least raises questions of constitutionality.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the ACLU has taken an interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When government makes the decision, as they did in Manhattan,
they take a step toward favoring a religious doctrine,'' said Dick
Kurtenbach of Kansas City, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas
and Western Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the religious issue could plunge Manhattan into serious
legal trouble isn't clear from previous court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Battles over posting of the Ten Commandments on the walls of
public buildings have occurred in other states, including Georgia
and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In the Georgia case, the U.S. Supreme Court said the
commandments had to be removed. In Alabama, state courts allowed
the commandments to remain.
</P>
<P>
   In Republic, Mo., the American Civil Liberties Union this year
filed suit to demand the removal of a Christian symbol from the
city seal.

<P>
   Questions were raised several years ago about a Ten Commandments
monolith in front of the Wyandotte County Courthouse. The display
remains there today.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Manhattan city officials found that city governments
in several places, including Lawrence, Leavenworth, Salina and
Wichita, do not display the Ten Commandments. Junction City does,
the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple blocks from City Hall, at the First Lutheran
Church, Pastor Keith Wiens noted that Ten Commandments aren't
unique to a single religious tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the commandments come out of a tradition that
has given birth to three major world religions,'' he said. ``But
apart from that, they are basic guidelines that can speak to and
can help anyone, those who have faith in God and those who do
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiens wants the display to remain at City Hall. But he confesses
that over the years he wasn't a regular visitor to the monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly,'' he said, ``before the renovation project, I wasn't
aware of it.''

EXPERTS SAY BIG-CITY RAIL DEPOT RENOVATIONS WINDING DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At the beginning of this century, many of
America's monumental train stations were built. Now, at the end of
the century, they're being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   In October, New York rededicated Grand Central Terminal after a
$200 million restoration that caused even jaded East Coast
commuters to stop and gawk. And this month next year Kansas City's
majestic former depot is scheduled to reopen after its own $200
million-plus renovation of crumbling decor and rusting girders.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's other grand stations either revamped or mired
in neglect, Kansas City's endeavor may signal the end of what
railroad station historian Janet Greenstein Potter terms the
``golden age'' of re-using these buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union Station is rounding out the last of the big station
restorations,'' Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's story is similar to those of its palatial
predecessors, ranging from New York to Philadelphia, and St. Louis
to Nashville, Tenn. And Kansas City's redevelopers have taken
several cues from the patriarch of the station restoration
movement, Washington's Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was in the nation's capital where 150 architects,
planners and government officials from throughout the country
gathered recently in a former train-passenger lunchroom for the
nation's first conference devoted entirely to railroad station
restorations.
</P>
<P>
   They spun tales of development partnerships, preservation
passions and nostalgic yearnings for community gathering places.
And they hailed what the conference's sponsor, the Great American
Station Foundation, called the ``station-centered development
movement,'' representing some of the costliest and most stirring
urban redevelopments.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this, architect Denis Kuhn strode to the front
of the room, dimmed the lights and clicked through slides showing
some of his renovation renderings for Kansas City's Union Station.
This project, he explained, ``includes everything I've heard every
other speaker talk about.''  &LR; brk:Mighty monuments
</P>
<P>
   In terms of a ``golden age,'' America's huge railroad stations
are actually passing through their second.
</P>
<P>
   The first spanned roughly 1890 to 1920, when the mighty
railroads built almost all of the nation's colossal stations. Each
contained hundreds of thousands of square feet _ like Kansas
City's, completed in 1914, which encompassed more space than a
modern shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The railroads lavished money on a game of architectural
one-upmanship by competing to build the most spectacular monuments
to their arrogant success,'' Potter wrote in her 1996 book, Great
American Railroad Stations.
</P>
<P>
   The second era covers roughly 1980 through 2000, decades after
automobiles and airplanes supplanted trains as preferred forms of
travel. Many of the distinctive stations followed similar sagas:
diminished use, abandonment, threatened demolition, preservation
crusade, and then public-private partnership for redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis the Romanesque-style building became a hotel, and
stores and restaurants filled the old train shed. In Washington the
beaux-arts edifice was restored with gold-leaf paint and converted
into a shopping mall and rail center. Each project exceeded $200
million in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In New York the nation's largest train station added shops and
eateries, too, and was spruced up in what The New York Times
considered ``the greatest feat of historical preservation in the
city's history,'' costing $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the removal of some offices revealed part of the
ceiling painted to resemble an aquamarine sky. It hadn't been seen
in years, and some commuters were seen stopping and staring. The
building reopened with a ceremony featuring a performance of a
special symphony piece named after it, ``Grand Central.''
</P>
<P>
   This second ``golden age'' coincides with the creation of
special financing tools, and the recognition that history can have
tourism and development potential.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government provided tax incentives for
historic-building restorations from 1976 until 1986. Amtrak, the
federally subsidized passenger train carrier, also funded
renovations at East Coast stations it served. Then the Department
of Transportation added ``enhancement'' grants for transit
facilities in 1991. And the Great American Station Foundation was
formed two years ago to assist station projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That there's a funding source for the preservation of railroad
stations is a big factor,'' said Barbara Pahl, a station authority
with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   As for history's potential, Thomas Downs, Amtrak's former
chairman and the station foundation's first chairman, told the
first station-redevelopment conference: ``Train stations are
unique. They can still bring people into downtowns....They are
repositories of nostalgia and memories and a sense of place, and
those can have economic ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City fits some of these trends but not others.
</P>
<P>
   The local project followed the typical big-station saga. The
beaux-arts structure faced a demolition threat in the 1970s, was
abandoned in the 1980s and then benefited from a public-private
partnership in the 1990s, culminating with the nation's first
bistate sales tax to cover half the funding.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's re-use, however, differs from most others. It
won't remain a train center or become an urban mall but will be
retrofitted to become a science museum. Plus, it isn't getting
funding help from Amtrak or the station foundation, and Kansas
City's share of federal enhancement money has gone elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The station, though, is getting close to $32 million from other
federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the remaining colossal stations still not revived, none shows
signs of joining the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is location,'' said Pahl. Those in Buffalo, N.Y.,
Detroit and Oakland, Calif., are just outside their downtowns in
rundown neighborhoods, away from potential customer bases. Others,
as in Denver, can't find consensus on any new use.
</P>
<P>
   And not all big cities have big train stations. There are
station projects under way or contemplated in Seattle and Houston,
for example, but neither of those smaller stations is considered in
the same monumental class as the stations in Washington, New York
and Kansas City.  &LR; brk:Washington connections
</P>
<P>
   When Andy Scott took over Kansas City's Union Station
redevelopment in 1994, there was no Potter book explaining what was
happening to other stations and no foundation offering a guidebook
on how to proceed with such projects.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott, executive director of the Union Station Assistance
Corp., was directed to one counterpart in the industry: Keith
Kelly, president of the Washington, D.C., Union Station
Redevelopment Corp. Kelly had worked for Crown Center before going
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The two men soon developed an adviser-apprentice relationship,
which carried over to Kelly's successor, David Ball, after Kelly
died. The Washington advisers had the advantage of already
completing what Scott was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in one of Scott's many trips to Washington to work on
federal grants, he sat with Ball at a restaurant in one of the
station wings. ``Let's take this space,'' Scott told him at one
point. ``What was it before and how did it change?''
</P>
<P>
   From such conversations Scott learned about details that get
debated and the choices that are weighed when a train station is
converted to something else.
</P>
<P>
   Take preservation issues. Not issues that are no-brainers, such
as keeping stonework intact, but little things like doors.
</P>
<P>
   When Washington's station served only trains, doors separated
the barrel-vaulted, gold-trimmed lobby from the adjoining concourse
train gates. When the concourse was reconfigured with restaurants
and shops, those doors were removed to aid the flow of crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Then when Kansas City's redevelopers considered replacing the
old Harvey House in the east wing with another eatery, initial
plans included all the original bronze doors. At one meeting Scott
recounted what Washington did, and the restaurant doors were
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Scott also learned from Washington's mistakes. The redevelopers
there, for example, maximized retail space so much that rest rooms
were cut or shrunk. But those that remained were used so much that
$500,000 had to be spent replacing fixtures after only two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things we did on ours that were lessons learned from
theirs,'' Scott said. ``It has served as a great model for the
process we're going through.''

CONSERVATIVE DeLAY STANDS UNCHALLENGED DESPITE SOME GOP CONCERNS 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When big money contributors, lawmakers and
lobbyists wanted to network at the 1996 Republican National
Convention in San Diego, they headed for the yacht parties thrown
by Rep. Tom DeLay's political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was another example of how DeLay, the House Majority Whip,
has studiously catered to the needs of his House colleagues,
whether it be raising money, dispensing political advice, rounding
up votes for legislation, or simply feeding hungry lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In return, many GOP members have come to respect the Texas
lawmaker's skills despite their concerns about his hardball
tactics, his hardline conservatism and his anti-Clinton rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   And with Republican House members scheduled to select their new
leaders Wednesday, DeLay is the only one in the House leadership
that has not faced a challenge for his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might not like his politics. Some people might not
like him personally. But they all respect the job he does,'' said
DeLay spokesman Mike Scanlon. ``People understand where he's coming
from. Take it or leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   What is ironic about DeLay's strong standing is that the
conservative lawmaker has survived at a time when some experts
believe the party's obsession with the White House scandal and the
decision to proceed with an impeachment inquiry cost the GOP seats
in the election.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has unabashedly led the anti-Clinton forces in the House,
sending out a thick binder to colleagues on impeachment even before
independent counsel Kenneth Starr sent his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban Houston lawmaker has called on Clinton to resign
and told radio listeners recently ``For me, it's already been
established _ anybody who lies to the grand jury ought to be
impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   While such talk has made many moderate Republicans nervous, they
have not been willing to challenge DeLay because they respect the
job he has done as Whip and are not sure anybody else would want
what many view as a difficult and thankless task.
</P>
<P>
   The Whip organization is responsible for rounding up votes on
legislation, a job that is likely to become increasingly difficult
in the new Congress, where Republicans hold a slim six-seat
majority.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's staff has been particularly sensitive to members' needs
over the years, dispensing a range of services from providing
information on bills to serving barbecue in his spacious Capitol
office during late night voting. One GOP aide said that DeLay's
staff had even served as troubleshooters for lawmakers suffering
from negative press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that moderates see him as an ally or someone who
is a consensus builder,'' said a top aide to one House moderate.
But the aide said DeLay has survived because ``one, very few people
wanted the job and two, no one wants to cross Tom DeLay.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has not shied from employing often controversial and
hardball tactics in an effort to keep Republicans in power. He has
pressured special interests that do business with Congress to give
money to the party. Recently he unsuccessfully tried to force a
trade association not to hire a former Democratic congressman as
its director and instead choose a retiring Republican House member.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has not faced a major challenge in his own elections,
DeLay has been able to give away much of the money raised by his
personal campaign account and his political action committee,
Americans for a Republican Majority.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-1998 election cycle Americans for a Republican
Majority contributed $193,064 to 75 candidates, ranging from
moderate Illinois Rep-elect Judy Biggert to conservative firebrand
Bob Dornan of California, who lost a rematch to Democrat Loretta
Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay contributed another $183,500 to candidates during the same
election cycle, including $157,000 to the National Republican
Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his conservatism DeLay has displayed an incredible
degree of pragmatism in his dealings with members.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent leadership struggle DeLay endorsed Rep. Bob
Livingston for speaker even though the Louisiana Republican has
been criticized by conservatives for brokering a budget deal with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is helping round up votes for moderate Rep. Tom Davis of
Virginia who is challenging Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., to head the
National Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials with conservative groups helping Linder claimed
that DeLay's staff have threatened them by saying they won't get
legislation they want passed if they don't back Davis. DeLay's
aides have denied the charge.

 &HT;    DID MICROSOFT MARKETING MUSCLE SINK IBM BID?
 &HT;    450&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ IBM Corp. was ``caught in a vicious cycle'' when it
sought to market what it says was a superior operating system,
because developers could not be weaned from their dependence on
Microsoft Windows, a key IBM executive testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though IBM popularized the personal computer in the early
1980s and co-developed OS/2 in cooperation with Microsoft, the
operating system fell victim to the Microsoft juggernaut, said John
Soyring, director of IBM's Network Computer Software Services.
Soyring testified at the Microsoft antitrust trial in support of
the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, IBM's own personal computer unit has
offered only Windows on its desktop and laptop lines, and no longer
offers OS/2 in the U.S. market, Soyring admitted under
cross-examination by Microsoft lawyer Steven Holley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the relative size of the Windows installed base, no PC
application can achieve wide distribution _ that is, be a 'best
seller' _ that is not offered on Windows,'' the witness said.
</P>
<P>
   Soyring, who is based in Austin, Texas, held that ``at various
times, OS/2 has enjoyed technological advantages over Windows in a
number of areas.'' For example, OS/2 Warp Version 3, available
nearly a year before Microsoft released Windows 95 in August 1995,
offered the same 32-bit capability, multi-threading, and
symmetrical multiprocessing support.
</P>
<P>
   But Tod Nielsen, Microsoft's general manager for developer
relations, said in an interview outside the courtroom that OS/2
failed ``because it didn't meet the needs of a broad range of
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen argued that ``IBM is now trying to blame someone else
for their mistakes. ...No amount of money, partnership or prayer
can make a bad product successful.''
</P>
<P>
   On a worldwide basis, IBM still enjoys revenues six times higher
than those of Microsoft. But in the realm of PC operating systems,
various versions of Windows now account for about 92 percent of the
overall market, against less than 6 percent for OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft-IBM rivalry also figured in videotape testimony
shown just before Soyring took the witness stand. Once again,
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates appeared combative and vague under
questioning by David Boies, the government's lead counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In their exchange, Boies cited a Gates e-mail message from
November 1997 that said disagreements over IBM's promotion of the
Java computer language kept the two companies from having a
harmonious relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The two would ``never have the same relationship that we have
with Compaq, Dell and even HP (Hewlett-Packard) because of their
software ambitions,'' Gates wrote.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Boies prodded Gates to expand on his memo by asking, ``do you
remember people at IBM being concerned about IBM's relationship
with Microsoft being a problem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the day was taken up by Microsoft's cross-examination of
Glenn Weadock, a computer expert testifying for the government who
contends that Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system commingled
its code with the Internet Explorer Web browser code so the two
cannot be disentangled.
</P>
<P>
   Hour after hour, Microsoft attorney Richard Pepperman sought to
get Weadock to admit that most users actually preferred an
integrated browser. At one point, while Weadock repeatedly
demurred, Microsoft's lead counsel appeared to fall asleep, resting
his head on a beige computer terminal atop the defense table.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to enliven the proceedings, U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson broke in to tell a protracted story from
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the judge's tale was whether computers should be
viewed as being of the male or the female gender.
</P>
<P>
   When a group of women were asked the question, they said it
should be masculine, in part because ``as soon as you commit to one
you realize that if you had waited a little longer you could have
had a better model.''
</P>
<P>
   A men's group, on the other hand, concluded computers were
feminine, in part because ``even your smallest mistakes are stored
in long-term memory for later retrieval.''

COST OF IRAQ BUILDUP TO LAND SOLELY ON US TAXPAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If war is hell, peacekeeping is downright
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   US officials and private analysts estimate that the military
buildup in the Persian Gulf this month has cost well over $1
billion, and US taxpayers are picking up the tab, not the oil-rich
Arab countries that paid for most of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not asked Arab countries to pay so far,
and they are not contributing more than jet fuel and incidental
expenses, according to US officials and foreign diplomats. That
leaves Americans and, to a much lesser extent, the British, to pay
for keeping Saddam Hussein in check.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon claims to have no idea what the price tag is for
the buildup this autumn. ``We don't have firm estimates now. In
fact we don't even have loose estimates,'' spokesman Ken Bacon said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Determining the cost of the buildup is difficult because the
Pentagon has a wide range of fixed costs, such as salaries and
maintenance, that would exist under normal circumstances. The
additional costs for the Gulf operation come from fuel as well as
the transportation of supplies and maintenance teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calculationg the cost depends on how long a buildup goes, what
the Pentagon continues to send and how they chalk it up,'' said
Colonel Dan Smith, director of research for the nonprofit Center
for Defense Information in Washington. For example, he said, the
aircraft carrier US Enterprise was scheduled to go to the Gulf
anyway, but its departure was speeded up because of the possible
confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cost of building up a military presence in the Gulf
in 1990 and fighting the 100-day Gulf War totalled about $61
billion, according to the Pentagon. To put this figure in
perspective, that amount would represent the third largest military
budget in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge costs were made more palatable to American
taxpayers because allies paid for all but $7 billion of them,
according to Department of Defense calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates that it spent another $6.9 billion on
Iraq operations from the end of the Gulf War through last
February's buildup. ``We have had to ramp up and send over
additional planes, additional ships and additional people in order
to stare down Saddam Hussein and force him back into his box,''
said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official involved in the recent buildup said
the last time that Washington solicited financial support for its
military operations was in 1994, when Iraq sent its troops to the
border of Kuwait, raising the specter of another invasion. At that
time, the US government secured about $350 million from Saudia
Arabia and Kuwait. In the latest confrontation, Defense Secretary
William Cohen and other US officials appealed to Gulf states for
their public support but not their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of burden-sharing was never raised,'' the US
official said. ``When you're trying to convince someone to land
your troops and warplanes in their country, you don't ask them to
pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the US government needs to press its
allies to pay for the cost of containing Hussein. After all,
American dependence on Persian Gulf Oil has diminished considerably
since the Gulf War. The United States buys only 23 percent of its
crude oil from the region, compared to 30 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Asia and Western Europe import more oil from the region
than we do,'' said Zal Khalilzad, a military analyst and a former
assistant undersecretary of defense. ``We risk getting killed in
large numbers protecting the oil that is for their benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Murphy, assistant secretary of state for Near East
and South Asian affairs during the Reagan administration, said that
continued US financial commitment may become politically untenable.
Prolonged, arduous deployments in the Persian Gulf and other areas
are driving highly trained air force pilots and technology
specialists out of the military and sending reenlistment rates
plummeting to near historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that the Clinton administration has not explained
why the US receives so little help in bearing the costs of
operations that benefit Iraq's neighbors. ``There really hasn't
been any burden sharing in the fullest sense since Desert Storm,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   And John Hillen, a national security specialist at the Council
on Foreign Relations, concluded, ``I think we're paying to make
sure the global economy is fueled.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government, John White, a former deputy secretary of defense in the
Clinton administration, said that the US government has good
reasons for mobilizing troops against Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken a long-term view of the stability of the Gulf,
which has to do with oil, broader issues of communications and the
ability to move around the world unthreatened, and it has to do
with our friends and allies,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf economies that were awash in money in 1991 are no
longer flush due to a worldwide drop in oil prices. Saudi Arabia,
for example, is expected to generate some $30 billion in oil
revenues this year -- $15 billion less than at the beginning of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Larry Goldstein, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation, ``They are hurting. The loss of revenue is
real, but pain is relative. It's a little bit like the NBA when
Kenny Anderson says the strike is forcing him to sell one of his
eight antique cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of an agreement with Kuwait and Saudia Arabia, the two
countries spend a total of at least $100 million a year, mostly in
fuel, to support American military operations in the Gulf,
according to US official.
</P>
<P>
   During February's showdown with Iraq, the US mustered a
coalition of twelve nations to provide everything from medical
units to commando squads. But with the exception of Britain, which
sent war ships, the participation of the allies was largely
symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Experts caution that any attempt to put firm costs on this
buildup is fruitless because the price tag rises daily. ``You can't
measure the doggoned thing until the end,' said Smith from the
Center for Defense Information.

MONICA LEWINSKY, SEEN BUT NOT HEARD, MAKES AN AUDIO DEBUT  
</HEADLINE>
 (htv) 
 By JAMES BENNET    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A presidential scandal that was never long on
mystery or romance surrendered perhaps its last tantalizing secret
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   What for the last 10 months had been heard only by select
prosecutors, grand jurors, relatives and waiters Tuesday chattered,
sobbed and wheedled around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky's endlessly tape-recorded voice _ like so much
of her uniquely interrupted, scrutinized life _ became public
property.
</P>
<P>
   The inflection was not thin or childish, even in constant
counterpoint to the robust rasp of Linda Tripp, who secretly
recorded their conversations. But, more Buffy than Bacall, it was
unmistakably that of a woman who is very young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meaning, like, if she had a  &UR; moment &LR; ,'' she says sharply at
one point, describing how she had paged the president's secretary,
Betty Currie, ``like, if she  &UR; could &LR; , you know, if she could talk,
then to call me.'' Unaware that Tripp is archiving her rapid-fire
ramblings, she adds impatiently, ``So it's like, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   At other points, Lewinsky's rather nasal intonation softens, the
word ``like'' drops away, and she sounds lost and a little afraid.
``That was very nice of her,'' she murmurs sadly when told that a
White House staff member has defended her jeopardized reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The content of the 22 hours of conversations was revealed weeks
ago in transcripts. But their tone and tenor were unknown before
Tuesday morning, when sets of 37 tapes were presented in flat brown
boxes, like so many breakfast doughnuts, to reporters. They were
released by the House Judiciary Committee, which is considering an
impeachment case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected, nostalgic twist, the audiotapes almost
instantly yanked Tuesday's 24-hour television news networks back to
the less hectic days of radio drama. Static head shots of the
protagonists adorned the screen.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides privately grumbled about the timing of the
release, two days before Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, is
to testify before the committee. But most just declared that the
tapes contributed nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the audio might draw attention by adding drama to the
proceedings, Paul Begala, an adviser to Clinton, did not pause.
``Maybe in the way that people slow down to look at a car wreck on
the highway,'' he said. ``But that doesn't mean they want more car
wrecks.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House could draw some comfort Tuesday from Tripp's
performance. What read as exhortation in the transcripts sounds
like hectoring and even badgering as she presses Lewinsky to seek a
better job with higher pay from Clinton and his friends. ``Favors
like that are done every day, and it's nonthreatening to anyone,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Tripp commiserates with Lewinsky that others have
their ``own agenda'' and worries that she could ``lose a dear
friend'' by testifying against Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky sometimes sounds quite mature and analytical as she
contemplates in matter-of-fact tones the trouble it might cause the
president to arrange a highly paid job for her. But she also sounds
determined as when she declares that she wants ``something easy to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   And she sometimes sounds plain angry. ``I'm fed up,'' she says
at another point.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has a lot going on in the background. She can be heard
eating _ at one point there is the unmistakable sound of a spoon
scraping cardboard _ watching sports on television, ordering a pet
off the furniture. But she never seems to lose track of Lewinsky's
exhaustive accounts of her efforts to reach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The committee blanked out some personal exchanges as well as
what appears to have been a multitude of expletives.
</P>
<P>
   The two women spent much of their hours of conversation trading
observations about their own and each other's personalities.
Worrying that White House staff members might be gossiping about
her, Lewinsky tells Tripp she may go crazy if she returns there to
work. ``Me with my paranoia?'' she expostulates.
</P>
<P>
   At times Lewinsky seems to be using her voice as an instrument
to influence her confidante. She sobs, seemingly uncontrollably, at
the news that Tripp intends to testify truthfully about their
conversations, but she dries up when Tripp cuts her off with the
impatient observation that she does not cry as easily as Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky tries wheedling. ``What about if I could insure that
you have job security?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, her voice rises to a screech as she says that the
president will realize she has been indiscreet with Tripp.
`` &UR; Because &LR;  it'll be obvious, it'll be obvious to him!'' she
storms.
</P>
<P>
   It is when she considers the extremes of her extraordinary
predicament that Lewinsky sounds the youngest. In Harlequin romance
novel terms, she describes falling in love with Clinton ``the first
time I ever looked into his eyes close up.'' But she also becomes
almost a child again when she contemplates the awfulness of her
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I can't win for losing,'' she blurts out at one
point, sounding near tears. ``I can't win. I can't win.''

SEARCH FOR TRUDEAU'S SON CONTINUES IN BRITISH COLUMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   MONTREAL _ As a loyal dog was finally hauled away from a
freezing five-day vigil for his lost master, police divers Tuesday
started scouring a remote lake in British Columbia for the body of
the youngest son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott
Trudeau.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Trudeau, a 23-year-old lover of the outdoors, is believed
to have drowned in Kokanee Lake on Friday after being swept into
the frigid waters by an avalanche. He and three companions were on
a back-country ski expedition when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   His ski mates survived, but were unable to reach Michel as his
screams for help echoed off the steep mountains all around. They
made an arduous trek miles through the deep drifts of the roadless
wilderness to summon assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But Trudeau's beloved dog, Makwa, refused to abandon the scene,
keeping watch over the slush-clotted lake as bad weather thwarted
searchers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from reaching
Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park.
</P>
<P>
   The young Trudeau was the first victim of the notorious
avalanches of British Columbia's ski season, which last year took
16 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy marked the second time in four months that Trudeau's
plucky part-Labrador pooch made headlines across Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Michel's pickup truck rolled over while the young man
was traveling east through Manitoba on the Trans-Canada Highway.
The dog disappeared, but Trudeau refused to leave the area of the
accident _ searching for days until Makwa was finally found, his
leg injured by the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Makwa repaid his master's devotion this week with a vigil of his
own. But there will be no happy endings this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Police hold no hope that Trudeau is alive, and warned that
searchers may not even be able to retrieve the body from the gloomy
depths of the lake, which is starting to ice over.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Mounties Tuesday were able to catch Makwa and another
dog belonging to one of Michel's skiing companions, airlifting the
animals to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dogs are very hungry, but basically in good shape,'' RCMP
Randy Koch said from Nelson, B.C., the nearest settlement to the
accident. ``The Trudeau dog did not want to leave the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, weather cleared enough to allow helicopter-borne
divers to reach the lake to commence the grim search. Ironically,
Michel Trudeau was training as a rescuer with the ski patrol while
working as a lift operator at a lodge.
</P>
<P>
   The sad saga has riveted Canada, capturing front page headlines
and dominating television news reports. Pierre Trudeau, 79 and in
frail health, is known for his steely character but has reportedly
been crushed by the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The older Trudeau was a suave Montreal multimillionaire known as
much for his swinging lifestyle as his political ideals when he
rode a wave of ``Trudeaumania'' to power in 1968, presiding off and
on as prime minister for 16 years. His 1971 marriage to Margaret
Sinclair produced three sons, including Michel, and became the
stuff of international gossip as Margaret _ 29 years younger than
Trudeau _ carried on with celebrities while her husband conducted
his own liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau, a semi-retired lawyer in Montreal, remains the most
controversial leader in Canada's history, an arrogant, aloof figure
who outraged civil libertarians in 1970 by invoking the War
Measures Act and ordering troops into Quebec to suppress
secessionist terrorists _ but who also later won accolades from
civil rights proponents by adding a strong Charter of Rights and
Freedoms to Canada's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was divorced in 1984, after a long separation, but
the three boys stayed close to both parents, shuttling between
homes in Montreal and Ottawa. ``My father's motto is reason before
passion,'' Michel Trudeau told a Quebec filmmaker earlier this
year. ``My mom is the complete opposite.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A presidential scandal that was never long on
mystery or romance surrendered perhaps its last tantalizing secret
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   What for the last 10 months had been heard only by select
prosecutors, grand jurors, relatives and waiters Tuesday chattered,
sobbed and wheedled around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky's endlessly tape-recorded voice _ like so much
of her uniquely interrupted, scrutinized life _ became public
property.
</P>
<P>
   The inflection was not thin or childish, even in constant
counterpoint to the robust rasp of Linda Tripp, who secretly
recorded their conversations. But, more Buffy than Bacall, it was
unmistakably that of a woman who is very young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meaning, like, if she had a  &UR; moment &LR; ,'' she says sharply at
one point, describing how she had paged the president's secretary,
Betty Currie, ``like, if she  &UR; could &LR; , you know, if she could talk,
then to call me.'' Unaware that Tripp is archiving her rapid-fire
ramblings, she adds impatiently, ``So it's like, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   At other points, Lewinsky's rather nasal intonation softens, the
word ``like'' drops away, and she sounds lost and a little afraid.
``That was very nice of her,'' she murmurs sadly when told that a
White House staff member has defended her jeopardized reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The content of the 22 hours of conversations was revealed weeks
ago in transcripts. But their tone and tenor were unknown before
Tuesday morning, when sets of 37 tapes were presented in flat brown
boxes, like so many breakfast doughnuts, to reporters. They were
released by the House Judiciary Committee, which is considering an
impeachment case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected, nostalgic twist, the audiotapes almost
instantly yanked Tuesday's 24-hour television news networks back to
the less hectic days of radio drama. Static head shots of the
protagonists adorned the screen.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides privately grumbled about the timing of the
release, two days before Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, is
to testify before the committee. But most just declared that the
tapes contributed nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the audio might draw attention by adding drama to the
proceedings, Paul Begala, an adviser to Clinton, did not pause.
``Maybe in the way that people slow down to look at a car wreck on
the highway,'' he said. ``But that doesn't mean they want more car
wrecks.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House could draw some comfort Tuesday from Tripp's
performance. What read as exhortation in the transcripts sounds
like hectoring and even badgering as she presses Lewinsky to seek a
better job with higher pay from Clinton and his friends. ``Favors
like that are done every day, and it's nonthreatening to anyone,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Tripp commiserates with Lewinsky that others have
their ``own agenda'' and worries that she could ``lose a dear
friend'' by testifying against Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky sometimes sounds quite mature and analytical as she
contemplates in matter-of-fact tones the trouble it might cause the
president to arrange a highly paid job for her. But she also sounds
determined as when she declares that she wants ``something easy to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   And she sometimes sounds plain angry. ``I'm fed up,'' she says
at another point.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has a lot going on in the background. She can be heard
eating _ at one point there is the unmistakable sound of a spoon
scraping cardboard _ watching sports on television, ordering a pet
off the furniture. But she never seems to lose track of Lewinsky's
exhaustive accounts of her efforts to reach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The committee blanked out some personal exchanges as well as
what appears to have been a multitude of expletives.
</P>
<P>
   The two women spent much of their hours of conversation trading
observations about their own and each other's personalities.
Worrying that White House staff members might be gossiping about
her, Lewinsky tells Tripp she may go crazy if she returns there to
work. ``Me with my paranoia?'' she expostulates.
</P>
<P>
   At times Lewinsky seems to be using her voice as an instrument
to influence her confidante. She sobs, seemingly uncontrollably, at
the news that Tripp intends to testify truthfully about their
conversations, but she dries up when Tripp cuts her off with the
impatient observation that she does not cry as easily as Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky tries wheedling. ``What about if I could insure that
you have job security?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, her voice rises to a screech as she says that the
president will realize she has been indiscreet with Tripp.
`` &UR; Because &LR;  it'll be obvious, it'll be obvious to him!'' she
storms.
</P>
<P>
   It is when she considers the extremes of her extraordinary
predicament that Lewinsky sounds the youngest. In Harlequin romance
novel terms, she describes falling in love with Clinton ``the first
time I ever looked into his eyes close up.'' But she also becomes
almost a child again when she contemplates the awfulness of her
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I can't win for losing,'' she blurts out at one
point, sounding near tears. ``I can't win. I can't win.''

COST OF IRAQ BUILDUP TO LAND SOLELY ON US TAXPAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If war is hell, peacekeeping is downright
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   US officials and private analysts estimate that the military
buildup in the Persian Gulf this month has cost well over $1
billion, and US taxpayers are picking up the tab, not the oil-rich
Arab countries that paid for most of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not asked Arab countries to pay so far,
and they are not contributing more than jet fuel and incidental
expenses, according to US officials and foreign diplomats. That
leaves Americans and, to a much lesser extent, the British, to pay
for keeping Saddam Hussein in check.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon claims to have no idea what the price tag is for
the buildup this autumn. ``We don't have firm estimates now. In
fact we don't even have loose estimates,'' spokesman Ken Bacon said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Determining the cost of the buildup is difficult because the
Pentagon has a wide range of fixed costs, such as salaries and
maintenance, that would exist under normal circumstances. The
additional costs for the Gulf operation come from fuel as well as
the transportation of supplies and maintenance teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calculationg the cost depends on how long a buildup goes, what
the Pentagon continues to send and how they chalk it up,'' said
Colonel Dan Smith, director of research for the nonprofit Center
for Defense Information in Washington. For example, he said, the
aircraft carrier US Enterprise was scheduled to go to the Gulf
anyway, but its departure was speeded up because of the possible
confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cost of building up a military presence in the Gulf
in 1990 and fighting the 100-day Gulf War totalled about $61
billion, according to the Pentagon. To put this figure in
perspective, that amount would represent the third largest military
budget in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge costs were made more palatable to American
taxpayers because allies paid for all but $7 billion of them,
according to Department of Defense calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates that it spent another $6.9 billion on
Iraq operations from the end of the Gulf War through last
February's buildup. ``We have had to ramp up and send over
additional planes, additional ships and additional people in order
to stare down Saddam Hussein and force him back into his box,''
said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official involved in the recent buildup said
the last time that Washington solicited financial support for its
military operations was in 1994, when Iraq sent its troops to the
border of Kuwait, raising the specter of another invasion. At that
time, the US government secured about $350 million from Saudia
Arabia and Kuwait. In the latest confrontation, Defense Secretary
William Cohen and other US officials appealed to Gulf states for
their public support but not their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of burden-sharing was never raised,'' the US
official said. ``When you're trying to convince someone to land
your troops and warplanes in their country, you don't ask them to
pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the US government needs to press its
allies to pay for the cost of containing Hussein. After all,
American dependence on Persian Gulf Oil has diminished considerably
since the Gulf War. The United States buys only 23 percent of its
crude oil from the region, compared to 30 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Asia and Western Europe import more oil from the region
than we do,'' said Zal Khalilzad, a military analyst and a former
assistant undersecretary of defense. ``We risk getting killed in
large numbers protecting the oil that is for their benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Murphy, assistant secretary of state for Near East
and South Asian affairs during the Reagan administration, said that
continued US financial commitment may become politically untenable.
Prolonged, arduous deployments in the Persian Gulf and other areas
are driving highly trained air force pilots and technology
specialists out of the military and sending reenlistment rates
plummeting to near historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that the Clinton administration has not explained
why the US receives so little help in bearing the costs of
operations that benefit Iraq's neighbors. ``There really hasn't
been any burden sharing in the fullest sense since Desert Storm,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   And John Hillen, a national security specialist at the Council
on Foreign Relations, concluded, ``I think we're paying to make
sure the global economy is fueled.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government, John White, a former deputy secretary of defense in the
Clinton administration, said that the US government has good
reasons for mobilizing troops against Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken a long-term view of the stability of the Gulf,
which has to do with oil, broader issues of communications and the
ability to move around the world unthreatened, and it has to do
with our friends and allies,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf economies that were awash in money in 1991 are no
longer flush due to a worldwide drop in oil prices. Saudi Arabia,
for example, is expected to generate some $30 billion in oil
revenues this year -- $15 billion less than at the beginning of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Larry Goldstein, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation, ``They are hurting. The loss of revenue is
real, but pain is relative. It's a little bit like the NBA when
Kenny Anderson says the strike is forcing him to sell one of his
eight antique cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of an agreement with Kuwait and Saudia Arabia, the two
countries spend a total of at least $100 million a year, mostly in
fuel, to support American military operations in the Gulf,
according to US official.
</P>
<P>
   During February's showdown with Iraq, the US mustered a
coalition of twelve nations to provide everything from medical
units to commando squads. But with the exception of Britain, which
sent war ships, the participation of the allies was largely
symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Experts caution that any attempt to put firm costs on this
buildup is fruitless because the price tag rises daily. ``You can't
measure the doggoned thing until the end,' said Smith from the
Center for Defense Information.

PANEL URGES REVIEW OF STUDIES USING MENTAL PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A presidential commission Tuesday called for a
nationwide review of studies that either provoke psychotic symptoms
or withdraw medications from people with mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to establish how widespread these studies
are,'' said Dr. Bernard Lo, a member of the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As detailed in a Boston Globe series that began on Sunday,
psychiatric researchers for the past 25 years have conducted a
series of ``challenge'' studies in which mental patients have been
given a drug such as ketamine that triggers a psychotic episode.
The aim is to study the biology of mental illness. At other times,
patients have been taken off their medication and allowed to fall
back into psychosis for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Neither type of experiment eases the suffering of mental
patients, and many mental health specialists say provoking
psychosis can cause long-term harm.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Globe series, commission member James Childress
proposed the review to his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of evidence on provocation studies,'' said
Childress in making his proposal, which fellow commissioners
swiftly agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the commission recommended regulations to provide
special research protections for people with mental illness that
would limit the kinds of studies they can be asked to participate
in and require tougher oversight of the studies that do involve
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We undertook this ... because we think it's important for all
vulnerable populations to have special protections,'' said Harold
T. Shapiro, chairman of the presidentially appointed commission and
president of Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will send its recommendations to the White House
in the next few months. Despite similar recommendations in the
past, people with mental illness currently do not the same research
protections as prisoners, pregnant women, children and fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   At President Clinton's request, the commission also began
deliberating Tuesday on the ethical implications of a new type of
embryonic cell research involving human and cow tissue. It could
take up to six months before the issue is fully explored, according
to Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for the Institute of Medicine review, the bioethics
commission asked not only for an assessment of how widespread the
controversial research is, but also of how people were recruited
for such studies and what contributions these studies have made to
science.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent mental-health advocate was quick to criticize the
role of the Institute of Medicine in doing a national review.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they recognized a problem that has been exposed and
needs to be investigated,'' said Vera Sharav, founder of Citizens
for Responsible Care in Psychiatry and Research, a New York-based
group made up of families with sons and daughters who suffer from
schizophrenia. ``But the Institute of Medicine is not the agency to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute, Shariv charged, is composed of researchers who in
the past have approved of challenge studies, and in some cases have
even conducted them.
</P>
<P>
   Childress initially proposed having the inspector general's
office of the Department of Health and Human Services conduct the
review, and suggested limiting the review only to the most
controversial research, those involving symptom exacerbation.
</P>
<P>
   But Lo and other commission members also expressed concerns
about studies that involve medication withdrawal, or washout, and
the use of placebo, or a dummy sugar pill. They also worried about
the ``police action'' implied by an inspector general review.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Childress' proposal was modified to cover studies
involving placebos and washouts, and to put the review in the hands
of the Institute of Medicine, a congressionally created,
independent research arm that examines scientific questions of
national importance.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its two-year deliberation on research protections for
people with mental disorders, the bioethics commission did try to
assess on its own some of the studies involving the exacerbation of
symptoms, the withdrawal of medication, and the use of placebos.
Despite sending nearly 60 letters to researchers requesting a copy
of the protocols and consent forms, the commission received only 13
sets of materials.

remains poised and sane on the first anniversary of giving birth to
the world-famous septuplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it's much easier than you might think. I can't say
that having all of them together is seven times the work,''
McCaughey said in a recent phone interview from her home in
Carlisle, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   It's afternoon nap time in the tiny home on First Street, and no
stragglers fuss in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Last month aside _ everyone had the flu and bronchitis _ the 12
months since the seven were born Nov. 19 have gone amazingly well,
McCaughey says.
</P>
<P>
   Church volunteers help out only during the day now. The
septuplets sleep through most nights.
</P>
<P>
   The family will be moving into its new home next week, and the
seven celebrated their first birthday a little early with extended
family. Each had an individual cupcake matching the big cake.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the day they turn 1, ``Seven From Heaven, the
Miracle of the McCaughey Septuplets'' ($22.99, Thomas Nelson
Publishers) will be in bookstores everywhere. The book, written
with Gregg and Deborah Lewis, alternates between the first-person
perspectives of Bobbi and husband Kenny, and details the
difficulties and triumphs of the family's year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we might have a different story to tell if we'd had a
baby that had cried non-stop for months on end, but they're just
such good kids,'' Bobbi said. ``We haven't really had any colicky
babies or any babies that are just cranky for the sake of being
cranky.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies have few health problems and are on target for their
developmental age _ 10 months because they were born two months
early. The prognosis looks good. Alexis hasn't needed extra oxygen
since June, and Natalie and Alexis should no longer need feeding
tubes after the two eat more solid foods and drink from cups,
doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   The credit, then, goes to good-natured babies _ and a schedule
that stays on track most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The babies are up at 7 a.m. and nap at 9 a.m., 1:30 and 4:30
p.m. Bedtime is 7:30 p.m. The babies eat together, diapers are
changed at the same time, and everyone plays.
</P>
<P>
   The entire family has been on outings to parks and restaurants,
including spending Labor Day weekend at a campground that had
electricity and running water.
</P>
<P>
   Many friends shook their heads in disbelief when told about the
camp trip. Others asked Kenny and Bobbi if they were crazy, even
though eight other adult family members had gone along for the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camping is something we really enjoy,'' Bobbi said. ``We
wanted to start the tradition when the kids were young and just get
them used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Big sister Mikayla, nearly 3, is adjusting well and loves to
help out with the babies, Bobbi said. She's changed a diaper on her
own, when Mom wasn't in the room, and she's the babies' favorite
entertainment as she marches back and forth through the living room
singing songs for the diminutive audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just watch her like it's the greatest thing in the
world,'' Bobbi said.
</P>
<P>
   From the first story about the babies' birth, public reaction to
the McCaughey septuplets has ranged from miracle to madness.
</P>
<P>
   The McCaugheys received a generous outpouring of support from
around the country and a congratulatory call from President
Clinton. Many criticized their decision against selective
reduction, a decision based on their religious beliefs. To prevent
the risks associated with large multiple births, doctors often
advise against carrying all fetuses to term. The McCaugheys were
morally opposed to aborting any fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   The septuplets were conceived when Bobbi McCaughey showed only
three mature eggs, considered a good number for getting pregnant
without the risk of a large multiple birth. Mikayla was conceived
under the same scenario.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Bobbi and Kenny recall how they had agreed that
twins would be nice and they could handle triplets. That was before
they listened to seven heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want seven babies. ``I just wish I could understand
what God is trying to teach us,'' Bobbi wrote in her journal. ``I
know to trust him, but what else? There must be more.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a year later, the couple remain unwavering in their
commitment against selective reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The McCaugheys also were criticized for giving credit to God for
the successful outcome. Throughout the book, the McCaugheys talk
about God's provision in their lives, their dependence on him and
their desire to show their Christian faith from their wedding day.
They also talk about the loss of privacy and how the criticism
stung.
</P>
<P>
   For the McCaugheys, the babies were, and are, an answer to
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Why God answered the McCaugheys' prayers this way, whereas other
families never conceive children, is an unanswerable question,
Bobbi McCaughey says.
</P>
<P>
   Her tubes have been tied, but Bobbi would be open to another
baby. However, ``Kenny says absolutely not!'' she said with a
laugh. &QL;

FAMILY WARY OF COMMERCIAL APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The high estimate to raise the year-old McCaughey
septuplets to adulthood is $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Diapers and formula alone, if they had not been donated to the
family, would have cost $1,000 a month, more than half Kenny
McCaughey's monthly salary as a billing clerk at a car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   So, the family has taken a few commercial opportunities besides
collaborating on the new book.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny is appearing in a Black &AMP; Decker cordless-drill spot, and
Bobbi is endorsing a line of Simplicity patterns designed for busy
mothers. They are contemplating offers for a television movie.
</P>
<P>
   But they turned down a tabloid offer of nearly $1 million for an
exclusive story. They limit media interviews, though besieged with
requests, and have an agent who specializes in Christian clients.
There will be no book-signing tour.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have children who lead normal lives, Bobbi
McCaughey says. They don't want to accept any endorsement or
interview that would clash with their Christian beliefs and values,
but they do want to provide for their family. They also want to
express gratitude to those who have been so generous, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't feel that it would be right to say, `Thank you
very much, but you're not going to see any pictures of the kids,'
'' Bobbi says of allowing some access to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the endorsements and generosity, including their new
5,500-square-foot home, the family must continue trusting in God,
she says. She didn't share their checking-account balance, only
saying, ``Well, Kenny's still working.'' &QL;

STUDENT SMOKING SOARING, COLLEGE STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing a trend seen in younger students, a Harvard
University study has found that in the past four years, smoking has
increased by 28 percent on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking is up among all student groups, regardless of age, sex,
year in school, race and ethnicity, said the researchers, who
analyzed responses from more than 14,000 students in 1997 and more
than 15,000 in 1993. In 1993, 22 percent of college students
smoked; now, more than 28 percent do.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, smoking was up in 99 out of 116 4-year schools in
the 39 states surveyed, noted social psychologist Henry Wechsler,
the senior author of the paper published in the current Journal of
the American Medical Association and director of College Alcohol
Studies at the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most dramatic finding,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``It shows it's everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and ill health
in America, leading to more than 400,000 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for the surge in college smoking, the researchers
said, &UR;  &LR; is that smoking has been up among high school and middle
school children lately and these young people are now in college.
In fact, between 1991 and 1997, cigarette smoking rose 32 percent
among high school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped that college students would be more immune to
this type of behavior, that they would read health messages and
warning labels more,'' Wechsler said.
</P>
<P>
   The rise is particularly disturbing because people with college
educations have traditionally smoked less than less-educated
people.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tide has seemed to be turning against tobacco
companies recently, the entertainment industry has been promoting
``the idea that smoking is more common than it is,'' noted Dr. Dr.
Donald Sharp, a medical epidemiologist in the office on smoking and
health at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an increase in the depiction of tobacco use in
feature films,'' agreed Jay Winsten, associate dean at the Harvard
School of Public Health. ``The glamorizing of smoking serves as an
important barrier interfering with other efforts to curb tobacco
smoking by teenagers and children.''
</P>
<P>
   One study showed that more than half of the top-grossing feature
films between 1991 and 1996 depicted tobacco use, added Susan Moses
deputy director for Harvard's center for health communication.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking in movies ``certainly hasn't helped,'' noted Wechsler.
``I wish actors and directors would think about the health of youth
before they did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Ryan, a senior at Brown University, said she first lit up
about 18 months ago, and now smokes a half a pack to a pack a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started because my boyfriend did it, and it was very much
one of those I-want-to-be-cool things,'' Ryan said. ``You don't
even know that when you're doing it, but I know that now. To some
extent, you're hanging around and (by smoking), showing you're not
a prude. I was hitting my I'm-going-to-be-fun-in-college stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased smoking rates were found in all kinds of colleges _
public and private, commuter and residential, large and small,
schools that are academically competitive and those that are less
so. Smoking prevalence was also similar in rural and urban schools,
between women's and co-ed schools, and between schools that have a
religious affiliation and those that don't.
</P>
<P>
   Although smoking was up among all groups of college students,
certain groups _ notably Asians, African-Americans and Hispanics _
have lower smoking rates than whites, the researchers found. Older
students _ seniors and fifth-year students _ also tend to smoke
less than freshmen, sophomores and juniors.
</P>
<P>
   Most students began smoking in high school, the researchers
found, with just 11 percent beginning at or after age 19. But more
than a quarter began smoking regularly in college, Wechsler said.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all college smokers said they had tried to quit in the
previous year, which suggests more aggressive anti-smoking
campaigns might find a receptive audience on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   At least two things might help, noted Wechsler and co-author Dr.
Nancy Rigotti in a prepared statement. Rigotti is director of
Tobacco Research and Treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges could offer more smoking cessation programs and create
smoke-free areas _ including dormitories. More smoke-free areas
would help nonsmokers, by reducing their exposure to second-hand
smoke, and would reduce the visibility and accessibility of
cigarettes for smokers trying to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools are trying to do just that. Emerson College in
Boston, for instance, began offering a smoking cessation program
last spring and made one of its largest dormitories smoke-free,
said Jane Powers, director of health services.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the price of cigarettes might also help, said Sharp of
the CDC. So would ``counter advertising'' to offset the $5 billion
a year the tobacco industry spends in advertising and promotion.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Trying to fine tune a massive redevelopment plan for
downtown Hartford, Conn., officials are pressuring New England
Patriots owner Robert Kraft to commit soon to relocating the
football team there, according to individuals familiar with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Talks have intensified over the last few days between Kraft and
Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who met for five hours Monday
and two hours Friday, in an effort to finalize a proposal for an
open-air stadium that would be shared with the University of
Connecticut's football team. UConn needs a larger facility to move
up to the Division 1-A category by 2002 and could apparently foot
some of the stadium's construction cost if the Patriots agree to
move there.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford option, if finalized, could be a cheaper and less
troublesome alternative for Kraft, who has pledged $220 million to
build a new stadium in Foxborough, Mass. but has been stymied by
the Massachusetts Legislature to win publicly financed improvements
around the site.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's legislature, meanwhile, has already approved $300
million to revitalize Hartford along the Connecticut River, some of
which could be used for stadium and infrastructure construction.
The federal government is throwing in another $7 million for the
effort, the state's two US Senators announced this week.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the recent flurry of activity between the
team and Connecticut officials is that the state needs to begin
making plans to move the city's steam plant located at the
crossroads of Interstates 84 and 91, where the new stadium would be
built. Utility executives met with Hartford Mayor Michael Peters on
Nov. 2 to talk about replacing the steam plant _ which state
officials said was an encouraging sign that the expensive and
complex process was moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy and at the time secret meetings between Kraft and
Rowland make it clear that a stadium proposal is gaining momentum
there as part of the huge housing, entertainment, retail and
convention center project at the riverfront Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman declined to comment Tuesday. But a key
civic leader pushing the downtown revitalization said a decision
needs to be made quickly on the stadium so as not to derail the
overall project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the Patriots) have an interest in us, we have a time frame
that we have to meet,'' Richard Fiondella, chairman and chief
executive of Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co., told the
Hartford Courant Tuesday. ``It'll either happen in the next three
to four months, or it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rowland was evasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a handful of people who are actually taking
part in the discussion,'' spokesman Dean Pagani said. ``Only a
handful of people know what's actually going on in the jury room.
Everyone else has to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they want to build a new stadium for UConn by
2002 that would seat at least 35,000 people. Drawing in the
Patriots would only require an expansion of that proposed facility
but it would reduce the cost to both the university and Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who has a cordial relationship with Connecticut officials
going back many years, flew directly from Buffalo, N.Y., where the
Patriots played the Bills on Sunday, to Hartford, where he
reportedly met Rowland at the Governor's Mansion before continuing
talks at an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   News of the meetings reverberated on Beacon Hill Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Governor Paul Cellucci headed to New Orleans for the National
Republican Governor's Association, he said he would press Rowland,
who is also expected to attend, on the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll ask him about it,'' Cellucci said. ``We have bills
pending but there has to be a willingness on the House's side to
try to find some common ground and deliver a bill that will make it
possible for the Patriots to stay here in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham struck a deal with Kraft
last February that would have spent $52 million on infrastructure
and $20 million for land around Foxborough Stadium, which Kraft
would pay $700,000 to lease back from the state each year. In
return, Kraft would have spent $220 million of his own money to
build a new facility.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would have cost taxpayers $2.3 million a year,
compared to $2.2 million a year for the original House bill that
offered just $52 million in just infrastructure in exchange for a
renovated stadium. The team generates about $10 million in state
tax revenue a year.

FOSSILS OF DINOSAUR SKIN REVEAL FAMILY RESEMBLANCE TO MODERN KIN
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, paleontologists have found fossilized
embryos of dinosaurs so well preserved that their delicate skin has
survived in mineralized form, providing a glimpse of reptilian
scales in patterns bearing a family resemblance to the skin of
modern-day lizards.
</P>
<P>
   The embryonic dinosaur skin was one of several important
discoveries made a year ago by a fossil-hunting expedition working
in the parched northern Patagonian badlands of Argentina.
Everywhere the paleontologists looked over an area more than a mile
square they saw gray fossilized eggs, whole or in scatterings of
shell, lying on the surface or buried to depths of 16 feet. They
could hardly take a step without crushing egg shell fragments under
foot.
</P>
<P>
   The nesting site was found by scientists from the American
Museum of Natural History in Manhattan and the Carmen Funes Museum
in Neuquen, Argentina. They announced the discoveries on Tuesday in
a news conference at the American Museum. More detailed
descriptions appear in a report in this week's issue of the journal
Nature and an article in the December issue of National Geographic
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding embryo bones is rare enough, but finding the tissue of
embryos is truly spectacular,'' said Luis M. Chiappe, a research
associate at the American Museum and a leader of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   The paleontologists said the nesting site was about 70 to 90
million years old, in the last epoch of the Age of Reptiles. A
preliminary analysis by geologists indicates that the egg clusters
were laid in the flood plain of ancient streams that sometimes
overflowed, burying the unhatched eggs in layers of mud that
protected them from scavengers and decay.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs were about six inches in diameter, and each one would
have had the volume of a dozen chicken eggs. Some of them, Chiappe
said, were quite close to hatching. The baby dinosaurs would have
started life a mere 15 inches long and grown to an adult size of up
to 45 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   One embryo had 32 tiny teeth that reminded paleontologists of
sauropods, the giant plant-eating dinosaurs with long necks and
tails, huge bodies and four elephant-shaped legs. A familiar
sauropod is apatosaurus, often called brontosaurus. But Chiappe
said the teeth and scale patterns of the Patagonian embryos
suggested that they were related to a different type of sauropods
known as titanosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Rodolfo A. Coria, director of the Carmen Funes Museum, said the
embryo discoveries had opened ``large doors that had been closed
for years'' and should yield important insights into the physiology
and growth rates of sauropod dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries, Chiappe said, were also remarkable because they
were the first dinosaur embryos found in the Southern Hemisphere
and the first known embryos of sauropods. Paleontologists look
forward to finding and studying more southern specimens to broaden
their understanding of dinosaur evolution, which until now has been
based almost exclusively on fossils from the Northern Hemisphere.
And the fossil hunting has been especially rewarding in recent
years in the relatively unexplored Patagonia.

FIRST SIGHTING OF METEOR STORM LIVES UP TO EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of awestruck viewers throughout much of Asia and
elsewhere around the world were treated Tuesday to the most
spectacular meteor shower in 33 years, according to early reports.
</P>
<P>
   And to the relief of officials at satellite companies, space
agencies, and the military, the Leonid meteor storm appeared to
have spared the more than 600 satellites in orbit from the damage
that many had feared they might inflict.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports from scientists who had traveled to China,
Mongolia, Australia, or Japan for the event indicated that some
observers were counting more than 1,000 meteors an hour at the peak
of the display _ enough to qualify it as a true meteor storm,
rather than just a shower. One team in the Canary Islands _ halfway
around the world from the expected prime viewing area in Asia _
reported counting up to 2,000 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every location around the world that was graced with
clear skies early Tuesday _ unlike New England, which was solidly
clouded over _ apparently had peak meteor rates of 100 to 200 per
hour, more than a typical annual meteor shower produces.
</P>
<P>
   But those totals were still far less than in some past Leonid
storms, which occur every 33 years, and short of the most
optimistic expectations: up to 10,000 meteors per hour. Still, it
was not yet certain Tuesday when the peak of activity may have been
_ or even whether the storm had reached its peak.
</P>
<P>
   Two American research aircraft and one high-altitude balloon
were flying near Japan Tuesday to try to make unprecedented
observations of the meteors _ believed to be produced by particles
the size of sand grains shed by a comet called Tempel-Tuttle,
although some scientists say the particles may be larger bits of
very light, fluffy material.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Preliminary data gathered by these flying observatories are
not expected to be ready for release until late Wednesday or
Thursday, according to a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the excitement and elation from observers around the
world who braved cold nights to watch the action, satellite owners
and operators were relieved that no satellite appears to have been
damaged. Many had feared they might be, by the greatest flurry of
space junk to strike the Earth since satellites became commonplace
and crucial to communications, navigation, and weather monitoring.
The last great meteor storm was the Leonid peak in 1966, when for a
brief time sky-watchers in the Western United States saw more than
100,000 meteors in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``No spacecraft have been reported damaged as yet,'' said NASA
spokesman Donald Savage late Tuesday. And Eberhard Moebius, a
professor at the University of New Hampshire who developed a
particle detector for a research satellite called the Advanced
Composition Explorer, said that ``we can still see the real-time
solar wind data coming in'' from the satellite. That indicated that
the Advanced Composition Explorer, considered the most vulnerable
of all satellites because of its position and the sensitivity of
its instruments, appeared to have weathered the celestial storm
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from many locations, including Europe, the Mideast,
Asia, and the Americas, all suggested that while the total number
of meteors seen was not as high as some had hoped, there were far
more very bright meteors _ called fireballs _ than anyone expected.
Fireballs are defined as meteors that outshine any star or planet
in the sky, and some of those reported Tuesday glowed brighter than
the full moon and left smoky trails that remained visible for
several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Some were so bright that even observers in cloudy locations were
treated to a rare spectacle. Stuart Atkinson, watching through
misty clouds in England, reported by e-mail that ``even in the
areas completely hidden by cloud there are flashes and bursts of
light, making the sky look like there's a WW2 artillery bombardment
going on, unbelievable, spectacular.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FROM OUTFIELDER TO VALEDICTORIAN

<P>
   He was known as Tito Landrum in the '80s. He stood in against
Nolan Ryan and Doc Gooden when their fastballs buzzed under his
chin, but he never knew fear until he sat in a classroom at New
York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kids were more qualified than me,'' he said the other
day, a college graduate, a man with a future. ``There would be a
three-hour class and a half-hour break and another three-hour
class. I did not know how to handle it. I was out of the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   He is now called Terry Landrum, his given name. Last May his
peers chose him valedictorian of his college class, the School of
Education at NYU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a problem with that,'' he said. ``Some of them had 3.9
averages, and mine was only 3.3. But they wanted me to do it, and
it was an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   With his bachelor's in physical therapy, Terry Landrum will have
a life after sports. Not all athletes make the break, and some of
them run into very public trouble. Too gracious to bring up the
subject himself, Landrum conceded that some of his colleagues still
seem to be grieving for their former life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to some of the golf tournaments and card shows,'' he
said. ``I ask them, `What are you doing?' and they say, `Oh,
nothing.' You'd be amazed at some of them. Where are they now?''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, many athletes do not live in the past, but shed their
clubhouse manners and life style when it is time, and become useful
members of the broader society.
</P>
<P>
   There is the former professional running back and Supreme Court
justice, Byron White, once known as Whizzer. There is Sally Ride,
former junior tennis player, rugby player at Stanford, later an
astronaut. There is Scotty Baesler, a former basketball captain for
Kentucky, losing a tight election to Jim Bunning, a pitcher of a
perfect game, for a Senate seat. There are Tenley Albright, Bobby
Brown, Eric Heiden, Dot Richardson, Ron Taylor and Debi Thomas,
doctors all.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your definition of athlete, there is also Jesse
(the Body) Ventura, the professional wrestler who, winning the
governorship of Minnesota this month, said, ``You can't win until
you learn how to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Landrum knew he was learning lessons while taking eight years to
reach the St. Louis Cardinals. Last week he said: ``I was not an
everyday player, so I had to go early for practice. I would stay
late and listen to everybody. I accepted criticism. That was the
only way to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   He had his moments. In 1983, he was shuttled to Baltimore, and
he hit the homer in Chicago that won the American League series. In
1985, when Vince Coleman absent-mindedly became entangled in the
tarpaulin, Landrum stepped in and batted .429 in the league series
and .360 in the World Series, and relished every moment of it.
</P>
<P>
   He was, for the record, one of the good people in a major league
clubhouse, willing and able to express himself, while many of the
Cardinals were grumbling about all those journalists asking all
those questions.
</P>
<P>
   When his career ended in 1989, Tito Landrum tried for a job in
baseball, and none was forthcoming, if you can imagine that. In
1991, he moved to New York with his fiancee, Carol Williams, an
award-winning producer now with ABC's ``Discovery'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carol is my heart and soul,'' he said. ``We've been together
11 years. When she suggested I go back to school, I was frightened
because I had been an average student in high school, and had no
background in science or math, all the things I hated and, quite
honestly, ducked. But I took one course in biology and got a B, and
that excited me.''
</P>
<P>
   He had not made a ton of money in baseball, and wound up taking
a student loan after seeking guidance from Richard Lapchick of the
Northeastern University Center for the Study of Sports in Society.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted into the highly selective physical therapy program at
NYU, Landrum felt like a rookie who has just seen his first
big-time curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I had was my work ethic,'' he said. ``I showed
up early, and I asked questions. I had four tutors, and I would sit
and talk with those bright kids about how to study.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May 13, in his elegant speaking voice, Terry Landrum gave
his valedictory talk, a masterpiece in six quick paragraphs. He
recalled a minister's parable about a race in which the two fastest
runners became careless and fell down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always identified with the slowest runner,'' Landrum
said. ``I spent eight long years in the minors. Then I made it to
three World Series. Not one of them felt as good as it feels to be
here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Landrum has completed eight-week clinical
internships, one in cardiopulmonary medicine, one in orthopedics,
and is now studying to gain his license. He hopes to specialize in
female athletes who are coming down with a major number of
noncontact knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been an asset for any baseball team in the front
office, or with a television network. Instead, Terry Landrum has
applied the positive values from sport toward his own education and
a useful career in the broader world.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KRASNOYARSK-26, Russia _ When Andrei Sokolov came to this
nuclear city more than 30 years ago it was a bastion of privilege
for the Soviet Union's scientific elite.
</P>
<P>
   Its very existence was a state secret. Behind barbed-wire
fences, and hidden inside a mountain of granite, three nuclear
reactors produced tons of plutonium for nation's nuclear arsenal.
Its scientists, the nation's brightest, lived the Soviet dream: the
best food and wages the Kremlin could provide.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk-26 remains closed off from the world. But these days
it is an impoverished ward of the state, and a vexing worry for
Russian and American officials who fear Russia's best scientists
will leave for aspiring nuclear powers like Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov, 58, one of the city's top nuclear specialists, says he
is not leaving. He sometimes goes months without his meager salary,
and he and his neighbors recently endured a few weeks without heat.
Like the humblest Russian peasant, his wife, Nadezhda, helps make
ends meet by canning cabbages, cucumbers and tomatoes from the
garden at their dacha, and she cannot look back without a twinge of
regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better then,'' she said. ``The city was clean.
Everything was in abundance. There was no economic panic. We were
young and everything seemed beautiful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Sokolovs are stoical about the future, nobody can be
sure about the thousands of other specialists in Russia's 10
nuclear cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has become so concerned about the
tumbling morale of its top nuclear scientists that it has ordered
its security services to secretly monitor them, Russia's minister
of atomic energy said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Energy Department has pledged as much as $30
million in assistance through 1999 to start up new businesses in
the hope that the enterprises will be able to attract hundreds of
millions more in Western investment.
</P>
<P>
   But critics worry that the aid is too little to make a
difference. And with Russia's economy in crisis and investors
fleeing, attracting foreign investment is harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As winter begins creeping across the heartland, nuclear workers
have taken to the streets to demand back pay. Guards at nuclear
laboratories have abandoned their posts to forage for food. Power
shortages threaten to shut down electronic security systems
designed to safeguard stores of bomb-grade materials.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk-26 has endured its share of tribulations: a restive
workforce, months of unpaid wages and the temporary shutdown of its
lone nuclear reactor, which forced residents to endure the bitter
Siberian chill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in the nuclear closed cities is very close to
catastrophic,'' said Viktor Orlov, director of the Moscow-based
Center for Policy Studies and an expert on Russia's nuclear
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The armed guards at the checkpoint for Krasnoyarsk-26 provide a
sobering reminder to visitors that they are about to enter a state
within a state.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders must get the blessing of the Federal Security Service,
the heir to the KGB. Passports are inspected and, in the case of
foreigners, escorts provided.
</P>
<P>
   The residential heart of this city of seven square miles gives a
hint of its past glory. There is an artificial lake with three
beaches. Its movie theater, which used to receive first-run Soviet
films the day after they appeared in Moscow, displays an ad for the
American film ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more sports facilities than in most Russian cities of
this size, and a well-tended park, which features a statue of Lenin
staring vacantly into space. (It had been looking approvingly at
Stalin before Nikita Khrushchev launched his campaign to
de-Stalinize the nation and the dictator's statue was removed.)
</P>
<P>
   The train station that the city's scientists and engineers use
to go to work looks like a typical suburban platform, save for the
fact it is protected by armed interior ministry guards and serves
an electric train that heads straight into a fortified mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The subterranean complex at the other end of a three-mile-long
tunnel is a cavernous, multistory honeycomb of nuclear reactors,
plutonium laboratories, cafeterias and workshops _ some 3,500 rooms
in all.
</P>
<P>
   It is the mountain that persuaded Stalin and Lavrenty Beria, his
secret police chief, to build the complex in this remote stretch of
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The granite peak, they calculated, would shelter the complex
against an American nuclear strike, enabling the Soviet Union to
produce bomb-grade plutonium after a nuclear war. The nearby
Yenisei River, one of Siberia's mightiest, would cool the
plutonium-generating reactors.
</P>
<P>
   No efforts were spared to turn this cold war project into a
reality. The chief construction engineers were military officers.
Most of the brawn, however, was provided by slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the city's records, some 70,000 prisoners worked
here from 1950 to 1964, digging out the mountain _ excavating more
rock than was used to build the pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many were veterans, farmers and workers, who may have done
little more than steal a sack of potatoes to feed their families.
Several hundred foreigners were also brought here for forced labor,
including, the city's punctilious records show, prisoners from
Germany, Poland, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Spain, Finland and
``one Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Krasnoyarsk-26 are named after Soviet heros and
city founders, but the only trace of the prisoners is the pitiful
plot of overgrown and unmarked graves that straddles the border of
the town. Now, some graves have been defaced by local vandals while
others have been covered by a garage.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk-26's fall from grace has made its present troubles
harder for many of its residents to bear. Unlike Russia's sorry
factory towns or collective farms, this city got used to being a
pampered enclave for the nation's top engineering talent, and many
inhabitants cannot look back without a nagging sense of regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early days were full of enthusiasm,'' said Ivan
Mashkovtsev, a former KGB official who used to oversee security at
the nuclear complex.
</P>
<P>
   Its workforce earned 50 percent more than its counterparts
outside the city gates. Food was ample and there was no rationing
or lines. Vacations were generous: 36 work days a year and 48 days
for those who labored inside the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of national purpose was fortified by ironhanded
secrecy. For the first few years, none of the residents was allowed
to leave. Later, when travel within the Soviet Union was allowed,
the word ``plutonium'' was stripped from their vocabulary. If
anyone asked, they could say that they worked for an iron ore mine
or lived on a military base.
</P>
<P>
   There were no telephone lines connecting Krasnoyarsk-26 to
nearby cities and villages; the telephone lines used by the top
leadership ran straight to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Because the city was left off Soviet maps, residents called it
Krasnoyarsk-26, using the number on the post office box where their
mail was sent at the open city of Krasnoyarsk, 40 miles south.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk's plutonium industry did not stay secret for long.
According to Russian officials, American intelligence learned about
the reactors in the 1963, several years after its second reactor
began to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Krasnoyarsk-26's reactors kept churning away. According
to some Western estimates, they produced more than 40 tons of
bomb-grade plutonium, about one-third of the plutonium used to
build the Soviet arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   With the world awash in deadly plutonium, two of the three
reactors here have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining reactor provides heat for the city. It still
produces plutonium as a byproduct that is separated from the
reactor's nuclear waste and stored as a powder for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   To many, the loss of the secret city's cold war mission has been
a devastating psychological blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem is probably not the loss of material
wealth,'' Mashkovtsev said. ``The problem is the way people look at
the nuclear industry. People here feel like they are unneeded,
especially when they hear others say that everything they did was
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   For Valery Lebedev, the director of Krasnoyarsk-26's nuclear
operations and a veteran resident of the city, holding the complex
together is an increasingly daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 people still work at the nuclear complex. But it has
received only two-thirds of the government funds it was expecting
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices have increased but we cannot raise wages, because
we do not even pay people what they are supposed to be paid,''
Lebedev said. ``We try to do our best to pay something. If we don't
have money we give food.''
</P>
<P>
   The money crunch has taken its toll. Even keeping the lone
reactor running is not a simple proposition.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a budget shortfall delayed a shipment of uranium
fuel. Then workers in the radio-chemistry laboratory, where
plutonium is separated from the nuclear waste, mounted a brief
protest. The reactor was out of operation for weeks, leaving the
city without heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned when a person has to think all the time about
how to feed his family,'' Lebedev explained. ``That's not a good
time to carry out some important operations.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also affecting arms control efforts. The Russian
government has promised the United States it will convert the
Krasnoyarsk-26 reactor and two similar reactors at another closed
city, Tomsk-7, so that they no longer produce plutonium by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials said the conversion will almost certainly
have to be delayed because of budgetary and technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Without generous funds from Moscow, the city's character has
begun to change. It is quieter, greener and safer than most than
most Russian cities, but it is no longer walled off from the
problems of modern-day Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of funds has affected the city's medical services
which suspended all but emergency operations in August when
medicine and surgical gloves ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Like other scientists, Sokolov and his family have felt the
blow. They live in a cramped, but tidy apartment, crowded with
books and pictures of grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov, tall, lean and graced with an impish sense of humor,
relishes his work and his colleagues and regales guests with tales
of his trips through the still untamed taiga, the storied Siberian
wilderness that stretches north to the Arctic tundra.
</P>
<P>
   Their rewards for long years of service behind the barbed-wire
city limits, however, is a meager one. Sokolov's salary, which
sometimes has been delayed for months, is about $150 a month. His
wife, a chemist, has been paid more regularly, but only receives
$30 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Their salaries are supplemented by small pensions, granted in
recognition of their decades of toil. Each receives $37.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Their children have delivered their verdict on the city's
future. The Sokolovs' son works in the city, but their two
daughters, who received degrees in science, moved away years ago
and have no desire to return.
</P>
<P>
   Pensioners and laid-off workers have an even harder time.
</P>
<P>
   Valentina Mazurova worked as a construction engineer when
Krasnoyarsk-26 was a boomtown. A sturdy woman with an engaging
smile, she has given up her dreams of travel and supplements her
monthly pension by selling dried fruit in the outdoor market. On a
good day, she may earn $2.
</P>
<P>
   Others residents have turned to the world outside the wire for
work. Each weekday morning, several thousand pile into a caravan of
cars and buses that snakes its way to the city of Krasnoyarsk.
</P>
<P>
   Lebedev would like to see the secret city opened up. That, he
believes, would bring in new business and money and make the city
less dependent on the dying military sector.
</P>
<P>
   Few residents, however, agree. They see the barbed-wire fences
as a final barrier against the turmoil sweeping the land and want
to keep Krasnoyarsk-26 closed despite the economic costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stronger the crisis the more people want to live in
isolation,'' said the Andrei Katargin, the mayor of Zheleznogorsk,
the name of the residential area inside the fences.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the closed cities have become a heavy burden for
Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's atomic energy minister. Krasnoyarsk-26 is
just part of the problem. The director of the nuclear design center
Chelyabinsk-70 shot himself in 1996, as that closed city faltered
under the weight of unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
   Morale is so low that Adamov regularly lectures the authorities
in the nuclear cities not to pay plumbers and common laborers more
than nuclear scientists. The approaching winter threatens to make a
bad situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   Closing down the cities is not an option. They are still needed
to disassemble weapons and safeguard nuclear materials, and nobody
wants the scientists to be tempted to go abroad.
</P>
<P>
   As the cities deteriorated, Russian intelligence began the
secret monitoring of the top Russian scientists, whose
bomb-designing skills would be particularly valuable to an aspiring
nuclear power or to the United States, Adamov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call them sensitive professions,'' Adamov said. ``and we
know all these people by name. Even they don't know that they are
in this group. We make sure they are provided for.''

CONNECTICUT WOOS NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>

 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Trying to fine tune a massive redevelopment plan for
downtown Hartford, Conn., officials are pressuring New England
Patriots owner Robert Kraft to commit soon to relocating the
football team there, according to individuals familiar with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Talks have intensified over the last few days between Kraft and
Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who met for five hours Monday
and two hours Friday, in an effort to finalize a proposal for an
open-air stadium that would be shared with the University of
Connecticut's football team. UConn needs a larger facility to move
up to the Division 1-A category by 2002 and could apparently foot
some of the stadium's construction cost if the Patriots agree to
move there.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford option, if finalized, could be a cheaper and less
troublesome alternative for Kraft, who has pledged $220 million to
build a new stadium in Foxborough, Mass. but has been stymied by
the Massachusetts Legislature to win publicly financed improvements
around the site.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's legislature, meanwhile, has already approved $300
million to revitalize Hartford along the Connecticut River, some of
which could be used for stadium and infrastructure construction.
The federal government is throwing in another $7 million for the
effort, the state's two US Senators announced this week.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the recent flurry of activity between the
team and Connecticut officials is that the state needs to begin
making plans to move the city's steam plant located at the
crossroads of Interstates 84 and 91, where the new stadium would be
built. Utility executives met with Hartford Mayor Michael Peters on
Nov. 2 to talk about replacing the steam plant _ which state
officials said was an encouraging sign that the expensive and
complex process was moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy and at the time secret meetings between Kraft and
Rowland make it clear that a stadium proposal is gaining momentum
there as part of the huge housing, entertainment, retail and
convention center project at the riverfront Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman declined to comment Tuesday. But a key
civic leader pushing the downtown revitalization said a decision
needs to be made quickly on the stadium so as not to derail the
overall project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the Patriots) have an interest in us, we have a time frame
that we have to meet,'' Richard Fiondella, chairman and chief
executive of Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co., told the
Hartford Courant Tuesday. ``It'll either happen in the next three
to four months, or it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rowland was evasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a handful of people who are actually taking
part in the discussion,'' spokesman Dean Pagani said. ``Only a
handful of people know what's actually going on in the jury room.
Everyone else has to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they want to build a new stadium for UConn by
2002 that would seat at least 35,000 people. Drawing in the
Patriots would only require an expansion of that proposed facility
but it would reduce the cost to both the university and Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who has a cordial relationship with Connecticut officials
going back many years, flew directly from Buffalo, N.Y., where the
Patriots played the Bills on Sunday, to Hartford, where he
reportedly met Rowland at the Governor's Mansion before continuing
talks at an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   News of the meetings reverberated on Beacon Hill Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Governor Paul Cellucci headed to New Orleans for the National
Republican Governor's Association, he said he would press Rowland,
who is also expected to attend, on the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll ask him about it,'' Cellucci said. ``We have bills
pending but there has to be a willingness on the House's side to
try to find some common ground and deliver a bill that will make it
possible for the Patriots to stay here in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham struck a deal with Kraft
last February that would have spent $52 million on infrastructure
and $20 million for land around Foxborough Stadium, which Kraft
would pay $700,000 to lease back from the state each year. In
return, Kraft would have spent $220 million of his own money to
build a new facility.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would have cost taxpayers $2.3 million a year,
compared to $2.2 million a year for the original House bill that
offered just $52 million in just infrastructure in exchange for a
renovated stadium. The team generates about $10 million in state
tax revenue a year.

 KRASNOYARSK-26: provided for.''

<P>
   The atomic energy ministry's long-term plan is to cut the
nuclear workforce by as much as a third and create an equivalent
number of new jobs in the commercial sector. Of the three-quarter
of a million people who live in the closed cities, 125,000 work
directly in the nuclear enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the closed cities are like children,'' Adamov said.
``The gap between ordinary cities and the free market is quite big,
but the gap between people who lived in a closed city and a market
economy is enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are so high that the United States Energy Department
has forged an unusual collaboration with the atomic energy
ministry, its former archrival. It has earmarked $30 million
dollars to help launch new businesses, which might attract Western
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a small sum and the funds cannot even be disbursed
until Congress reviews the spending plan early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department is also planning to spend $200 million to
help Russia dispose of plutonium. That will also involve work in
the closed cities, though it is not clear exactly how those funds
will be spent and how much will go to American contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities were in trouble before, but now they are getting
desperate, said Kenneth Luongo, a former Energy Department official
and the head of the Russian-American National Security Advisory
Council, a private group that focuses on the problems of the closed
cities. ``What little economic progress there was is being erased
and serious action is required to prevent further deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   At Krasnoyarsk-26, Lebedev has not given up hope. His dream is
to transform his complex into a high-tech commercial center _ a
sort of Silicon Valley of Russia. He has tried one plan after to
try to lure business here but little has happened.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to assemble Samsung televisions collapsed after import
tariffs on electronic components were raised. He also drafted a
plan to make his city a tax-free zone for foreign investors. But
the government never acted.
</P>
<P>
   The complex is so desperate it would like to make money storing
nuclear waste. But Russian law forbids it from accepting nuclear
waste from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   These days Krasnoyarsk-26 is counting on the construction of a
$200 million factory to produce silicon for computer chips. The
Defense Enterprise Fund, a Pentagon-funded group that is trying to
help Russia convert its military industry to civilian production,
has paid for some of the planning. The Russian government has
already spent several million dollars to grow silicon crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk-26, however, still needs to line up major Western
investors. With Asia in a recession and the United States and
Europe possibly on the brink of a slowdown, persuading foreign
companies to sink hundreds of millions of dollars into a Siberian
nuclear city is harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As investors ponder their hand, Lebedev is weighed down by more
immediate worries. This summer, he sent his Moscow superiors a
blunt memo describing where this once-proud city was headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wage payments are three months behind schedule,'' he wrote.
``The social tension in the shops and factories has reached the
critical level, and its consequences are unpredictable.''

STOCK PRICES MIXED IN UNEVEN SESSION, DESPITE RATE CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Widely anticipated cuts in interest rates by the
Federal Reserve Board did not invigorate the stock market Tuesday.
Prices, which have rallied sharply the last six weeks, closed mixed
in moderate trading.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks moved lower early in the session, then jumped abruptly in
midafternoon after the Fed announced its third cut in the overnight
federal funds rate and second reduction in its discount rate in the
last seven weeks. But sellers emerged in the last hour of trading,
particularly in big, blue-chip issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell as much as 82
points in the morning and was up as much as 91 after the Fed's
announcement, closed down 24.97, or nearly 03. percent, at
8,986.28. Nearly all the average's decline resulted from a sharp
slide in Hewlett-Packard, which closed at 60 1/16, down 5 15/16.
Hewlett-Packard warned that first-quarter earnings might fall and
that sales in its 1999 fiscal year were not likely to meet
forecasts because of increased competition and weakness in Asia and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Most broader market indexes did better than the Dow. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.46, or 0.3 percent, to
1,139.32. And the Nasdaq composite index gained 16.84, or .09
percent, to 1,878.52. But the Russell 2000 index of mostly
small-capitalization stocks dipped 0.99 point, or a quarter of 1
percent, closing at 389.43.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come a very long way in a very short time,'' said Al
Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards, noting that since
Oct. 8 the Dow rose 21 percent; the S&AMP;P 500, 24 percent, and the
Nasdaq composite, 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was doing some consolidating last week and is
likely to be doing some more of that,'' he said. ``But I don't see
a lot of downside risk below 8,600 on the Dow. If there had been a
1-in-3 risk of a recession next year before the Fed started to cut
rates, it has been reduced to a risk of 1 in 10.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts in the federal funds rate and the discount rate pushed
those two rates to their lowest levels in four years and helped
lift prices of financial service and bank stocks, which have been
on the rise since the Fed began to cut rates in late September.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan and American Express, two Dow stocks, rose for the
second consecutive day. Morgan gained 3}, to 107\. American Express
rose 2 7/16, to 99]. BankAmerica rose 1 5/16, to 61 1/16, and Chase
Manhattan climbed 3 7/16, to 61 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks also gained. Merrill Lynch rose 3[, to 66|, and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter closed at 66|, up 2 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was sanguine. Richard Bernstein, chief
quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch, said Hewlett-Packard was
not likely to be the last company to issue a somber message on
earnings for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think that if you get Fed easing, you will get
earnings growth,'' he said. ``But we are in a period where earnings
growth is negative. That is something people have pretty much
ignored over the last six to seven weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   With interest rates at current levels, Bernstein said stocks
were between 10 and 20 percent above what he considered fair
valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Slumping crude oil prices, which fell to a 10-year low in London
and a 4-year low in New York, pushed down oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron fell 2{, to 80}. Exxon dropped 15/16, to 70 9/16. And
Mobil lost 11/16, to 71 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   With much fanfare, DaimlerChrysler, formed by the merger of
Daimler-Benz and Chrysler, introduced its shares on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday. But the stock ended lower, closing at
83~, down 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of Nasdaq included &QC; Amazon.com. Shares in the online
bookseller soared 22\, to 148{, after it said it had opened an
online video store to compete with Hollywood Entertainment's
Reel.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger high-technology companies that trade on the Nasdaq system
also moved higher. Microsoft gained 3 1/16, to 111~. Cisco Systems
rose 1 13/16, to 68}. And Intel closed at 108{, up 1|.
</P>
<P>
   K-Tel International was one of the session's biggest losers. The
seller of music, videos and other entertainment was notified by
Nasdaq that it had failed to meet the minimum tangible net asset
requirement for trading, and faced delisting. The stock tumbled 5|,
to 12.

LEONID METEOR SHOWERS ARRIVE, THOUGH NOT EXACTLY AS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The much-anticipated storm of Leonid meteors swept over Earth on
Tuesday, a bit ahead of schedule, leaving many sky watchers
disappointed but others dazzled by fireballs as bright as the full
moon.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonids, so named because they appear to come from the
constellation Leo, flash through the sky in large numbers every
year about this date, but once in about every 33 years the swarm is
often so dense that tens or hundreds of meteors are seen each hour.
</P>
<P>
   The last such storm was in 1966, and a good show was expected
this year. Another good Leonid display might occur a year from now,
astronomers have forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonid meteors, most of them smaller than grains of sand,
are fragments knocked loose from Comet 55P/Temple-Tuttle each time
it makes a close approach to the Sun every 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from regions that were in nighttime darkness Tuesday
during the peak of the meteor storm suggested wide variations in
the storm's apparent intensity. But nowhere did the reported rate
of meteor sightings greatly exceed 2,000 per hour _ barely
one-tenth the rate at which meteors hit the atmosphere during the
great 1966 Leonid storm.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of damage to any of the roughly
600 satellites orbiting the Earth that are used for communications,
military surveillance, climate and weather monitoring, astronomy
and navigation. The odds of any given satellite being hit by a
meteoroid were calculated as about one in a thousand _ a small risk
but one that caused some concern because of the high value of many
satellites. Satellite experts said that some damage might take days
to detect, but that satellites generally seemed to have escaped
disabling harm.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts that the Leonids would put on their best show over
Japan and China were only partly realized; according to news agency
reports, people in parts of Thailand saw many bright meteor trails,
while the view from Tokyo was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The meteor display was unexpectedly good over southern Europe,
and came several hours earlier than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge,
Mass., which is a worldwide clearinghouse for reports from
astronomers, said that observers at La Palma in the Canary Islands
saw about 2,000 meteors per hour at the peak. But observers in
Portugal counted only a few more than 300 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Marsden of the astrophysical observatory said the
Leonid display included an unusually high proportion of fireballs,
a few of which reached the brightness of the full moon during their
speedy crossing of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Interfax news agency reported that a meteorite weighing
several ounces was seen to land during the Leonid storm in front of
a car in the city of Rustavi in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But Marsden expressed doubt that the meteorite was part of the
storm. ``We sometimes see sporadic meteorites during these storms
that are not related to the main body of meteoroids,'' he said.
``This sounds like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Only very rarely is a meteoroid large enough and dense enough to
survive its fiery trip through the atmosphere and reach the ground.
Old records suggest, however, that as many as half a dozen people
(and one dog) may have been killed by meteors during the course of
human history. But there is ample geological evidence that huge
meteoroids have hit the Earth in the distant past, and probably
will again.

FIRST SIGHTING OF METEOR STORM LIVES UP TO EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of awestruck viewers throughout much of Asia and
elsewhere around the world were treated Tuesday to the most
spectacular meteor shower in 33 years, according to early reports.
</P>
<P>
   And to the relief of officials at satellite companies, space
agencies, and the military, the Leonid meteor storm appeared to
have spared the more than 600 satellites in orbit from the damage
that many had feared they might inflict.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports from scientists who had traveled to China,
Mongolia, Australia, or Japan for the event indicated that some
observers were counting more than 1,000 meteors an hour at the peak
of the display _ enough to qualify it as a true meteor storm,
rather than just a shower. One team in the Canary Islands _ halfway
around the world from the expected prime viewing area in Asia _
reported counting up to 2,000 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every location around the world that was graced with
clear skies early Tuesday _ unlike New England, which was solidly
clouded over _ apparently had peak meteor rates of 100 to 200 per
hour, more than a typical annual meteor shower produces.
</P>
<P>
   But those totals were still far less than in some past Leonid
storms, which occur every 33 years, and short of the most
optimistic expectations: up to 10,000 meteors per hour. Still, it
was not yet certain Tuesday when the peak of activity may have been
_ or even whether the storm had reached its peak.
</P>
<P>
   Two American research aircraft and one high-altitude balloon
were flying near Japan Tuesday to try to make unprecedented
observations of the meteors _ believed to be produced by particles
the size of sand grains shed by a comet called Tempel-Tuttle,
although some scientists say the particles may be larger bits of
very light, fluffy material.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Preliminary data gathered by these flying observatories are
not expected to be ready for release until late Wednesday or
Thursday, according to a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the excitement and elation from observers around the
world who braved cold nights to watch the action, satellite owners
and operators were relieved that no satellite appears to have been
damaged. Many had feared they might be, by the greatest flurry of
space junk to strike the Earth since satellites became commonplace
and crucial to communications, navigation, and weather monitoring.
The last great meteor storm was the Leonid peak in 1966, when for a
brief time sky-watchers in the Western United States saw more than
100,000 meteors in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``No spacecraft have been reported damaged as yet,'' said NASA
spokesman Donald Savage late Tuesday. And Eberhard Moebius, a
professor at the University of New Hampshire who developed a
particle detector for a research satellite called the Advanced
Composition Explorer, said that ``we can still see the real-time
solar wind data coming in'' from the satellite. That indicated that
the Advanced Composition Explorer, considered the most vulnerable
of all satellites because of its position and the sensitivity of
its instruments, appeared to have weathered the celestial storm
unscathed.

   Reports from many locations, including Europe, the Mideast,
Asia, and the Americas, all suggested that while the total number
of meteors seen was not as high as some had hoped, there were far
more very bright meteors _ called fireballs _ than anyone expected.
Fireballs are defined as meteors that outshine any star or planet
in the sky, and some of those reported Tuesday glowed brighter than
the full moon and left smoky trails that remained visible for
several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Some were so bright that even observers in cloudy locations were
treated to a rare spectacle. Stuart Atkinson, watching through
misty clouds in England, reported by e-mail that ``even in the
areas completely hidden by cloud there are flashes and bursts of
light, making the sky look like there's a WW2 artillery bombardment
going on, unbelievable, spectacular.''

   MNQABA, South Africa _ One would not expect, perhaps, that a
mild-mannered professor from Howard University would turn out to be
the Indiana Jones of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   One might have had an inkling three years ago, when he restored
an Ark of the Covenant to the Israelites _ the local branch _ after
finding it in the museum basement where police had dumped it,
letting its scroll of the Ten Commandments written in Xhosa gather
dust for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But now any doubts are dispelled, because he has just followed
that up by bringing the bones of the Prophetess back to her people.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he fulfilled two predictions made by Nonteta Bungu,
founding mother of the Church of the Prophetess Nonteta, which
still claims 1,000 adherents in the treeless, hut-dappled hills of
the Eastern Cape.
</P>
<P>
   Before she died in 1935 while unjustly imprisoned by the South
African authorities in an insane asylum, among the prophecies she
made, her followers say, were: ``I will return in a different
form,'' and ``Look to the Americans _ they will help you one day.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Robert Edgar, a 50-year-old professor of
African history at Howard, the historically black university in
Washington, came to uncover the bones of a long-dead religious
figure here is a triumphant tale of U.S.-South African cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   And her village's quest to get the new government to release her
body after the old government had refused for six decades to part
with it is a parable of change in South Africa, where black
historical figures are finally getting the monuments that English
and Afrikaner conquerors had long reserved for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The two stories culminated recently on a windswept hilltop here
in the village of her birth. As the girls' choir of Joe Slovo
Secondary School sang ``All Is Well'' and one of 600 mourners
blasted a last salute into the sky with his pistol, the polished
wood coffin bearing the skull, leg and arm bones of Nonteta sank
slowly into place beneath a fine new granite headstone. Sixty-three
years ago, she had been wrapped in a blanket and tossed atop the
coffin of a prisoner in an unmarked grave in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy,'' said Tobi Nokrawuzana, 91, who in 1927 walked
the 600 miles to Pretoria with 30 other church members to see their
leader one last time. ``This is what I have been praying for for so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   And Edgar expressed his delight that a mission begun, in a
roundabout way, on his first visit here as a graduate student in
1973 ``ended just the way I'd hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonteta Bungu was born about 1875 in the middle of a messianic
age for the Xhosa people, the tribes sandwiched on South Africa's
Indian Ocean coast between the imperialistic Zulus to the northeast
and the northward-moving whites.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the last Frontier War in 1852, the Xhosa had
virtually given up armed struggle. Their nation had been utterly
broken in 1857 by a 15-year-old prophetess, Nongqawuse, their Joan
of Arc, who convinced them that if they killed all their cattle and
burned their grain, an army of ancestors would rise from the sea to
destroy the English invaders. When the ghostly legions failed to
emerge, the starving people were forced to beg the settlers for
work.
</P>
<P>
   Nonteta did not find her calling until 1918, as the worldwide
influenza pandemic was decimating her people. During her own bouts
of fever, she dreamed that God was punishing the earth. On
recovering, she began to preach against alcohol, adultery and
pork-eating, and to insist that impoverished blacks unite because a
day of judgment was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Although her populist message was not anti-white, Edgar said,
she had the misfortune to be noticed by the government after the
Bulhoek Massacre of 1921. In that episode, government troops
marched on the squatter city of 3,000 Israelites, the followers of
the militant evangelist Enoch Mgijima, whose desperate land
seizures were supported by the fledgling African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After days of negotiations over eviction, the sides lined up
facing each other. Shots rang out, and the Israelites charged the
machine guns. Minutes later, one soldier had been speared and 183
Israelites were dead. The massacre horrified blacks and liberal
whites. The embarrassed government began cracking down on many
sects here.
</P>
<P>
   Nonteta was arrested and sent to a local asylum, her visions and
her habit of preaching while ``reading'' from her bare hands
ascribed to madness. When her followers kept marching to visit her
there she was transferred to faraway Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors at Weskoppies Asylum there admitted ``there is
no reason she should not be so discharged having regard only to her
mental condition,'' they agreed that she might cause trouble
outside and held her until she died in May 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Word did not reach her followers for two weeks, and when they
asked for the body, the government said it was buried and would
stay buried.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government considered the bodies even of
executed prisoners state property. Rumors that she was alive,
jailed on Robben Island, persisted among her followers until 1990,
when Nelson Mandela was freed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Edgar returned to a village where he had met some of
Nonteta's followers 25 years ago while researching a book on the
Israelites. (The Israelites, modeled on a black American church,
still have 15,000 members. In 1995, in the basement of a museum in
Grahamstown, Edgar found their wooden ark, captured by police in
1921.)
</P>
<P>
   As he wandered around, ``a woman suddenly shouted: `Bob Edgar!
You're Bob Edgar! But something has happened to you _ your beard is
white!''' he recalled the other day, laughing. ``Because of
Nonteta's prophecy _ `Look to the Americans' _ my visit back then
had become part of the oral tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Seeing how upset church elders still were, even decades later,
and suspecting that the new government would be sympathetic, he
began searching Pretoria burial records. At the Rebecca Street
Cemetery, he came across a ledger entry for ``Nonteto, age 62,''
buried in unmarked plot No. 99 in the African Paupers section on
May 22, 1935, after dying of stomach and liver cancer in the
Weskoppies Asylum. She was found.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who was moved enough to drive 10 hours to attend
the funeral the other day, bringing his 5-year-old son, was Coen
Nienaber, the University of Pretoria forensic archaeologist who
spent three days in July meticulously exhuming Plot 99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it's just another skeleton in another box and another
report to be filled out,'' said Nienaber, who normally digs up Iron
Age graves for archaeologists and shallow ones for police. ``This
one was special.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that the remaining bones were indeed Nonteta's.
They were those of a 5-foot-6 woman in her early 60s with signs of
advanced cancer, buried, as the records indicated, coffinless above
the coffin of a male prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   So, with about $5,000 from the provincial government, which is
eagerly hunting for nonwhite heroes to memorialize, her body was
brought back home.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar tried to give the family the credit, but Denver Webb, the
department's director of museums, waved that off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hadn't done the research, we'd have nothing,'' he said.
``My deputy is from that community, and he'd never even mentioned
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the Rev. Mzwandile Mabelu, current head of the church,
put it at the end of a long, song-filled service: ``I thank the
earth because Nonteta's remains are here today after being in her
so long. I thank your God of America because through your spirits,
Bob has been able to return her. And I thank you, Bob, and wish you
a good day. Because your task has been great indeed.''

EAPPENS, IN FILING, DECRY AU PAIR`S `REVISIONISM' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ British au pair Louise Woodward's conviction for
involuntary manslaughter in the shaking death of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen automatically entitles the baby's parents to
punitive damages from Woodward, the attorneys for the Eappens
argued in court papers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With a hearing scheduled for Thursday in federal court, lawyers
for the Eappens accuse Woodward of trying to rewrite history by
suggesting her criminal conviction is not sufficient grounds for a
punitive damage award.
</P>
<P>
   ``In what appears to be a campaign of revisionism, (Woodward)
bases her argument on the startling suggestion that the criminal
trial judge effectively acquitted her of criminal liability for
Matthew Eappen's death,'' the Eappens' lawyers, Fredric L. Ellis,
Edward D. Rapacki, Edward A. Broderick, and Edward C. Bassett Jr.
wrote in an 11-page reply to a memorandum filed last week by
Woodward's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court ... should reject (Woodward's) attempt to rescript
her criminal conviction,'' the lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's recently hired Boston lawyers have asked US District
Judge William G. Young to consider their claim that Woodward cannot
be sued for punitive damages _ which would be awarded on top of
compensatory damages _ because her conviction for involuntary
manslaughter did not include a finding that she had engaged in
``willful, wanton or reckless conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the Eappens argue that a manslaughter conviction
necessarily means that the defendant has been found guilty of such
conduct and Woodward's lawyers cannot relitigate that issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens are basing their suit against Woodward on the
portion of the state wrongful-death statute that permits punitive
damages if a defendant is found to have caused the death of another
due to ``willful, wanton or reckless conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   A Middlesex Superior Court jury originally convicted Woodward of
second-degree murder but Judge Hiller Zobel reduced the conviction
to involuntary manslaughter last November. He found that Woodward
had not acted out of malice _ a requirement for a murder conviction
_ but ``confusion, inexperience, frustration, immaturity and some
anger.'' He sentenced her to time served in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Zobel's reduced verdict was later upheld by the state Supreme
Judicial Court.

   WASHINGTON _ Smoking among American college students has
increased substantially in recent years, a national survey of about
15,000 students by the Harvard School of Public Health shows.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was released Tuesday at a news conference here
and which appears in the Nov. 18 issue of The Journal of the
American Medical Association, found increased rates of cigarette
smoking among all students regardless of age, sex, race, type of
college or region of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 28 percent of college students said in 1997 that
they had smoked in the last month, compared with 22 percent in a
similar survey in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the authors said, cigarette smoking among college
students fell in the 1970s and early 1980s and remained steady
until 1990, when the rate began to increase.
</P>
<P>
   This reflects a 32 percent rise in smoking by high school
students from 1991 to 1997, the authors said. They said they had no
conclusive evidence about why more young people were smoking, but
they suggested that it was a consequence of advertising aimed at
them by tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since those in college are less likely to smoke than their peers
who do not attend college, said one of the authors, Henry Wechsler,
a lecturer at the School of Public Health, the increase among
students ``signals great danger'' for the health of the next
generation of adults.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students are not heavy smokers, the study found.
Fewer than 12 percent of the smokers _ only 3 percent of all the
college students surveyed _ said they smoked a pack a day or more;
43 percent of the smokers said they did not smoke daily, and 45
percent said they smoked daily but less than a pack.
</P>
<P>
   Another author of the study, Dr. Nancy Rigotti, an assistant
professor at the Harvard Medical School, said that because so many
of the students were ``early in their cigarette-smoking habit,''
they would be receptive to cigarette-cessation programs at the
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that African-American and Asian students were
less likely to smoke than whites and that students at public
universities smoked more than those at private colleges.

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a very large
difference between Denver (no. 1) and Minnesota (2), and almost no
difference between Jacksonville (3) and Atlanta (4).

<P>
   L'ANSE DE'PRIEN NOIR, La. _ Alphonse (Bois Sec) Ardoin, 82, an
accordion player and farmer, is checking his hogs on a muggy,
mosquito-ripe autumn afternoon. ``Allez, cochons,'' Ardoin chants
as dragonflies dart above the hog pens. ``Allez.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking past his swaybacked barn, his dog, Sunshine, trailing
after, Ardoin says: ``Me? I got eight acres and three hogs.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he should add, a new album on Rounder Records, ``Allons
Danser,'' made with the Cajun band Balfa Toujours, which is led by
Christine Balfa, the daughter of Ardoin's friend the fiddler Dewey
Balfa, who died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The album is a heartfelt cry redolent of a time before radio and
television, traditional French music from South Louisiana powered
by Ardoin's bluesy, black Creole singing and accordion playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to me, having a new record out,'' says Ardoin,
who had not recorded in 20 years. ``But I play music to be with
other people. You need other people for the music to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is why Ms. Balfa and her husband, Dirk Powell,
also a member of Balfa Toujours, have driven the hour or so north
of Lafayette _ past fields of sugar cane and rice, past crawfish
farms, past cypress knees poking out of the bayous _ to Ardoin's
place here in Evangeline Parish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to playing with Bois Sec at least once a month,
just for fun,'' Ms. Balfa says.
</P>
<P>
   For Ardoin, Ms. Balfa, Powell and others in their community,
music has never been a career; it has meant living and breathing.
The vital French music of the region _ 22 parishes called Acadiana
_ hasn't been shunted to the museum, to be occasionally dusted off
and propped on a sterile stage.
</P>
<P>
   Cajun and black Creole music features fiddles and accordions
complemented by the haunting, high-pitched singing of French
lyrics; the main difference is that the Creole fiddler or singer is
bluesier than his Cajun brother.
</P>
<P>
   Zydeco takes the rural tradition of the black Creoles and
marries it to rhythm-and-blues, creating a louder, more urban dance
music in which the groove is all important.
</P>
<P>
   French music thrived here because of South Louisiana's
isolation, both physical and cultural. But what happened here is
not an isolated event. Often damned for its take-no-prisoners mass
culture, the United States has always found room for local, often
country, musics: the strong fiddling tradition that grew up around
Galax, Va.; the African-American fife-and-drum bands of Northern
Mississippi; the Mexican-American conjunto born along the
Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   And the omnivorous popular culture has never been shy about
borrowing (stealing?) from the locals, as Cajuns know. Hank
Williams's ``Jambalaya (On the Bayou)'' was a country hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Cajuns Jimmy C. Newman and Doug Kershaw made it to the Grand
Ole Opry with pale versions of their childhood music. As the fad
for all things Louisianan bloomed in the 1980s, Paul Simon dabbled
in the sounds of Acadiana and the 1987 movie ``The Big Easy''
featured a Cajun detective and a soundtrack of Louisiana music. And
isn't that a rowdy zydeco accordion heard on the occasional
Budweiser television commercial?
</P>
<P>
   But so what? South Louisiana's French-speaking culture has not
only survived the broader culture's disdain and lack of interest
(then annoying obsession) but has also reached the late 1990s
healthy and intact. No mean feat in these days of cultural
cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   And on this day it seems that Ardoin, Ms. Balfa and Powell are
celebrating that good fortune, doing their bit for cultural
renewal. The threesome play for a good two hours, Ms. Balfa on
guitar, Powell on fiddle and Ardoin, accordion balanced on his
right knee as his feet tap time: ``Donnez Mon Chapeau,'' ``Valse a
Canray,'' ``Duralde Ramble.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has played Carnegie Hall and has played worldwide,
it's understood that Ardoin is just as happy making homemade music
with his friends and family, maybe happier. He is a farmer who
plays music (and who has brought up 14 children), not a musician
who plays at farming. Yes, he received a National Heritage
Fellowship award in 1986, but in 1992 he was the grand marshal of
the Louisiana Swine Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Ardoin, who was born in the house next to his small farm, pauses
between songs. ``I could play day and night when I was young,'' he
says. ``But the last two days I've been cutting tall grass. My back
and arms hurt, and the mosquitoes were eating me, too.'' He laughs;
the music surges on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allons Danser'' grew out of Ms. Balfa and Powell's musical
get-togethers with Ardoin, whose last album, ``The Ardoin Family
Orchestra With Dewey Balfa: A Couple of Cajuns,'' had been made
with Ms. Balfa's father, whom he had known since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Balfa recalls that as they played at Ardoin's farm one day,
she said: ``Hey, you remember that record you did with Daddy? I
think it's time we turned it around and made `Bois Sec Ardoin With
Balfa Toujours.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Balfa says, ``And Bois Sec said, `Don't say that if you
don't mean it, no.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of his new album, Ardoin says, ``It still feels good to hear
yourself on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty thievery was crucial in Ardoin's learning how to play
accordion as a boy. ``These white boys I knew would steal an
accordion from their parents, and then we'd go sit by the canal and
I'd play,'' Ardoin remembers. He also used to pinch his brother
Houston's accordion, hide in the hayloft of the family barn and
practice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the time his brother found out, Ardoin played so well that
Houston gave him the instrument. ``My brother said: `I can't even
play one song. Here, you take it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that nickname? Ardoin didn't like working in the rain as a
boy, and he knew of a hollow tree where he could hide when he felt
the raindrops. That kind of tree was called ``bois sec,'' or dry
wood, and the name stuck.
</P>
<P>
   As Ardoin, Powell, 29, and Ms. Balfa, 30, jam in Ardoin's
kitchen, it's hard to believe that in the late 90s their music
still makes some in their community angry. But it is so. ``There
are people saying, `I can't believe Christine recorded with that
black man,''' Ms. Balfa says.
</P>
<P>
   Balfa Toujours had to grapple directly with questions of race
and ethnic identity last January when, on Martin Luther King Day,
they were dismissed from a job by a dance club in Basile, Ms.
Balfa's hometown, because of their friendship with Geno Delafose, a
black zydeco musician.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Balfa says the club's owner was worried that Delafose might
join her band onstage and offend his customers.
</P>
<P>
   Of her friendship with Delafose, Ms. Balfa says, ``It seems we
can share the stage together all around the country and the world,
yet we can't do it where we grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Balfa Toujours's run-in with racism is a haunting reminder of
what happened to Amede Ardoin, a cousin of Bois Sec's and one of
the region's most important and influential musicians, at a dance
in the early 40s. All Amede Ardoin did was wipe his sweat away with
a handkerchief given him by a Cajun woman. After the dance, he was
nearly beaten to death by white men enraged that a black man would
use a white woman's handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Reed, 55, a white accordion player who grew up on a farm
next to Bois Sec Ardoin's, finds such racism bewildering. ``When I
was a boy, we were color-blind,'' he says. ``We always just
considered ourselves to be poor people. Everybody used to go to the
country store in the afternoon after cutting rice. I used to play
harmonica while Bois Sec was playing. A lot of songs I play today
are his style.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the music would be at Ardoin's farm _ music, and
more. ``Bois Sec was always known for his boucherie,'' Reed says.
``He'd butcher pigs twice a year, and everyone was welcome, white
and black. There'd be boudin, cracklins, pork roast, andouille.''
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the front door of Ms. Balfa and Powell's house on
Bayou Teche in La Pointe, a button accordion _ ``made in
Louisiana'' _ sits on a bench as if waiting for the right player, a
bayou Excalibur. ``That belonged to my father,'' says Ms. Balfa of
Dewey Balfa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made out of cypress,'' Powell adds. ``It's light but
hard, and water doesn't affect it. This house is made of cypress.''
</P>
<P>
   As is, perhaps, Balfa's reputation. ``He's a constant presence
in our lives,'' Ms. Balfa says of her father. ``We're trying to
carry on his message. I always feel his presence when we play.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 Balfa, the fiddling son of a sharecropper who also drove
a school bus and sold insurance, was a late replacement at that
year's folk music festival in Newport, R.I. A local newspaper,
however, considered Balfa's invitation to play Cajun music an
embarrassment, especially to those trying to put their country
roots behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy had never seen more than 200 people together at one time
before,'' Ms. Balfa says. ``And 17,000 people gave him a standing
ovation after the first song. And that changed his life. He became
a strong advocate for Cajun culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell adds: ``We still get cards and letters from people who
have Dewey dreams. As Christine's cousin, Courtney Granger, got
ready to record his first album, he had a dream that Dewey was in
the room with him, and that Dewey had touched his heart, and he
cried as he told us the story. That gave Courtney such a sense of
emotion when he went to make his record.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Balfa Toujours honors the past _ and the past is
never past in Louisiana _ it is careful not to turn its music into
mere waltzing with ghosts. ``Music has to be a part of people's
lives,'' Ms. Balfa says. ``And as a musician, you have to make that
connection with people when you play.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's latest album, ``La Pointe,'' recorded in Ms. Balfa
and Powell's living room and kitchen, mixes traditional songs like
``Pa Janvier'' and ``Le Reel de Courville'' with their own
compositions. ``We're always looking deeper into the tradition,
into the center of it rather than outside it,'' Powell says.
``There's so much richness in it as far as writing original
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, an old-time musician whose family and musical roots
stretch back to the mountains of Eastern Kentucky, has found
Louisiana's French-speaking culture congenial. ``Almost everyone
has been accepting,'' he says. ``People are flattered that someone
from outside wants to play their music. In clubs it's never an
issue. The only test is whether you're playing it right or not.
People will come up and ask for a song that was recorded 40 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how did Powell learn all those songs? ``I listened a lot,
and I used to play the accordion while I was driving,'' he says.
``When I was dating Christine, I'd travel between Maryland and
Louisiana, and I'd drive with my knees on those long interstate
stretches.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Louisiana, music is still passed generation to
generation, a quilt made up of fiddles, guitars and accordions.
Especially accordions: Powell estimates that there are more than 50
accordion makers in the region. In the Basile-Mamou area, Ardoins
and Balfas have been making music since at least the 19th century;
this year three generations each of Balfas and Ardoins performed
together in London.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two high school students lead the youngest generation. Courtney
Granger (who plays fiddle) is completing his first album with the
help of Balfa Toujours, while Chris Ardoin, whose grandfather is
Bois Sec, leads a popular zydeco band, Double Clutchin', which also
features his brother Sean. On the band's 1997 album, ``Gon' Be Jus'
Fine,'' it recorded songs by both Bois Sec and Amede Ardoin.
</P>
<P>
   In the album's liner notes, Chris's father, Lawrence, says
Double Clutchin' remade the 1930 recording of ``Amede Two Step''
into ``Ardoin Two Step.'' ``Chris plays it just like Amede.'' his
father said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a steamy Louisiana Saturday night, and at the Bourques
Club, a dance hall in Lewisburg (pop. 300). The accordion player
Horace Trahan and the Ossun Express hold court. Couples of all ages
glide, waltz and two-step to the hard-driving accordion, the
sobbing fiddle. ``Of course the old people dance,'' Ms. Balfa says.
``It's what they do. It keeps them young.''
</P>
<P>
   Dancing is a birthright here, a good time on a Saturday night
after a hard week's work: dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud
music. Red tablecloths (cigarette-scarred, patched and repatched)
disguise plank tables, the jukebox offers tunes by the Louisiana
Aces, the Balfa Brothers and Le Band Passpartout, and for tonight
anyway Bud is indeed the King of Beers.
</P>
<P>
   The band, helped by Ms. Balfa and Powell (Trahan is a carpenter
who sometimes works on their house), is lighted by one naked,
bug-sticky bulb; after playing for four hours, each band member
will be paid $50 to $70.
</P>
<P>
   As the Ossun Express finishes a song, someone shouts, ``Un autre
'tit bout!'' (``Another little bit!'') The dancer liked the song so
much that he wants to dance to it a little longer. ``In this music
the line between the band and the audience is almost nonexistent,''
Powell says. ``You can go up and meet the biggest star in this
music and shake his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominick Cross, editor and publisher of In Tune, a Lafayette
magazine that covers South Louisiana music, says (in between
dancing): ``The music is so important here. In Lafayette there are
15 or so clubs, and every town has a dance hall. It's part of the
culture. There's a lack of influence from white-bread America.
People here don't talk about culture. They live it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, two French friends of Ms. Balfa and Powell's show up. The
friends, Bruno Catheline and Michel Salmon, have a Cajun band back
home in Brittany, so Trahan, as he would for any local player,
invites them to sit in with his band.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the world shrinks, centuries fall away: the original
Acadians left Brittany and Normandy and arrived in what became Nova
Scotia in 1604, taking their music with them. By the mid-1700s,
many Acadians had arrived in Louisiana, Ms. Balfa's descendants
included, exiled by the British. Now, two musicians from Brittany
are playing Cajun music in a Louisiana dance hall, music whose
roots are buried deep in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Cajun music,'' says Catheline, who plays and builds
accordions. ``And to play with the Cajuns is magnificent. I stayed
up all night after I heard Dewey Balfa play in Brittany in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Trahan introduces his guests, then cries: ``Allons, danser!'' A
touch of Dewey Balfa in his voice, a Bois Sec Ardoin quiver.
</P>
<P>
   The dance floor fills. Ghosts waltz. The tradition lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Complaints of misconduct by the office of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr are being examined or reviewed by several government
and non-government offices. Among them are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Justice Department has been examining the origins of
Starr's investigation of President Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky and is deciding whether to investigate a complaint,
first raised by one of Ms. Lewinsky's early lawyers, that Starr's
office improperly pressured Ms. Lewinsky into cooperating at the
outset of the inquiry last January.
</P>
<P>
   _ The department has already reviewed and dismissed a number of
accusations raised by Clinton's lawyers and others. It found no
evidence that Starr acted unethically or withheld pertinent
information about the timing of his initial contacts with
witnesses, like Linda Tripp, when he asked the department to expand
his inquiry to include the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   _ An inquiry is under way into charges that Starr's deputies
improperly disclosed federal grand jury information to news
organizations. U.S. District Court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,
who has been been presiding over the federal grand jury examining
the Lewinsky matter, named John Kern, a senior District of Columbia
judge, to conduct the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   _ An examination of whether David Hale, an important Whitewater
witness, received payments from Clinton's political adversaries is
being conducted by a special investigator, Michael Shaheen, a
former Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the District of Columbia Bar Association is
carrying out a review of whether prosecutors on Starr's staff
violated provisions of the ethics code of the District bar. The
nature of the accusations has not been disclosed.

EAPPENS, IN FILING, DECRY AU PAIR`S `REVISIONISM' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ British au pair Louise Woodward's conviction for
involuntary manslaughter in the shaking death of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen automatically entitles the baby's parents to
punitive damages from Woodward, the attorneys for the Eappens
argued in court papers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With a hearing scheduled for Thursday in federal court, lawyers
for the Eappens accuse Woodward of trying to rewrite history by
suggesting her criminal conviction is not sufficient grounds for a
punitive damage award.
</P>
<P>
   ``In what appears to be a campaign of revisionism, (Woodward)
bases her argument on the startling suggestion that the criminal
trial judge effectively acquitted her of criminal liability for
Matthew Eappen's death,'' the Eappens' lawyers, Fredric L. Ellis,
Edward D. Rapacki, Edward A. Broderick, and Edward C. Bassett Jr.
wrote in an 11-page reply to a memorandum filed last week by
Woodward's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court ... should reject (Woodward's) attempt to rescript
her criminal conviction,'' the lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's recently hired Boston lawyers have asked US District
Judge William G. Young to consider their claim that Woodward cannot
be sued for punitive damages _ which would be awarded on top of
compensatory damages _ because her conviction for involuntary
manslaughter did not include a finding that she had engaged in
``willful, wanton or reckless conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the Eappens argue that a manslaughter conviction
necessarily means that the defendant has been found guilty of such
conduct and Woodward's lawyers cannot relitigate that issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens are basing their suit against Woodward on the
portion of the state wrongful-death statute that permits punitive
damages if a defendant is found to have caused the death of another
due to ``willful, wanton or reckless conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   A Middlesex Superior Court jury originally convicted Woodward of
second-degree murder but Judge Hiller Zobel reduced the conviction
to involuntary manslaughter last November. He found that Woodward

_ but ``confusion, inexperience, frustration, immaturity and some
anger.'' He sentenced her to time served in jail.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Parliament Tuesday approved the
American-brokered peace plan by a significant majority, reflecting
the widespread, pragmatic acceptance here of partitioning the Land
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose Likud Party was created
to defend the Jewish homeland from territorial compromise, turned
his back on the party's founding credo. In so doing, he won a far
more substantial victory, with 75 yea votes, than the Labor Party,
with its slim margin of support, won for the original
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord signed in Oslo in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But he did so only with the Labor opposition's support. Only
half of his coalition government voted for the agreement; two of
his Cabinet members voted against it; and five ministers, all Likud
members, walked out of the chambers, refusing to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are carried today on the hands of the opposition, like in
a hammock,'' said Eli Goldschmidt, a Labor member of Parliament.
``Onward to peace!''
</P>
<P>
   The decision had the makings of a watershed moment, but it did
not feel like one here Tuesday. After nearly five years of
on-and-off again negotiations, of terrorism, political
assassinations and changes in leadership, caution has tempered the
enthusiasm _ and the hostility _ that many once felt toward the
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   There was no clapping or cheering when the tally was announced _
75 for, 19 against, and 9 abstentions. Sixteen members did not
vote. Shortly before midnight the session fizzled out.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Netanyahu set the tone: ``This is not a day of
jubilation,''he said. He presented his land-for-security plan to
the Parliament as a painful and unavoidable reality, and it was
accepted with resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have expected the prime minister to speak of joy,''
Walid Sadek, an Israeli Arab member of Parliament, said in the
midafternoon. ``To say, `There's peace, happiness, a new wind
blowing through the region.' But what we heard were words of
arrogance and of humiliation for the Palestinian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadek addressed an all-but-empty chamber, typical of the two
days of discussion leading up to the final hours of full
attendance, and full rowdiness. The speaker of the Parliament, Dan
Tichon, pronounced the decision the most difficult in the country's
50 years. But, for two days, the floor of the Parliament was
generally occupied only by the speaker and the next in line to
speak. ``People, or should I say, chairs,'' one member began.
</P>
<P>
   And even as they concluded that they would vote for the ``path
of peace,'' most members from both left and right maligned the
agreement. It was a bad plan, they said, or a dangerously delayed
one, or hollow _ no longer buoyed by the Israeli-Palestinian trust
that led to the original accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say with certainty that this agreement could have been
obtained a year ago,'' said David Levy, the former foreign
minister, who resigned early this year, partly out of frustration
with stagnation in the peace effort. ``And we wouldn't be left, so
many of us, with a bitter taste in our mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   Zvi Weinberg, a low-profile member of Yisrael Baaliya, the
Russian immigrant party, was one of the few to voice unequivocal
support for Netanyahu. ``The agreement surrenders a large part of
our historical heritage, but I have no doubt the prime minister is
walking on the right path,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, there were few kind words for Netanyahu, and the
attacks from his own right wing carried the sharpest bite. Benny
Begin, a Likud member of Parliament, said the prime minister was
acting ``like a dishrag.'' Hanan Porat, a member of the National
Religious Party, mocked Netanyahu for ``running whining to his
American nanny'' whenever he had a disagreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kleiner, leader of the right-wing Land of Israel front
in the Parliament, pronounced Netanyahu finished and the Likud
Party irrelevant. ``They broke the ideological backbone of their
movement,'' he said. ``The whole existence of Likud was based on
keeping the Land of Israel undivided. Now what is the difference
between Likud and Labor?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no serious talk of bringing down Netanyahu's
government, especially after the prime minister strengthened a
tenuous hold on power early this week by persuading the National
Religious Party _ all of whose parliament members voted against the
accord Tuesday night _ to remain in his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The far-right Moledet Party attached a vote of no-confidence in
the government to the vote on the agreement, but it did not appear
to change the individual members' determination to cast their votes
either for or against the peace effort. It was not the intention of
Labor Party members to give Netanyahu a vote of confidence, but
they essentially did.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he presented the agreement to the Parliament, Netanyahu
sounded a grim note. ``As opposed to others, we don't have any
illusions,'' the prime minister said Monday. ``We don't believe in
a new Middle East, and we did not return from Wye with a promise
that a new sun would shine or that there would be a sudden end to
100 years of conflict,'' he said, referring to the site of the
peace talks, Wye Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace memorandum, signed at the White House last
month, the Israelis agreed to turn over 13 percent of the West Bank
to Palestinian civil control, and to transfer an additional 14
percent, already under civil control, to full Palestinian control.
In exchange, the Palestinians were to clamp down on terrorism and
incitement, confiscate illegal weapons, reduce their oversized
police force and ``reaffirm'' the elimination from the Palestinian
Covenant of clauses calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial accord reached in Oslo, Israel began a process
of withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and major Palestinian cities on
the West Bank. With this further withdrawal, Israel will have
turned over 40 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Cabinet, which attached conditions to its approval of
the agreement last week, the Parliament appeared to have approved
the Hebrew translation of the agreement unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, a Cabinet meeting was scheduled for Thursday
to approve the handover of the first chunk of the West Bank to be
transferred to the Palestinians since the troubled city of Hebron
was divided early last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet's approval was expected, and Israeli withdrawal
could start the same day, from the area between Jenin and Nablus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday, Netanyahu had threatened to suspend the withdrawal
until The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, disavowed remarks he
made at a weekend political rally, in which he threatened an
uprising, complete with rifles, if the peace agreement stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Arafat professed his commitment to diplomacy and
peace, not violence. And, ending the latest standoff between them,
Netanyahu later accepted his comments as an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday he gave the guns speech; today it wasn't exactly the
roses speech, but it's progress,'' Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Parliament was in session, leaders of the Jewish
settlers met with army and government officials to see the final
maps of the first withdrawal. On them, the West Bank looked like a
dalmatian, with splotches of color representing Palestinian
territory scattered across the strip of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maps have a lot of yellow and brown, but on the ground,
God forbid, there will be a lot of red,'' said Rehavam Zeevi, head
of the far-right Moledet Party.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the inevitability of the withdrawal, the settlers
raised 117 specific objections to the maps, and the officials
accepted half and promised to make changes. The maps showed that
six settlements will lie within 500 yards of a
Palestinian-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I fight for the government not to give anything,
but we must be realists,'' said Pinchas Wallerstein, a leader of
the settlers. ``So we concentrate on the maps, and the practical
questions, like will this electric line now run through a
Palestinian area, where it can be cut?''

JAPAN'S DEBT RATING CUT, RAISING DOUBTS ABOUT STIMULUS PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By STEPHANIE STROM  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The decision by Moody's Investors Service to downgrade
Japan's pristine credit rating has called into question whether
more than $800 billion worth of government financial stimulants
aimed at reversing the country's prolonged economic decline has all
been for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The step by Moody's, announced Tuesday, reflected increased
skepticism by the credit-rating service about the effectiveness of
the Japanese government's bureaucratic regulatory and political
systems after eight years of economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be difficult for the present government or possible
future governments to balance conflicting policy objectives of the
long run to achieve a durable recovery in economic growth, to
relieve the fiscal burden of the government and to restore solvency
and vitality to the financial sector,'' Moody's said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's credit rating is now lower than that of Italy, an
economy with an irregular history and debt levels exceeding its
annual output. At the new level of Aa1, down from triple-A, it has
become the second member of the Group of Seven major economies with
a credit rating below the top level. Canada's debt is rated lower
by Moody's, at Aa2.
</P>
<P>
   Although the near-term effects of the move were not totally
clear, Japanese leaders denounced it. Given Japan's big trade
surplus, impressive savings rate and vast foreign-currency
reserves, no one really thinks Japan will default on its credit
obligations. ``Japanese government bonds are the most trusted in
the world,'' Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declared.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa noted that Japan would issue 35 trillion yen in
government bonds, roughly $287 billion worth at current exchange
rates, by the end of the fiscal year on March 31, and that they
were selling well.
</P>
<P>
   Eisuke Sakakibara, the prominent vice finance minister for
international affairs, suggested that the downgrading raised more
questions about Moody's credibility than Japan's. ``Personally, I
think if Moody's continues to behave like that, the market
evaluation of Moody's will go down,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the ratings agencies have been criticized for
failing to spot the poor credit quality at the core of Asia's
problems, and several commentators dismissed the statement
accompanying the downgrading as little more than a recitation of
views expressed by others.
</P>
<P>
   Another agency, Fitch, lowered its ratings of Japanese sovereign
debt to AA-plus in September. And although Takahira Ogawa, director
of sovereign ratings at Standard &AMP; Poor's in Singapore, told the
Dow Jones news service on Tuesday that he saw no immediate reason
to re-examine its triple-A rating for Japan, he said the agency was
monitoring the effects of recent policies to determine its future
direction on Japanese debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if the information they're relating or the
concerns they're raising haven't been discounted already in the
markets,'' said Craig Chudler of Salomon Smith Barney. ``The danger
is not the direct impact of the rating _ so many other things are
going on that are affecting the cost of financing,'' but that the
government ``is responding in a way that says it's not getting the
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets seemed unfazed by Moody's decision. The
price of the benchmark 10-year government bond fell only slightly
Tuesday _ enough to drive the yield up by 0.015 percent, to 0.86
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Nikkei stock index finished marginally lower,
inching back 15.27 points, or just over a tenth of 1 per cent, to
14,413.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist with Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter here, said the cost of a downgrading from triple-A to Aa1
was minimal, noting that the lowering of Canada's debt to Aa2 in
1995 had little effect on that economy or Canadian corporations.
``There is not a doubt in anyone's mind that Japan might default on
an obligation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and analysts said that Tuesday's downgrading had
largely been factored into markets after Moody's announced in July
that it was considering lowering Japan's sovereign debt rating. How
the downgrading will affect Japan's battered corporations was open
to interpretation. Most analysts said that Moody's and other
agencies had already lowered corporate ratings, but a few worried
that Tuesday's action would set off a further round of reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Many regarded Moody's decision in August to lower Toyota's
triple-A rating to Aa1 as laying the groundwork for cutting Japan's
sovereign debt rating on Tuesday. Toyota, with $20 billion in cash
at its disposal and very little debt, is one of the bluest
blue-chip companies in the world, and few found Moody's rationale
for lowering its ratings convincing.
</P>
<P>
   The downgrading came the day after Japan announced one of the
biggest economic-stimulus packages on record, pledging to spend
$195 billion to invigorate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   That brought total Japanese stimulus spending to more than $800
billion since 1992, which was clearly on Moody's mind.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report from the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development, Japan's public debt, including that of
regional governments, was 93.1 percent of the nation's gross
domestic product in 1997, compared with 120.3 percent in Italy,
98.8 percent in Canada and 64 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, such fiscal stimulus packages have not led to
sustained economic growth, but rather are increasing domestic debt
substantially,'' Moody's said. ``It is uncertain whether future
packages would provide a self-sustaining boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody's also cited the demands of cleaning up the debt-laden
banking system, on which the government is spending $208 billion in
a separate rescue package. The agency said Japanese banks were
``much weaker than financial systems in other advanced industrial
countries.''

HOUSTON BISHOP ELECTED CONFERENCE PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's Catholic bishops elected Houston
Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza as their conference president, and
selected their first black as vice president Tuesday, choosing
continuity and change in a difficult church era.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza, 67 and a Beaumont, Texas, native known for social
justice work, becomes the first conference president from a
Southern diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, 50, of Belleville, Ill. _ a protege of
the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, who was famous for
building bridges in a factionalized church _ was elected conference
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He becomes the first African-American chosen for that post, and
traditionally would be nominated for the presidency at the end of
Fiorenza's three-year term. Gregory said he hopes to serve the
whole church, and wants to bring Midwest qualities to national
Catholic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good,'' Fiorenza said as photographers snapped
pictures of him. ``Not excitement so much as being able to take
advantage of the opportunity to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for being a principled leader committed to service and
social justice, Fiorenza is quiet, preferring to work behind the
scenes. He is the son of a Sicilian immigrant. He has never
forgotten the hard times of his youth, nor the pivotal experience
of marching for racial justice in Selma, Ala., in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Fiorenza was a ``conspicuous collar in the crowd,''
said the Rev. William Lawson of Houston, a longtime friend and
fellow social activist. As bishop, Fiorenza has remained ``just as
stubborn an advocate for the underclasses,'' Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza and Gregory move into their new positions Thursday.
They were elected on a day when the bishops' conference, the
American church's top policy-makers, urged their 60 million-member
flock to apply Catholic teaching to daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics are called to defend the poor and work for justice,
the bishops said in the pastoral reflection, ``Everyday
Christianity: To Hunger and Thirst for Justice.'' Later, they
earmarked $400,000 for emergency aid to victims of Hurricane Mitch
in Honduras and Nicaragua. They are considering setting aside other
funds for long-range rebuilding in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are both practical applications of our being in
solidarity with the human family,'' Fiorenza said, ``particularly
when the human family is under great stress, in the midst of great
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be understood, faith must be applied to daily life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must continue to put before our people that if you really
want to be a Christian and live Christianity as a person of God, it
has to move from Sunday to every day of the week and affect us in
our work, family life and recreation,'' Fiorenza said. ``That's the
real challenge to do away with the dichotomy between what we
believe and how we live.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the president's contest, Fiorenza won by a simple majority,
garnering 30 more votes than necessary to win. He took 164 of the
265 votes in a contest against nine other bishops.
</P>
<P>
   While serving years as conference president, he will continue as
bishop to the 1.2 million Catholics in the Diocese of
Galveston-Houston. He will be the conference's 11th president,
succeeding Bishop Anthony M. Pilla of Cleveland. Like Fiorenza, he
is viewed as a moderating voice in church life.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory, the vice president, was elected from the candidates
remaining after the president's election. He has gained high marks
for his leadership in Belleville, a diocese marred by a spate of
cases of priestly sexual abuse when he became its bishop in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of 14 black bishops serving in five U.S. dioceses.
About 5 percent of the American church is black. In Houston, Bishop
Curtis Guillory serves as auxiliary bishop to African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He was excited at Fiorenza's election, calling it ``a sense of
coming of age'' for the diocese, a multicultural region that has
grown to be the nation's ninth largest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza became Houston's bishop in 1984. Educated in Beaumont,
he graduated from St. Mary's Seminary in La Porte, now in Houston.
He was ordained in 1954. He held various pastoral assignments in
Houston, including administrator of Sacred Heart Co-Cathedral in
downtown and was the diocese's chancellor when named bishop of San
Angelo in West Texas in 1979. He also has served as chairman of of
the bishops' $11.5 million anti-poverty program, the Catholic
Campaign for Human Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took to that position like a duck takes to water,'' said
Cardinal William Keeler of Baltimore, Fiorenza's friend for 20
years. ``He has such a great sympathy for what that effort tries to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   As conference vice president during the past three years,
Fiorenza has gleaned the insights, committee experience and
negotiating skills needed to be its president, his colleagues said.
In that role, he will represent the American church in word and
deed. He will often be the first bishop quoted on significant
issues and will intercede in Rome for the American church.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Michael Sheehan of Sante Fe, N.M., a long time
friend, said Fiorenza's even-tempered disposition complements his
leadership skills. Sheehan, formerly bishop of Lubbock, has known
him for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has grown in his ability to deal with extreme personalities
and extreme movements within the church,'' Sheehan said. ``He
doesn't have a lot of patience for extremism because he's very much
of a moderate person in his living and in his thinking. But he's
grown in his ability to appreciate and deal with the extreme left
and the extreme right.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the bishops increasingly must balance opposing viewpoints
as part of a multicultural, worldwide church. Pope John Paul II
stresses traditional church teaching, including an all-male
celibate priesthood. American Catholics range from liberals
favoring ordaining married men to conservatives who want to return
to celebrating Mass in Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Electing Fiorenza and Gregory shows that the bishops remain
committed to social justice, analysts said, noting the conference's
past opposition to capital punishment and the nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bishops are still concerned about the poor and the
underprivileged. They want to have a high profile on those two
issues,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese of New York, author of a book
on the bishops' conference.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Gregory holds a doctoral degree in sacred liturgy, Reese
said he is highly qualified. ``He's exactly the kind of leader
they're looking for. On the other hand, he is a sign that the
Catholic Church wants to be inclusive and is not just a white
European church.''

 &HT;    Part 4: Surviving with Guilt
 &HT;    (EDS: THIS IS THE FOURTH INSTALLMENT IN THE SERIES, ``9 Minutes
and 20 Seconds,'' by Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Gary
M. Pomerantz. If you are interested in the series and need resends,
please call CoxNet at (404) 526-5456. THE STORY SO FAR: Three years
ago, ASA Flight 529 crashed near Carrollton, Ga. with 29 people
aboard. Days one and two of the series reconstructed the crash and
the rescue effort. Day three told of the different paths taken by
two survivors given a second chance.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the rush to escape the fire consuming the broken
fuselage, five passengers saw the man who had been in seat 5A. He
was trapped and unresponsive.
</P>
<P>
   They had to make a quick decision: Do I stop to help this man,
or do I flee? Each survivor's choice would long weigh on his
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Other passengers had trampled the man, perhaps not noticing him
beneath the fallen luggage and torn plane pieces.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane had skidded across a Carroll County, Ga. hayfield,
the 10-row fuselage had broken apart. The rear section rolled on
its right side, throwing the man across the aisle and onto the
right windows. His 6-foot-4 frame lay between seats and overhead
compartments, his head near an opening ripped in the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   That opening was the only escape for 14 passengers in the
cluttered back section. A few got out quickly, but those in back
needed longer. Sixty seconds and more.
</P>
<P>
   Too long.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel pouring from the ruptured right tank puddled and caught a
spark. The opening filled with flames, a blue-orange veil through
which passengers could make out only the blurred sky, and then not
even that. The plane's metal skin burned at 1,800 degrees, an
apocalyptic heat.
</P>
<P>
   A line formed and a shout came. ``You have to go through the
fire! Just go! Go! Go!'' With no room for a running start,
passengers could only lunge through the veil, unsure what they'd
find on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The five passengers came upon the man from 5A only seconds
apart: three young men first, then two Virginia deputy sheriffs.
</P>
<P>
   In a spontaneous act, the three young men _ Alan Barrington,
Kevin Bubier and David Schneider _ stopped to help him. They
cleared debris away, tugged at him and called out to him. Schneider
recognized him as a colleague from work; the others knew him only
as someone in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   His blue-jean shorts, they would all remember. One would recall
seeing the man's eyes closed; the others thought they were open but
vacant. One spotted a small bleeding wound on his forehead. Another
remembered his gray hair, brushed to the side. The man did not
respond to their shouts.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a few moments, the fire found new fuel. The three
men felt a jolt in the fuselage and heard screams outside.
</P>
<P>
   Now they chose self-preservation, leaning into the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia deputies _ Charles Barton, a law enforcement lifer,
and his young colleague, Tod Thompson _ were the last to arrive at
the fiery opening. Barton spoke to the man lying near the opening.
Then he leaped, disappearing into the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the flames, fearful they would melt his face,
Thompson heard the man from 5A call out: ``You've got to help me
out!''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling the heat, Thompson replied in a rising voice, ``You've
got to get out!'' Then, holding an overnight bag in front of his
face, Thompson followed Barton into the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Flames snake-licked Thompson for a split second before he ran 15
feet into the hayfield. Seeing green grass, he fell and rolled. The
flames, almost miraculously, had only singed his arms.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, he saw the man from 5A, 62-year-old business
consultant Jim Kennedy, step outside the fuselage. Flames consumed
Kennedy as he rocked backward, as if in slow motion, and fell.
Kennedy crawled through the flames. He made it 15 feet outside the
fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   In a few moments, flight attendant Robin Fech came to him there.
He rolled slowly on his back, energy dissipating, his body
discolored and swollen. Fech slammed her vest against his
midsection to put out lingering flames. Within a few minutes,
Kennedy died in that spot, his hands and knees locked in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home to Virginia, Maine and Roswell, Ga., Schneider,
Bubier and Barrington heard friends and family say they'd been
touched by God, somehow chosen to survive.
</P>
<P>
   But their own thoughts were darker, as if from a fevered dream:
What if I really was a coward? Why did I live when others died? Why
didn't I do more to help?
</P>
<P>
   A haunting, debilitating survivor's guilt grew from their belief
that they might have done more to save Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Layered into Thompson's response was the death of Charles
Barton, his 57-year-old friend and role model. The young deputy
returned home convinced he'd broken the lawman's code: ``Don't come
back without your partner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hayfield, Barton was lying in a smoky heap 30 feet from
the fuselage. Rushing to him, Thompson crouched over a man who
didn't resemble the one he'd seen minutes earlier: His hair,
eyebrows and clothes were gone, his breaths labored.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said, ``We're going to get you out of here! Hang on!''
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurts,'' Barton said, his voice barely audible. ``Man,
this hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to reassure his friend, Thompson searched for a soft,
smooth spot on Barton's body to place his hand. He saw only charred
skin. Finally, he gently touched Barton's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't push so hard there,'' Barton said, wincing.
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon, in a West Georgia hospital, Barton asked
to see Thompson. Doctors only allowed the young deputy to walk past
the open door to Barton's room.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Barton was transferred to the burn unit of
Atlanta's Grady Hospital, and Thompson followed. Told that only
family members could enter Barton's room, Thompson pleaded, ``I'm
the only family he's got here!''
</P>
<P>
   So he put on a scrub suit and saw his friend's disfigured face
and an array of tubes pumping fluids into him. Only hours from
death, Barton was unconscious, but Thompson called out to him in
his thoughts: I'm here with you, buddy!
</P>
<P>
   Emotional aftershocks struck these four survivors hardest in the
days that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights after the crash, Alan Barrington, the 35-year-old
human resources manager, felt his conscience stalking him.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his kitchen table in Roswell about 10 p.m., his
dinner growing cold, his wife on the phone across the room,
Barrington thought about those who died in the crash: people he did
not know but might have saved. That included Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   He'd spotted Kennedy in the fuselage, eyes closed, beneath
debris. He'd reached to him and said, ``Get up!''
</P>
<P>
   But then Barrington was distracted by another passenger, who was
dangling from a seat belt above, screaming. In the confusion,
Barrington reached to help the dangling man, then forgot Kennedy,
leaving him behind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, realizing funerals were only a day away, Barrington's
thoughts took him to the grave sites of Kennedy and the others.
</P>
<P>
   Did you do everything you could to help my father/my mother/my
son?
</P>
<P>
   He imagined a grieving family asking him this question.
Barrington thought, Unless you died in the attempt, you did not try
hard enough. He heard himself say aloud, ``I'm alive,'' and so the
answer had to be, No, I didn't do everything I could have done.
</P>
<P>
   This admission brought tears and sobs. He fell from his chair to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   As his four young children slept upstairs, thankful for his
existence, Barrington cried for more than an hour. His wife,
Beverly, finally reached his mother by phone in Texas and pressed
the receiver to his ear. From the kitchen floor, Barrington's sobs
went quiet as he heard his mother's prayers.
</P>
<P>
   David Schneider, wearing a bandage on his right hand, came to a
small, lush Connecticut town to attend the wake of his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider had known Kennedy only by face and reputation. The
28-year-old engineer had intended to introduce himself to Kennedy
when their flight arrived in Gulfport, where their company was
fabricating gates to control the flow of the Ohio River. But in a
twisting of metal and fate, Schneider met Kennedy for the first
time inside the burning fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four nights after the crash, Schneider stood at the funeral
home before Kennedy's widow and eight grown children. He introduced
himself, said he had been on the fateful flight and might have been
the last person to speak to Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Softly, he asked, ``Do you want me to tell you about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kennedy's voice cracked. Yes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Jim,'' Schneider said. ``I tried to pick him up.'' The
Kennedy children craned their necks to listen. ``Jim! Jim Kennedy!
C'mon, we've got to get out of here!'' Schneider said he heard a
small explosion and screams. The fire had intensified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have tried to carry him out.'' Schneider shook
his head and tears came. ``I'm sorry. I hope he didn't die because
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kennedy put her hand on Schneider's shoulder. She
mentioned the autopsy. Though it said the cause of death was
``thermal burns,'' no soot was found in her husband's breathing
passage. Maybe he wasn't breathing when the flames got him, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the facts and witness accounts were not in yet. But
hearing this, Schneider thought, He didn't blink at me. His eyes
didn't move. That's why he didn't get up! He was already dead!
</P>
<P>
   Schneider felt astonishing relief. He was thankful Kennedy had
not died in anguish and that his own inability to help the man
hadn't caused his death.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, Kevin Bubier, a 37-year-old shipyard worker, suffered
nightmares about fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bubier saw it in his dreams: a holocaust, hotter than anything
he'd ever known, surrounding him. He awoke in a fright and then his
terror worsened, for flames still threatened him even with his eyes
open.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmares returned Bubier to the man near the fuselage
opening.
</P>
<P>
   Bubier and Schneider had propped up Kennedy. And for a moment,
Bubier held Kennedy's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bubier had noticed blood on Kennedy's forehead and a faraway
look in his eyes. Then flames roared into the open space, creating
the image in his nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   He lunged through those flames but later would remain unclear
about one detail: Was he still holding Kennedy's hand when he
lunged, or had he let go?
</P>
<P>
   In northern Virginia the day after Kennedy's wake, a procession
of law enforcement cars stretched along a country road toward
Leesburg, blue lights flashing, en route to the memorial service
for Charles Barton.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Tod Thompson felt all eyes upon him. He thought people
blamed him for Barton's death, and the 33-year-old deputy took
their stares to say, How can you come back when Charlie didn't?
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's wife, Pam, also sensed stares. But she believed
people were looking at her husband not because he came back alone,
but because he came back at all.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson took it hard. He worried that people would talk. Just
being there shamed him.
</P>
<P>
   Spring 1998
</P>
<P>
   Outside, rain falls on Newtown, Conn., and in Nancy Kennedy's
front yard, a maple tree's leaves, brilliant red, stir in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   A widow of nearly three years, she is sitting in a cozy living
room with daughters Meg and Maddy, recalling Schneider's appearance
at the wake. ``Dave Schneider kept asking for our forgiveness,''
she says. She shakes her head. By reaching out to her husband,
Nancy Kennedy says, Schneider ``gave us a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been married to James Gerard Kennedy (Jim to friends,
Gerry to family) for 37 years; they had seven daughters and a son.
He gave them playful nicknames, including Moopie, Be-so (as in
``How can you be so cute?), Haymouse, Genie Beanie and Handsome
Harry Backstage. He so impressed them, they thought the Kennedy
half-dollar had been named in his honor. He had a slew of
grandchildren, who called him Poppy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the rain falls, they remember stories.
</P>
<P>
   Like those long-ago rides to Sunday Mass in the Volkswagen
Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy: ``We used to get the whole family into a little
Volkswagen.''
</P>
<P>
   Meg: ``Three in the luggage well, three on the seat, two on
laps, and you, Mom, would hold the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   And those Sunday afternoon grab bags that he filled with candy.
He would call for his kids to line up. And now, recalling those
moments, Nancy, Meg and Maddy sing out his call: ``Youngest to
oldest, oldest to youngest, middle to ends!''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kennedy, a small woman with a coarse smoker's voice, was a
junior at Fordham University when they married; he had graduated
from Niagara University. His professional career would be varied,
and they would move a lot.
</P>
<P>
   A jock, fit, trim and tall, Kennedy drove himself hard and knew
the value of a buck; he proudly duct-taped his running shoes so
they'd last longer. Because he often said, ``My wants are many, my
needs are few,'' his kids called him Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Atlanta after the crash to claim her husband's body,
Nancy Kennedy saw a newspaper photo of Barrington with his family.
She thought that if her husband had seen Barrington with his four
young children, he would have said, ``Let him live and I'll go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she gets angry at fate. Smoking cigarettes on the
porch, she has stared at the distant hills and gotten angry at her
husband for dying. She was so angry at Atlanta, since his last
flight took off from there, she refused to watch the 1996 Olympics
on television.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an affirming perspective to the crash, Nancy
Kennedy says. That several passengers thought to stop and tried to
help her husband ``says a tremendous amount about the human
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I would have responded if tested,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to get too truthful, but I would've high-tailed right
out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   These four survivors have Jim Kennedy as their common bond.
Returning home after the crash, they discovered a new uneasiness in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the office of the Loudoun County, Va., Sheriff's
Department, Thompson saw a portrait of Barton staring back at him
each day in the foyer.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider waited for a divine answer about what was intended for
him next. The stress of Bubier's job in the Maine shipyards, once
challenging, now overwhelmed him. Barrington, overcome by a
spiritual imperative, no longer aspired to become vice president of
human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four, Thompson's reaction to the death of Jim Kennedy has
been the most analytical, what might be expected from a law officer
and former military policeman. Yet, in a visceral way, he still
feels guilty for the loss of his partner, though he could have done
nothing to save him.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was the only survivor among the six passengers in the
last two rows. A soft-spoken Midwesterner, raised on a farm in
Renwick, Iowa (population: 287), Thompson did not seek
psychological counseling in the immediate aftermath of the crash,
unlike the three others. But his wife, Pam, says they ``talked and
talked'' about the crash and she believes their talks were
therapeutic.
</P>
<P>
   The crash's effects on her husband, she says, have been subtle.
``Tod has always been laid back, but with work now, he takes an
even more relaxed attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He agrees. ``I cherish life more,'' he says. Back at work after
the crash, Thompson stood outside an open window of a home where a
man with a knife had barricaded himself after raping a woman. The
man shouted to Thompson, ``You're going to have to kill me!''
Thompson replied calmly, ``No, I don't think I'm going to do
that.'' They talked more, and finally the man gave himself up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his modest home on a dirt road in northern Virginia,
Thompson lies on a couch with his daughter, Rachel, playing upon
his chest. Rachel in April 1997 became the first child born to an
ASA survivor. ``God had a purpose for Tod staying on earth _ to be
a dad,'' a friend told Pam Thompson. Their second child is due in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has thought often about the moment Kennedy called out
to him. Barton spoke to Kennedy in words he couldn't make out, then
lunged into the flames. Then Thompson did just as Barton had done.
Thompson believes that at that moment he thought, ``The best thing
for me to do is to show (Kennedy) which way I was going. And that's
what Charlie did for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thompson has wondered if he did enough for Kennedy: ``I
want to feel I did that. But there is a moment that comes over me
that I don't feel that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he says, carrying Kennedy out ``would have slowed me
down. ... It would have been double suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about Barton every day, especially at the sheriff's
office, triggering a troubling response: ``Going into the building,
seeing Charlie's old friends, the people he worked real close with,
just puts me uneasy.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Barton's close friends, Investigator Eddie Fant, says
Thompson once was a reminder of Barton's death. But no more: ``Now
it's not always that I see Tod and miss Charlie. Now I see Tod and
I'm just glad he's alive.'' Fant still keeps Barton's picture over
his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Thompson says, he hides his uneasiness at the office
by thinking about something else.
</P>
<P>
   To make it easier, Thompson works outside the office whenever he
can.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Thompson and Schneider, Bubier has difficulty recreating
the moment. It seems he'd rather not remember it, and talking about
it is hard.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally does, he talks for two hours. But when his
retelling comes to Kennedy in the fuselage, his voice catches.
``Just give me a second,'' Bubier says.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, in a Maine restaurant, Bubier still is uneasy
discussing Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a touchy subject,'' he says. He'd rather not talk in a
restaurant. He'll talk back at home, ``in case I don't quite get
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it will be quiet over there, and it will just be us.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash changed him, Bubier says. His job at the Bath Iron
Works wasn't the same. Nothing was. His concentration and desire
were gone. He sought simpler pleasures: training trotting horses,
for instance, a favorite pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Bubier asked for a demotion, from assistant dockmaster
supervising a large staff to electrician responsible for no one's
work but his own. His boss suggested Bubier give up the horses to
improve his performance at work. Bubier, seeing the Maalox on his
boss' desk, replied, ``You don't get it, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   To lessen his stress, he took the demotion and went back to the
tools. But even then, tension and an emptiness prevailed. Several
times he drove to work, pulled into the parking lot and suffered an
anxiety attack.
</P>
<P>
   He felt he needed to be home with his wife, Christine. So he'd
head back home, and as soon as he got on Route 1, his tears would
dry up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing back here?'' Christine would say. ``I've
just got to be home,'' he'd reply.
</P>
<P>
   Talking with a psychologist _ about the crash and his guilt _
helped. So did anti-depressants.
</P>
<P>
   He wonders why he has struggled so: ``I know people who went to
Vietnam and saw horror upon horror upon horror, and they are
leading what I call normal lives. I mean, I saw death. I saw
horrible death ... but I got to go away from it after one day. They
had to go back and do it again and again and again. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to find justification for why I shouldn't be
able to just get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, months after the crash, he tried to imagine a silver
lining. He thought about the money he might get from a legal
settlement, and for an instant he relished how it might make him
happier.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, his lawyer called to say Sonya Fetterman, the
37-year-old mother of three from Texas, had died, the 10th and
final fatality of the crash. Bubier chided himself: There, you
S.O.B.! That'll teach you for thinking good things!
</P>
<P>
   Bubier has been on a medical leave from his job since last
winter, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and is
unsure if he'll return. ``I'm OK as long as I know that I can be
home and around my family,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He is building a house near his hometown of Greene, Maine, where
Bubiers date back for generations and where his 21-year-old
daughter lives with her husband and infant daughter, Bubier's first
grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Bubier's new two-story home sits on a lovely 24-acre green
space, a river running through it. There's room for a barn and the
trotting horses he has purchased and trains with his father, a
veteran on the Maine circuit. It's a pastime Bubier would like to
transform into a moneymaking career.
</P>
<P>
   Here, where his past and future are rooted, Bubier speaks more
easily about Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy serves as a symbol of his internal struggles. Bubier
says he does not recall letting go of Kennedy's hand when he lunged
into the flames. ``It's probably the worst feeling of the whole
thing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He stares into the distance, trying to imagine the man from 5A.
Suddenly he recalls his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the guy have shorts on?'' he asks. Yes, Kennedy wore
blue-jean shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I remember seeing bare legs under the (seat)
cushions. That's weird. I never really thought of that until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he remembers Kennedy's sneakers. ``And I remember white
sports socks. They might even have had a red stripe on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubier shakes his head. ``I remember that better than his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you'd like to go under hypnosis to see if you could
figure it out. But that might be even worse of a nightmare than
you'd want to deal with, know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, told that Nancy Kennedy has expressed her gratitude to him
for ``touching my husband'' in that frantic moment, Bubier's eyes
fill with tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I don't need any thanks, that's for sure,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider felt cleansed after attending Kennedy's wake. Over the
next 18 months, with the help of a priest, he came to terms with
his emotions about the crash. Yet he still isn't fully satisfied;
he struggles with the unanswered questions about the deeper meaning
of his own survival.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation in his condo in Centreville, Va., Schneider
demonstrates his movements after the plane skidded to a stop: He
unstraps his imaginary seat belt, takes a couple of steps across
his living room, bends to help an imaginary Kennedy, then acts out
a leap into the flames, toward his sofa. ``About 12 seconds,'' he
surmises.
</P>
<P>
   He is surprised to learn that other survivors struggle still
over Kennedy. ``I thought I was the only one that had an issue with
him,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He is even more surprised to learn, two and a half years after
the crash, that Kennedy made it outside the fuselage. ``I've got to
live with what I did,'' Schneider says. ``I know I made every
effort. ... If he would have moved or reacted to me, I would've
tried to get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he says, ``Maybe there's fate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, a lifelong Catholic, went to see a priest after the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   He had waited for changes to come over him, reasoning that God
had saved him for a reason. But he came to a realization: ``I don't
feel like I'm much different.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider had half expected to quit his job to become ... what?
A doctor? Later, after he left his company, he joined another
construction engineering firm. Not the job change, or epiphany, he
had expected.
</P>
<P>
   His priest told him, ``Maybe God was there and helped you or
maybe He didn't help you. No one knows that but God.'' Schneider
told his priest of Kennedy and of his own remorse and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``God understands you want to save yourself,'' the priest told
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did I live and the guy next to me died?'' Schneider asked.
``Does this mean I was saved for a reason?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have been or you might not have been,'' the priest
answered. The reason, he said, might become apparent ``tomorrow or
it might not happen until you are 78.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or it might not happen at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider told himself, ``I just have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Cobb County restaurant a week after the crash, a waitress
approached Barrington. He noticed her belt loops. Suddenly he was
hit with an image of a man on fire. At the crash site, Barrington
had flipped that man, using his belt loops. Now he sat blank-faced
until the image passed. ``The waitress probably thought I was a
dummy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At home in Roswell, Barrington noticed how often fire appears on
TV. Each time he saw it, he tensed or left the room. His
10-year-old son once threw himself in front of the TV to keep him
from seeing flames. Barrington began wearing a baseball cap to pull
over his eyes whenever fire showed up on his living room screen.
</P>
<P>
   He has thought of Kennedy and how the plight of another
passenger distracted him from helping Kennedy. ``It's hard to
explain to someone unless they have been in that situation,''
Barrington says. ``How can you forget someone mortally injured at
your feet? But you can do it. I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrington's guilt took about six months to fall away. In time,
he decided he had done the best he could at the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   As his guilt receded, his faith emerged stronger than before.
Reviewing his life, it seemed as if he had been programmed for
this.
</P>
<P>
   Years before, Barrington had attended Christ Unlimited Bible
School in Kansas City. There he listened to speakers who had
endured tragedies before finding strength in Christianity.
Barrington felt an urge then to become such a speaker, and even
prayed that God give him a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the triage area in the hayfield, looking at the
burning fuselage a dozen years after his Bible school days, he'd
thought about this. Finally, he had a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Barrington left his personnel job at Service Merchandise in the
summer of 1997, two years after the crash. Freed to do so by his
financial settlement with the propeller company, Barrington created
a one-man nondenominational ministry. He calls it the Driving Force
Ministry; it consists primarily of public speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crash, Barrington has told his story at churches and
schools. A central theme is second chances. He has written about
the crash for Christian magazines. He has tapes of his speech to
sell, and he is writing a Christian handbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like God wants me to do this ministry,'' he says, but
adds, ``I'm not sure how I'm going to support myself four or five
years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared on the ``Sally Jesse Raphael Show'' with other
``miracle survivors,'' including a man from the Oklahoma City
bombing. This year, he and his family moved back to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   As a public speaker, Barrington gestures with his hands and
walks as he talks; he speaks passionately of God, second chances
and ``the many miracles I experienced that day.'' Even so, his
wife, Beverly, fears that if the relatives of those who died in the
crash heard him, they might say, ``We never got our second
chance.'' She adds, ``Maybe I'm too pessimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely don't have all the answers or pretend to,''
Barrington says.
</P>
<P>
   But he says he knows who does: ``I do believe you can have a
peace about it and that God is in control.''

INTERNATIONAL FUROR FOLLOWS GORE REMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ A row kindled by Vice President Al
Gore's provocative statement of support for reformers here and
across Asia blazed even higher as nations rebuked Gore for his
blunt lecturing and Malaysia accused him of inciting violence.
</P>
<P>
   The mounting diplomatic furor over Gore's call for democracy as
a prerequesite for economic rebirth on Monday _ and his support for
the ``reformasi'' movement championed by the jailed nemesis of
Malaysia's prime minister _ threatens to derail any progress made
at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that ends
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The summit of 21 economies _ including nations with political
systems as diverse as communist Vietnam, post-communist Russia, the
United States and the sultanate of Brunei _ was envisaged as a
forum for sealing a free-trade agreement and launching an Asian
recovery plan. Instead, Gore's comments polarized members and
overshadowed discussion of economic packages.
</P>
<P>
   The eclipsing of an economic agenda by a strong political
message could have repercussions for the unity and future
effectiveness of APEC. In Asia, leaders rarely publicly discuss
each other's embarrassing political matters, opting instead to talk
behind closed doors _ or even to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, opposition leaders and rights activists here suggested
Tuesday that Gore's well-intentioned, but self-righteous-sounding
message might backfire. If Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad succeeds in portraying the United States as scheming to
topple his government, he could galvanize nationalists. Worse
still, he could use Gore's encouragement of protesters as an excuse
for a further crackdown on dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi Tuesday denounced
``incitement by the US government to lawlessness by certain
elements...to use undemocratic means in order to overthrow a
constitutionally elected government.'' Malaysia will ``hold the US
accountable'' for any violence.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia doesn't appreciate ``sanctimonious sermonizing from any
foreign quarter, especially the United States _ a country which is
known to have committed gross violations of human rights,'' he
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear why the White House decided to have Gore make such
blunt comments rather than exert behind-the-scenes pressure on
human rights as it has done with other nations, such as China. It
could be a calculated strategy of good cop/bad cop that would allow
President Clinton, who stayed home to attend to the Iraqi crisis,
to keep pressing Malaysia backstage in future. Gore, Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright and US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky all took very hard-line positions here on human rights
and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several countries _ including traditional US allies _
distanced themselves from or admonished Gore's confrontational
style.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's newspapers on Wednesday led with headlines such as:
``AL GORED!'' ``Chorus of Outrage over Veep's Gross Interference.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian Prime Minister John Howard said it was not the
``Australian way'' to tell others what to do. ``You don't
necessarily achieve a desirable outcome by constantly hectoring
other nations. ... We believe in an open, democratic system ... We
also recognize different countries have different views.''
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, whose nation hosts
next year's summit, said Gore's ``megaphone diplomacy'' was
threatening APEC.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine President Joseph Estrada was the only APEC leader to
publicly support Gore. ``It was a very beautiful speech,'' said
Estrada, who on Monday met the wife of Mahathir's jailed
ex-protege, Anwar Ibrahim, against the wishes of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more surprising than the split among heads of state was
the discomfort Tuesday within the local activist community sparked
by Gore's remarks. Many worried Mahathir could now galvanize his
supporters by denouncing domestic reformists as stooges of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Leading opposition leader Lim Kit Siang said Gore has disturbed
``a hornet's nest. ... There is the feeling of national
embarrassment that a foreign leader should be talking about the
need for democratic change ... on our own soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandra Muzaffar, president of the locally-based International
Movement for a Just World, complained that ``Gore's comment will be
exploited to the hilt by those who have been saying that there is a
CIA plot to destabilize the country and overthrow Dr. Mahathir
Mohamad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, a protest by more than 500 people occurred
outside a mosque about a mile from a dinner thrown by Mahathir for
heads of state. Demonstrators sang ``reformasi'' to the tune of
``When the Saints Come Marching In'' and cheered, but were unable
to march to the dinner because a dozen police riot trucks blocked
the way. Despite worries that Gore's speech could incite violence,
protesters dispersed peacefully.

COMMENTARY: STARR'S SECRET HELPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Sally Quinn. As soon as she published her landmark
Washington Post article about why Washington insiders despise Bill
Clinton's trashy morals, other, no doubt envious Washington
insiders had the gall to question her morality. ``Sally's had a
very interesting sex life of her own,'' says Charles Peters, the
editor of The Washington Monthly, in this week's New York magazine,
though he didn't produce any tapes to back up his claim. Some
capital refugees, of whom I'm one, remain incredulous when anyone
mentions the phrase ``interesting sex life'' and Washington in the
same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   To fault Ms. Quinn or the other righteous Washingtonians she
quotes for hypocrisy about sex is itself a form of hypocrisy.
Washington insiders are entitled to keep their extramarital affairs
private, even if they don't feel others are. The real smoking gun
in Ms. Quinn's essay, far more intriguing on impeachment-hearing
eve than all the moral pieties, involves not sex but the law, and
her judgment of Kenneth Starr, not Clinton. ``Ken Starr is not seen
by many Washington insiders as an out-of-control prudish
crusader,'' Ms. Quinn wrote. ``Starr is a Washington insider,
too,'' with ``a reputation as a fair and honest judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinn did not say whether Starr's reputation for fairness
stems from his dismissal of a $2 million libel judgment against her
own paper; that case wasn't mentioned in her piece. But she did
make it clear that her affection for Starr was common among the
``more than 100'' insiders she interviewed, many of them
journalists. And that raises a serious question: After all the talk
of a right-wing conspiracy fueled by Richard Mellon Scaife to bring
down Bill Clinton, and a left-wing conspiracy fueled by James
Carville to defame Bill Clinton's accusers, might Ms. Quinn have
inadvertently unmasked a third, previously unremarked conspiracy?
Was there a bipartisan conspiracy by Washington insiders to give a
free journalistic pass to their fellow club member Starr?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the evidence keeps piling up that Washington media
insiders were as blind to Starr's adventures this year as they have
been to the anti-impeachment sentiments of ``the American people.''
There has been far more detailed coverage of the dead-end ``talking
points'' than of the independent counsel's alleged 24 illegal leaks
(under federal investigation since June), or of his deputies'
strong-arm efforts to prevent Monica Lewinsky from calling her
lawyer when she was apprehended in January, or of his exact
relationship to that dulcet-toned human wire Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the country, not all the press lives in Georgetown.
Washington outsiders, some of them too lowly even to appear on
``The Beltway Boys,'' have helped pursue the stories the Quinn
co-conspirators have ignored. The latest example is the writer
Renata Adler, who in the December Vanity Fair raises still more
doubts about Starr's insistence that he didn't hear from Ms. Tripp
until Jan. 12 _ and therefore could not have been in earlier
collusion with that selfless patriot and the Paula Jones legal team
to ambush the president in a perjury trap.
</P>
<P>
   By exhuming a 1994 FBI report (as well as Alfonse D'Amato's
now-forgotten Whitewater hearing transcripts), Ms. Adler found that
Ms. Tripp had contacts with the independent counsel office, both
under Starr and his predecessor, Robert Fiske, as far back as 1994,
to push murder theories about Vincent Foster (among other matters).
This history casts doubts not only on Ms. Tripp's supposedly
``apolitical'' motives to betray her friend, but also on the
veracity of her grand jury testimony this year, when she swore she
``had never even thought about the independent counsel in (her)
wildest dreams'' while taping Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adler uncovered much else left unreported by the Beltway
gang, too, including out-of-chronology sequences on the Tripp tapes
that cast further doubt on their integrity. On a lighter note, Ms.
Adler also discovered that Starr had redacted vulgar synonyms for
excrement in his published Monica encyclopedia _ but, inexplicably,
not those for penis. This may be the only bizarre inconsistency in
the independent counsel's behavior this year that we can hope
investigators of the investigator will leave unexplored.

RETURNING U.N. INSPECTORS FACE LESS THAN CORDIAL GREETING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ As U.N. weapons inspectors prepared Tuesday to
resume their work in Iraq, they were greeted with fresh
denunciations in the official Iraqi press despite Iraq's new pledge
to demonstrate full cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been intended primarily for domestic consumption,
but it also showed that Iraq is hardly ready to roll out a welcome
mat.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 of the inspectors returned to Baghdad Tuesday
morning after they pulled out last week in anticipation of an
attack, and they expressed the hope that Iraq would indeed make
good on its promise to allow them to conduct unfettered work. The
last time Iraq permitted U.N. inspectors to conduct anything more
than monitoring operations was in early August.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the clearest clue about the Iraqi attitude may have
been the newspaper headline that taunted the head of the inspection
commission, Richard Butler, as a ``Mad Dog.'' As the inspectors
arrived on a U.N. C-130 plane on a flight from Bahrain to an air
base outside the Iraqi capital, a U.N. spokeswoman, Caroline Cross,
offered a forecast that was carefully guarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to a professional and productive
relationship with the Iraqi authorities over the next few days,''
Ms. Cross said, ``and, you know, time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors were not scheduled to resume work until Wednesday
morning, and even then, U.N. officials say, it will almost
certainly be at least several days before they undertake the kinds
of intrusive inspections that have aroused Iraq's ire in the past,
and which the Iraqi government banned on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cross said the inspectors hoped to return to the field ``as
soon as possible.'' But she said that more pressing priorities for
inspectors would be to test communication equipment and otherwise
re-establish the infrastructure they abandoned when Iraq decided on
Oct. 31 to cut off cooperation altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arab governments have done little more than express relief
since Clinton decided over the weekend to call off an attack and
accept Iraq's promise to resume cooperation with the inspectors.
Some Arab commentators have remained sharply critical of Iraq for
taking the confrontational stand that provoked the latest crisis, a
stance that left Baghdad without tangible support from any of its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam erred in the timing of his decision to halt cooperation
with the international inspectors for good, and so had to back
down,'' Abdelazim Hammad, an Egyptian columnist, wrote on Monday in
the semiofficial daily Al Ahram. ``One hopes this climbdown will be
the start of the Iraqi regime's reaching the age of maturity, and
learning when to advance and when to retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, other leading Arab voices have warned that
the tough American response to Iraq and the renewed threats of
military attack could ultimately rebound against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Washington may consider to be a humiliation of the Iraqi
leadership will be sold in Baghdad as a victory, on the argument
that the rug has been pulled from beneath the feet of the Americans
who are forever seeking an opportunity to wage aggression against
Iraq,'' Salameh Ne'mat wrote in the Saudi-owned Al Hayat.

 &HT;    Republicans have opportunity to make history with leadershipBy
Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ House Republicans will decide today whether Newt
Gingrich's planned exit has sated their appetite for change.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will elect their leaders for the next Congress, and
they have a chance to place the first woman and the first
African-American in top positions.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's decision not to run again leaves Rep. Robert
Livingston of Louisiana as the lone candidate for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Another Georgian, Rep. John Linder, is in a fight to keep his
job as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
which recruits candidates and raises campaign money. Rep. Tom Davis
of Virginia is running against Linder.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is remaining neutral in the leadership elections, but
Thomas Mann, a congressional expert at the Brookings Institution,
said the next speaker probably has an interest in change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more change you get, the easier it is for him to start
with a fresh team and be the clearly acknowledged leader,'' Mann
said. ``With a narrow majority, divisions within in his party, a
president with a veto and a popular agenda, it's going to be a
difficult proposition for him under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The most attention will be on contested elections for Majority
Leader and Republican Conference chairman. House Majority Leader
Richard Armey of Texas faces Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington and
Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   If Dunn were to win, she would become the first woman to serve
as Majority Leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Boehner, the Republican Conference chairman, is trying
to hold onto his post against Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the only
black Republican in the House.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas is the only incumbent in
the GOP leadership who is unopposed for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   There were claims of sufficient support for victory from several
candidates Tuesday. Faxed letters to colleagues and last-minute
telephone calls to shore up support were the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), in a letter of support for Linder,
said: ``In our post-election anguish, let's not add to the turmoil
by ousting a tested veteran of fund-raising and candidate
recruitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann said the election of Dunn would help change the profile of
the Republican party more than a victory by Watts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask yourself how visible is the conference
chairman,'' Mann said. ``Dunn is a little different. The majority
leader is more visible. . . . I'd say that is more promising in its
potential payoff in softening the image of the Republican party.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Dunn or Watts or both win, the Republicans would have a
leadership team more diverse than their Democratic counterparts.

 PETER COTES, 86, PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR OF ``MOUSETRAP''
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Cotes, a British theatrical producer and director who
staged the first production of Agatha Christie's ``Mousetrap'' in
1952, died Tuesday at his home in Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds.
He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mousetrap,'' now in its 46th consecutive year in London,
is the longest-running show of all time. It made Christie a rich
woman and Cotes a rich man, although his name was often overlooked
when credits for the play, a murder mystery, were mentioned.
Wisely, Cotes demanded a royalty of 1.5 percent rather than a flat
fee for his work as director.
</P>
<P>
   The Christie play was unquestionably his most successful effort,
but it was only one stop in a significant career that often defied
censorship. In 1946, he presented ``Pick-Up Girl,'' an American
play dealing with venereal disease, at a small, private London
theater club. Because of its subject matter, the play had not been
licensed for commercial production. Queen Mary, the Queen Mother,
came to see it, and after the performance asked Cotes where he
found ``those wonderful actors.'' Helped by that royal
recommendation, the play was licensed and moved to the West End.
</P>
<P>
   Cotes was born in Maidenhead as Sydney Arthur Rembrandt
Boulting. His younger brothers, John and Roy, became the Boulting
Brothers of English films. He took the name Cotes from a childhood
home called Northcotes and used it as a pseudonym to show
independence from his brothers.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career as an actor, working in films as well as
onstage. After World War II, he was active as a producer and
director, often working with his second wife, the actress Joan
Miller (who died in 1988). In 1948, he founded a theater company,
the Peter Cotes Players, in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   His commitment to outspoken drama and his antipathy for the star
system were integral to his book ``No Star Nonsense.'' He also
collaborated on ``The Little Fellow,'' a biography of Charlie
Chaplin. In addition, he wrote books about crime and was a
television producer and director.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, he staged private productions in London of
``The Children's Hour'' and ``A Pin to See the Peepshow'' (about an
English murder case), avoiding censorship by the Lord Chamberlain
by presenting the plays privately in a theater club. In 1953 he
brought ``A Pin to See the Peepshow'' to Broadway, with his wife in
the leading role. The show closed after one performance, in direct
contrast to ``The Mousetrap.''

TV DOCTOR'S BREAST-CANCER DIET BOOK DRAWS CRITICISM FROM SCIENTISTS

</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dispute has arisen over a best-selling book promoting a diet
that purports to prevent breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The book is ``The Breast Cancer Prevention Diet: The Powerful
Foods, Supplements and Drugs that Can Save Your Life,'' by Dr. Bob
Arnot, the physician who is a national correspondent for NBC
television. It says that although it will be a decade or more
before medical science fully knows what kind of diet may prevent
breast cancer, ``you can't afford to wait'' and that ``food is a
lot kinder to your body than drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists, including some whose work is cited in the
book, have criticized it as making recommendations that are
premature, misleading and misrepresentative of existing research
results.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Tuesday, Arnot said he should perhaps have
spoken of ``risk reduction,'' rather than prevention, since there
are no diets, drugs or supplements that are definitely known to
prevent breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prevention is a buzz word,'' Arnot said, adding that the book
clearly states that the specific dietary recommendations are ``a
bet,'' not a sure thing. ``Still,'' Arnot said, ``I stand by the
idea that food is a major part of breast cancer and breast cancer
prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   The book recommends that women limit their consumption of
carbohydrate foods like potatoes, carrots, rice, bagels and popcorn
that can raise levels of blood sugar, and avoid the fats found in
most vegetable oils. The recommended diet is rich in soy, flaxseed
and fish oils.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say that not enough is known about nutrition and
cancer to formulate a diet that can be said to prevent or treat
breast cancer, although there are many clues to dietary factors
that might be helpful in preventing the disease. For example, the
American Cancer Society and those doctors who do offer dietary
advice to breast cancer patients and women at high risk of
developing the disease suggest that they consume a low-fat diet
rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains in amounts that
maintain a normal body weight.
</P>
<P>
   The American Council on Science and Health, a nonprofit
organization, issued a critique this week calling the book
``unscientific and deceptive, a disservice to American women.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilian Thompson, a professor of nutritional science at the
University of Toronto whose work was cited three times in the book,
said she was especially distressed by what she called ``a very
misleading'' description of her research.
</P>
<P>
   The book states that Ms. Thompson had demonstrated that
consuming 25 grams a day of flaxseed caused women's breast cancers
to diminish in size. In an interview, she said the finding had been
made only in laboratory animals and that a study of a
flaxseed-supplemented diet in 100 breast cancer patients was far
from completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never spoke to Dr. Arnot _ his assistant called me _ and I
was very clear that this work is ongoing and that we don't yet know
if the findings in animals will apply to women,'' Ms. Thompson
said. ``I'm very upset at being quoted in this way. I'm already
receiving calls from patients and physicians about this and I have
to tell them that it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Rock, a nutrition scientist at the University of
California at San Diego, said she objected to the suggestion that a
diet that she is now involved in testing can prevent breast cancer.
The $13 million study, which is being financed at seven centers by
the National Cancer Institute, is testing the ability of a diet low
in fat and rich in fruits and vegetables to reduce breast cancer
recurrence in 3,000 women who have already been treated for the
disease. ``It's quite premature to come out with these
guidelines,'' Ms. Rock said. Dr. Moishe Shike, who heads the cancer
prevention program at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New
York City, said he recommends that breast cancer patients avoid
being overweight, eat a diet with no more than 20 percent of
calories from fat, consume five to eight servings a day of fruits
and vegetables and about 25 grams a day of dietary fiber. `` But we
cannot say that such a diet will prevent or cure cancer,'' he
added. ``We simply don't have the evidence to support such an
assertion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Sloan Kettering said Arnot
had agreed to remove references to the cancer center from
subsequent editions of the book.

TRIPP TAPES REVEAL DUPLICITY   IN TALKS WITH LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Linda, I don't know why I have these feelings for
him,'' Monica S. Lewinsky says, sounding sad and lost as she spills
her heart out to Linda R. Tripp about her love for President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Tripp, secretly recording the conversations, has no sympathy
in her voice. ``You protect him every inch of the way,'' Tripp
snaps, urging Lewinsky to reveal the extent of her relationship
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was made public in transcripts in September.
But with Tuesday's release of 22 hours of taped conversation, the
screenplay jumped to life with psychological and sexual twists and
turns, providing a surreal soundtrack for impeachment hearings
Thursday in the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If nuance is everything, the tapes, made in fall 1997, tell all,
from the whiny to the whimsical, the mundane to the sensational.
Much of it is girl talk between Lewinsky, the former White House
intern, and Tripp, her onetime friend and coworker at the Pentagon.
They gab about money, sex, and the affair. It is the first time
most of the public has heard Lewinsky's voice, which Tripp
describes on the tapes at one point as sounding like a ``little
Marilyn Monroe vixen.'' On most of the tapes, however, Lewinsky
speaks in a normal voice, with variations in timbre reflecting a
range of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Lewinsky sobs like a vulnerable Valley Girl, declaring
how she fell in love with Clinton after she ``looked into his eyes
close up and was with him alone ... that's the person I fell in
love with.'' At other times, Lewinsky sounds like a savvy lawyer,
dissecting strategies to avoid disclosing the affair. Tripp,
meanwhile, is variously sympathetic, exasperated, and manipulative,
coaxing ever more details from her friend.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sounds that captivate the listener. The sobs and the
laughter, the arguments and the exclamations, all paint a portrait
of a frightened intern admitting she would lie to protect herself _
and, it is implied _ the president. ``I would lie on the stand for
my family,'' Lewinsky says. ``That is just how I was raised. ...
I've lied all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp responds that she would never lie. But Tripp, of course,
knew that the conversation was being taped. A Maryland grand jury
is investigating whether Tripp broke state law by making the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Tannen, a Georgetown University professor of linguistics
who listened to some of the tapes Tuesday, said they reinforce the
impression that Tripp betrayed Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of conversation that women have with their best
friends,'' said Tannen, author of ``You Just Don't Understand'' and
other books analyzing conversation. ``It is the kind that makes you
best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   As result, Tannen said, the release of the tapes could backfire
on Republicans and make the public more sympathetic to Lewinsky.
The context of the tapes also helps Lewinsky, Tannen said. For
example, referring to Lewinsky's comment that she has lied all her
life, Tannen said the tapes make clear Lewinsky made the statement
because she was ``desperate'' for Tripp to keep quiet about the
affair.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were released by the House Judiciary Committee. The
transcripts and the tapes contain many gaps, indicating that the
committee deleted portions considered too salacious, personal, or
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the tapes appeared timed by Republicans to revive
public interest in the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal just two days
before independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr testifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that most people around the country won't be
paying much attention, but the people obsessed with this story,
this will just be a day in heaven for them,'' White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said. The tapes were played for the media on Capitol
Hill and, in a bit of high-tech voyeurism, all 22 hours of private
conversation immediately could be heard on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The wheels of intrigue turn endlessly in the tapes, as Tripp is
heard pulling Lewinsky along in a plot to preserve evidence of an
affair. When Tripp learns that Lewinsky may have a dress stained by
the president, she offhandedly mentions that she has a cousin who
knows all about DNA. Tripp tells Lewinsky that she can preserve
Clinton's DNA by swabbing the stain with a Q-tip and putting it in
a Ziploc bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pack it in with your treasures,'' Tripp advises. When Lewinsky
sounds hesitant, Tripp says: ``I feel like this is what I would
tell my own daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Lewinsky's decision to save the stained blue dress that
enabled the FBI to identify Clinton's DNA, which led to the
president's admission that he had an ``inappropriate'' relationship
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the conversation is comically mundane. Tripp complains
about her haircut, and Monica sighs sympathetically. Lewinsky
discusses her many shopping expeditions. Tripp is depressed and
eats a truffle. In the background are an assortment of Americana
sound effects, all picked up by Tripp's secret tape recorder: a
Yankees-Indians baseball playoff game, a dog barking, a television
drama.
</P>
<P>
   But time and again, Tripp steers the conversation back to
Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton and in the direction of a
confirmation from Lewinsky that she had sex with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky insists she didn't have intercourse but implies that
she had oral sex, as she later testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even came close to sleeping with him,'' Lewinsky says.
``We didn't have sex. ... We fooled around. ... Having sex is
having intercourse.'' Then, using a euphemism for oral sex, she
said, ``And all that don't count.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp responds incredulously: ``It is less personal to give''
oral sex ``than intercourse?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not necessarily,'' Lewinsky responds. ``It depends.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Tripp: ``I'm getting an education late in life.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation has been considered important because Lewinsky
swore soon afterward in an affidavit that she had never had sexual
relations with the president. Clinton then denied in a deposition
that he had sexual relations with Lewinsky, a statement he later
repeated publicly in a famous finger-wagging remark. Clinton
eventually said his denial of sexual relations was ``legally
accurate,'' which aides said was a reference to Clinton having had
only oral sex with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Tripp gives Lewinsky advice about how to
communicate with one of the president's aides, suggesting that a
face-to-face meeting is preferable to talking on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be careful what you said on the phone,'' Tripp said, as
her tape recorder captured every word.

TRADING BEGINS IN DAIMLERCHRYSLER STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
 (rl) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Shares of DaimlerChrysler A.G. began trading
officially Tuesday as further signs emerged that German executives
from the former Daimler-Benz A.G. would be the senior partners in
the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler shares, which had been trading on a when-issued
basis on Friday and Monday, fell 43.75 cents to 83.875. Financial
analysts attributed the drop in the automaker's stock to continued
selling by stock index funds because DaimlerChrysler, unlike the
former Chrysler Corp., is not part of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz and Chrysler announced their merger last May and
completed it last Thursday. With $140 billion in annual revenue,
DaimlerChrysler becomes the world's third-largest automaker in
terms of revenues, and the world's fourth-largest company, trailing
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Mitsui, a Japanese trading
company.
</P>
<P>
   The organization chart released Tuesday for DaimlerChrysler
featured many German executives in leading roles. While the new
company's management board has 10 Germans and eight Americans, for
example, there are nine Germans among the 11 executives who report
directly to the company's two co-chairmen. Similarly, five of the
eight members of the new company's corporate integration council
are former Daimler executives, as are five of the seven members of
the company's nonautomotive business council.
</P>
<P>
   The preponderance of German executives was not entirely
surprising in a merger that in many respects has amounted to a
German takeover of Chrysler. The combined company has been
incorporated in Germany for tax reasons. And while Chrysler's
former chairman, Robert J. Eaton, and Daimler's former chairman,
Jurgen E. Schrempp, will be co-chairmen of DaimlerChrysler for
three years, Eaton is scheduled to retire then, and Schrempp, who
initiated the merger, will run the company himself.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp said in an interview Tuesday that the presence of eight
Americans on the management board mattered more than the fact that
some of those Americans did not report directly to the chairmen
during day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler will, however, maintain separate headquarters in
Stuttgart, Germany, and Auburn Hills, Mich., a suburb of Detroit.
American and European shareholders will also hold equal stakes in
the combined company at first _ 44 percent in each case, with
shareholders from the rest of the world owning the remaining 12
percent. And Eaton and Schrempp vowed Tuesday to keep the two
companies' brands distinct rather than blurring the differences
that separate Chrysler brands like Jeep, Dodge and Plymouth from
Daimler brands like Mercedes-Benz and Freightliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the customer, in terms of showrooms, nothing will
change,'' Schrempp said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said DaimlerChrysler planned to decide by the end of the
year whether to take an equity stake in the Nissan Diesel Motor Co.
But he said that DaimlerChrysler had not been in talks to acquire
its controlling shareholder, the struggling Nissan Motor Co.,
Japan's second-largest automaker.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: SHANAHAN WANTS TO BE THE PERFECT COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mike Shanahan is vice president and head
coach of the Denver Broncos. It's the vice president title that's
the thing. Shanahan picks his coaches, his players, his practice
schedule, his offensive plays, the game plan and the Broncos'
overall direction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what a path the Broncos are blazing. With their dominating
30-7 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs here Monday night, the
Broncos are 47-16 in four seasons (including the post-season) under
Shanahan, have won at least 9 of their first 10 games in each of
the last three seasons, are the defending Super Bowl champions and,
this season, have won 10 games and lost none.
</P>
<P>
   It is official now. With six regular-season games left, Shanahan
and Denver are chasing history: an unbeaten and untied 16-game
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought it possible 10 years ago when Shanahan
was head coach of the Raiders in a miserable situation where
control was not his. Shanahan refuses to offer details about his
brief Raider tenure and continues to keep the depth of his
frustration there inside. But he has said this: ``I thought I was
going to the Raiders to be the head coach. That is not what I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   A puppet? Maybe. But make no mistake, Al Davis, the Raiders'
managing general partner, was in control. Here is how much:
</P>
<P>
   After the Raiders' initial 7-9 season under Shanahan in 1988,
Nick Nicolau, then the Raiders' receivers coach, and Art Shell, the
offensive line coach, got into an argument. Nicolau was a coach
Shanahan had hired. Davis had forced Shanahan _ against Shanahan's
wishes _ to keep several of the Raiders' assistant coaches,
including Shell. Several of those coaches did not like it that
Shanahan had been hired from outside the organization. Several of
them wanted the job.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan was 35 then, young and fresh and full of innovative
ideas. Several coaches from the Raiders staff bucked against him.
They wanted him to fail. Shanahan wanted big changes: For example,
he wanted to run 80 plays in rapid-fire practices and games, rather
than the 50 or so plays in the slow-paced style the Raiders had
long featured. Some coaches and veteran players resisted; this was
not the Raiders way at all, they insisted.
</P>
<P>
   After the Nicolau-Shell argument, Shanahan dismissed Shell and a
few other coaches. A few days later, Davis hired them all back. And
then Davis dismissed Nicolau. And then hired Fred Biletnikoff as
Nicolau's replacement. Power play to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Four games into the next season, after a 1-3 start, Davis
dismissed Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting fired is tough on anybody,'' Shanahan said here after
Denver beat the Chiefs, making the Broncos only the eighth team
since the merger of the old National and American Football Leagues
in 1970 to reach 10-0. ``Not succeeding with the Raiders hurt. I
think some of the edge is taken off that when you win the Super
Bowl. But we didn't succeed here two seasons ago when we got off to
a 12-1 start and lost at home in the playoffs to Jacksonville. That
was an opportunity wasted. That still sticks in my craw.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, this is Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   The failures nearly match the victories. The ones who doubted
him he remembers nearly as much as the ones who applaud him.
Winning the last Super Bowl is not enough. He wants another. And if
it wasn't for that Jacksonville playoff debacle, Shanahan believes,
he might be shooting for three consecutive rings.
</P>
<P>
   Driven. He wakes up thinking about winning. He goes to bed
thinking about winning. And he is willing to pay the price for it _
with tireless work and attention to detail. He wants his place in
history. Winning the Super Bowl again is, indeed, the priority. But
16-0? Believe it, he smells it. You want to leave a mark? That
would be one for the ages. It is a vision dancing in his head. His
team's, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go 16-0, it would not be finished,'' Denver safety
Tyrone Braxton said. ``We want the Super Bowl again. But Mike is
already being called the best coach in today's game. We do that, we
go 16-0, and he goes down in history as one of the best ever. He
would never say that, though. He is committed. As a defensive
player, I always try to get into the opposing offensive
coordinator's head. It is very difficult to get into Mike
Shanahan's head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Kansas City. Shanahan, besides his superior talent in
assembling and orchestrating an offense, has a knack for blending
players' skills with his schemes. Take quarterback Bubby Brister,
the backup to John Elway. Brister is now 4-0 as a starter this
season, including Monday night's game when Elway watched with
bruised ribs. Brister runs better than Elway. First drive versus
the Chiefs, Shanahan calls for a sell-out on the run and a bootleg
keeper by Brister. Thirty-eight yards later, Brister was in the end
zone and had achieved the longest scoring run by a quarterback in
Denver history.
</P>
<P>
   If Elway were in the game, that play at that time would likely
not have been called. Rather than wring his hands over not having
Elway, Shanahan cooked up something that would milk what he did
have in Brister. The Raiders can expect more when they visit Denver
on Sunday as the Broncos continue their quest. And it is Shanahan
who has lately had the last laugh on the Raiders: He is 6-1 against
the Raiders as Denver's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Romanowski, the Denver linebacker who spit on the 49ers'
J.J. Stokes last season, causing an uproar, appreciates Shanahan.
``That next afternoon, things were getting wild, and I walked up to
Mike's office for advice; I wanted to hear what he had to say,''
Romanowski said.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to get into Shanahan's head. ``Mike said I messed
up,'' Romanowski said. `` He said I had already apologized and that
I should keep apologizing. He told me to hold myself accountable
for my actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Blunt and effective. Romanowski did what Shanahan advised. The
incident could have lingered. It is now barely an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have been good for four quarters in nearly every
game, but their early play has been incredible. They are crushing
opponents, 100-13, in the first quarter and by 42-3 on both teams'
opening drives. This indicates two things: Shanahan's scripted
plays that start each Denver game, that are practiced meticulously,
work. It also says that he is winning the cat-and-mouse coaching
game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan does the little things for his players. Each one has
his own hotel room on the road. He serves them breakfast and lunch
daily at the team's complex. Practice on Fridays is less physical
because the Broncos don't wear pads. Mondays are a day when players
arrive for work when they want, as long as the work is done. He
rewards them financially, too. Produce, and you are treated fairly
at contract time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my career I have played for Bill Walsh, George Seifert,
Rich Kotite, Ray Rhodes and Mike Shanahan,'' said Romanowski, an
11-year veteran. ``Mike Shanahan is the best coach I have played
for. When you win a Super Bowl, you get that hungry feeling to win
another. It starts at the top and by understanding what Mike
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   By getting into his head.

BOTH SIDES UNSETTLED ON EVE OF HOUSE IMPEACHMENT PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton impeachment proceedings were in turmoil
Tuesday night as Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee
wrangled over whether to significantly widen the inquiry and
Democrats appeared to be in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion came as the committee prepared to open the
investigative phase of the inquiry Thursday by cross-examining the
independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, about his probe of Clinton's
sexual affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Amid new polls that show broad public disapproval of the way
Starr and Congress have handled the case, the independent counsel
Tuesday sent the committee four boxes of evidence related to his
investigation of former associate US attorney general Webster L.
Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Starr examined whether Hubbell may have received ``hush money''
to shield Clinton from a criminal inquiry. But he made no
recommendation on whether the boxes contained evidence to support
an additional impeachment against Clinton, leaving the committee to
make the determination.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde, was
consulting Tuesday night with committee Republicans on whether to
expand the impeachment proceedings to the Hubbell matter and
whether to call numerous witnesses other than Starr in the Lewinsky
saga. He made no comment on the Hubbell material.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, committee Democrats vented their frustation with
Hyde and aired some of their internal differences in a closed-door
meeting Tuesday night with the House minority leader, Richard A.
Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats were so irate about the GOP handling of the
inquiry that they were considering boycotting the Starr hearing.
The proceeding is expected to be a defining moment of only the
third impeachment hearings in US history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, trying to figure out the Republican plans for
calling witnesses is more complicated than deciphering internal
Kremlin politics in the heyday of the Soviet Union,'' said
Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who
serves on the Judiciary Committee. ``This whole process is
pathetic,'' said Meehan, who does not plan to boycott the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hurlyburly, Gephardt began working behind the scenes
with Democrats to forge a compromise plan that moderate Republicans
could accept to resolve the proceedings short of Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's lawyers complained to the Judiciary
Committee that they were shortchanged in being offered only 30
minutes to question Starr in Thursday's hearing. Starr is scheduled
to present his case against Clinton for two hours, then be
questioned in five-minute intervals by the panel's 21 GOP members
and 16 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe ... it would be fair to grant us 90 minutes for
questions,'' White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff wrote Tuesday to
Hyde. Ruff will question Starr with White House special counsel
Greg Craig and Clinton's private lawyer, David E. Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had no immediate response to the request.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, who rank among the
staunchest social conservatives in Congress, were pressing Hyde to
call additional witnesses in the inquiry, including former
Democratic fund-raiser John Huang.
</P>
<P>
   Huang's former employer, the Riady family of Indonesia, paid
Hubbell $100,000 of an estimated $700,000 that Starr has
investigated as possible ``hush money.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr obtained a 15-count indictment last week against Hubbell
on charges of perjury and fraud involving his legal work in
Arkansas real estate ventures. In 1995, Hubbell began an 18-month
prison term after pleading guilty to charges that Starr brought
against him of bilking his former law partners and clients.
</P>
<P>
   If Huang, who received immunity from prosecution in Starr's
inquiry, is called before the committee, the impeachment case would
be widened beyond the allegations of perjury, witness tampering and
obstruction of justice that Clinton faces in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP members, concerned about poll findings and the apparent
lack of votes for Clinton's impeachment in the full House and
Senate, were urging Hyde to limit the inquiry to the Lewinsky
matter and resolve it as quickly and as reasonably as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But other committee Republicans want to broaden the
investigation to cover additional White House matters that Starr
has investigated, including the handling of confidential FBI files
by Clinton political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and senior
member of the Judiciary Committee, cited the Republican wrangling
as central to the GOP leadership's quandary in designing an exit
strategy for the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know whether to bring it to an end or expand it,
and they clearly are not happy,'' Frank said. ``They thought they
had a horse they could ride all the way, but now they don't know
whether to shoot it or sell it to the dog-food factory.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats had their own problems, according to several
congressional aides. Stymied by the Republican majority's rapidly
evolving -- and unpredictable -- handling of the inquiry, the
committee Democrats have also been hampered by their lack of
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two days before Starr's appearance, for instance, the
panel's Democrats have yet to devise a comprehensive plan for
cross-examinaning Starr. The strategy could be essential because of
each member's limited, 5-minute question period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no coordination right now, no grand scheme, which is
bizarre at this point in the process,'' said a Democratic aide who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan blamed the problem largely on the committee's Republican
majority. ``There are differences of opinion on the Democratic side
about the best approach to take,'' he said, ``but it's nearly
impossible to get a consensus when the Republicans change their
strategy every hour and haven't got a clue how they're going to
proceed.''

   So far, the contest between Gov. Fernando de la Rua of Buenos
Aires province and Congresswoman Graciela Fernandez Meijilde for
the nomination of the opposition coalition, Alianza, has attracted
little voter interest, since both have essentially endorsed Menem's
free-market policies.
</P>
<P>
   But de la Rua, who leads in opinion polls, has begun to put some
excitement in the campaign for the Nov. 29 primary by suggesting
that a thorough accounting of the current government will take
place when he takes office in 2000. ``There will be no tolerance,
cover-up or complicity,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua has promised to push federal judges and prosecutors to
investigate which officials may have received up to $21 million in
bribes from a local IBM franchise in exchange for a government bank
contract three years ago. (The local IBM management has been
replaced, and IBM officials in the United States say they had no
knowledge of any bribery.)
</P>
<P>
   The governor has also expressed the need to find out who in the
government was involved in the smuggling of Argentine arms to
Ecuador and Croatia, breaking a U.N. embargo, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Menem has called for an investigation into
bribe-taking in governor de la Rua's provincial government and
international arms sales made during the Radical Party government
in the 1980s. Menem, president since 1990, has denied any
involvement by himself or his aides in either the arms smuggling or
the IBM bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fernandez Meijilde, who represents Buenos Aires province in
Congress, has also pledged to order investigations of corruption in
the Menem government. ``If I don't go after past corruption,'' she
said in an interview, ``I'd be sending out exactly the wrong
signal, that official corruption is fine and it will be tolerated
by future governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Menem dropped out of the race for a third term under pressure
from his party. But he stirred interest in the corruption issue two
weeks ago when he demanded that his Justice Department investigate
Carlos Stornelli, the prosecutor who is trying to uncover who
profited from the sales of arms to Ecuador and Croatia between 1991
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The government's senior prosecutor declined to follow the order,
and his decision was widely applauded by members of Congress,
including members of Menem's party. And in another sign that Menem
is beginning to lose influence as a lame duck, a federal judge
investigating illegal arms trafficking has said he will ask several
Cabinet members to testify about activities that forced the
resignation of Oscar Camilion as defense minister three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua leads the centrist Radical Party while Ms. Fernandez
Meijilde leads the Frepaso Party, a center-left group that broke
away from Menem's Justicialist Party. The two parties entered into
a pact last year.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Alianza primary is likely to run a close race
with Eduardo Duhalde, the mayor of Buenos Aires and the leading
candidate in the Justicialist Party.

 &HT;    Glavine awarded Cy over Hoffman
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Down deep, where the public is not invited, even Tom
Glavine, the decade's winningest left-handed pitcher, harbored his
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having won it one time, I've had a burning desire to win it
again,'' Glavine said, ``just to prove that the first time wasn't a
fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Which he did Tuesday. In a historic ballot, Glavine won his
second Cy Young Award while becoming the first pitcher to do so
with fewer first-place votes than the runner-up. Glavine totaled 99
points to San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman's 88; Hoffman drew 13
first-place vote to Glavine's 11 in the award's 3-2-1 system.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Kevin Brown finished third (76) with eight
first-place votes, and Atlanta's John Smoltz and early front-runner
Greg Maddux tied for fourth with 10 points. The vote marked just
the second time in National League history that one team has placed
three pitchers in the top five since the Cy Young was first awarded
in 1956; Los Angeles was the other, in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, six of the 32 voting members of the Baseball Writers'
Association of America failed to list Hoffman anywhere on their
three-man ballots, although he tied the league record for saves
with 53. But Glavine would hardly dispute the vote, having just
completed some of the most important four days of his life. Tom and
Chris Glavine were married Saturday in his Alpharetta home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have the argument that the relievers have the
Rolaids Relief Award and (that) that's the way it should be,''
Glavine said. ``But then that opens up the argument whether a
starting pitcher should be considered for the MVP when they have
the Cy Young Award. If somebody is the clear-cut winner, then they
should be the clear-cut winner, whether they're a starter or a
reliever. I think a starting pitcher has an edge in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, in Buffalo, N.Y., said, ``I'm honored to have my name
mentioned with the guys who are up for it. I'd be lying if I said I
wasn't a little disappointed. I did what I had to do; I did my job.
The rest was up to the writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, who already won the 1998 Silver Slugger award as the
best-hitting pitcher in the league, led all NL pitchers with a 20-6
record, his fourth 20-win season and first since 1993. Brown (18-7)
posted a lower ERA (2.38 to 2.47) and had 100 more strikeouts.
Hoffman converted 53 of 54 save opportunities with a dominant 1.48
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   But Glavine was recognized for consistency. He worked seven or
more innings in 22 of his 33 starts, was 11-2 when starting the day
after a Braves loss and closed out with a strong final two months.
Going 8-3 in the second half, Glavine lost just once in his last
seven starts and allowed only 18 runs in his last 11 games (2.08
ERA). He joins Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Steve Carlton, Tom Seaver
and Maddux as multiple Cy Young winners in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nearness of the guys who put together strong years made
for an uncertain feeling,'' Glavine said. ``But I didn't worry
about it too much. I just kind of let the day come and hoped for
good news. Either way, I would have been happy with the year I've
had. This obviously makes it a lot happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine had declared Maddux the Cy Young winner back in early
August, when Maddux was 15-5 and leading the league in ERA with
five shutouts. But even as he spoke, Glavine was in the midst of a
streak of 23 scoreless innings that fueled his candidacy. Maddux
finished 6-7 in the second half, and Brown went 5-4 in the last two
months. Teammates Brown and Hoffman undoubtedly canceled each other
out with some split votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why none of us try to get caught up in what's happening
in the moment, because we know in a short period of time a lot of
things can change,'' Glavine said. ``The fact that Greg didn't
pitch as strongly in the last few weeks of the season opened an
opportunity for me. I was fortunate I could sneak in there and win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His Cy Young is the seventh won by Braves' pitchers _ including
Warren Spahn's in 1957 _ and gives the franchise six of the last
eight awarded. Maddux won one of his four as a Chicago Cub, in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   That Glavine's wedding was scheduled a few days before the
announcement was hardly coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have the wedding first, because no matter what
happened, I'd be happy,'' he said. ``This is a nice belated wedding
present.''

<P>
   AL KHADR, West Bank _ Uprooted fruit trees and flattened
grapevines littered swaths of freshly bulldozed land Tuesday in
this Palestinian village, where the Israeli army has begun clearing
the way for a road linking a Jewish settlement to a highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the peace of the bulldozers,'' Ali Musa, a villager,
said as he surveyed his trampled vines in a terraced valley of fig,
almond and olive trees. ``We're losing our land.''
</P>
<P>
   The new road through the valley on the edge of Al Khadr,
southwest of Bethlehem, is supposed to connect the northern end of
the fast-growing Jewish town of Efrat to the Jerusalem-Hebron
highway.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of a dozen bypass roads linking Jewish settlements,
roads that were authorized by the Israeli Cabinet when it endorsed
the new Israeli-Palestinian accord last week.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for an Israeli withdrawal from an additional
13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian steps to
fight terrorism. But the bypass roads, built mostly on expropriated
Arab land, are cementing Israeli control of wide areas of the West
Bank even as other areas are to be handed over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials say the roads, which skirt Arab communities,
are a security measure necessitated by the pullback. The
Palestinians see them as part of a plan to carve up the West Bank
and block the establishment of a Palestinian state there.
</P>
<P>
   Following common practice in many countries, Israeli authorities
have offered compensation to Palestinians whose land has been
expropriated. But villagers here, as in other areas of the West
Bank, have rejected compensation, arguing that accepting it would
mean recognition of Israel's right to seize their land.
</P>
<P>
   The roadwork has already set off unrest in Al Khadr. Villagers
protesting the destruction of their trees and vineyards clashed
Sunday with Israeli soldiers, blocking a bulldozer and hurling
stones as the troops responded with tear gas and rubber-coated
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over land in the West Bank is likely to intensify
in the coming months as Israel and the Palestinians stake their
claims before planned negotiations on a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon urged Jewish settlers Sunday to
``grab more hills,'' warning that ``whatever isn't seized will end
up in their hands,'' a reference to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But Avi Benayahu, a spokesman for Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, said the bypass roads had no political aim and were
meant solely to insure safe access to Israeli settlements by
detouring around Palestinian-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a reality in which areas are being transferred to
Palestinian security control, the one and only purpose of the roads
is safer travel for the Jewish residents'' of the West Bank,
Benayahu said. ``We're guided solely by security considerations. We
have no intention of slicing up the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   But Khalil Tafakji, a Palestinian geographer who has studied
Israeli settlement patterns, said the bypass routes were part of a
years-old plan to crisscross the West Bank with Israeli roads,
insuring permanent control of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim of these roads,'' Tafakji said, ``is to isolate
Palestinian communities and prevent them from growing and to cut
the West Bank into cantons in which there is no geographical
continuity between the north, the middle and the south.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishara Daoud, a member of the Palestinian legislative council
from the Bethlehem area, put it more bluntly on a visit here
Monday. The bypass roads, he declared, are nothing less than a
``cancer'' aimed at ``dividing Palestinian land, leaving no
geographical unity for a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   People in Al Khadr, a community of 8,000, said they feared that
the new road would cut them off from the only land available for
the natural growth of their village. Some voiced concern that land
on the other side of the road would be annexed to Efrat, the
sprawling settlement whose rapidly spreading neighborhoods are now
little more than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're putting us in a box,'' said Naim Sbeih, who owns land
in the valley. ``If the new agreement means taking our land and
turning us into servants of the Israelis, then we don't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   The road is also a challenge to Hussein Issa, who runs a local
school devoted to peace education, where pupils meet Israeli
counterparts and study Hebrew. The school, named Flowers of Hope,
overlooks the valley being bulldozed. ``This makes our efforts
impossible in the Palestinian community,'' Issa said. ``How can you
teach peace when the bulldozers are working?''

 &HT;    Changing cast of Tar Heels
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Last year, North Carolina didn't miss a beat
in its first season without Dean Smith, college basketball's
all-time winningest coach.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bill Guthridge, the longtime Tar Heel assistant promoted
after Smith's retirement, North Carolina finished 34-4 and advanced
to the NCAA Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, North Carolina might have a tougher time
replacing NBA lottery picks Vince Carter and Antawn Jamison, who
left Chapel Hill a year early, and steady guard Shammond Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The new-look Tar Heels (2-0) will get their stiffest test of the
young season when they host Georgia (2-0) tonight in the second
round of the Preseason NIT at the Smith Center. The winner of the
9:30 p.m. contest advances to the NIT Final Four in New York's
Madison Square Garden on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from one of our most experienced teams last year to
one of our most inexperienced this year,'' Guthridge said. ``I'm
pleased with the way we've played in our first two games, but I
don't know if we're ready for a team like Georgia. Georgia's win
over College of Charleston (84-63 on Monday) was amazing. People
across the country were shocked to see that score.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina could be turning some heads by March, despite
returning just one starter from last year's squad _ New York-bred
point guard Ed Cota, one of the ACC's top playmakers, who averaged
eight points last season. Swing man Jason Capel and forward/center
Kris Lang became just the 12th and 13th freshmen to start their
first games at Carolina. Capel, who had 14 points in a 65-44 win
over Florida International in the first round, is a strong
candidate for ACC rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our top two perimeter shooters in Carter and
Williams,'' Guthridge said. ``We need for some of the others to
step up and hit the outside shots. Cota's taken a few more shots
but not a lot more. He's a capable scorer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels probably will try to muscle the Bulldogs with
their deep frontcourt, which includes 6-11 sophomore Brian
Bersticker off the bench. Forward Ademola Okulaja, the only senior
in the starting lineup, scored 15 points with a career-high 17
rebounds against Florida International.
</P>
<P>
   Center Brendan Haywood, a 7-foot sophomore, started the opener,
scoring 19 points against Appalachian State, and had 12 points off
the bench against Florida International. Haywood will return to the
starting lineup against Georgia; he lost his starting role for
being late to a pregame meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be physical,'' Georgia coach Ron
Jirsa said. ``They can play without fear of fouling. They've got a
lot of depth, and they're very big.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Georgia squandered a seven-point lead in the
final two minutes of regulation, then fell to North Carolina 82-80
on Carter's bucket with 3.2 seconds left in overtime. The Bulldogs
lost their first five SEC games after that heart-breaking loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really affected us,'' Georgia point guard G.G. Smith said.
``Our confidence really dropped off. This year, we want to play
smart and play our game.''

 &HT;    Lefty's legend: GSU coach one win away from 700 club
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He is 66 years old and well into his fourth decade as
a college basketball coach. But longevity has not dulled the
enthusiasm of Lefty Driesell, who tonight begins his second season
at Georgia State seeking a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Driesell needs one victory to become the 11th coach in Division
I histor with 700 career wins, a victory that could come against
Georgetown in the season opener. Driesell is set to join coaching
legends Phog Allen, Adolph Rupp and Dean Smith in the exclusive
fraternity, but he appears to have the vigor and excitement of his
playing days at Duke in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Driesell still pays close attention to each detail during a
Georgia State practice, bellowing instructions through a small
microphone that he attaches to his shirt. He has also been known to
jump in the middle of individual drills when a player does
something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Driesell is one of the Georgia State basketball program's top
promoters, spending hours and hours speaking to local groups. He
even made an appearance at last Sunday's Atlanta Falcons-San
Francisco 49ers game at the Georgia Dome, the site of tonight's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to come out and help us get No. 700, and No. 1
for this team,'' Driesell said. ``I was at the (Falcons) game
Sunday, and that was exciting. It would be great if we have that
kind of excitement to carry over for our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a promoter, always a promoter, but Driesell has made his
name in college basketball with his sense of humor and his
excellent coaching ability. The record speaks for itself _ 699-347
while coaching at Davidson, Maryland, James Madison and Georgia
State. Actually, Driesell is closer to 800 career wins if you
include his 97 victories as a Virginia high school coach in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But Driesell's coaching performance at Georgia State last season
might have been his best. The Panthers finished 16-12, the
program's first winning season in six years and only the third in
school history, with a lineup that included just two returning
starters from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Driesell faces a rebuilding job after losing guards Rodney
Hamilton, the school's all-time leading scorer, and Shellord
Pinkett, but the task should be a little easier with several
talented transfers joining the program. Alabama transfer Anton
Reese, a former all-state player at Lithonia High, returns home and
will join Georgia Tech transfer Kevin Morris in what could be the
most explosive backcourt in the Trans America Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Stricker, a 6-foot-11, 265-pound junior who transferred
from Arizona State, won't become eligible until December.
</P>
<P>
   All the players agree that they're here for two reasons _ to
help turn the program around and to play for one of the best
coaches in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because of Coach Driesell,'' Reese said. ``I know
he's trying to turn this program around. I wanted to be a part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very exciting for us to get back out there
after sitting out last year,'' Morris said. ``It's a fitting start,
because Coach is going for No. 700, and we'll be playing a team
with a national reputation. We win, it could put us on the map
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Driesell's goals was to put Georgia State basketball on
the map. Since his arrival, he has had the basketball offices
remodeled, the center of the basketball floor repainted with a huge
Panther logo, and has upgraded the schedule to include Georgetown,
Miami and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all part of the man who is set to join the basketball
elite, possibly tonight or against North Florida on Saturday night.
Although Driesell doesn't like to talk about the record, others
around him realize its importance _ for the program and the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tries to act like he doesn't care how many wins he's got,''
Morris said. ``He says it's just another win. But I feel like deep
down he's going to be very proud of it.''

   Klein is making his first foray into cyberspace with an
interactive campaign for CK One, the unisex fragrance from the
Calvin Klein Cosmetics Co. unit of Unilever. The scent has become a
worldwide best seller since its introduction in 1994, though sales
in the United States have flagged recently.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign replaces a previous one that featured corps of edgy
androgynes dishing out hip, flippant chatter. Now, a smaller cast
of slicker, sleeker characters use electronic mail in recounting
their fictitious, interconnected relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for CK One, estimated at $10 million, is indicative
of marketers' efforts to capitalize on the increasing consumer use
of personal computers. That is particularly true for brands seeking
to create personas that appeal to trend-setting shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is entering the
electronic-commerce realm by selling Levi's and Dockers apparel at
two World Wide Web sites, www.levi.com and www.dockers.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be of the moment,'' Klein, president and chief
executive at Calvin Klein Inc., said in an interview Monday at his
office in midtown Manhattan. ``To watch people who stand for what
the fragrance is all about communicate in the most modern way
speaks to the consumer we're trying to reach.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes e-mail appropriate, he added, is that it echoes how
``very personal'' the choice of a fragrance can be.
</P>
<P>
   The concept for the CK One campaign came from the New York
office of Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, the Portland, Ore., agency that handles
brands like Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Nike. The campaign was
developed in collaboration with CRK Advertising, the in-house
agency at Klein.
</P>
<P>
   By presenting cyberspace as the answer to the question ``Where
does Calvin Klein want to go today?'' the ads offer a contemporary
twist on a traditional ploy _ the serialized or continuing
campaign. Examples include the flirtatious couple hawking Taster's
Choice coffee for Nestle SA and the unconventional couples peddling
Klein's Obsession fragrance in surrealistic spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people will say `Who wants to talk to any of these
characters?' and you don't have to,'' Klein said, smiling. ``But
over the years we've found that people are interested in the
models, the characters, in our commercials, and want to find out
more about them.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail addresses of the CK One characters are featured
prominently in the campaign, which begins this week with television
commercials in Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America. The
initial three characters are Anna, a schoolgirl who is ``13 going
on 30,'' Klein said; Tia, a 20-something woman embarking on a
career, and Robert, a 40-ish urbanite.
</P>
<P>
   Missives to the three addresses _ anna(AT)cKone.com,
tia(AT)cKone.com and robert(AT)cKone.com _ are answered with
prepared responses meant to be in the characters' voices, in which
they ruminate on their complicated lives in and out of love. The
replies expand on remarks they make in the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Models portray the characters in the TV spots, as well as in
radio commercials, print ads and posters; the e-mails are actually
produced by Brant Mau, a copywriter at the Wieden &AMP; Kennedy office
in Portland, who works with the co-creative directors of the
agency's New York office, Stacy Wall and Michael Prieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is about now,'' said Prieve, who had been
co-creative director on the agency's Microsoft account, ``and
fashion is supposed to be. The question was how could we combine
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if people write back and say `This is a joke; I can't
believe you're doing this,''' he added, ``they're responding to the
campaign, and that's great, instead of just sitting around watching
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign _ titillating in a voyeuristic, ``Rear
Window''-meets-Windows way _ marks the first CK One work from
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy since its New York office was selected in
September to share brand duties with CRK Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   When an e-mail was sent to Anna's address, the reply resembled
the hasty, chatty online argot of teen-agers. It was centered on a
crush Anna has on a boy at school, who is ``smart and gorgeous and
totally perfect and really really sweet,'' and included emoticons
like : ) for a smile and : ( for a frown.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail reply from Tia, far more polished than Anna's,
described her new job at a ``superhot TV production house'' called
Manic _ an in joke? _ and her problematic love life involving
Jason, a boyfriend left behind in Seattle, and Ian, an ``annoying
guy'' she met during the shooting of a dog-food commercial in
London.
</P>
<P>
   The reply from Tia states, in a style evocative of the novel
``The Diary of Bridget Jones,'' ``Note to myself: Men equal
Confusion. Avoid at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   And Robert's reply, in world-weary tones, revealed him to be a
``happily married'' man on a business trip to London, who feels
``some unspoken connection'' to a woman he just met while shooting
a ``bloody dog-food commercial.'' Of course, it's Tia. (Later, it
turns out that Anna is his daughter.)
</P>
<P>
   There will be no fixed schedule by which computer users will
receive subsequent e-mail from the characters, said Robert Triefus,
senior vice president for worldwide communications at Klein, ``to
make it as realistic as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be surprising in the way e-mail can be,'' he added,
``with the next one coming immediately or a couple days later or a
couple weeks later.'' And if consumers tire of the cybersoap opera,
they can send e-mail asking for the correspondence to end.
</P>
<P>
   The story is intended as ``an unfolding drama,'' Prieve said,
and is not completely plotted out, so ``if everyone falls in love
with one character,'' his or her role can be expanded. Plans call
for as many as seven additional characters to be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with the characters, Prieve said, they will
``stay away from the piercings and the tattoos'' that were
hallmarks of the first batch of models promoting CK One. That shift
comes after a refocusing of Klein's apparel advertising this year
to emphasize a clean-cut look.
</P>
<P>
   And consumers will be spared static shots of the characters at
keyboards, Klein said, because ``it isn't really necessary to get
the idea what this is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Jacobs, vice president at CRK Advertising, said that the
campaign would begin in this country with television ads in 30
markets, radio spots in more than 20 markets and national
commercials on cable networks like MTV. The print ads and posters
will appear regionally and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials were directed by Mark Romanek and the print ads
and posters were photographed by Richard Burbridge; Steven Meisel
produced the original CK One campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As plugged in as the new campaign is supposed to be, the Klein
foray into cyberspace is only partial.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always said to us we should have a Web site for
image,'' Klein said. ``We'll get there because I'm convinced it
will mean enormous business one day, but it's not the main priority
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And though his company is moving online, Klein is remaining most
resolutely off line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to sit in a room and e-mail,'' Klein said.
``My life just doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``I can't type'' _ though he is ``debating
whether I should take lessons.''

 &HT;    Falcons confident, not cocky
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons are enjoying the view atop the NFC
West after Sunday's victory over San Francisco, but it is a
precarious position for a franchise unaccustomed to success.
</P>
<P>
   The focus has changed. Instead of being asked if they can beat
teams with winning records, the Falcons are asked if they can
handle prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (8-2) will find out starting Sunday, when it plays the
Chicago Bears (3-7). Atlanta could be favored in their next five
games; opponents have a combined record of 16-35.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be agonizing to be in this position (to win the
division, and home-field advantage in the playoffs) and not take
advantage of it,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``We've got to keep our
feet on the ground. It's easy to get up for San Francisco. The real
test is to get up for the Chicago Bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Terance Mathis said there's plenty of incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get as many home games as we can get during the playoffs is
very, very important,'' he said. ``We don't want to go to Green Bay
in January. We don't want to go to San Francisco in January.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have shown no signs of a letdown, soundly beating
inferior teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson said this franchise, which has only
one division title (1980) and made the playoffs five times, has
history on its side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the players (34 of 53) were here last year
(when Atlanta started 1-7) and years before that, and we've been in
the same position as the Bears,'' he said. ``We don't take anybody
lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've had three key ingredients,'' said right guard
Gene Williams, an eight-year veteran. ``We've got maturity; we
haven't had too many injuries at key positions, and we've been
lucky (with the schedule).''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said he has been surprised team chemistry developed so
quickly during his two years as head coach. Because of the
veterans, the players haven't required psychological coddling.
Mathis and linebacker Cornelius Bennett have led by work ethic,
experience and performance. Bennett played in four Super Bowls with
Buffalo. Others are more vocal, including cornerback Ray Buchanan
and free safety Eugene Robinson, who played in the last two Super
Bowls with Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence, not cockiness, is evident in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have handled almost every situation that's been
presented,'' Reeves said. ``The only game we didn't handle was the
Jets game (a 28-3 loss). I thought everybody would rally around
with (injured quarterback) Chris (Chandler) not in there, but it
didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to spend too much time talking to them. They can
look at the film and see (the Bears) are a pretty good team.
They've won three of their last six. They're a lot like we were
last year.''

 &HT;    Eagles lineman out with fracture
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On its way to finishing the regular season undefeated
for the second time in nine years, top-ranked Georgia Southern
nearly made it through the season without a major injury to a top
player. But it has discovered that its best defensive lineman will
be on the sideline for at least one game.
</P>
<P>
   Division I-AA All-American Voncellies Allen suffered a hairline
fracture of his left leg in last week's 28-23 victory over South
Florida. Georgia Southern (11-0) has an open date this weekend, but
Allen, a 5-foot-11, 286-pound junior from Douglas, is expected to
miss next weekend's playoff-opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was just a bruise at first,'' Eagles coach Paul
Johnson said. ``But we later found out it was a fracture that could
keep him out at least two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, informed Monday by the NCAA Division I-AA Football
Committee that they are one of two teams selected as hosts in
first-round playoffs, will start Cloise Williams (6-1, 312) or
fellow junior Eugene Phillips (6-3, 245) at Allen's position.
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished: All-American guard Mark Williams, a 6-1,
312-pound senior out of Albany's Westover High School, had insisted
that the goal of the offensive line for the option-running Eagles
was to block well enough for the fullback position to produce a
2,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our ideal goal,'' Williams said. ``A lot of time the
quarterback and the (slotbacks) get their yards on the perimeter.
But we know that if the fullback gets the ball, it's going to be
inside the tackles 99 percent of the time. So if they get 2,000
yards, it's mostly yards we got them.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that goal has been reached. Redshirt freshman phenom
Adrian Peterson by himself has rushed for a school-record 1,932
yards and 25 touchdowns. Three other players who have played
fullback, including seniors Jevon Sullivan and Carl Small, combined
for 399 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 2,331 yards gained by the Eagles' fullbacks,
junior quarterback Greg Hill has rushed for more than 1,000 yards
for the second year in a row. With his 105-yard, two-touchdown
effort against South Florida on Saturday, Hill has gained 1,061
yards and scored 16 TDs.

FED REDUCES SHORT-TERM RATES AGAIN

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again by a
quarter of a percentage point Tuesday to help keep a gradual
economic slowdown from turning into a recession, but the central
bank signaled it might hold off on further reductions in coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   The cut was the third in seven weeks, and like the previous two
it was driven by the concern that the global financial crisis was
making it hard for companies to raise money, threatening the long
expansion in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In reducing rates but suggesting that investors should not count
on further cuts, the Federal Reserve was walking a line between
calming Wall Street's fears of global turmoil and giving too much
stimulation to an economy that has shown surprising resilience in
the face of shocks from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   With the outlook for further rate cuts now uncertain, the
markets reacted with ambivalence. Down 75 points just before the
Fed's announcement at 2:20 Tuesday afternoon, the Dow Jones
industrial average pushed 75 points into positive territory after
the announcement, then fell back again and closed at 8,986.28, off
24.97 points for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rate cuts over the last several months have helped
fuel a remarkable rebound in the stock market while providing
considerable reassurance to other countries. After plunging in late
summer, the Dow is back within striking distance of its high of
9,337.97, amid a general sense that the worst of the global crisis
may have passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that it would cut the main
short-term rate it controls, the federal funds target rate for
overnight loans between banks, to 4.75 percent from 5 percent. It
said it would also reduce its discount rate on loans to banks from
the Federal Reserve system to 4.5 percent from 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The move should help bolster the economy by making it slightly
cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow. Several banks
quickly reduced the prime rate they charge business borrowers to
7.75 percent from 8 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cut in the discount rate was something of a surprise,
analysts said, and underscored the Federal Reserve's determination
to deal with a credit squeeze that has eased in the last few weeks
but is still pronounced by historical standards.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been particularly
concerned for the last several months about the jittery bond
market, where investors have been shunning all forms of debt except
those that are the safest and the most easily sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although conditions in the financial markets have settled down
materially since mid-October, unusual strains remain,'' the
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in explaining the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, however, added that after three quarter-point
reductions in the federal funds rate since late September, the
economy should be on more of an even keel. Financial conditions,
the Fed statement said, ``can reasonably be expected to be
consistent with fostering sustained economic expansion while
keeping inflationary pressures subdued.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some economists still think the Fed will lower rates
again at its next meeting, on Dec. 22, many analysts took the
statement to mean that the Fed would cut rates again only if the
markets or the economy show new signs of distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clever statement to break up any presumption that the
Fed has to continue easing,'' said Kenneth Mayland, chief economist
at Keycorp in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, Mayland said, will look closely at the strength of
holiday retail sales and at the stability of the financial markets.
If it sees clear evidence that the economy is deteriorating, he
said, the Fed will no doubt consider cutting rates again in
December and may well ease them again further down the road if the
economy continues to slow. But the central bank does not want to be
forced into moving again in December just because the markets
assume it will, Mayland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed's options are now open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's policy committee met Tuesday just minutes
after the Labor Department reported that inflation was negligible
in October, with the Consumer Price Index rising just two-tenths of
a percent. The news was presumably reassuring to Fed officials, who
have seen the absence of wage and price pressures as a somewhat
perplexing but welcome development that has given them considerable
flexibility in responding to the global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists say the Fed should nonetheless pay more
attention to the possibility that the combination of interest rate
cuts and continued underlying strength in the economy will push up
inflation next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Levy, chief economist at the BankAmerica Corp., said the
financial markets were returning to normal and that companies were
again lining up to sell their bonds. Growth in the money supply, a
critical gauge of future inflation, is becoming troublesome, he
said. At the same time, he said, consumption of goods and services
in the United States remained robust and unemployment remained low,
a traditional recipe for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   While Fed officials say they have been remarkably united over
the last several months in their decisions to cut rates, analysts
said the more strident inflation fighters within the central bank
were no doubt growing nervous about taking the easing policy too
far.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan appears to have set aside, at least for now, his
concern that stock prices were getting too high. Instead he seems
intent on insuring that an incipient credit squeeze in the bond
market and among banks is contained and reversed before considering
the easing process complete.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Harris, an economist at Paine Webber, said the Fed might
have been influenced in its decision Tuesday by the results of an
unreleased survey of bank loan officers, asking whether lenders
were tightening lending standards. Harris also said that while
capital markets in the United States appeared to be calming down,
conditions abroad remained worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy is also taking a hit from the global crisis in
the form of reduced exports. The Commerce Department is scheduled
to disclose the nation's trade deficit for September on Wednesday,
and most economists are saying that exports, especially to Asia,
will remain depressed, while imports in politically sensitive
industries like steel will increase.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure being placed on U.S. manufacturers from falling
exports and increased import competition led big companies and
business groups to applaud Tuesday's rate cut. DaimlerChrysler AG
co-chairman Robert Eaton said the rate cut was clearly ``a signal
they're willing to do whatever is necessary to keep this economy
moving.''

DIVORCE CURB IS DIVIDING FEMINISTS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Proposals to make divorce more difficult and to punish
adulterers have stirred a rare and passionate public debate here,
with opinions clashing in newspapers, radio call-in shows and
television specials around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, included in early drafts of a new law on marriage
and family, were prompted by concern about a rising divorce rate
and reports that more rich men are supporting mistresses, widely
known as ``little honeys,'' or leaving their wives to marry younger
women.
</P>
<P>
   But women's advocates have been bitterly split by the proposals,
with some calling them needed protections for women but many
younger feminists and sociologists calling them a regressive move
in a country where the Communists have a history of paternalistic
meddling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people still want to use the government to interfere in
people's private lives,'' said Li Yinhe, a sociologist, referring
to the legal experts, mostly older women, who drafted the
proposals. Ms. Li, an expert on sex issues at the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences, is one of the most vociferous opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make a distinction between law and morality,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under an onslaught of criticism, the authors of the proposals
have hunkered down, complaining, rightly, that news accounts have
often oversimplified their ideas. Several declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent seminar one of the authors, Xu Weihua of the
All-China Women's Federation said, ``Divorce is too easy under the
existing marriage law, and women's rights have not been protected
so many have become single mothers and poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Other drafters such as Wu Changzhen, a professor at Beijing's
University of Politics and Law, have said that while they are not
against divorce as such, there are too many ``rash divorces,'' and
that people who violate the marital contract through adultery ought
to pay _ usually in the form of extra money to the spouse in a
divorce settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents say that a rise in divorces in China is not
necessarily unhealthy; the current rate of 12 divorces for every
100 marriages remains far below that in most Western countries.
These opponents support strong rules on sharing of property and
child support after divorce, but say that does not warrant the
punitive spirit of the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   When legislators first considered the matter a couple of years
ago, it seemed clear that the country's 1980 marriage law needed
updating. That law allowed relatively free divorce in principle,
with ``alienation of affection'' as possible grounds, although
splitting up has long been difficult in practice because of the
scarcity of housing. But the law was generally too vague and sparse
to deal with China's new complexities.
</P>
<P>
   The National People's Congress appointed a panel of senior legal
experts to come up with a proposal. Late last year, as a secret
draft circulated, a number of concerned sociologists and family
experts convened a meeting _ including the draft's authors _ to
discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Then this August, a detailed account of that meeting was
published in a popular Beijing newspaper. The topic clearly touched
a nerve and the media have been given a long leash to explore the
issues, often carrying heavy criticism of the new proposals. But
one magazine carried an open letter from women whose husbands had
affairs who said they wished to ``vigorously call for adultery to
be made unlawful.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed new divorce law would not, as has been reported
here to great alarm, limit divorce only to cases in which couples
have lived apart for three years. Numerous other causes such as
adultery, one party's alcoholism or spousal abuse can also be
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   It is not even clear that, in practice, it would that much
harder to obtain a divorce. But the opponents are reacting in part
to the language, which seems to require evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that some members of the legal establishment are
patronizing people, treating them like children,'' said Chen
Xinxin, deputy secretary of the China Marriage and Family Research
Institute, a professional association.
</P>
<P>
   Most feared is the suggested involvement of police in adultery
cases. If one party violates the duty to be faithful, says a draft,
then the other party may call in law enforcement agencies to
investigate and end the problem.
</P>

   ``If this becomes law, people will have no sense of security in
their private lives,'' said Ms. Chen. ``There will be opportunities
for blackmail and extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual debate itself has given Chinese a vivid glimpse at
democratic discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this debate is not simply about the particular
issues,'' said Ms. Chen. ``It's also about how to deal with the
thousands of years of tradition we have in China,'' she said, ``a
tradition of intolerance and lack of respect for individual
freedom.''

 &HT;    Auburn wants to interview Georgia Tech's O'Leary
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Auburn athletics director David Housel has contacted
Georgia Tech, apparently to seek permission to interview football
coach George O'Leary for the Auburn job, Yellow Jacket athletics
director Dave Braine said Tuesday. Braine said he will give O'Leary
permission to interview, but O'Leary said Tuesday he has not talked
with Housel and has no interest in interviewing until after the
season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deal with any of that stuff until the end of the
season,'' O'Leary said. ``Dave Braine did tell me Auburn called,
but I've not spoken to them. I would not do that to the players or
Georgia Tech. Something like this can be a distraction if you let
it be a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said he is not ruling out an interview after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always listen,'' O'Leary said. ``But I'm very happy at
Georgia Tech. I'm happy with the players I recruited.''
</P>
<P>
   Braine said Housel left him a telephone message Friday, but he
did not receive it until he returned to work Monday morning after a
weekend trip. Braine said he called Housel back Monday, leaving
messages at his office and his home, but as of early Tuesday
afternoon he still had not spoken directly to Housel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked with (Georgia Tech president) Dr. (Wayne) Clough (on
Monday),'' Braine said. ``We will give him permission to talk to
Auburn. It's protocol to do it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Alabama newspapers reported early this week that O'Leary
interviewed for the Auburn job Friday, but O'Leary and Braine
adamantly denied that report. O'Leary was in his Tech office Friday
morning, was scheduled to fly to a speaking engagement in
Spartanburg, S.C., in the middle of the day and returned to his
office Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did (interview), it'd be a shock to me,'' Braine said.
``George is too focused. He's not going to do something like that
during the season. I really think we have a good enough
relationship that he would have asked for permission.''

 &HT;    Gators' Johnson reaches maturity as QB
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gainesville, Fla. -- Doug Johnson, the junior from Gainesville
whose career has been a series of ups and downs, has enjoyed his
most consistent three-game stretch as Gator quarterback. In wins
over Georgia, Vanderbilt, and South Carolina, Johnson has completed
61.4 percent of his passes for 1,118 yards and 10 touchdowns.
Johnson's play gives the No. 4 Gators a realistic shot of knocking
off No. 5 Florida State when the two powerhouses meet in
Tallahassee on Saturday (3:30 p.m., ABC).
</P>
<P>
   Even coach Steve Spurrier, who had been skeptical about
Johnson's long-term future as his quarterback, is beginning to
throw some compliments Johnson's way.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seems to be seeing the field a little better and getting us
out of a bad play and into a good play a little better, too,''
Spurrier said. ''Doug has been playing pretty (well) for us lately.
I would still like to think he can play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it is quite an improvement for a guy who was not the
starting quarterback on Oct. 10. Johnson had lost the job to
sophomore Jesse Palmer, who was performing better in practice and
making fewer mistakes in games. But Palmer suffered a shoulder
injury against LSU, and Johnson became the starter by default.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also started spending more time studying film and
learning about Spurrier's sophisticated offense. He began to keep
in his back pocket a piece of paper with the plays for that week's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doug's starting to carry his ball plays around with him and
studies them when he gets a free moment,'' said Spurrier. ''That's
encouraging and it's certainly beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Johnson is beginning to show the kind of dedication to the
game that Spurrier demands of a quarterback. Last year, after
Johnson broke curfew and lost his job, Spurrier wondered to close
associates whether Johnson's commitment to the game would ever
equal his talent. The two apparently are drawing close.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think I'm stronger mentally and I'm a little bit
stronger person,'' said Johnson, who had shoulder surgery in the
off-season. ''I certainly know I'm a smarter person and a smarter
player. When you go through a lot of stuff like I have, the big
winners are the ones who survive and get stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   A new mindset does not account for all of Johnson's improvement.
Spurrier made some changes in the offense, beginning with the
Georgia game, when he went to a no-huddle attack, often with five
wide receivers. By getting the play earlier and not huddling,
Johnson says, he is more comfortable making changes at the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of my job is to get us into the right play, and now I can
do it because coach Spurrier gets the play in so quickly,'' Johnson
said.. ''It's when you're pressed for time that you tend to make
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago against Florida State, Johnson had the biggest moment
in what was a otherwise disappointing sophomore season. With the
Gators trailing 29-25 and about two minutes left, Johnson called an
audible and hit Jacquez Green for a 63-yard completion that set up
Fred Taylor's one-yard run for a touchdown. Florida stunned No. 1
Florida State and knocked the Seminoles out of a shot at the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida State win ``really saved my season,'' Johnson said.
''It was a new breath of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has another opportunity to build on his Florida legacy.
A win over the Seminoles' would be the Gators' first in Tallahassee
since 1986. It also would keep Florida's hopes alive for a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can tell you is that now we're having a lot of fun,''
Johnson said. ''Coach Spurrier feels comfortable enough with me to
call a wide-open game. And that's the way I like it.''

STORY OF DAVY CROCKETT'S EXECUTION HITS THE AUCTION BLOCK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.C., Tenn., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A memoir purportedly written 150 years ago by an
obscure Mexican military officer that details, among other things,
the aftermath of a battle and the execution of one of the losing
combatants, is expected to draw as much as half a million dollars
when it goes on the auction block Wednesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why, it helps to know that the battle in question
is the Alamo and the combatant a man in a coonskin cap named Davy
Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no subject in Texas that is more serious _ even
sacred _ than the events surrounding the deaths in 1836 of more
than 180 defenders of the small mission on what was then the
outskirts of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central facet of the controversy that has risen up around
the diary is this: Did Davy Crockett go down swinging like Walt
Disney wanted to see it or did he allow himself to be captured and
then executed?'' said James Crisp, a history professor at North
Carolina State University who has studied the documents and written
extensively on them.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp and other historians believe that the papers of Jose
Enrique de la Pena _ a diary written during the Texas revolution, a
subsequently expanded memoir incorporating other accounts and
various supporting documents _ are genuine and that the stories he
tells, including the execution of Crockett, probably are, too.
</P>
<P>
   Others vehemently dispute this, call the papers a sophisticated
forgery and insist that the former Tennessee congressman, as other
eyewitness accounts have it, fought to the bitter end, swinging his
rifle, ``Old Betsy,'' like a baseball bat at the approaching
Mexican soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   None of the critics have advanced a theory on why anyone would
have gone to the trouble to concoct such an elaborate forgery, but
they point to what they say are inconsistencies and anachronisms in
the text.
</P>
<P>
   One leading critic, Bill Groneman, a New York City fire captain
and amateur Alamo historian who published the book ``Defense of a
Legend: Crockett and the de la Pena Diary'' in 1994, says he knows
why some of the historians insist on believing the diary genuine.
``People want to adjust history to the way they want it to be,''
Groneman said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's what they say about him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're looking at is an icon inside of an icon,'' Crisp
said. ``It's the icon of Crockett inside the icon of the Alamo. The
Alamo is a significant part of the American mythic narrative of how
we became a nation and Davy Crockett is the most famous person at
the Alamo. It's a pretty emotional subject for some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Shaw, vice president for books and manuscripts at
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield in Los Angeles, said the auction house
has been stunned by the level of passionate interest following news
of the sale of the diaries by the heirs of John Peace, a longtime
San Antonio lawyer and chairman of the University of Texas Board of
Regents, who purchased them in the mid-1970s from the widow of a
Mexican antique dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen,'' Shaw said. ``We're
sitting out here in California scratching our heads going, what the
heck?''
</P>
<P>
   The memoirs, historians believe, were written sometime in the
late 1830s by de la Pena in an effort to expose what he saw as the
ineptitude of top Mexican leaders in the war. The Crockett episode
is just one short incident in the long narrative, but it has drawn
almost all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   As described by de la Pena, Crockett was one of seven survivors
of the battle who were brought before the winning general, Antonio
Lopez de Santa Anna. An officer explained to Santa Anna that one
survivor was ``the naturalist David Crockett, well known in North
America for his unusual adventures,'' who had taken refuge in the
Alamo when the fighting started. Santa Anna responded with ``a
gesture of indignation'' and ordered Crockett and the others
killed.
</P>
<P>
   At first, soldiers refused to do it, de la Pena wrote, ``hoping
that once the fury of the moment had blown over these men would be
spared.'' But eventually other soldiers ``fell upon these
unfortunate, defenseless men just as a tiger leaps upon his prey''
and tortured them to death with swords and bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These unfortunates died without complaining and without
humiliating themselves before their torturers,'' de la Pena wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a seemingly heroic death would be unacceptable to those
who revere Crockett _ outside of the suggestion that he had tried
to talk his way out of it by claiming to be an innocent naturalist
_ is a mystery to many who have read the memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They died like true soldiers, like men with honor,'' Shaw
said. ``Where does that impugn any basic man stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he bought the de la Pena documents, Peace placed
them with his other items of Texana in the hands of the University
of Texas at San Antonio, where they have remained as the John Peace
Collection in the John Peace Library. His son, John Peace 3rd,
decided to sell the documents earlier this year because he was
concerned by reports, since denied, that the university intended to
break up the collection and because he was growing increasingly
weary of answering questions from all the people stirred up by the
controversy, said Lisa Wolf, a spokeswoman for the family.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy broke in 1975 when the memoir portion of the de
la Pena documents was translated into English. Though there had
been other accounts of men's being executed after the Alamo
fighting, including Crockett, the memoir seemed to many to be
particularly authoritative and corroborative.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1978, Dan Kilgore, president of the Texas State
Historical Association, published a book called ``How Did Davy
Crockett Die?'' in which he accepted the de la Pena memoir as
genuine. A firestorm ignited with many in Texas, and around the
country, expressing outrage at the idea that Crockett had not died
while fighting to the last.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Crockett's whole life argues against him doing this,'' said
Thomas Ricks Lidley, a mental health worker and private researcher
in Austin who is also a critic of the diaries. ``A man with such
bravery, I don't see it in his character.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy surrounding the debate has not dissipated for more
than two decades, and it is now reaching a peak as the papers go on
the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   The auction house had originally valued the manuscript at
$200,000 to $300,000, but based on more recent expressions of
serious interest it feels that it may go for as much as $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that both sides agree upon is that the de la Pena
papers go into the hands of someone who will keep them open to
scholars, and perhaps complete the task of translating all of them
into English. This is by no means certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest fear,'' Crisp said, ``is that some right-wing nut
case will put down a bunch of money and then throw it in the
fireplace.''

 &HT;    Bad boy's back in town: Luke Perry returns to `90210'
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Not unlike a young Orson Welles.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke Perry suggests that would make a good opening line for this
article. That's just how Perry is. Helpful, yes. But, more
important, determined not to take himself too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, nothing like Dylan McKay, the brooding
surfer-cum-stinkin' rich kid he played for five seasons on Fox's
``Beverly Hills, 90210'' before leaving to make movies in 1995. His
attitude as defiantly out there as his sideburns, Dylan was by
turns an alcoholic, a high school dropout, a widowed newlywed
(something about a Mob feud) and, along with Shannen Doherty, part
of the most deliciously dysfunctional teen couple since Romeo
swapped poison with Juliet.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's back. Tonight, Perry, 32, rejoins ``90210,'' his
McKay character finally having quit Europe to ``look for'' himself
back home _ and he's wilder and richer than ever, according to the
former teen idol.
</P>
<P>
   Perry isn't saying how long he'll stay on ``90210,'' although
he's reportedly committed for at least a dozen episodes, after
which he'll get to create his own series for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox may be owned by Rupert Murdoch, but Perry says his idol is
none other than Atlanta media mogul (and Murdoch rival) Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted's great. He's the American dream,'' said Perry, slyly
adding that he'd like to sit down to lunch with the Braves owner
and new Dodgers owner Murdoch. ``The man started out with a
billboard and some bad debts, and now he's the king!''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Perry on some other subjects:
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's it like being back on ``90210''?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's like driving your very first car again. Sometimes it's
uncomfortable. Most of the time it's very familiar. But I know how
the damn thing works, you know?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you surprised ``90210'' is still around?
</P>
<P>
   A: The show's constructed mostly of silicone and hairspray, both
of which have a life expectancy of at least 100 years. So God only
knows how long this thing can be on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Give us a status report on Dylan's sideburns.
</P>
<P>
   A: When we had figured out that it was probably a good idea for
me to come back, I was sans sideburns. And I still am. But now that
I'm there, I'm thinking I gotta go a little old school, maybe get
them sideburns out . I . I . I'm definitely not coming back with
just one. They come in pairs!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you watch ``90210'' after you left?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't watch a single one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your favorite color of Donna Martin's (actress Tori
Spelling's) hair?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh! Toto's hair, yeah! I like it about where it is now
because this is pretty close to the natural color. And it's a color
found in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What will Dylan do? Will he finally get a job?
</P>
<P>
   A: No! If you had all that money, would you have a job? It's
like, how are you going to get Shaquille O'Neal to shoot foul
shots? He has $110 million, he doesn't care if he makes his foul
shots or not . I . I . I'm really into hedonism and I think we
should represent a lot more of that on the show. Remember when it
used to be all bikinis and sunshine? I liked that!
</P>
<P>
   Q:What are the chances we'll see Shannen Doherty on ``90210'' in
the near future?
</P>
<P>
   A: Could you define for me ``near future''?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Uh, some time before the show goes off the air.
</P>
<P>
   A: Could you define for me Shannen Doherty?! Here's the rule in
the world of Aaron Spelling: Nothing is impossible. It's up to
Shan, you know? And I've never been able to read Shannen's mind. I
can tell you that obviously I care about the girl a great deal and
I imagine at some point they'll ask her. Can you imagine the
ratings on that one?!
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you deal with tabloid reports of you dating Calista
Flockhart?
</P>
<P>
   A: Calista's a nice girl and I think everybody knows it's not
true. But it just shows _ I mean what was I doing? I was sitting at
a baseball game (the World Series) and she happened to be sitting
beside me. They didn't say anything that Denzel Washington and
Bruce Willis were on the other side, did they?So I'm just gonna do
whatever I'm gonna do, and they're gonna write whatever they're
gonna write, but, I don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've become pop culture shorthand for cool. How's it feel
being mentioned on episodes of ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``South Park''?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's good. As long as it wasn't Cartman-related! That's like
one night I was a ``Jeopardy!'' answer and I almost fell over.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much did you cost?
</P>
<P>
   A: Excuse me, I was the Daily Double in Double Jeopardy! and I
believe the woman won $3,800 by knowing it was me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what was the category?
</P>
<P>
   A: Uhh. Bad TV Actors With Cool Hair?

ANALYSIS: IMPEACHMENT PROBE AS POLITICAL THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also IMPEACH-STARR, MONICA-VOICE) 
(bl)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite all of the distracting jockeying over
witnesses and evidence Tuesday, one truth shone clearly about the
House impeachment inquiry: A process once conceived of as a matter
of supreme seriousness has become just another piece of political
theater on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, was supposed to save his party from just such a pitfall
as the senior statesman who would lead the House through the
nation's third impeachment proceeding against a president.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Hyde was not the biting Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
whose Senate Whitewater hearings tarnished him before he was
defeated this year. Nor was he the hot-headed Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., whose campaign finance hearings were so discredited that
Burton had to dismiss his chief investigator.
</P>
<P>
   But now as the House Judiciary Committee prepares to call
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr as its first witness Thursday,
Hyde presides over an investigation that has become a terrible
millstone for his party.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hyde has yet to call a single witness, the public long
ago made up its mind that it wanted Clinton to remain in office. It
signaled that first in polls, and then, more forcefully, in the
mid-term elections earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   This vexing quandary is causing Hyde and his committee to veer
first in one direction and then another as they seek to make their
investigation seem more credible _ and to deal with House members
who just want to call the whole thing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Election Day two weeks ago, Republican interest in
impeaching this president is running out of gas,'' said Rep. Jack
Quinn, R-N.Y. ``Henry Hyde is in a bit of a bind there. He's
started down this track. Now the question becomes how do we stop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has repeatedly insisted that his task as chairman of the
same committee that presided over the Watergate inquiry 24 years
ago is to enforce the law and make sure no man stands above it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States is the trustee of the
nation's conscience,'' he said the day the House voted to authorize
an impeachment inquiry. ``We are entitled to explore fairly, fully
and expeditiously the circumstances that have been alleged to
compromise that position.''
</P>
<P>
   But more and more Republicans are saying that the House may very
well lack the votes to impeach the president, and the incoming
speaker, Robert Livingston of Louisiana, is said to want the
investigation wrapped up. In this atmosphere, Hyde is having a
great deal of trouble balancing the imperatives of a fair and full
investigation with the idea of an expeditious one.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hyde and committee Republicans thought the solution
was to showcase Starr as the only major witness, accept the record
that the independent counsel submitted to the House when he said
``substantial and credible evidence'' existed of 11 possibly
impeachable offenses, and leave it to Clinton to contest any of
Starr's findings when the president answered 81 questions _ some
pointed _ from the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But that brought stinging criticism from the Democrats that
Starr was witness to nothing and that he was simply being given a
platform to rehabilitate his image. He could not resolve the
discrepancies that exist between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky about
their sexual contact, nor Ms. Lewinsky's differences with Betty
Currie, Clinton's secretary, about why Ms. Currie retrieved gifts
the president had given to the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Some committee Republicans also say they were concerned that
they were not building the clear factual record that would allow
them to charge the president with perjury, obstruction of justice
and witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of history, 10 years from now when I look back on how
I cast a vote, I want to say I did it on a factual record and
eyewitness testimony,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who
serves on the Judiciary Committee. ``I think that is important.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday the Republicans decided to call new witnesses, and
were weighing going beyond the Lewinsky matter to hear from John
Huang, the former Democratic fund-raiser who was at the center of
the campaign finance controversy in 1996. Huang has been granted
immunity from Starr for cooperating in his investigation of Webster
Hubbell, the former No. 3 official in the Clinton Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans sought in part to blame the Democrats for the
new strategy. They noted that the president has yet to respond to
the 81 questions he was sent and that Democrats _ who even briefly
Tuesday threatened to boycott Thursday's hearing _ want to put
Starr on trial instead of the president.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the case that as uncooperative as the Democrats
have been, the committee itself did nothing for nearly a month,
despite knowing that it wanted to complete its inquiry by year's
end. It took no depositions and waited for the Election Day mandate
that never came.
</P>
<P>
   So now, the committee's Republicans wait to see whether
something will change the sense that they are investigating a
president who will never be convicted in the Senate and might not
be impeached by the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have the hearings and have the debate,'' Hutchinson
said. ``I hope Congress will be listening to it and we'll see if it
changes the dynamics.''

 &HT;    A shopping head start
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLANDS, N.C. _ Some folks visit this lovely mountain town in
autumn to unwind, others to explore the many waterfalls in the area
or to hike the woodland trails. Many come for the hunt, armed not
with rifle or bow but checkbook and charge cards, ready to scope
out merchandise and bag some great finds.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to shopping, it's open season here _ but that
hasn't always been the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Used to be we didn't open the door until Memorial Day and we
closed it up after Labor Day,'' says Christy Kelly, executive
director of the Highlands Chamber of Commerce. ``Now, most
merchants are open at least through December or January, and many
are staying open all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest shopping day of the season _ the day after
Thanksgiving _ is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody comes up Thanksgiving,'' says Ann Jacob, who runs
galleries in Buckhead and Highlands. ``They come in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the cultural scene is on hold _ the Highlands Playhouse
summer season has ended and the big fall art shows are over _ the
town does not slumber through the holidays. The lighting of the
town the Friday night after Thanksgiving is followed by the Olde
Mountain Christmas Parade down Main Street Dec. 5 and the Highlands
Community Players' Annual Christmas Reading Dec.12 at the Episcopal
Church of the Incarnation's Great Hall.
</P>
<P>
   If the crowds on a recent weekend are any indication, a lot of
shoppers weren't waiting for Thanksgiving to start marking off
their holiday lists. Cars cruised Main Street in a game of
motorized musical chairs, drivers hoping to snag a freshly vacated
parking space.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the altitude. There's something about the air at
4,118 feet above sea level that renders you powerless over all that
merchandise calling your name from the rows of shops on and off
Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   The spiffy clothing, the dazzling jewelry, the Old World glass
Christmas ornaments, the antique cuckoo clock from the Black
Forest, the mint-condition Majolica, the Bubba teeth. the Bubba
teeth?
</P>
<P>
   The decaying, gap-toothed dentures straight out of
``Deliverance'' were flying out of the well-stocked Toy Store on
Main Street at $15 a pop _ a novelty among the mostly upscale
offerings in this mountain shopping mecca that has been charming
browsers and buyers for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Highlands was founded as a summer resort in 1875 by Samuel
Kelsey and Clinton Hutchinson, whose names are immortalized in the
new Kelsey &AMP; Hutchinson Lodge, an inn and several cottages perched
above the town at Spring and Fourth streets. In 1928, the Highlands
Country Club was built and Old Buckhead headed north for the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is still the big season _ the population swells to 20,000
June through August _ but the town is becoming more of a year-round
destination. And the proliferation of businesses makes it clear
shoppers are as welcome as the golfers and hikers and other
outdoorsy types.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping district is no longer confined to two blocks on
Main Street and ``On the Hill'' along Fourth Street between Main
and Spring streets. Businesses have opened just blocks away at
Highlands Plaza, Wright Square and Mountain Brook Center and on
U.S. 64 toward Cashiers, where you'll find the Apple Mountain
Shoppes and Celtic Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Serious shoppers can pick up a shopping guide and map at the
Chamber of Commerce in Town Hall, a block off Main Street on Fourth
Street.
</P>
<P>
   As we strolled from shop to shop, we found many temptations:
handmade wreaths of dried flowers, herbs and fruits at the Little
Flower Shoppe ($150 to $650), cozy afghans at Goodwin Weavers
($14.95 to $79, but most are $39.99), festive quilted Christmas
throws ($29-$119) at Azure Rose Quilts and adorable plush purses by
Wildkins for little girls in the shape of ponies, pigs, doggies and
kittens at the Grinning Frog ($22.95).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the items are distchain lodging. One block off Main at
N.C. 106. 1-800-426-7866.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Highlands Inn: Dates to 1880; on National Register of Historic
Places. Main Street (at Fourth). 1-800-964-6955.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Highlands Suite Hotel: New, two-bedroom suites. On Main Street
(at Second). 1-800-221-5078.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kelsey &AMP; Hutchinson Lodge: New lodge and cottages on three
acres overlooking downtown. 450 Spring St. 1-888-245-9058.

   &QR;  Old Edwards Inn: Charming rooms with period furnishings in

</P>
<P>
   Beyond shopping
</P>
<P>
   At least seven scenic waterfalls are within 20 miles of
Highlands, as are several hiking trails. The Visitor Center at
Fourth and Oak streets can provide maps (828-526-2112). Or stop by
the U.S. Forest Service two miles from town on U.S. 64 east at Flat
Mountain Road (828-526-3765). For golfers, Trillium Links is open
to the public (1-888-909-7171).

 &HT;    Ted Turner eats it
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge, Don O'Briant and John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ted Turner's taking a serious bite out of his
15,000-strong buffalo herd.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Turner announced he was selling meat products though
a new company, U.S. Bison, where son Teddy chairs the board.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he announced a partnership with Atlanta's Buckhead
Beef Co. to distribute this other red meat throughout the
Southeast. Over a gourmet buffalunch at Buckhead Beef, the Turners
schmoozed Atlanta's top chefs.
</P>
<P>
   The vittles were a far cry from the still-pulsating buffalo
heart Kevin Costner chowed down in ``Dances With Wolves.'' Nava
chef Kevin Rathbun prepared buffalo tartare tacos, buffalo/wild
rice sausage and smoked buffalo short ribs and pecan-crusted
dry-aged bison strip.
</P>
<P>
   What does it taste like? Very tender, very lean beef. But it's
much healthier, with less fat and cholesterol and fewer calories
than chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Will Turner take a break from his low-fat buffaloaf to really
follow through on that presidential bid? ``I have been thinking
about it since 1979, and if I don't do it soon it will be too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   But Turner claims he was ``just thinking out loud. I wish it
hadn't gotten out. Must've been a slow news day.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing hard time
</P>
<P>
   Actor-crooner Harry Connick Jr. certainly is serious about his
part in ``Letters From a Wayward Son,'' being filmed in the Atlanta
area.
</P>
<P>
   To research his role, he consented to being put in leg irons and
bound in handcuffs for two days in the Angola, La., prison. Connick
was clad in prison clothes and restrained for his trip to Camp J, a
solitary unit at the notorious state penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   An unshaven Connick had planned to do three days in solitary but
signaled to get out a day early, saying ``it was too quiet'' and
``the food wasn't too good,'' Warden Burl Cain said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inmates didn't know who he was,'' Cain said. ``They
nicknamed him Youngster.''
</P>
<P>
   Connick agreed to do a spring concert for inmates and to help
raise money to build prison chapels. His father, Harry Sr., the
Orleans Parish district attorney, helped set up the gig.
</P>
<P>
   Obsessing over Wolfe
</P>
<P>
   Think we're obsessed with Tom Wolfe's new book? Well, maybe so.
But we're not the only ones spilling ink over ``A Man in Full'' and
its portrayal of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the front-page headline of Tuesday's Los Angeles
Times: ``Wolfe Fascinated by Atlanta's Excesses _ and Vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times piece says:
</P>
<P>
   Observing Atlanta grow in leaps and bounds, while naming every
new building and boulevard ``International This'' or ``World
That,'' Wolfe sees the city positioning itself to become the next
great international center _ ``Chocolate Mecca,'' as one of his
characters calls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' Wolfe said, ``New York is the place you have to
go if you want to be where the most important things are happening.
It used to be Rome, certainly back in the 17th Century. Then it was
Paris. At one time it was London.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 21st Century, he adds, it may be Atlanta. ``It might
happen,'' he said, shaking his head at the improbability.

 &HT;    School band finds a passel of performers
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Country people in Georgia have ever been big on music.
</P>
<P>
   They may have been poor in many respects, but they were rich in
their appreciation and performance of music.
</P>
<P>
   All of us knew the song:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tune up my fiddle
</P>
<P>
   I'll rosin my bow
</P>
<P>
   I'll make sweet music wherever I go.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Sweet Apple and Crabapple (Ga.) and environs are not
country anymore. They are surrounded by shopping centers and
subdivisions, but that old pleasure in music survives.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of that the other day when I heard that 40 parents and
teachers had joined their children at the new Northwestern Middle
School (Ga.) for a concert they are putting on this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Why did they think to do that, I asked my grandchild Betsy, who
proudly serves as first trombonist in the symphonic band. She shook
her head. She didn't know except that they loved to hear music and
they loved to play it.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and fathers went home and pulled out the dusty trombones
and clarinets they had played in their own school days and went to
practice. Betsy's father lucked into the long-stored saxophone of
his college days and went to join them.
</P>
<P>
   As they talked of the program, at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in the
school gym, I thought of my first neighbors at Sweet Apple.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have much in the way of worldly goods, but there
wasn't a house in the settlement that didn't have an old parlor
organ or a fiddle or a banjo.
</P>
<P>
   Our dear old neighbor Lum Crow was a prime banjo picker (he
called it his ``racket box''), and he attributed some of its tone
to the fact that he used real cat skin on its cover. And there
wasn't a family that didn't have a pretty good singer in it.
</P>
<P>
   We loved to go to our neighbors' gatherings and have them to
ours, and I remember with sadness that one young guitarist, now
dead, lingered after everybody else had gone home because he was
embarrassed that we had paid his group of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gon' play you a tune you can't pay for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was dying, the dishwasher was whining, we were
party-tired and sleepy, but we pulled up chairs and listened, and
it was the loveliest old mountain ballad we ever heard. It was true
_ a tune we couldn't pay for.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), in his fine autobiography,
``Walking With the Wind,'' tells of church singing in his
childhood. The country church he attended had no hymn books, no
piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was music, music richer and sweeter than any I have
ever heard since,'' Lewis writes. ``I'm talking about pure singing,
the sound of voices fueled by the spirit, people keeping rhythm
with a beat they heard in their hearts, singing songs that came
straight from their soul, with words that they felt in every bone
of their body.''
</P>
<P>
   The Northwestern concert Thursday night will be rich in
instruments, and the music they play _ designed to stir memories of
the 1950s and '60s _ will be memorable. The concert is free. To get
there, go to Crabapple Corners near Alpharetta, Ga., and turn on
Birmingham Road. It's a new school with lots of parking.

 &HT;    `Star Wars' ad: If you show it they will come
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was an intergalactic reunion as ``Star Wars'' fans
showed up in three metro theaters Tuesday to get a sneak peek at
its prequel, ``Episode I: The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The first look at writer-director George Lucas' latest, which
won't hit theaters until May 21, drew more than two dozen viewers
to United Artists North Point, Ga. theatre for a 1:45 p.m.
screening of ``The Waterboy.'' The trailer, which begins its
regular run in theaters Friday, was screened before and after the
Adam Sandler comedy. At AMC Southlake Pavilion in Morrow , Ga., and
AMC Colonial in Lawrenceville, Ga., the trailer was also attached
to screenings of ``Meet Joe Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the on-screen words ``Every generation has a
legend,'' the trailer begins slowly, with glimpses of several
locations: a swamplike place, with hard-to-see creatures moving
through fog toward the camera. The familiar golden desert of
Tatooine,with an enormous silver spaceship stretched on the sand.
An aerial view of a regal-looking city (computer-generated), with
airborne vehicles flying toward a central palatial building.
</P>
<P>
   Then _ boom. Like the MillenniumFalcon hitting light speed, the
trailer jumps to quick cuts that show old characters _ Yoda, R2-D2
and a C3PO so new he's a maze of wires not yet encased in gold _
and new cast members, including Liam Neeson as Jedi master Qui
Gon-Jinn; young Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker; Pernilla August as
his mother, Shmi; Natalie Portman as Princess Padme; Samuel L.
Jackson as Mace Windu; and Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-Wan
Kenobi.
</P>
<P>
   It also has glimpses of light-saber fights; exotic,
computer-generated creatures; and a dizzying spaceship race over a
rocky desert floor, recalling the forest chase in ``Return of the
Jedi.'' The film apparently focuses on Anakin, the future Darth
Vader, when he first meets his Jedi instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a ``Star Wars'' baseball cap, Kristopher Graham, 24,
drove to Alpharetta's (Ga.) North Point from Dawsonville, Ga., just
to see the trailer. ``I love it when Liam Neeson's character tells
Anakin, `Anakin Skywalker, this is Obi-Wan Kenobi,' '' he said of
the scene in which the future Darth Vader meets his mentor. ``That
sets up the whole story for the six or nine movies, whatever number
Lucas decides to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Roger and Stuart Wolf (23 and 21, respectively) came
for the preview. ``We've been waiting for this since word first
came out that there was actually going to be a `Star Wars'
prequel,'' said Roger, who lives in Dunwoody, Ga. ``The technology
has finally caught up and gotten to a point where George Lucas can
show us what he wants us to see.''
</P>
<P>
   They stayed to watch the Sandler flick. Several others left
their seats and headed to another theater showing ``The Waterboy,''
which had started at noon.

   Having seen the trailer twice already, Roswell, Ga., resident
Gary Harrison, 27, was heading back to catch it a third time, at
the end of the movie. He was impressed by what he saw, especially
the light-saber battles. ``They look a lot more intense than the
first couple of movies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer shows enough to please fans without giving away too
much of the plot. In Graham's words: ``It's awesome. It sends
chills down you.

 &HT;    Powerpuff Girls do battle with Mojo
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hopefully, daughters everywhere have given up those trendy Spice
Girls. They're so over anyway _ or should be after tonight's debut
of Cartoon Network's half-hour animated wonder ``The Powerpuff
Girls'' (8 p.m. EST)
</P>
<P>
   These elementary 'toon babes aren't just girls. They're grrrls.
</P>
<P>
   Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup are a trio of young, cute,
doe-eyed crimefighting sisters who fly in and manhandle evil butt _
usually right after their beauty sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Their show, created by Craig McCracken, is often a kick _ from
eye-popping homages to '50s chic and Japanese animation to
smile-inducing wisecracks aimed at adults so they won't lose their
minds while watching with the kids.
</P>
<P>
   These girls, like many crimefighting characters, got their
superpowers quite by accident.
</P>
<P>
   They live in the suburbs of Townsville with Professor Utonium
who set out originally to create the world's most perfect little
darlings. He mixed sugar and spice with everything nice _ then by
accident dropped in a big dose of Chemical X.
</P>
<P>
   In tonight's first two 11-minute episodes, the Powerpuff Girls
do battle with Mojo Jojo, a mad monkey turning the citizens of
Townsville into obedient dogs, and a seemingly sweet woman who,
when the professor's not looking, turns into ``Mommie Fearest.''
</P>
<P>
   Your daughter will likely love it. You the adult, however, must
always remember all of this: Blossom with the long hair and red bow
is the leader. She wears pink. Bubbles has blonde pig tails and
wears blue. Buttercup has short dark hair and wears green.
Blossom's the smart one, Bubbles is the sensitive one and Buttercup
just wants to beat up baddies.
</P>
<P>
   Got it? For your sake, we certainly hope so.

REVIVING AN OPERATIC IMMORTAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred years ago Sunday, Pietro Mascagni's opera ``Iris''
had its premiere at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome, the same theater
in which, eight years before, his first and most famous opera,
``Cavalleria Rusticana,'' received 60 curtain calls at its
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas ``Cavalleria'' ushered in the era of verismo, which
sought to dramatize the lives of ordinary people, ``Iris'' came at
the height of the ``japonisme'' that swept the arts in Europe in
the second half of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The centennial of the work, which was last heard at the
Metropolitan Opera in 1931, will be celebrated on Monday evening
with a concert performance by Teatro Grattacielo at Alice Tully
Hall in New York City. While preparations have been under way,
associations and connections have evolved on many levels, including
a conductor, Fiora Contino, whose father sang in Mascagni's operas
and some elaborate Whistlerian costumes that connote the Esthetic
Movement's interpretation of the Japanesque.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second opera presented by Teatro Grattacielo,
which was founded in 1994 and is named for a movie house in postwar
Genoa, where Maria Callas and others performed while the city's
bombed-out opera house was rebuilt. The name, Skyscraper Theater,
is especially appropriate to a New York setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see our mission as a kind of historic preservation of
operas, specifically in the verismo style, that the larger opera
houses can no longer afford to stage,'' said Thurmond Smithgall,
who directs the company along with Duane D. Printz, one of its
founders. As former opera singers themselves, Smithgall and Ms.
Printz are also devoted to giving young singers opportunities to
perform in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the lead singers in ``Iris,'' including Karen Notare in
the title role, will be making New York debuts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Contino, the general director of Opera
Illinois, will make her New York conducting debut. As the youngest
daughter of Ferruccio Corradetti, an Italian baritone, Ms. Contino
was born into the verismo tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Corradetti, before moving to New York and establishing a
prolific recording career, sang under Mascagni's direction in Rome
in 1901, when his ``Maschere'' was given its premiere in six
Italian opera houses on the same night. One of Ms. Contino's
half-sisters, Iris Adami Corradetti, a soprano and voice teacher,
was named for Mascagni's Japanese heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Mascagni was the second composer (after Alberto Franchetti) to
whom the librettist, Luigi Illica, had shown his work for ``Iris,''
inspired by the Japanese legend ``The Maid Who Loved Flowers.''
Illica had discovered the tale in an anthology of Japanese and
Chinese poetry, ``Le Livre de Jade,'' compiled in France and
translated into Italian.
</P>
<P>
   He included long descriptive passages, which were not meant to
be set to music but which establish the mood and setting for each
of the three acts. The libretto, including those passages, has been
newly translated for the printed program by Ms. Printz.
</P>
<P>
   In the opera, Iris, a village maiden, is coveted by Osaka, a
nobleman, for her beauty. A procurer, Kyoto, plots her abduction by
means of a puppet show. Iris is distracted by Osaka's seductive
voice as one of the puppets and carried off to the geisha district
of a nearby town.
</P>
<P>
   Osaka, bored by her innocence and protestations, leaves her to
Kyoto, who displays her to the town. Among the bystanders is her
blind, saintly father, who reviles her in a mistaken belief that
she left him purposely. In her shame, she jumps into a sewer and
dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an impressionistic opera, it echoes Debussy's `Pelleas et
Melisande,' Ms. Contino said recently in her New York studio. ``And
in breaking harmonic rules, it resembles works by Mussorgsky.''
Listening to recordings of the opera, Ms. Contino became aware that
they did not represent the music as she heard it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bar lines should fall away to reveal supple blending of words
and music,'' she said. She sang a few lines, following the score
with her finger, to show how to achieve a more natural sound.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mascagni did not include Japanese instruments in the
orchestration, he suggested their dissonance and timbre with an
assortment of strings and gongs surrounding melodic lines
reminiscent of Wagner. Giacomo Puccini, who attended opening night
and called the instrumentation ``dazzling and colorful,'' profited
from Mascagni's experiment and sought greater authenticity when he
came to compose ``Madama Butterfly,'' which appeared in 1904.
Illica also had a hand in the ``Butterfly'' libretto, working with
Giuseppe Giacosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iris'' has been receiving attention in recent years,
specifically in London; Opera Holland Park performed it in a full
outdoor production during the last two summers, with costumes by
the Welsh designers Charles and Patricia Lester, whose costumes for
the film ``Wings of the Dove'' were last year nominated for an
Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   Their costumes for ``Iris,'' a cross between Whistler's
``Princesse du Pays de la Porcelaine'' and portraits by Klimt, so
successfully paralleled the music in a timeless fantasy version of
Japanese dress that Teatro Grattacielo has borrowed them for the
New York performance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing captures the spirit of the opera so well as the
field of purple irises that adorns the heroine's kimono as she
sings her opening aria. Beautiful on its own terms, it also
presages the vision of immortality that concludes the work, as the
sun rises on a sea of irises.

SOMETIMES THE PLAYER'S THE THING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It will come as no surprise to Nicole Kidman's screen
admirers to learn that she also looks sexy and beautiful on stage,
not least when scantily dressed. Yet this unremarkable discovery
threw British newspapers into a veritable swoon this fall when she
made her first stage appearance in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   A few theater critics did actually notice her performance (``she
(italics)can(end italics) act''). But far more space was dedicated
to poetic, erotic and clinical (``no _ repeat, no _ cellulite'')
ruminations about her body. The normally staid London Daily
Telegraph was quite overwhelmed. ``Pure theatrical Viagra,'' it
gasped.
</P>
<P>
   True, sex (italics)is(end italics) the theme of the play, ``The
Blue Room,'' David Hare's loose adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's
turn-of-the-century play ``Reigen,'' or round-dance, now better
known as ``La Ronde.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten characters (Ms. Kidman and the British actor Iain Glen each
play five) engage in a daisy-chain of sexual encounters. Copulation
is suggested every time the stage goes dark, with surtitles coyly
offering how long each of the 10 couplings supposedly lasts. And
yes, for the briefest of moments, the tall, lissome actress does
stand naked, her back to the audience, as her partner dresses her.
But what is it with the Brits? This was theater, not live sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an element of the British that is kind of
pathetically grateful for a glamorous star gracing our boards,''
said Sam Mendes, who directed the play at the 250-seat Donmar
Warehouse in Covent Garden. ``Even those who have seen the play
have written about something that isn't really on stage. This is
not the kind of violently erotic `Oh, Calcutta!'-style review that
has been reported here. They wrote about the wrong things. They
didn't write about the play.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright seems to have taken it all in stride. ``As far as
the British press were concerned, the play was simply a chariot
that was carrying Nicole Kidman into town,'' Hare said. ``I don't
think they noticed there was a play. Plainly, there was something
magnetic about Nicole's presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after eight weeks of sold-out performances in London, where
the rich paid upward of $1,000 for a ticket and the poor waited 12
hours for returns, ``The Blue Room'' moves to Broadway to test the
response of a New York audience to the Kidman phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Will they, too, scramble to view the 31-year-old Australian aka
Mrs. Tom Cruise in various states of undress? The New York
producers evidently hope so, since they have scheduled a longer run
in a larger theater than in London. With previews beginning on
Friday at the 900-seat Cort Theater, and the opening scheduled for
Dec. 13, the 100-minute play involving, as the advertisements say,
``10 intimate acts'' ... and no intermission is scheduled to run
through March 7.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hype, though, Ms. Kidman's purpose was hardly to
encourage voyeurism. Rather, having begun her acting career in the
theater in Australia in the mid-1980s, she said she simply missed
appearing on stage. After Ms. Kidman moved to the United States and
married Cruise, she made her name in such movies as ``To Die For,''
``Dead Calm'' and ``A Portrait of a Lady'' (her latest film,
``Practical Magic,'' opened last month).
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, she always preferred seeing plays to movies. And
when she and Cruise half-settled in England while shooting Stanley
Kubrick's still-to-be-released film, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' (based, by
coincidence, on another Schnitzler tale, ``Traumnovelle,'' or
``Dream Story''), she jumped at the chance of working in an
experimental theater where, she thought, she would attract little
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes, I have been totally surprised by the reaction,''
she acknowledged in a recent interview, accompanied by Glen, in a
dressing-room at the Donmar Warehouse. ``This is a small theater. I
didn't want to start by doing something big on Broadway or on the
West End. When you do theater, you want to explore yourself as an
actor. And if there is a lot of pressure, it tends to stop you. I
just wanted to work with Sam Mendes. I had seen his work at the
Donmar. I had seen his `Cabaret' and `Othello.' We went to lunch
one day and we just got on. He had a lot of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But bringing a movie star to the London stage is not an original
one: Juliette Binoche, Kevin Spacey and Liam Neeson have all drawn
crowds here in recent months. But Mendes was clearly taken by Ms.
Kidman's eagerness to appear at the nonprofit Donmar _ and
willingness to do so for a weekly salary equivalent to $400.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you meet her, her spirit is surprising,'' the 33-year-old
director said. ``She has a huge kind of childlike streak that is
very engaging and very unexpected with someone whom you associate
with film performances which are very severe. So I wanted to find
something in which she could display that.''
</P>
<P>
   The chosen vehicle was the contemporary version of ``La Ronde,''
which Mendes had asked Hare to write, using two actors to play all
the roles. Schnitzler's original 1900 German-language version,
which was closed down by police as obscene when it finally opened
in 1921, was a satirical expose of Vienna's highly stratified
society.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the original play, Hare said: ``I think, crudely,
you could say that at the end of the 19th century, Freud's
contemporary Schnitzler produces this shocking revelation that sex
and romance are used to manipulate, and that they are forms both of
self-deception and deceit. His version is rather world-weary and
cynical about La Ronde, or sexual roundelay: `Here is this place
where we all deceive each other.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have swung it round because I don't feel that at the end of
the 20th century that's such a startling thing to say. If anything,
I am saying, `La Ronde is where we live _ where else can we live?
And hideous as the bruises are that we may take on on La Ronde,
it's a lot better than being off La Ronde,' which is why I give the
actress that climactic speech where she says, `What's the
alternative? The story is going to end badly, so what do we do
meanwhile? At least we're on La Ronde.' I feel La Ronde is where
you learn, while Schnitzler feels that La Ronde is where you got
your heart broken.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hare's version, which changes the identity, though not the
social ranking, of several characters, also suggests that nihilism
rather than hypocrisy is today's social blight. Of course, in both
cases, it is sex that breaks down class barriers.
</P>
<P>
   So, Mendes was asked, did Ms. Kidman know what she getting into?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if she had known what she was going to do, she might
have blanched,'' the director said with a laugh. ``But once it
became part of an organic process, after you have spent six weeks
in rehearsals, it grew out of the natural chemistry between the two
actors. If I had told Iain on the first day, `By the way, I want
you to do a naked cartwheel in this scene,' he'd have looked at me
and probably walked out. But it came naturally out of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It obviously helped that the two actors got along well. Before
Mendes cast them together, Ms. Kidman had never heard of Glen, who
in recent years has won accolades here for his leading roles in
``Hamlet,'' ``Henry V'' and ``Martin Guerre.'' And, by the way,
Glen had not seen any of Ms. Kidman's movies, either.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with Glen in loose shirt, scruffy trousers and no
shoes and Ms. Kidman in elegant gray sweater, gray slacks and black
boots, they seemed to hail from different worlds of entertainment.
Yet after four months of working together, they have clearly become
good friends. And for that, they also pay tribute to Mendes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam was never pushy; he never insisted on anything,'' Ms.
Kidman recalled, stealing a puff of Glen's cigarette. ``The actual
scene in which Iain as the playwright is naked and he dresses me,
the model, we didn't do it in rehearsals, only in the preview. But
we felt that particular scene was needed because of who the
playwright was and who she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen, 37, whose strong physique serves as a perfect match to Ms.
Kidman's fragile beauty, concurred. ``I thought that in an evening
of sexual coupling, it might have seemed coy if at some point there
wasn't full nudity,'' he said, ``because there's a coital moment in
each scene. It was just getting that balance right.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, since we are talking about sex ... ``We've spent the last
three months talking about it,'' Ms. Kidman interrupted with an
exuberant laugh. ``Why should we stop now?''
</P>
<P>
   So, she was asked, what did Cruise think of the intimacy of the
play?
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband has done many things in films,'' Ms. Kidman said.
``I have done many things in films. That's part of being an actor.
And, I'm sorry to say, it doesn't provoke any fights in our
household any more.''
</P>
<P>
   And the audience reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear them gasp,'' she said with an embarrassed giggle.
``In the scene between the politician and the model, when he _ I
don't know what word you can use in print. Well, you sense the
tension because people feel relieved to laugh. When he asks, `Is
that good?' and I say, `I don't even know what you're doing,' it
always gets a very big laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, it was not the play's sexiness that worried Ms.
Kidman. Not having appeared on stage for so long, she was nervous
before rehearsals even began. And before opening night, she said,
she was terrified. For her, the real challenge was playing five
different characters in quick succession, each with a different
accent: cockney, French, Australian, upper-class British and
breathy actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, my God, I have bitten off more than I can
chew,'' she recalled. ``Why didn't I just choose one character?''
</P>
<P>
   Hare said he was struck by how dramatically Ms. Kidman's
performance improved once the previews began. ``It was almost like
those two weeks were her university of theater acting,'' he said.
``My only sadness is that in all this hysteria it gets overlooked
how damned good she is in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors' fresh challenge in New York will be to perform in a
proscenium theater after working with an audience on three sides of
the stage at the Donmar. But, for Ms. Kidman, the perils of
returning to the theater after a long break are over.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she is now looking forward to more frequent stage
appearances, with the leading role in Strindberg's ``Miss Julie''
now provisionally scheduled for Sydney late next year. She has also
told Mendes that she is ready to return to the Donmar.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actress, there are so few good roles in film,'' she
said. ``But there are great roles in theater for women of all ages.
In theater, you grow, vocally, in discipline, it's the best thing
you can do.'' She paused as if ready for a confession. ``If you
work just on films, you get lazy,'' she said. ``You really do.''

 &HT;    Making Thanksgiving gravy isn't brain surgery
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Why make gravy when you can buy it? Let's phrase
that another way: Why buy it when making it is so easy?
</P>
<P>
   Six disappointed tasters evaluated eight gravies available to
harried cooks looking ahead to Thanksgiving day . The variety
included four canned and jarred turkey gravies, two made from
mixes, one from a caterer and another from a supermarket deli.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion was unanimous and vocal: Make your own.
</P>
<P>
   The gravies ranged from totally unacceptable to just acceptable,
said the tasters. The jarred and canned varieties, priced from 99
cents to $1.79 for 1 to 1 cups, predictably beat out the gravies
made from dry mixes, budget priced from 50 cents to $1.29 for one
cup. But they also outperformed freshly made gravies from Dorothy
Lane Market and Solganik Catering Co., priced at $6 and $7.75 a
quart, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   All tasters rejected the Dorothy Lane Market gravy, complaining
of an unpleasant smell and bitter aftertaste. They were almost as
critical of a powdered Butterball Turkey Gravy Mix, which all said
tasted of bouillon.
</P>
<P>
   The preferred Heinz Homestyle Roasted Turkey Gravy won points
because it ``tastes like it came from the bird'' even though it
``looks like pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   One taster's comment, ``It's OK _ but not terrible,'' summed it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Also acceptable to four of the tasters were the Franco American
Turkey Gravy and the Franco American Slow Roast Turkey Gravy _ but
not that company's fat-free effort.
</P>
<P>
   Given that a serving of traditional commercial gravy contains
just 1 gram of fat, going for fat-free seemed pointless.
</P>
<P>
   Only one gravy, a thick, peppery version from Solganik Catering,
got an ``excellent'' rating from one taster who said it had a
``true gravy look,'' but she commented on the ``unusual taste.''
Others agreed that it ``looks the most like turkey gravy'' but said
``it doesn't taste like turkey gravy.''

FTC ISSUES AD GUIDELINES FOR DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Spelling of ``Vaegra'' in 3rd graf is CQ.) 
(mk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, the Federal Trade Commission is issuing
advertising guidelines aimed specifically at the nation's booming
dietary supplement industry.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are the commission's second action within a week
on claims by the industry, which earned nearly $12 billion in 1997
and is growing at about 20 percent a year. Last week the commission
e-mailed warnings to 1,200 Internet sites that it said had made
``incredible claims'' for drugs, devices and dietary supplements,
including herbal remedies that purported to ward off AIDS or cure
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the commission has taken legal action this year
against seven supplement manufacturers over advertising claims for
various products, including an impotence remedy called Vaegra and a
shark cartilage product that supposedly cured cancer, rheumatism,
arthritis, diabetes, fibroid tumors, bursitis, circulatory problems
and cysts. Several weight-loss potions were also targeted by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, which are being posted Wednesday on the
commission's Web site and sent to trade associations for the
supplement industry, do not amount to any change in policy, said
Michelle Rusk, a lawyer for the commission. Basically the FTC
requires that advertising be truthful, that it not be misleading
and that advertisers be able to back up their claims. The new
guidelines explain how those requirements apply to the supplement
industry and spell out the kinds of claims that supplement
manufacturers can and cannot make.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection, said that in recent years the commission had issued
similar guidelines to define ``low fat'' for the food industry and
terms like ``recycled'' and ``recyclable'' for other producers.
</P>
<P>
   The new supplement guidelines were prompted by the tremendous
growth of the industry, Ms. Bernstein said, and by confusion among
manufacturers about what was allowed in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of new players,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of
1994 limited the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to
regulate supplements, and that change left many manufacturers
wondering what the rules were.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernstein said the commission had worked with industry and
consumer groups for a year to develop the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Response from the industry has been favorable. Alan Raul, a
lawyer at Sidley &AMP; Austin, a Washington law firm that represents
the National Nutritional Foods Association, said: ``The FTC has
really reached out to the dietary supplement industry to provide
assistance and guidance in the sort of advertising claims on
dietary supplements that are appropriate. It looks like a thorough,
helpful piece of guidance that will be useful to the public and to
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Annette Dickinson, director of scientific and regulatory
affairs for another trade association, said, ``We think it's a very
good idea, and a useful guide.''
</P>
<P>
   The guide, a 26-page document, explains that the Food and Drug
Administration is responsible for claims on labeling, and the FTC
for advertising claims, including those on the Internet. It
provides 36 hypothetical examples of advertising claims, and
explains how the law would apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers are responsible for implied claims as well as
expressly stated ones, the guide says, so that if an advertisement
cites ``university studies'' in support of a product, the studies
must not only exist but also deliver on the implied message, which
is that they are reliable studies.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if an advertisement says that 90 percent of
cardiologists take a certain product, the manufacturer must be able
to demonstrate not only that fact but also the implied claim that
the product is good for the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike FDA labeling rules, which forbid claims that supplements
can treat or prevent disease, the FTC guidelines allow such claims
in advertisements, provided that the manufacturer can substantiate
them. What qualifies as substantiation is also explained in the
guidelines: ``competent and reliable scientific evidence,''
including tests, analyses, research and studies conducted and
evaluated by qualified professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But advertisers cannot, by picking and choosing among studies,
present only those that back their claims. The guidelines say the
advertisements must reflect ``the totality of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also requires that advertisers disclose, clearly
and prominently, ``qualifying information'' like side effects or
the fact that a weight-loss product works only if the consumer also
diets and exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Companies must also disclose whether a person who endorses a
particular product is being paid for the endorsement and whether
the person is qualified to make such an endorsement. If, for
example, a person identified as ``Dr. Jones'' speaks on behalf of
vitamins but is a doctor of Romance languages rather than of
medicine, the advertising is not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers are also barred from implying that any food
supplement has been approved by the FDA, which has no authority to
regulate supplements unless they violate its labeling rules or
become implicated in consumer illness.

 &HT;    What's the fuss about gravy, anyway?
 &HT;    (EDS: May run with GRAVY-COX.)
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ All it takes to make gravy is broth, flour and
fat. Some salt and pepper. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   So why all the fuss about gravy? Even some veteran cooks refuse
to make it, remembering the failures _ the lumps and the anemic
color, which is what you get if you do it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Making good gravy is all in the technique, a matter of blending
those three central ingredients in the right way, at the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   But given the evaluation of the available store-bought gravies
(see adjacent story), Thanksgiving is the time to master this skill
once and for all. Even if you make gravy only once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that gravy is one thing on the table that has to be
piping hot. Making it can be a last-minute whirlwind performance at
the stove _ done at about the same time the turkey is being sliced
and the potatoes are being mashed. Doing everything possible ahead
of time is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's a 1-2-3 order to making gravy, here's a primer
to making it right and as easy as possible.
</P>
<P>
   You need turkey broth to make gravy. While some prebasted birds
that have been injected with broth exude a lot of liquid, you'll
need about 4 cups for a batch of gravy. Make your own ahead of time
with the turkey neck and giblets. Simmer in water with celery,
carrots, onion, salt and pepper for an hour. This can be done the
night before. Reserve the neck and giblets, if you like, and dice
them for giblet gravy. Store the broth, covered, in the
refrigerator. If you want to use the liver as well as the heart and
gizzard, cook it in the stock just for the last five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Once the turkey is out of the oven and resting on a serving
plate, pour the juices off, ideally into a quart glass measuring
pitcher. You can skim the fat from the top and use it. (It helps to
stick the container in the freezer for a few minutes so the fat
rises to the top more quickly). Figure on using to cup fat. Or you
can substitute butter.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of homemade gravy is pale and tastes of raw flour. That
just means the flour and fat mixture wasn't cooked long enough. It
should bubble and color nicely before the liquid is added. To avoid
lumps, use a whisk to blend in the flour. If you don`t have one,
this is the time to buy one. They're cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The best gravy is made in the bottom of the roaster, where you
can stir up the caramelized bits that add flavor to the finished
product. However, cooks who scorn prebasted birds may find that the
bottom of the pan has scorched. The choice then is to start with a
clean saucepan, butter and homemade turkey stock.
</P>
<P>
   Once the gravy is browned and thickened it's OK to let it simmer
at a bare bubble in the roaster at the back of the stove, keeping
it warm for the turkey, dressing and mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   And, remember, if your efforts are lumpy, run the gravy quickly
through a food processor and no one will know.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY GRAVY
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 quart
</P>
<P>
   chilled turkey stock (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   cup fat, either from the pan drippings or butter
</P>
<P>
   cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   cooked, diced giblets, if desired
</P>
<P>
   When turkey is removed from roaster and set aside to rest, pour
off and reserve any accumulated juices. Skim off and reserve fat
</P>
<P>
   Add enough turkey stock to the pan juices to make 4 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Add enough butter to reserved turkey fat to make 1/2 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the fat in either the roaster or a large, clean saucepan.
Over medium heat whisk in the flour and cook, stirring
occasionally, until bubbling and aromatic and the mixture begins to
color. Gradually whisk in 4 cups of the combined drippings and
broth. Scrape the bottom of the roaster with the whisk to loosen
the flavorful brown bits. Cook until thick. Season with salt and
pepper. Add the giblets if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Options: If the guests are adults, deglaze the pan with a half
cup of wine such as a nutty Madeira, and stir to loosen up the bits
and pieces stuck to the pan. Add that to the reserved pan juices to
be used in making the gravy.
</P>
<P>
   To get a head start on Thanksgiving, make turkey stock now. For
real turkey taste you want the native bird, not chicken, but turkey
parts can be hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY STOCK
</P>
<P>
   turkey neck, heart and gizzard
</P>
<P>
   1 rib celery (leaves included), cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, cut into quarters
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 grinds black pepper
</P>
<P>
   5 cups cold water salt
</P>
<P>
   Place all ingredients in a medium saucepan with a lid. Bring to
a boil, skimming off froth if a clear stock is essential (it isn't
with gravy). Turn the heat down so that the broth just simmers.
Cook for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the turkey parts and let cool before dicing. Strain and
discard the solids.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate promptly. When chilled, remove and save any fat that
has accumulated on the refrigerated turkey broth. It can be used as
part of the fat in the gravy.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to add the liver, just add it to the broth and cook
for just five minutes or it will be overcooked. Or saute the liver
in a bit of butter and add to the cooked giblets.
</P>
<P>
   Options: For richer flavor and color, roast the turkey pieces
with the chunks of onion, celery and carrot in a 400-degree oven
until nicely browned. Then proceed with the recipe.

STUDENTS' SUCCESS DEPENDS ON TEACHERS MOST, POLL SAYS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans rate the quality of the classroom teacher as the most
important element in lifting student achievement, ahead of stronger
curriculum and stricter discipline, according to the results of a
poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by the nonprofit Washington organization Recruiting New
Teachers and Louis Harris and Associates tested respondents on a
range of subjects related to teaching quality, including salaries
and approaches to school change.
</P>
<P>
   It was done as a way to gauge public interest in a topic
educators and policy makers view as increasingly important in light
of an estimated need for 2.2 million new teachers in the next
decade to meet growing enrollments and replace retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 1,504 adults, who were asked 42
multiple-choice questions, has a margin of error of plus or minus
two percentage points. The Philip Morris Companies Inc. provided a
$130,000 grant to finance the poll, whose results were compiled in
a report, ``The Essential Profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that most Americans, 56 percent, would consider
a career in teaching if the salary was at least $60,000, and 81
percent would recommend it to a family member if the pay was that
high. The national average for public school teachers is about
$38,000.
</P>
<P>
   And, when asked which of eight professions was most beneficial
to the country, teachers ranked first, ahead of doctors,
accountants and lawyers. But when asked which profession they would
recommend to a family member, teaching ranked second _ 39 percent _
to medicine _ 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents in some cases were out of step with the thinking of
policy makers seeking to improve the quality of teachers. Contrary
to movements afoot in several states, for example, the poll found
that just over a third of Americans felt that earning a master's
degree from an accredited school of education was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   And despite efforts nationwide to raise curriculum standards, 90
percent of the respondents rated a well-qualified teacher as the
most important element in improving student learning, ahead of a
challenging curriculum, 77 percent; strict discipline, 77 percent;
reduced class size, 56 percent; and school uniforms, 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if they favored allowing parents to use public money
in the form of vouchers for private education or ``doing what it
takes to get qualified teachers in every classroom,'' 84 percent of
the respondents chose the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the findings do not necessarily run counter to common
sense,'' said David Haselkorn, president of Recruiting New
Teachers, ``but they do run counter to what has been seen as common
wisdom in school reform in the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll did not ask respondents how they ranked improving
teacher education against other concerns like lowering crime or
improving the environment. And it did not delve into the thornier
issue of education financing and how much money should be devoted
to improving teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hirsch, a senior policy specialist with the National
Conference of State Legislatures, a research group based in Denver,
said that policy makers would agree with much of the poll's
findings but that the larger question was how best to enact
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch noted, for example, that several states had raised
minimum teacher salaries in the past few year but nowhere near
$60,000. He predicted that such moves would be complicated by
voters' distaste for the higher taxes that might be necessary to
achieve those higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality teaching is such a complex issue when it comes to
salary, recruitment and retention that a lot of states are just now
trying to assess what programs they have in place,'' said Hirsch,
who called teacher quality ``one of the most talked about pressing
issues in state legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State
Schools Officers, a lobbying group in Washington, said that
although most Americans told pollsters they supported improving
education, spending money on it was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only about 20 percent of adults now have children in school,''
said Ambach, who served as New York State education commissioner
from 1977 to 1987. ``That makes a difference in the willingness to
support education.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the view of teacher quality as a leading component in
improving education matches what education experts increasingly
have been saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in the past decade has there been a strong movement in
education renewal toward the view that the teacher is of primary
importance,'' said John Goodland, director of the Center for
Education Renewal at the University of Washington and a leading
scholar on teacher training. ``This a relatively new concept. We
examined school reform reports for the entire century and none
mention teacher education until 1986.''

 &HT;    Democrats threaten boycott as documents are deliveredBy Rebecca
Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr sent
congressional investigators new information Tuesday from his
investigation of former Justice Department official Webster
Hubbell, and Democrats said they may boycott the proceedings if
they are expanded beyond President Clinton's affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The two sets of documents delivered in four boxes to the House
Judiciary Committee may signal that Republicans who want to broaden
the impeachment inquiry are prevailing in an intra-party struggle
with their colleagues who blame the impeachment proceedings for
election day losses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats viewed the day's developments with alarm and denounced
the proceedings as a partisan sham.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) complained that
Democrats are not being allocated enough time to rebut Starr's
allegations that the president committed perjury, obstructed
justice and tampered with witnesses in an attempt to hide his
affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, scheduled to be the marquee witness at a hearing on
Thursday, will get two hours to present his case, and Republicans
will have a combined 105 minutes to ask questions. Democrats will
get only 90 minutes to question Starr, and the White House has been
offered 30 minutes to cross-examine the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing keeps going the way it's been going, Democrats
may decide not to come to the hearing,'' Gephardt said. ``This is
not the way it should be done. It has not been done by anybody's
judgment in a bipartisan way, in a consensual way ... This is
outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   More witnesses may be brought before the panel, including former
Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang. He was a key player in
last summer's Senate investigation into fund-raising abuses by both
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible witnesses cited by lawmakers were Lewinsky; her
friend Linda Tripp, who secretly taped their conversations about
the president; and White House adviser Bruce Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the interest Tuesday focused on Huang. Republicans
want to ask Huang, who is cooperating in Starr's investigation of
Hubbell, whether he made payments to Clinton's former golfing
partner in exchange for his silence about the Whitewater land deal
and other possible improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   The material delivered to the committee included tape recordings
of Hubbell's telephone conversations from prison, which have
already been made public by the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee in its investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubbell evidence came five days after Starr sent additional
information he had gathered about allegations of an unwanted sexual
advance by the president of another woman, Kathleen Willey, raising
concern among some Democrats that Thursday's hearing would turn
into a ``political tirade.''
</P>
<P>
   But committee Republicans saw the new evidence as fuel for their
inquiry, which some said may need to be widened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may very well have a case where bribery comes into play,''
in the case of the alleged payments to Hubbell, said Georgia
Republican Rep. Bob Barr. He noted that even scholars invited by
the Democrats to a hearing last week said bribery would ``clearly
be impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Barr joined leaders of a dozen right-wing
groups to rally support for the campaign to oust Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference on the Capitol grounds, the Smyrna
lawmaker blasted Republicans who have said in recent days they
won't vote for impeachment because this month's election results
demonstrated the American people don't support such action.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any member to take the position that they are not going to
vote for articles of impeachment before that issue is even
presented to them and before the evidence is in I think would be
irresponsible,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, said they would focus their attention on
finding out how Starr went from investigating the failed Whitewater
land deal to the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that the process has become such a sham,'' said
Rep. Martin Meehan (D-Ma.), enroute to a Democratic meeting to
discuss strategy for Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter delivered to Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), the White House sought more time to cross-examine Starr.
Hyde had given the administration until Tuesday to respond to his
offer of a half-hour to question Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the guiding principle of our adversarial system that
truth emerges most clearly from the interplay of direct and cross
examination,'' White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff wrote. ``In
light of the fact that the majority has chosen to call as a witness
the person responsible for conducting a wide-ranging, four-year
investigation of the president _ an investigation that has given
rise to serious questions as to its fairness, we submit that
anything less than 90 minutes would unfairly constrain our ability
to explore the basis for Mr. Starr's testimony.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's Roman Catholic bishops on Tuesday
elected Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza of the Diocese of
Galveston-Houston, a soft-spoken prelate known for his concern for
the poor and immigrants, as president of the conference that serves
as their collective voice.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops also elected Bishop Wilton D. Gregory of Belleville,
Ill., as vice president, the first time that an African-American
prelate has been chosen for one of the top two positions in the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's election is all the more notable given that of the 269
diocesan and auxiliary bishops in the United States, only 14 are
black. As vice president, he will be in the favored position to
succeed Fiorenza when his term expires in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The election of both men, on the second day of the bishops'
semiannual meeting at a Capitol Hill hotel, continues a tradition
in which the church's American hierarchy has elected leaders
regarded as consensus builders _ a trend that has continued even as
the number of outspoken conservatives among the bishops has grown
as a result of recent appointments by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop of Boston, said he expected
Fiorenza would be ``very sensitive'' to the various members of the
conference, a quality the cardinal also attributed to the current
president, Bishop Anthony M. Pilla of Cleveland, whose term ends
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Law said that Gregory ``was elected on his own merit, but given
that he is an African-American, it's a wonderful moment in the
history of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza, who will become the first conference president to head
a diocese in Texas or the Southeast, was elected on the first
ballot, receiving 164 votes of 265 cast. Voting was by secret
ballot. Although 10 prelates were nominated for the position, the
serving vice president is traditionally elected president, while
other candidates compete for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Beaumont, Texas, Fiorenza, 67, grew up as the son of
an immigrant barber from Sicily. As a young priest in Houston, he
joined other clergy members marching for civil rights with the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, Ala., in 1965. Around that time,
Fiorenza said in an interview, he formed a friendship with an
African-American Baptist pastor in Houston, the Rev. William
Lawson, that continues to this day in a collaboration between the
Galveston-Houston Diocese and black Baptists to renovate run-down
housing through a community development corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza, who served six years as bishop of San Angelo, Texas,
was installed in 1985 as head of the Galveston-Houston Diocese,
where he is the spiritual leader of 862,000 Catholics. He said he
hoped the conference would help the church continue ``to raise
before the nation the issues of justice and fairness for the poor
and the immigrant and those who for whatever reason are kept on the
fringes of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory, initially competing against eight other candidates,
emerged as the front-runner after the first ballot for vice
president. He then prevailed in a runoff with Archbishop Justin F.
Rigali of St. Louis, whose archdiocese will host Pope John Paul II
during a two-day visit to that city in January.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory, 50, recently served as chairman of the conference's
committee on liturgy at a time when proposed liturgical changes
were an often contentious subject among the bishops. Gregory holds
a doctorate from the Pontifical Liturgical Institute in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Chicago and a former auxiliary bishop in that city
under the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, Gregory was installed as
head of the Belleville diocese in 1994, becoming spiritual leader
to 113,000 Catholics in the southern quarter of Illinois. He is one
of five African-American bishops currently heading a diocese in the
United States. Black Catholics number an estimated 3 to 4 million,
out of about 61 million Catholics nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters after his election, Gregory said, ``I
hope it's a sign of the church's honest and sincere desire to
include African-Americans at all levels of leadership and at all
levels of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that African-American Catholics will first of all pray
for me,'' he added, ``and second of all see this as a sign of
love.''

STARR TRIES ON STRATEGIES IN REHEARSAL FOR ROLE AS WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preparing for his appearance before the House
Judiciary Committee on Thursday, independent counsel Kenneth Starr
has rehearsed testimony that details a pattern of obstruction by
the White House extending beyond the matter of Monica Lewinsky,
lawyers familiar with his preparations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not made a final decision about the contents of
his two-hour opening statement, Starr has discussed the possibility
of drawing parallels between the White House's alleged coverup in
the Lewinsky affair and earlier alleged attempts to thwart other
aspects of the four-year-old Whitewater inquiry, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   As one lawyer put it, Starr plans to place the allegations of
perjury and obstruction of justice against President Clinton into
``historical perspective.'' Starr is also prepared to highlight the
``systematic'' campaign by the White House and its loyalists to
delay and undermine his office's investigation this year, lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who lie and perjure themselves have been able to get
away with it by complaining about prosecutors and portraying
prosecutors as villains,'' Charles G. Bakaly III, Starr's
spokesman, said during a wide-ranging interview Tuesday. ``We
believe we have been the victim of a coordinated effort to
stonewall and destroy our prosecutorial authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, announced Tuesday that it
would call more witnesses to testify in the inquiry, as the White
House asked for 90 minutes to cross-examine Starr, rather than the
30 minutes the committee had allotted it.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for those questions, Starr has spent much of the past
several weeks holding moot court-style proceedings in his office
conference room. While a video camera records the sessions, several
senior prosecutors rattle off hostile questions that they
anticipate committee Democrats will pose.
</P>
<P>
   At one point late last week, Starr told his colleagues, ``We
apologize to no one for seeking the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his office's exhaustive preparations, lawyers say that
Starr does not view his appearance as a last-ditch attempt to sway
public opinion, an accusation made by some Democrats Tuesday.
Starr's personal approval ratings have been stuck in the single
digits for months, in part as a reflection of the public's
weariness with the 10-month, sex-and-cover-up investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not seek vindication for himself on Thursday,'' Bakaly
explained. ``But he does seek vindication of the facts and the rule
of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr steered away from raising other areas of the Whitewater
inquiry in his Sept. 9 referral to Congress, which recommended 11
impeachable offenses related to the coverup of Clinton's affair
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decision that helped White House lawyers dismiss the
report as the product of a sex-obsessed inquiry, an argument that
has resonated with the public. The decision also infuriated some
Starr allies, who had openly called for Starr to draw parallels
between the Lewinsky matter and other areas of his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is determined to defend his report's findings on Thursday,
his allies said Tuesday. ``He absolutely stands by the referral,''
Bakaly said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are extremely high for Starr's appearance as the
impeachment inquiry's first witness. The fate of the impeachment
inquiry, as well as Starr's legacy, is likely to depend on the
public's reaction to the independent counsel's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with Starr's preparations said that his opening
statement would present a dispassionate review of the facts and the
law in the referral made in September to Congress. By disclosing
his discussions about possible areas of his testimony, Starr's
aides may be attempting to gauge the public reaction to the
possibility that he may widen the scope of his testimony to other
matters still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his last opportunity to make people realize that this
investigation was not just about sex,'' said Barbara Olson, a
Washington lawyer who is a frequent defender of Starr on
television. ``I don't know that Starr is ready for the level of
lies that he is going to have to face.''
</P>
<P>
   As the solicitor general during the Bush administration, Starr,
52, argued cases before the Supreme Court, where he felt
comfortable with the high court's deeply respectful decorum. Starr
has no experience making such an important presentation amid the
partisan free-for-all of the House Judiciary Committee room, where
snappy soundbites will be the goal of many of the 37 members, each
of whom will be given five minutes to quiz Starr on any subject.
</P>
<P>
   Some committee Democrats are preparing to fire hostile questions
at Starr to portray him as a right-wing, overzealous prosecutor who
remains determined to destroy the president. They plan to ask Starr
questions about allegations that his office leaked grand jury
material and about his prosecutors' contacts last January with
conservative opponents of the president who had links to Paula
Corbin Jones' sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel also plan to object to any attempts by
Starr _ or conservative Republican members _ to steer the hearing
to matters not contained in the referral.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have presumed that Starr would confine his testimony to the
four corners of the referral itself,'' said Jim Jordan, the
spokesman for the committee Democrats. ``It would be unacceptable
to our members for Starr to offer unproven allegations or innuendo
in an effort to somehow rehabilitate a failed investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said that Starr has expressed no opinion about the
public's rather tepid reaction to the Starr Report and its
allegations. Lawyers and friends described Starr as feeling upbeat
and looking forward to the opportunity to speak before the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, he sees this as the continuation of his duty to
assist Congress in their duty to make a judgment,'' Bakaly said.
``We make no judgments. We have simply gathered the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson's husband, Theodore Olson, who is also a Washington lawyer
and a close friend of Starr, acknowledged that Starr has no
experience presenting the facts and the law in a congressional
committee room riven by partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very different forum from what he is accustomed
to,'' Theodore Olson said. ``This will be five minutes of
interrogation, per person, by some friendly and some hostile
interrogators. Some of them will ask questions, some of them will
deliver speeches, some of them will engage in argument, some of
them may be attempted to do some grandstanding for the nightly
news. You don't see that kind of thing often in court from
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly agreed, saying: ``In the political world and world of
public opinion, Starr has been demonized by his critics. But in the
legal world, Starr has won repeatedly.'' Bakaly pointed out that
Starr's office has won 15 legal decisions against the White House
this year on issues such as the president's assertion of executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's allies also complained that the White House has
successfully advanced the argument that the independent counsel has
been motivated by a political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made no attempt to influence public opinion.'' Bakaly
said. ``Isn't it obvious?''

CALIFORNIA RULING IS A SETBACK FOR MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., whose business practices are being challenged
by the government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal
setback on another front Tuesday when a federal judge in California
ordered the company to stop shipping Internet software that
violates its contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The impact that the order, a preliminary injunction in a private
law suit in California, will have on the government's case is
uncertain. But the allegations in the government's antitrust suit
do include the practices that are at the heart of the
breach-of-contract case Sun filed against Microsoft last October _
namely, that Microsoft is trying to ``pollute'' Sun's Internet
programming language, called Java, by modifying it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft in the
antitrust case say that this is part of a pattern of illegal
practices by the software giant intended to protect and extend its
tight grip on the market for personal computer software. If Sun's
Java became an industry-standard, the government asserts, it could
pose a serious challenge to Microsoft. And in the California case,
Sun had argued that by altering the Java programming language,
Microsoft had violated a contract the two companies had signed.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ronald Whyte in the U.S. District Court in San Jose
ordered Microsoft to stop the practice and gave it 90 days to make
its Internet software entirely compatible with Sun's Java, as it
had agreed to do when it signed a technology licensing agreement
with Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The California ruling is badly timed for Microsoft, but the
spillover, if any, to the antitrust case in Washington is difficult
to determine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department will argue that a breach of contract is
part of the pattern of bad acts by Microsoft and of its intent to
monopolize,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division. ``It helps the
atmospherics of the government's case, but it's not clear beyond
that what the effect will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Tuesday is a preliminary injuction, noted Litan, and
the Sun-Microsoft trial is not scheduled to begin until next year.
Meanwhile, the antitrust trial is already well under way, and Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson is expected to rule early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a final ruling in the contract case, it would
have far more direct impact on the antitrust case,'' said Litan,
who is now at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The California ruling, industry analysts say, is not likely to
have a significant impact on Microsoft's business anytime soon _
though it does raise questions about the company's strategy of
trying to influence the industry to accept Microsoft's version of
Internet software standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the judge gave it 90 days to comply, there is no
business interruption for Microsoft,'' said Richard Sherlund, an
analyst for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. ``Microsoft does not have to pull
products out of distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Sherlund noted, the ruling does ``rein Microsoft in, and it
clearly comes at an awkward time for the company, given the
antitrust case.''

   A man decides to take the opportunity while his wife is away to
paint the toilet seat. After he finished, he headed to the kitchen
to raid the refrigerator. The wife comes home sooner than expected,
and heads to the bathroom, sits down and gets the toilet seat stuck
to her rear. She becomes upset and in a panic shouts to her husband
to drive her to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   She puts on a large overcoat to cover the stuck seat, and off
they go. When they get to the doctor's office, the man lifts his
wife's coat to show their predicament. The man asked, `Doctor, have
you ever seen anything like this before?`
</P>

   `Well, yes.` the doctor replied. `But never framed.`

   A lecturer teaching medicine was tutoring a class on
'Observation'. He took out a jar of yellow-colored liquid. `This`,
he explained, `is urine. To be a doctor, you have to be observant
to color, smell, sight, and taste.`
</P>
<P>
   After saying this, he dipped his finger into the jar and put it
into his mouth. His class watched on in amazement, most, in
disgust. But being the good students that they were, the jar was
passed, and one by one, they dipped one finger into the jar and
then put it into their mouth.
</P>
<P>
   After the last student was done, the lecturer shook his head.
`If any of you had been observant, you would have noticed that I
put my 2nd finger into the jar and my 3rd finger into my mouth.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FISH FACT &LR;  A man was speeding down the highway, feeling secure
in a group of cars all traveling at the same speed. However, as
they passed a speed trap, he got nailed with an infrared speed
detector and was pulled over.
</P>
<P>
   The officer handed him the citation, received his signature and
was about to walk away when the man asked, `Officer, I know I was
speeding, but I don't think it's fair - there were plenty of other
cars around me who were going just as fast, so why did I get the
ticket?`
</P>
<P>
   `Ever go fishing?` the policeman suddenly asked the man.
</P>
<P>
   `Um, yeah...` the startled man replied.
</P>
<P>
   The officer grinned and added, `Did you ever catch all the
fish?`

   In the Iraq crisis, Mr. Clinton says, ``the world spoke with one
voice.'' And said: ``Oh, yeah, right. Like this is any long-term
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's agreement to let U.N. weapons inspectors back in is proof
that threatending force works _ and that Iraq has had enough time
to hide what the inspectors were close to finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein is not a person we can trust,'' says British
Prime Minister Tony Blair. As a colleague of Bill Clinton, Blair is
a pretty fair judge of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``has backed down, but that is not
enough.'' Right. In the future Iraq should back down again and
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   It cost the U.S. millions of dollars to gather military forces
for the canceled strike on Iraq. Saddam may be evil, but he's good
for our economy.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's vice president says his country has been able ``to prove
to the whole world that our views are correct.'' Well, the whole
world minus everybody but him and Saddam.

   When the House impeachment hearings get under way, Aunt Ilse
from Oelwein hopes someone will move to change the name of the

 &HT;    Transportation secretary to visit sprawl victim Atlanta
 &HT;    By David Goldberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having heard plenty in recent months about metro
Atlanta's problems with traffic and air pollution, U.S. Secretary
of Transportation Rodney Slater came to the city Tuesday to hear
how the federal government can help make the region more
``livable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are, frankly, fed up with sprawl,'' said Slater, who
moderated a panel discussion before an audience specially invited
to the Georgia Freight Depot outside Underground Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Slater made his visit as part of Vice President Al Gore's
efforts to promote smarter growth. The selection of Atlanta for the
second of such ``listening sessions'' was deliberate, because the
region has achieved a national profile as poster child for suburban
sprawl run amok, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said Gore's idea of livable communities refers to
``places where families can walk, shop and play together'' and
where residents ``spend less time in traffic and more time with
family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater's own department came in for criticism from some in the
audience, who said the agency's emphasis on big highway projects
had hurt neighborhoods and contributed to Atlanta's sprawl and air
pollution. Slater agreed. ``For 50 years, building roads has too
often been thought of as the only way to address transportation and
congestion,'' he said. ``We have to think anew.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater asked Georgia Department Transportation Commissioner
Wayne Shackelford what he was doing to address Atlanta's problems.
``We're doing bike trails and lanes as part of most of the roads we
do today,'' Shackelford said. ``We're including sidewalks into
every single road we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Shackelford also pledged to work with the Georgia Rail Passenger
Authority to start commuter rail and added that work on express
lanes for I-85 in Gwinnett County will begin after the first of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Steve Thompson, who chairs the Senate Transportation
Committee, said huge obstacles remain if public transportation and
other alternatives to the car are to be expanded and financed.
``Some counties want to build a fence rather than a bridge,'' with
other parts of the region, he said. ``The state will have to get
serious about funding alternative modes,'' he added, noting that
use of the state's gasoline tax currently is restricted to roads.

</P>
<P>
   A man decides to take the opportunity while his wife is away to
paint the toilet seat. After he finished, he headed to the kitchen
to raid the refrigerator. The wife comes home sooner than expected,
and heads to the bathroom, sits down and gets the toilet seat stuck
to her rear. She becomes upset and in a panic shouts to her husband
to drive her to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   She puts on a large overcoat to cover the stuck seat, and off
they go. When they get to the doctor's office, the man lifts his
wife's coat to show their predicament. The man asked, `Doctor, have
you ever seen anything like this before?`
</P>

   `Well, yes.` the doctor replied. `But never framed.`

   A lecturer teaching medicine was tutoring a class on
'Observation'. He took out a jar of yellow-colored liquid. `This`,
he explained, `is urine. To be a doctor, you have to be observant
to color, smell, sight, and taste.`
</P>
<P>
   After saying this, he dipped his finger into the jar and put it
into his mouth. His class watched on in amazement, most, in
disgust. But being the good students that they were, the jar was
passed, and one by one, they dipped one finger into the jar and
then put it into their mouth.
</P>
<P>
   After the last student was done, the lecturer shook his head.

   In the Iraq crisis, Mr. Clinton says, ``the world spoke with one
voice.'' And said: ``Oh, yeah, right. Like this is any long-term
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's agreement to let U.N. weapons inspectors back in is proof
that threatending force works _ and that Iraq has had enough time
to hide what the inspectors were close to finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein is not a person we can trust,'' says British
Prime Minister Tony Blair. As a colleague of Bill Clinton, Blair is
a pretty fair judge of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``has backed down, but that is not
enough.'' Right. In the future Iraq should back down again and
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   It cost the U.S. millions of dollars to gather military forces
for the canceled strike on Iraq. Saddam may be evil, but he's good
for our economy.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's vice president says his country has been able ``to prove
to the whole world that our views are correct.'' Well, the whole
world minus everybody but him and Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   When the House impeachment hearings get under way, Aunt Ilse
from Oelwein hopes someone will move to change the name of the
target from Bill Clinton to Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton did not have to apologize to settle the Paula Jones
lawsuit. Why be sorry that he and she provided four years of great
entertainment?

NEW YORK SCHOOL REPAIRS LAG, BUT BID TO DOUBLE SPENDING IS
EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN and JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With seven months left in the Board of Education's
current five-year construction plan, school officials have
completed only about a third of the major repair projects they
identified as priorities when the plan was begun in July 1994,
according to data released by the board this week.
</P>
<P>
   While board officials say they are confident that the
construction is moving forward and that most of the work will be
finished by the end of the school year, they acknowledge that they
cannot know for sure. That is because the school system's computers
are unable to track the progress of construction projects or enable
officials to predict when the work will be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The board's acknowledgment that it did not know for certain when
it would be able to complete dozens of longstanding priority
projects _ including the replacement of leaky school roofs,
buckling auditorium floors, antiquated coal furnaces and
dangerously rotted window frames _ came on the eve of its expected
announcement Wednesday asking the city and state to spend $11
billion on its next five-year plan, to begin in July.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is more than double the current five-year budget of
$4.6 billion. If approved by city and state officials, it will be
the largest amount spent on the city school construction since
before the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Whether school construction officials get that money will hinge
largely on their ability to overcome a reputation for incompetence
and wastefulness _ one that has long dogged both the Board of
Education and the many incarnations of its construction arm, now
the School Construction Authority. That reputation has only been
enhanced by a series of construction accidents in the last school
year, including the collapse of a 10-ton brick facade at a Brooklyn
high school and the fall of a stray brick that killed a 16-year-old
girl at a Brooklyn elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be easy. State legislators have scheduled hearings in
early December on problems in city school construction, and the
State Board of Regents is readying a new set of guidelines for
school inspections and repairs. At the same time, the city
teachers' union is continuing to pursue a lawsuit to force the
board to make needed repairs.
</P>
<P>
   But school officials say they have made improvements, decreasing
the amount of time it takes to finish projects and increasing the
amount of work done each year.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Spence, deputy chancellor for operations, said the main
reason so many projects were still pending was that school
officials had received money to do much of the work only within the
last 18 months. The situation is a result of wild swings in
financing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The board originally agreed with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on a
$3.4 billion, five-year plan in the spring of 1994. A year later,
Giuliani, facing citywide fiscal pressures, pared $500 million from
the budget, forcing school officials to cut projects and table a
number of improvements to a system in which half the buildings were
built before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are doing so much triage,'' Spence said. ``You do an
emergency here and an emergency here and an emergency here.''
</P>
<P>
   As money became available, the mayor returned it to the schools,
raising the construction budget to its current $4.6 billion with a
mandate to build more classrooms and fix leaking walls and roofs.
But because much of the money has become available only within the
last 18 months, it has been almost impossible for school officials
to finish the work by next July, the end of the capital plan,
Spence said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Further delaying the repairs was the school system's crisis in
overcrowding. Spence said that, faced with an influx of almost
20,000 students a year, school officials changed course midway
through the construction plan and emphasized adding space to the
overburdened system. Instead of building classroom space for 40,000
students over the last four years, Spence said, school officials
had actually added space for almost 70,000, although much of it is
in trailers and other temporary classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Spence estimated that roughly 70 percent of the projects listed
in the current construction plan would be finished or under
construction by the end of the school year. But he said he could
not be sure, because of a Byzantine accounting system in which one
computer cannot talk to another.
</P>
<P>
   Asked, for example, how many of the 315 roofs to be repaired
would be finished by July 1999, as scheduled, Spence said: ``At
this moment in time, we can't give you a precise answer to that. We
can tell you how many have been funded and how many are in
construction, but we can't tell you how many are going to be done
by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The system's inability to track spending was brought into sharp
focus earlier this year when the School Construction Authority, the
semiautonomous agency that does the construction work for the
board, could not properly account for $100 million that it had
spent. Though theft or loss has been ruled out, officials are still
working to reconstruct how the money was used.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion in record-keeping had a more practical impact last
spring, when the board ran out of money to pay for small
construction projects like classroom plastering and upgrades in
bathroom plumbing. The shortfall forced the board to cancel some
projects and abruptly shuffle others.
</P>
<P>
   Spence said the authority was using a consulting concern to
rebuild its accounting system. He said that once the new system was
in place _ preferably by the time the new construction plan takes
effect next July _ the system would, for the first time, be able to
track the progress of continuing projects.
</P>
<P>
   City Comptroller Alan Hevesi said the glitches were of no small
concern. ``I am troubled by the board and the School Construction
Authority's inability to track projects,'' he said. ``The fact that
they can't go from one budget to another and tell us where the
money is spent is not a sign of good management.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence said that soon after arriving in New York and assuming
his job in the fall of 1995, he became one of the biggest critics
of the school construction process, singling out the authority for
delivering new schools over budget and well after the school year
began.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that in recent months, the process had grown far
more efficient and that the authority was now at work on $1.4
billion worth of projects _ almost triple the 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
   The authority, he said, is capable of handling an even bigger
work load; in making its request public Wednesday, the board is to
propose spending at least $2 billion a year on school repairs and
construction in each of the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Included in that amount, Spence said, will be a big increase in
money for maintenance _ a perennial frustration for a system of so
many aging buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our finger in the dike,'' he said. ``The system is
not going to fall down. But now it has got to get fixed.'

COMMENTARY: SO DON'T LIKE ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The joke about Bill Clinton is: When he drives
through a car wash in a convertible with the top down, somebody
else gets wet.
</P>
<P>
   The president turned the White House into Motel 1600 for rich
donors, but Al Gore was the first one to get into trouble for
making a few fund-raising calls from his office.
</P>
<P>
   The president had his way with a young intern, but it was Newt
Gingrich who got tossed out.
</P>
<P>
   The president told one of the biggest, fattest lies in history,
but the public wants to impeach the press.
</P>
<P>
   In a cover story this week, New York magazine took a poll and
concluded that it is the journalists covering the scandal who are
all wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were justice, Cokie Roberts would resign, too,''
writes Michael Tomasky, in a piece titled ``Off With Their Talking
Heads.'' ``It was her morality and personality that people voted
against.'' (Last I checked,  &UR; she &LR;  wasn't toying with an intern.)
</P>
<P>
   Some talking heads have been giving themselves a lashing. After
the election, George Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton adviser who
is an ABC commentator, apologized, ``We were all wrong, all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase President Clinton, it depends on what you mean by
``were'' and ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not smart for journalists to predict at the beginning of
the Lewinsky scandal that the president would be gone within days.
And it was wretched excess for the cable channels in search of
another celebrity death watch to turn into vultures with daily
``White House in Crisis'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   But the obsessiveness of the media does not justify the
wrongheaded, vituperative consensus that has been building in the
wake of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Myself, I was heartened by the way the voters weighed in with
common sense and proportionality, reacting allergically to
inquisitions and the prospect of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weeks since the election there has been too much
gloating from the White House and its supporters. And there has
been too much self-lacerating journalistic commentary misconstruing
the public reaction as a vindication of the president. He won. The
press lost. The press should get lost. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation ruled by polls and ratings, where even newspapers
hire focus groups to see what kind of news readers want, we are
losing sight of something we should have learned as teen-agers:
Just because something is popular doesn't mean it's right.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the truth is employed only to the extent
that it's useful. When the Monica story broke, the president asked
Dick Morris to do a poll to tell him what would play better, the
truth or a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said that he told his old pal he couldn't tell the truth
and survive, and Clinton replied, ``Well, we'll just have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   New York magazine, which included me among its mug shots, rains
a cascade of poll numbers showing that by big margins the public is
fed up with hearing about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   I know exactly how the public feels. I'm sick of hearing about
it, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that the scandal is there, and the president did
what he did and said what he said, and the consequences of what he
did and said have preoccupied the executive, the legislative and
the judicial branches of government for a year.
</P>
<P>
   To pretend otherwise, to submit robotically to the polls, to
take one's professional instructions from the wishes and whims of a
fickle electorate would be to abdicate the role the public says it
wants the press to play: covering the news.
</P>
<P>
   If the president had told the truth immediately, the story would
have died. But it is our job to undo the spin and look into the
lies and go the extra skeptical mile to see that there is no
cover-up. Moreover, all journalists are not like all other
journalists in the wild and woolly and recklessly fast era of the
24-hour news cycle of cable, the Internet and high-decibel
know-it-alls and gossips.
</P>
<P>
   The impure history of American government _ Vietnam, Watergate,
Iran-Contra _ proves that reporters have a duty to dig for the
truth, whatever the public thinks.
</P>
<P>
   There is a danger of making false equations between popularity
and rightness, between what is liked and what is true. The danger
is that next time, when the cover-up takes place in a less gray
area, reporters will look at the numbers and go home early.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, it may not be about sex and lies. It may be about
life and death.

NO NEW ORDERS FOR BOEING 717 SINCE BEFORE THE ROLLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Boeing's new 717 passenger jet was rolled out
this past June to the cheers of several thousand workers at the
Douglas aircraft factory in Long Beach, Calif., Boeing Chairman
Phil Condit said he was not worried about the lack of new orders
for the 100-seat plane his company had inherited in its merger with
McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get an initial order or orders and then there is a long
pause while you go through the design, rollout and testing,'' he
told a Post-Intelligencer reporter. ``Right about now, and for the
next six months, is when you see things pick back up. If it's
silent after the next six months, then I would begin to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts say it's time for Condit to start
worrying.
</P>
<P>
   His six months are up in early December, and Boeing has not
landed a single new order for its 717 since before the rollout.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, in a blow to Boeing, European rival Airbus
Industrie announced it has won a tentative order from International
Lease Finance Corp. for as many as 30 A318s, the plane it will
build to challenge Boeing in the 100-seat jet market.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been heavily courting ILFC to buy the 717.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say there is room in the market for only one
plane in this class, and with ILFC's stamp of approval, it's
obvious the A318 is that airplane,'' said Richard Aboulafia, senior
aviation analyst with the Teal Group, a closely followed aerospace
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Mr. Mulally, I'd say it's time to pack it in on the
717.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mulally is head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, at least publicly, is having none of that kind of dire
predictions about the future of its 717.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Fernando Vivanco noted that ILFC and Boeing are still
talking about the 717. In the past, ILFC has often split orders
between Boeing and Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like the plane and feel there is a market for it,''
Vivanco said of the leasing company.
</P>
<P>
   He said Boeing's goal is to announce a new order for the 717
before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if such an order would be ``significant,'' he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are talking about $30 million or so (per plane), any
order is significant ... five, 10 or 20. It's all significant.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 717 doesn't sell, it not only has consequences for Boeing
but for workers at the Douglas Division in Long Beach where the
plane is built.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing previously announced that it will end production there of
the MD-80 and MD-90 twinjets, with the loss of about 3,000 jobs.
And Boeing plans to stop production in early 2000 of the
unprofitable MD-11 widebody trijet, built in an adjacent factory
building in the Douglas complex. That will mean the loss of another
3,000 or so jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Douglas Division now has about 10,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 work on the 717 program, though that could increase
to about 2,500 once the plane enters full production next year. The
first 717 is scheduled to be delivered to AirTran Airlines,
formerly ValuJet, in the third quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was to have started production last month of some 737
models in Long Beach, but Mulally is reviewing whether it makes
good business sense to proceed with a new California assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   The 717 was launched in October 1995 with an order for 50
airplanes and 50 options from ValuJet.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was known then as the MD-95 and was the final
McDonnell Douglas plane to come off the drawing boards before the
1997 merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the AirTran order, Bavaria International Aircraft
Leasing has ordered five planes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing believes there is a market for about 2,600 planes the
size of the 717 over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The list price of the Boeing plane is from $30 million to $34
million.
</P>
<P>
   The 717 flew for the first time in early September, just days
before the start of the big Farnborough international airshow near
London. Two of the planes are now in flight testing.
</P>
<P>
   It was believed that Boeing would announce at Farnborough that
it had lined up new customers for its 717. That did not happen.
Rolf Sellge, the program's marketing director, told reporters at
the airshow, ``In the next two to three months, we will be able to
tell you about substantial new orders.''
</P>
<P>
   The 717 was being offered to 19 airlines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is Northwest, which operates a fleet of 180 older
DC-9s built by McDonnell Douglas. Boeing President Harry
Stonecipher, who headed McDonnell Douglas when the MD-95 was
launched, has said the plane is the ideal replacement for the DC-9.
</P>
<P>
   But Northwest already flys the Airbus A320, which is a bigger
version of the 100-seat A318.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller Airbus plane would have what is known as
``commonality'' with the bigger Airbus plane. That means
substantial cost savings for an airline, according to industry
analysts, who believe Northwest will pick the A318 over the 717.
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia said commonality outweighs any benefits the 717 might
have over the A318. Boeing, for example, likes to point out that
the 717 is significantly lighter than the A318, and that save an
airlne millions of dollars a year in airport takeoff and landing
fees. Those fees are based on airplane weight.
</P>
<P>
   An Airbus spokesman said Tuesday the aircraft maker still needs
additional orders beyond the 30 from ILFC before it launches
production of the A318.
</P>
<P>
   If production were started by the end of this year, the A318
would still not enter service until 2002, Airbus has said.
</P>
<P>
   That gives Boeing a huge advantage, said spokesman Vivanco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could deliver 300 717s before the first A318 is ever
delivered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not going to happen, according to Aboulafia.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that AirTran will end up taking delivery of fewer
than two dozen of the 50 planes it ordered as the launch customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see them taking any more than 20 or so. They don't
have the money or the requirement,'' Aboulafia said, adding that it
is ``stupid'' for Boeing to continue production of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants an orphan airplane,'' he said.

   The 11th-season premiere of ``The American Experience'' on PBS
(Wednesday night, check local listings) takes advantage of the
gathering millennial madness to look at another time when a younger
America was also anxiously peeling back the covers on a new
century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, there were five fewer united states than there are now,
and only 76 million people living in them. Cars were scarce: only
8,000. Pavement was scarcer: less than 10 miles of concrete
roadway. There was no federal income tax, but still the life
expectancy of the American male was a scant 48 years. (Women
averaged three years longer.)
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a very different time, but if any viewers notice
something oddly familiar about ``America 1900'' tonight, they can
go to the head of the class. They obviously have been paying
attention these past hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   In this three-hour special from filmmaker David Grubin (``FDR,''
``Truman''), the past-as-prologue message is delivered with all the
subtlety of a bull moose, but it's OK. Subtle or not, ``The
American Experience'' usually manages to make learning _ or
re-learning _ so much more fun than it was in Brother Robert's
sophomore-year ``Problems of Democracy'' class.
</P>
<P>
   ``America 1900,'' for instance, separates the year into four
segments roughly aligned with the seasons. Part 1, ``Spirit of the
Age,'' begins with President William McKinley greeting thousands of
visitors to his traditional New Year's Day reception at the White
House. In tone and texture, the president's enthusiastic mingling
with the masses perfectly captured the spirit of the age: a heady
rush of optimism, good will and exuberance in a blossoming economy.
Signs of progress were everywhere, with technological advances _
moving pictures, X-rays, automobiles, sound recordings, the
electric light _ outpacing the average American's ability to
understand them.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its hope and buoyancy, it was not the perfect year.
Hey, no year is ever perfect. Simmering beneath the surface in 1900
was a general unease. U.S. troops, flush with victory in the
Spanish-American War, were now mired in a guerrilla conflict
against independence-minded citizens of the Philippines who were as
unenamored of Americans as they had been of Spaniards.
</P>
<P>
   In an election year, it was a problem McKinley needed to solve
if he wanted to keep the hearts and minds of the voters focused on
the good times. But a Scottish immigrant named John Muir didn't
help matters at home when he started wondering about the price of
unchecked domestic progress on the resources that most Americans
just assumed were in infinite supply. Muir found an audience in a
burgeoning urban population that embraced the great outdoors with
adolescent fervor.
</P>
<P>
   With Part 2, ``Change Is in the Air,'' and Part 3, ``A Great
Civilized Power,'' Grubin and co-writer Judy Crichton continue with
the trouble-in-paradise scenario: ``Sapho,'' a Broadway play about
a free-spirited, sexually adventurous woman, sparks a long-running
flap over public morality; a flood of immigrants begins to sow
seeds of ethnic and racial mistrust; a coal-mine explosion in
Scofield, Utah, kills more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   But through it all, Grubin is struck by the pluck of America in
1900. It is evident in his and Crichton's writing, and in the
choice of perhaps the perfect narrator, historian David McCullough.
The pleasant timbre of McCullough's voice always has a smile
inherent in its authoritativeness.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the systematic abrogation of the rights of African
Americans, despite the extermination of Americans and other
foreigners in China during the Boxer uprising, despite the most
destructive hurricane in U.S. history, there was a lot of hope in
1900, as noted in Part 4, ``Anything Seemed Possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like Grubin is sugar-coating history, be assured
that ``America 1900'' doesn't skimp on the bad stuff. What's in
short supply here is cynicism and skepticism. But what's wrong with
that?
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>
   Another one bites the dust: Peter Roth has bailed out as
president of Fox Entertainment Group, the second network
programming honcho to abandon ship this season. Like Warren
Littlefield, who left NBC three weeks ago, Roth will return to the
production arena. Roth's replacement will be Doug Herzog, president
and CEO of Comedy Central. . . . Luke Perry returns to ``Beverly
Hills, 90210'' Wednesday night (check local listings). Former
``General Hospital'' regular Vanessa Marcil also joins the cast. .
. . Barbara Walters will be the first to interview Monica Lewinsky
_ on ABC's ``20/20'' sometime early next year. . . . Catch of the
month: Fox Sports Net's landing of Keith Olbermann, the ex-ESPN
wiseacre who realized his news-anchor gig at MSNBC was a bad idea.
Olbermann goes on the air in mid-December. . . . Preliminary
dust-biting: CBS has pulled ``To Have and To Hold'' and ``Buddy
Faro'' for the remainder of November sweeps. Both are expected to
return in December, but neither one has received assurances of a
full-season order. . . .

A NEW BREED IN WESTWOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The spigots on the right side of UCLA's shower
room are reserved for All-Americans. Everyone else uses them to
hang towels. No one has showered on the right side since Ed
O'Bannon, and each season the upperclassmen explain the tradition
to freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Loyd has done a lot of explaining lately.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd is UCLA's only senior and one of two upperclassmen, with
walk-on junior Sean Farnham. They are two against 12 freshmen and
sophomores _ and loving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good change,'' Loyd said. ``We've got a new
personality, a new attitude and there's new conversation in the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain, but the whole feel is different. There
are no cliques. Last year, with the seniors and all the freshmen,
we had a little of that. This will be a great team to play for,
even if we don't win that many games.''
</P>
<P>
   And that _ not their off-court trauma, aversion to defense and
petulant personas _ is the legacy of Toby Bailey, J.R. Henderson
and Kris Johnson. In four years, they won 92 regular-season games,
11 NCAA Tournament games, three Pac-10 titles and one national
championship. They were frustrating and confounding and often
eschewed coaching, but they won.
</P>
<P>
   The current Bruins follow coach Steve Lavin's every order like a
Romper Room class. They do not talk back, they play unselfishly and
they hustle. But will they survive a brutal Pac-10 and earn the
school's 11th consecutive NCAA Tournament berth?
</P>
<P>
   In past years, UCLA's participation in March Madness was a
given. Not so this season, because the Bruins cannot assume 12-15
victories in Pac-10 play. In fact, these baby Bruins may do well to
finish 10-8 in a league as competitive as the Atlantic Coast
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   More than any year in recent memory, UCLA's postseason fate may
depend on its pre-conference success. The Bruins must hoard
victories this month and next and brace themselves for a wild
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on sophomore guard Baron Davis' reconstructed left
knee. Even if he returns in December, he'll need weeks, perhaps
months, to regain timing and confidence in the knee. It's unlikely
he'll be as effective as he was last year _ at least not now, not
this season.
</P>
<P>
   How will he respond? If Davis tries to be what he was and gets
frustrated because he isn't, UCLA's fledgling confidence and
chemistry may suffer. Like USC and Arizona, the Bruins will lean
heavily on freshmen and sophomores. Unlike USC and Arizona, the
Bruins start the season with their best player recovering from
major surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest thing I've ever been through,'' Davis said.
``It's hard, it's tough, it's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins probably will start at least two freshmen, center Dan
Gadzuric and forward JaRon Rush, and two sophomores, guard Earl
Watson and forward Travis Reed. Watson is the most improved player
and the floor leader, but Rush must carry the scoring load in
Davis' absence. There's no one named O'Bannon or Bailey to make big
shots in enemy arenas with the pressure on and the crowd screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bruins played just well enough for 35 minutes to
stay within range of their foe, because Bailey, Johnson and
Henderson knew they'd make the decisive plays down the stretch.
That is not true this season. UCLA cannot waste a minute, not the
11th or the 31st. There's no telling how Watson and Reed and Rush
will react in the final minutes. Every week, every game, will bring
something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think coach Lavin is getting a couple gray hairs in his
head,'' Reed said. ``It's like playing in a park with a bunch of
young guys. We're all real excited.''
</P>
<P>
   If the freshmen are getting acclimated, Lavin and his staff seem
comfortable with their new surroundings. For two years they've
waited for this moment, when their recruits dominated the roster.
They've instilled energy and selflessness. Now, we'll see if they
can coach _ if they can build a system to suit their talent, if
they can devise game plans to attack weakness, if they can make
their players better over time.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, Bailey and Johnson had the same strengths and
weaknesses when they arrived in 1994 as when they departed last
spring. Will Lavin's recruits follow the same path?
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff often talks about ``reloading,'' about
keeping UCLA at an elite level season after season. But Duke had a
few bad years. Indiana and Georgetown have had plenty. Michigan,
North Carolina and Arizona lost key players and may struggle to win
20 games this year.
</P>
<P>
   With a team as young as UCLA's in a conference as good as the
Pac-10, it seems inevitable UCLA will lose 10, 12, perhaps 14
games. But to judge Lavin on temporal success alone ignores the
building blocks (ie: discipline, strategy and player development)
necessary for long-term prosperity. That's where he must succeed.
</P>
<P>
   What's at stake in Westwood this season isn't an NCAA Tournament
berth, but a glimpse into the program's future.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Davis has been cleared for full contact scrimmaging but is
not expected to play Thursday against Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he starts scrimmaging, the only thing left is games,''
Lavin said. ``My inclination is he will not play Thursday.''

 &HT;    Texas Supreme Court looks at loophole in juvenile justice
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Supreme Court justices, acting in a rare
criminal case Tuesday, confronted a hole in state juvenile law wide
enough to allow a girl accused of provoking a murder to escape
virtually unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   The issue for the court to decide will be whether the law
requires that a juvenile offender involved in a murder be freed
because she turned 18 before trial. But even if the Supreme Court
decides the law does not require that, the girl at the center of
the case _ now 21 _ is too old to be sentenced to a state juvenile
detention center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very frustrating case for everyone,'' said the
trial prosecutor, Bobbie Twigg, an assistant Harris County district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The court _ the state's highest arbiter for civil law _ heard
arguments in the juvenile case because juvenile criminal
proceedings are considered civil matters.
</P>
<P>
   In the case argued Tuesday, the defendant, Natasha Jonell
Arnold, was 16 when prosecutors said she riled her jealous
18-year-old boyfriend by telling him one of her colleagues at a
Houston fast-food restaurant was flirting with and pinching her.
Twigg said Arnold directed her boyfriend and three friends on a
payback mission, provoking the baseball-bat beating death of the
other teen as he carried grease from the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Gary Polland of Houston said Arnold only drove
her boyfriend to the restaurant to talk with the victim, and the
beating resulted when tempers flared.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors pressed a murder charge against Arnold. After an
unsuccessful attempt to certify her as an adult, a juvenile court
judge found her guilty of aggravated assault. But at the beginning
of her trial, Arnold's lawyers argued that she was beyond the
juvenile court's jurisdiction because she had turned 18.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge rejected the argument, then sentenced Arnold to
the Texas Youth Commission but allowed her to remain free on bond
during her appeal. Houston's 1st District Court of Appeal reversed
the trial judge, agreeing with the defense that the juvenile
court's power over the case had ended because prosecutors had not
tried the girl by the time she turned 18. That decision set up the
prosecutors' appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a jurisdictional case,'' Houston defense attorney Gary
Polland told the court Tuesday. ``It's not a technicality. It's
jurisdictional.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurisdiction _ determined by the Legislature _ defines a court's
authority to act in certain cases.
</P>
<P>
   To decide the case, justices will have to interpret the
Legislature's intent in the law that the Houston appeals court
decided barred prosecution of the teen-age girl. She had turned 18
before she was tried. Texas considers adults to be 17 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Texas family code, a juvenile court has authority to
try children between 10 and 17, but prosecutors can pursue a case
against a 17-year-old for conduct before the teen-ager turns 18.
</P>
<P>
   On the appeal, Alan Curry, the assistant district attorney,
argued that the trial court's jurisdiction continued beyond
Arnold's 18th birthday because prosecutors had initiated the case
against her before then.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas law professor Bob Dawson, a juvenile-law
specialist, agreed. But Dawson said he did not know what the court
might do in such a juvenile case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take so few of them,'' he said, ``they really don't have
solid grounding in juvenile law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Polland said the law's restrictive penalties for juvenile
offenders older than 17 _ barring probation and leaving detention
as the only possibility _ argued that the law barred a juvenile
court's authority in a case like Arnold's.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, left state lawmakers _ not the court _ to devise
a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature needs to give the state time to do its
business,'' Polland said.
</P>
<P>
   Osler McCarthy writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board bowed to investors' expectations with
its rate cuts Tuesday. But for its trouble, it earned only
half-hearted applause from stock and bond traders.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good reason for that muted reaction. Ever since
investors fled risky markets this summer for the safe haven of U.S.
Treasuries, the bond market has been leading the Fed on
interest-rate policy, trading at levels that predicted even further
drops in key rates. But Tuesday, both stock and bond investors
seemed to respond to signals in the Fed's comments that this, its
third cut since Sept. 29, could be the last for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The two quarter-point cuts Tuesday _ one in the federal funds
rate to 4.75 percent, another in the discount rate to 4.5 percent _
was pretty much what stock traders had been counting on from the
Fed's monetary policy meeting. Consequently, while the moves
briefly helped propel the Dow Jones industrial average to around
9,100 points, up more than 92 points, by the end of the day the
rate cuts were not enough to keep the average in positive
territory. The Dow ended the day down 24.97 points, closing at
8,986.28.
</P>
<P>
   Other indexes reacted more positively. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
crept up 3.45 points. The NASDAQ composite ended the day up 16.84
points, almost 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bond traders had been less cocky about a Fed cut. When the
announcement came, Treasury bonds mustered only a temporary rally,
hitting a wall of selling that left the yield on the 30-year bond
up just one-hundredth of a percentage point, at 5.30 percent.
Yields on bonds with shorter maturities _ notes coming due in two
years and five years, for instance _ inched up further.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the markets' reaction to Tuesday's move by the Fed is
more crucial than usual because financial-market stress _ not
troubling economic figures _ has driven Fed policy in recent
months. This is unusual. The last time it happened was in 1987,
after the stock market crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Fed been looking strictly at recent economic data, it
would almost certainly not have cut rates. ``Where is the
slowdown?'' asked Peter Canelo, U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``What they did today was unnecessary _
it was a precautionary move. The economy is doing well and is going
to be doing even better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, gross domestic product is growing at more than a 3
percent clip, there is a boom in housing demand, and sales of both
automobiles and smaller-ticket consumer goods are strong. Consumer
confidence is rising again after a couple of troubling dips and the
stock market is soaring. None of this would typically signal a need
for a drop in rates.
</P>
<P>
   Bond-market stability is, however, a more complex matter to
measure. The Fed has been looking for signs of a credit contraction
there that could push the economy into a recession. If the markets
appear to be more stable in the coming weeks, then the likelihood
of further rate cuts recedes.
</P>
<P>
   By several measures, stability is returning to some of the
investment arenas that had been hardest hit by the Russian default
and other meltdowns in emerging markets. What had been cavernous
spreads in September in the yields between Treasuries and
non-Treasury debt like junk bonds or mortgage securities are much
narrower now.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on Merrill Lynch's master index of high-yield bonds
closed on Tuesday 5.37 percentage points more than Treasuries with
similar maturities. Though still wide, the gap is a full percentage
point slimmer than it had been. Furthermore, investors are piling
into junk-bond funds at a furious rate _ roughly $1 billion a week
recently _ enlivening a market that had been comatose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment certainly seems to have changed dramatically
from late September, when companies were starting to fail for lack
of ability to roll over their debts,'' Martin Fridson, chief
high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch, said. That's exactly the
reaction from investors the Fed was hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   And investors in the stock market are almost swaggering again.
Canelo noted that after the market crash of 1987, it took 15 months
for stock prices to recover half of what they had lost. Following
this summer's market drop, it took less than four weeks to recover
half of what stock indexes had lost.
</P>
<P>
   One reason stock prices may have rebounded so spectacularly is
that the supply of money in the country's financial system has
ballooned of late. And while some of this money has flowed into the
stock market, the growth may also preclude a recession next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a recession take place when money growth is
rising at these rates,'' said Lief Olson, director of Absolute
Return Investors, an institutional money management firm in New
Canaan, Conn. ``With low inflation, continuing growth, and low
interest rates, you do not have a recipe for weak growth or
recession.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the nation averts a recession, higher stock prices
may not be the result. Daniel Laufenberg, chief U.S. economist for
American Express Financial Advisers in Minneapolis, is a bull on
corporate earnings for next year, but he thinks stock prices will
only tread water in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because he reckons that interest rates will rise. ``Credit
spreads and risk aversion by investors has created the need for the
Fed to ease,'' Laufenberg said. ``At some point, the Fed will have
to start focusing on economic fundamentals rather than financial
market conditions and when they do, I believe the Fed will discover
that the fundamentals are still very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   A rate increase next year, he said, could be the result.

 &HT;    Austin consultants strive for employee 'democracy'
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The founders of Athens Group Inc. set out to
form a more perfect technology consulting company. One where
everyone owns a share of the business and where everyone can share
in the profits based on their contributions. A place where clients
get the best service.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an industry driven by intellectual capital, it just made
sense to put exclusive ownership into the hands of the people that
drive the value of the organization _ the employees,'' says Mike
Haney, chief executive officer of Athens Group, which provides
technology strategy and custom software development.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are given shares in the company based on their years'
service, their initial investment and their performance. If they
leave Athens Group, they must sell their shares back to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   What this Northwest Austin business with 11 employees has done
is thrown out the hierarchy found at most companies and created a
management structure based on democratic principles. Even its name
reflects that philosophy. Athens, Greece, is considered the
birthplace of democracy, a city known for fostering freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Athens Group is part of two trends being embraced by a growing
number of small companies _ allowing employees more involvement in
decision-making and giving them part ownership, says Corey Rosen,
executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership,
based in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen estimates more than 2,000 companies now offer employee
ownership, ranging from small businesses like the Athens Group to
the 6,500-employee W.L. Gore &AMP; Associates, the Delaware maker of
Gore-Tex fabric and clothing. More companies are trying this for
two reasons: Studies show that companies that give employees
ownership are more competitive and it helps them attract and retain
top workers, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just altruism and ideology driving this,'' Rosen
says. ``It's about making money.''
</P>
<P>
   A recently completed study of 382 companies looked at the link
between employee ownership and companies' financial results. The
study, by professor Hamid Mehran of the J.L. Kellogg Graduate
School of Management at Northwestern University, found firms had on
average a 14.3 percent greater return on assets after starting the
ownership plans and an average 12 percent increase in total
shareholder return compared to similar companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen says firms like Athens Group are well suited to this
management structure because they are led by young entrepreneurs
willing to try another approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was driven not only by philosophical reasons but to provide
the best service for clients,'' says Haney.
</P>
<P>
   Athens' founders are primarily former executives of Sterling
Information Group Inc., a software consulting company started in
1986. Sterling, which earned a reputation for its unusually
flexible work environment, was sold earlier this year to
Renaissance Worldwide in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One of Sterling's founders, Chip Wolfe, set up the company to
allow people to find a good balance between their work life and
their personal lives. His actions were prompted by the needs of Dan
Thibodeau, one of Sterling's founders and now a director of Athens
Group. Thibodeau had a young son with cerebral palsy and needed a
more flexible schedule so he could take his son to medical
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned a lot at Sterling that's been valuable to us as we
go forward,'' says Haney, 44, who was president of Sterling from
1993 to 1998. ``What was great about that experience is the values
of the company were really based around employee participation,
teamwork, mutual respect and quality of life.'' Thibodeau has been
in charge of formulating the management policies for Athens. He
says he draws ideas from the 1994 book, ``The Democratic
Corporation: A Radical Prescription for Recreating Corporate
America and Rediscovering Success,'' by Russell Ackoff, a professor
emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of
business.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ackoff, service organizations can most easily adopt
this type of approach because the work can be provided by
individuals or small groups.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't suit every type of company or employee, he says.

STARR TRIES ON STRATEGIES IN REHEARSAL FOR ROLE AS WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 5th graf to update with rejection of White House request) (htv) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preparing for his appearance before the House
Judiciary Committee on Thursday, independent counsel Kenneth Starr
has rehearsed testimony that details a pattern of obstruction by
the White House extending beyond the matter of Monica Lewinsky,
lawyers familiar with his preparations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not made a final decision about the contents of
his two-hour opening statement, Starr has discussed the possibility
of drawing parallels between the White House's alleged coverup in
the Lewinsky affair and earlier alleged attempts to thwart other
aspects of the four-year-old Whitewater inquiry, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   As one lawyer put it, Starr plans to place the allegations of
perjury and obstruction of justice against President Clinton into
``historical perspective.'' Starr is also prepared to highlight the
``systematic'' campaign by the White House and its loyalists to
delay and undermine his office's investigation this year, lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who lie and perjure themselves have been able to get
away with it by complaining about prosecutors and portraying
prosecutors as villains,'' Charles G. Bakaly III, Starr's
spokesman, said during a wide-ranging interview Tuesday. ``We
believe we have been the victim of a coordinated effort to
stonewall and destroy our prosecutorial authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, announced Tuesday that it
would call more witnesses to testify in the inquiry, and rejected a
White House request for 90 minutes to cross-examine Starr, rather
than the 30 minutes the committee allotted it.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for those questions, Starr has spent much of the past
several weeks holding moot court-style proceedings in his office
conference room. While a video camera records the sessions, several
senior prosecutors rattle off hostile questions that they
anticipate committee Democrats will pose.
</P>
<P>
   At one point late last week, Starr told his colleagues, ``We
apologize to no one for seeking the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his office's exhaustive preparations, lawyers say that
Starr does not view his appearance as a last-ditch attempt to sway
public opinion, an accusation made by some Democrats Tuesday.
Starr's personal approval ratings have been stuck in the single
digits for months, in part as a reflection of the public's
weariness with the 10-month, sex-and-cover-up investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not seek vindication for himself on Thursday,'' Bakaly
explained. ``But he does seek vindication of the facts and the rule
of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr steered away from raising other areas of the Whitewater
inquiry in his Sept. 9 referral to Congress, which recommended 11
impeachable offenses related to the coverup of Clinton's affair
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decision that helped White House lawyers dismiss the
report as the product of a sex-obsessed inquiry, an argument that
has resonated with the public. The decision also infuriated some
Starr allies, who had openly called for Starr to draw parallels
between the Lewinsky matter and other areas of his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is determined to defend his report's findings on Thursday,
his allies said Tuesday. ``He absolutely stands by the referral,''
Bakaly said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are extremely high for Starr's appearance as the
impeachment inquiry's first witness. The fate of the impeachment
inquiry, as well as Starr's legacy, is likely to depend on the
public's reaction to the independent counsel's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with Starr's preparations said that his opening
statement would present a dispassionate review of the facts and the
law in the referral made in September to Congress. By disclosing
his discussions about possible areas of his testimony, Starr's
aides may be attempting to gauge the public reaction to the
possibility that he may widen the scope of his testimony to other
matters still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his last opportunity to make people realize that this
investigation was not just about sex,'' said Barbara Olson, a
Washington lawyer who is a frequent defender of Starr on
television. ``I don't know that Starr is ready for the level of
lies that he is going to have to face.''
</P>
<P>
   As the solicitor general during the Bush administration, Starr,
52, argued cases before the Supreme Court, where he felt
comfortable with the high court's deeply respectful decorum. Starr
has no experience making such an important presentation amid the
partisan free-for-all of the House Judiciary Committee room, where
snappy soundbites will be the goal of many of the 37 members, each
of whom will be given five minutes to quiz Starr on any subject.
</P>
<P>
   Some committee Democrats are preparing to fire hostile questions
at Starr to portray him as a right-wing, overzealous prosecutor who
remains determined to destroy the president. They plan to ask Starr
questions about allegations that his office leaked grand jury
material and about his prosecutors' contacts last January with
conservative opponents of the president who had links to Paula
Corbin Jones' sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel also plan to object to any attempts by
Starr _ or conservative Republican members _ to steer the hearing
to matters not contained in the referral.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have presumed that Starr would confine his testimony to the
four corners of the referral itself,'' said Jim Jordan, the
spokesman for the committee Democrats. ``It would be unacceptable
to our members for Starr to offer unproven allegations or innuendo
in an effort to somehow rehabilitate a failed investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said that Starr has expressed no opinion about the
public's rather tepid reaction to the Starr Report and its
allegations. Lawyers and friends described Starr as feeling upbeat
and looking forward to the opportunity to speak before the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, he sees this as the continuation of his duty to
assist Congress in their duty to make a judgment,'' Bakaly said.
``We make no judgments. We have simply gathered the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson's husband, Theodore Olson, who is also a Washington lawyer
and a close friend of Starr, acknowledged that Starr has no
experience presenting the facts and the law in a congressional
committee room riven by partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very different forum from what he is accustomed
to,'' Theodore Olson said. ``This will be five minutes of
interrogation, per person, by some friendly and some hostile
interrogators. Some of them will ask questions, some of them will
deliver speeches, some of them will engage in argument, some of
them may be attempted to do some grandstanding for the nightly
news. You don't see that kind of thing often in court from
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly agreed, saying: ``In the political world and world of
public opinion, Starr has been demonized by his critics. But in the
legal world, Starr has won repeatedly.'' Bakaly pointed out that
Starr's office has won 15 legal decisions against the White House
this year on issues such as the president's assertion of executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's allies also complained that the White House has
successfully advanced the argument that the independent counsel has
been motivated by a political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made no attempt to influence public opinion.'' Bakaly
said. ``Isn't it obvious?''

ON EVE OF VOTE, 3 OF 5 HOUSE GOP TOP SPOTS STILL CONTESTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a last-ditch effort to block Rep. Dick Armey
from being re-elected on Wednesday as House majority leader, one of
his two opponents tried to get the other to drop out and support
his race against Armey.
</P>
<P>
   But that opponent, Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., failed to
persuade Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., to quit. Tuesday both said
they were in the race to stay and they expected to force a runoff
after Armey is denied re-election on the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   With just hours until House Republicans decide who will lead
them in the new Congress, the races for three of the five top
positions remained hotly contested. Because the ballots are secret,
there are no reliable forecasts of the outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   The three races in which the outcomes are not certain are for
majority leader, conference chairman and chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee. Uncontested are the posts of
speaker, for which Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., is to be
nominated Wednesday, and majority whip, now held by Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The unsettled state of the leadership team reflected the
uncertain state of the party as it regroups after losing five seats
in the midterm elections two weeks ago and plots life after Newt
Gingrich, the larger-than-life speaker who was forced from office
after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Armey of Texas, in the No. 2 job in the House, alienated a
number of members when he supported a failed coup attempt against
Gingrich last year and then told Gingrich about it before it became
public. Many members expect Armey to win more votes than anyone
else on the first round, but not enough _ a majority _ to claim
victory.
</P>
<P>
   So Largent and Ms. Dunn are each hoping to place second. Whoever
comes in last is eliminated from balloting. Each of them is hoping
to claim second place, which would win the right to face off in
another round of balloting against the first-round winner, who is
expected to be Armey.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Ms. Dunn rejected Largent's suggestion that she quit the
race and he, if elected, would appoint her to a new position of
assistant majority leader. ``That's all there was to it,'' said
Kara Kindermann, an aide to Ms. Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Still brewing is a last-minute effort to draft a fourth
candidate, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., into the race for majority
leader. Although Hastert has not campaigned for the job, he has not
said he would not serve. As a result, his two most overt
supporters, Reps. Thomas Ewing, R-Ill., and Michael Castle, R-Del.,
plan to place his name in nomination Wednesday and hope that he
survives the first ballot and can go on to win as a consensus
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Also under fire is Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, the conference
chairman, who is facing a stiff challenge from Rep. J.C. Watts,
R-Okla. Watts, the only black Republican in the House, on Tuesday
claimed to have 118 ``solid'' votes, four more than a majority,
while Boehner's aides said he ``would not play the numbers game.''
</P>
<P>
   The third incumbent in a precarious spot is Rep. John Linder,
R-Ga., chairman of the party's campaign committee. The post is a
sensitive one in which crucial decisions are made about strategy
and distribution of party money in elections. Linder, who took some
blame for the Republican losses in the elections, is being
challenged by Rep. Thomas Davis, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans will choose most of their leaders Wednesday.
Only the speaker, which is a House-wide position, is elected by
both Democrats and Republicans, and that election is scheduled for
Jan. 6. But the Republicans are to nominate their candidate,
Livingston, on Wednesday, and because there is a Republican
majority, he will be elected when the House convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats held their re-organization election quietly Monday
and Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., was re-elected without challenge as
minority leader. Wednesday, Gephardt announced the appointment of
Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., a son of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., as the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee. The job is a crucial one for fund raising for Democratic
candidates as they prepare for the elections in 2000, when they
hope to regain control of the House.

MICROSOFT HAMPERED OS/2, IBM OFFICIAL TELLS COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MICROSOFT-SUN) 
(mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior IBM executive accused Microsoft Corp.
Tuesday of imposing contract restrictions on software developers
that prevented OS/2, IBM's computer operating system, from
effectively competing with Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   John Soyring, director of network computing software for IBM
Corp., took the witness stand Tuesday afternoon in the government's
antitrust suit against Microsoft. In the early 1990s, he was in
charge of developing OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   For part of that time, OS/2 was being jointly developed by IBM
and Microsoft as a replacement for MS-DOS, the Microsoft operating
system that preceded Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In written testimony, Soyring largely blamed Microsoft for
OS/2's tiny 6 percent market share. Though the suit does not
include complaints about Microsoft's monopoly hold over
personal-computer operating systems, its competitive business
practices are central to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Soyring testified that Microsoft provides certain programming
tools that software developers use to write programs that run on
Windows machines. Developers rely on those tools, he said, but
Microsoft forbids their use in writing software for other operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Soyring said, if a company wants to create a
version of, say, a word processing program for OS/2 computers, it
would have to ``recreate much of the application from scratch,''
making it difficult to ``justify the cost of offering the
application on OS/2.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in a statement Tuesday, said, ``IBM made decisions
with its OS/2 operating system that were not well received by
consumers and did not make it easy for developers to make great
applications for their platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1989, when IBM and Microsoft were still
collaborating on OS/2, they designed it to run only on expensive
computers with more memory than was typical at the time. Until
hardware caught up, the companies said, customers could use
Microsoft's new product, Windows. Eventually, however, the
computing world turned to Windows, and Microsoft ended its
partnership with IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The government also played a short clip from the 20-hour
deposition last summer of Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, in
which he was asked about Microsoft's relationship with IBM. In an
e-mail message last November, Gates wrote that he was unhappy with
IBM because ``the Java religion coming out of the software group is
a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Java is the programming language created by Sun Microsystems
that can be used on any operating system. As in previous parts of
the deposition shown in court, Gates said he did not recall much
about his e-mail message or about other topics on which he was
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Gates did volunteer that he had wanted IBM to stop criticizing
Microsoft, adding that he had ``talked about rhetoric being lowered
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Soyring _ like a previous witness, Glenn Weadock, who ended his
testimony Tuesday _ also said IBM saw no advantage in integrating a
Web browser with the company's operating system. ``Indeed,'' he
said, ``integration could be inefficient and disadvantageous to
customers'' because it could ``increase the size of the operating
system and therefore the size of the hardware required to run it
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   As Weadock finished his testimony earlier in the day, the
government showed memorandums and played deposition excerpts from
executives of several large corporations _ including Boeing,
Packard Bell NEC and Gateway _ who offered similar sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, Gateway wants to have flexibility on anything
associated with the Internet,'' Jim Von Holle, a Gateway executive,
wrote in an internal company memo last April. ``We want Microsoft
to provide us with the technology, not make decisions and choices
for us or our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kies, a Packard Bell NEC executive, said in a videotaped
deposition that ``it wouldn't make sense to have two very large
programs installed'' _ Microsoft's browser and another that a user
might choose to use instead _ ``taking up hard disk space and
potentially confusing customers.''

 &HT;    Boehner's status may be another Election Day casualty
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Rep. John Boehner's tenure among the
Republican elite could end today when the party meets to elect a
leadership team while still is smarting over surprising Election
Day losses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Speaker Newt Gingrich already has stepped down, the
thirst for change at the top may not have been satisfied. Boehner
(R-Ohio) is struggling to hold on the fourth-ranking member in the
House hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Once part of the conservative revolution that took over Congress
four years ago, Boehner now is fighting the perception that he's
the status-quo choice in a race against Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, a young, energetic star of the GOP who already enjoys
national visibility as he begins his third term.
</P>
<P>
   Since the voting is by secret ballot, it's impossible to count
votes ahead of time, but Watts has compiled as formidable a list of
public supporters as has the well-established Boehner. But it's not
uncommon for public supporters to secretly vote for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been our policy all along to avoid playing the numbers
game,'' Boehner spokesman David Schnittger said in response to
Watts' claim that he has confirmed enough votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Schnittger pointed out that when Boehner first won the job of
chairman of the Republican Conference in 1994, he had boasted of
140 confirmed supporters. Although Boehner prevailed, the final
count showed he was ``a chunk of votes shy'' of the commitments he
thought he had.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner's office acknowledges the race is tight. So tight, in
fact, Boehner has been working the phones non-stop since Nov. 10.
Schnittger said he's spending every waking moment dialing GOP
colleagues, marshaling support even through his 49th birthday
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the world's shortest surprise birthday party,''
Schnittger said. ``Three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehner cut the cake, baked by a staffer, then promptly returned
to the phone in his private office in the suite of rooms known
among Republicans as Boehnerland.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the chairman's job, which carries a $1.1 million
annual office budget and a staff of two dozen that provides a
clearinghouse of information for Republican members of Congress.
The conference office provides everything from tips on setting up a
district office to plain-English explanations of bills being
considered.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans feel the party's communication operation,
which falls within the conference office Boehner runs, contributed
to the GOP's poor showing in elections two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP lead shrank by five seats. When Congress returns in
January, the Republicans will have a mere six-vote majority, the
slimmest margin of control in decades.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats hamstrung by President Clinton's persisting sex
scandal, Republicans had expected to comfortably expand their
majority in the House, but were blind-sided when the votes were
counted.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the Election Day debacle, Gingrich resigned. His
replacement, after swift jockeying by a few ambitious members, will
be Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana. He is running unchallenged in
the party elections today.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the ballot is the job of Majority Leader, the No. 2 spot
behind the speaker. Rep. Richard Armey of Texas has drawn two
strong challengers for the position; one is Steve Largent, a
telegenic Oklahoman and ex-Seattle Seahawks star; the other is a
savvy woman from Washington, Jennifer Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3 position, for Majority Whip, the person who lines up
votes on bills, will remain in the hands of Texan Rep. Tom DeLay,
the only unchallenged member of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an overall tide for change, and Boehner is trying to
swim against it,'' said John Pitney Jr. a professor of political
science at Claremont McKenna College near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney, who has closely charted the Gingrich revolution, said
many party rank-and-filers are furious with Gingrich and Armey but
they may not take the time to distinguish one leader from another.
He said Boehner's role as party communicator is making him an
unfair target for the party's lack of an Election Day message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boehner is getting hit by the crossfire,'' Pitney said. ``But
you can't communicate what isn't there.''

frequently about film and television.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The words book and television tug against each other in a fairly
obvious way, but I still can't help smiling at the sassy paradox
implicit in the designation Book TV.
</P>
<P>
   That's what C-Span 2 calls the round-the-clock weekend
programming it introduced in September, displacing reruns of the
United States Senate, the estimable show this cable network carries
live on most weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Even pathological readers with fond memories of glancing up to
watch Dick Cavett joust with the likes of Lillian Hellman should be
skeptical about an enterprise whose advertising line is ``All
books. All weekend. Every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, Book TV may prove to be an enormous waste of
time, yet another invasion upon the consciousness by an empty
end-of-the-century pretense to seriousness. Worse, Book TV may turn
out to be addictive, especially in concert with its Internet site,
www.booktv.org., cutting into precious page-turning time.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I cranked up the VCR and gave in to the urge to find
out what Book TV was all about, and I came away from my browsing
with an odd sense of exasperated admiration. The programming _ an
array of author interviews interspersed with fly-on-the-wall visits
to readings, industry discussion panels, book festivals, stores and
production sites _ has much in it that will enhance the impassioned
reader's most beloved pastime.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not yet expansive enough to be addictive; too many of
its hours carry the rubric ``Encore Booknotes,'' meaning sometimes
dated segments of ``Booknotes,'' the worthy interview series
started 10 years ago on C-Span by its chairman, Brian Lamb, and too
little of its focus is on places beyond Washington.
</P>
<P>
   What Book TV is, as the folks at C-Span 2 are quick to point
out, is an early work in progress, always subject to revision, and
that's a rare and welcome property in a medium top-loaded with
overprocessed episodes of inanity. As would be expected, Book TV _
in keeping with C-Span and C-Span 2, which are financed by the
cable industry as a public service _ is dedicated to being a
witness of public life for the public's good.
</P>
<P>
   And as with C-Span's exhaustive coverage of the processes of
government, Book TV's best and worst moments derive from a
commitment to switching on the camera and letting it run.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most rewarding interludes in recent weeks was an
appearance by David Maraniss, Bill Clinton biographer and
Washington Post writer, at the Politics and Prose Bookstore in
Washington, just after an Election Day on which Clinton's fortunes
had seemed to tip radically for the better. Maraniss, who is
regarded by the White House at least as a severe judge of Clinton,
displayed an almost Clinton-like testiness as he spoke of his being
eventually closed off from interviews with the president.
</P>
<P>
   But then the author, most recently of ``The Clinton Enigma,''
went on to reveal the kind of humble and informed concern that one
hopes for in an influential journalist, and to offer real insight
on America's most recent political morning after.
</P>
<P>
   This interlude was soon followed, unfortunately, by coverage of
the Goodwill Annual Used Book Sale in Washington. Not only were
cameras trained on straining lines of bargain hunters as if they
were part of some compelling news event; interviewers also tried to
have a quick word with this acquisitive bunch. Little was learned
about book hobbyists, books or even the trafficking in vintage
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a few hours later, a visit to the bookstore at the
Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial degenerated into an exercise in
pricing souvenirs, curiously diminishing the weekend's special
attention to the sea of writing about the Roosevelts.
</P>
<P>
   Book TV may be all books, all weekend, but it is decidedly not
about all books, as in every genre. The producers make clear that
they try to highlight only nonfiction _ the regular program
categories are biography, history, children's books and ``the
business of books'' _ and they explain this decision by saying that
it is in keeping with C-Span's calling to concentrate on events
that influence opinion.
</P>
<P>
   While it's easy to understand that having a minimal staff would
force limits _ Book TV has a full-time complement of four people,
led by Connie Brod, the executive producer _ it seems misguided for
an undertaking devoted to the love of serious writing to justify
sidestepping fiction and poetry on the ground that these forms
don't influence national life.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of the former poet laureate Joseph Brodsky is surely
arguing eloquently to the contrary right now, and novelists like
Philip Roth and Tom Wolfe would probably be eager to chime in.
</P>
<P>
   Still, thankfully, literature and its interests do insinuate
themselves into Book TV's categories. A recent business-of-books
segment, for example, documented an industry conference in New York
on the future of children's books, and the speakers _ powerful men
in well-cut suits, charged with the task of making money _ warned
against movie tie-ins and made surprisingly touching pleas for the
integrity of the old-fashioned story.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, William Styple, author of the children's book ``The
Little Bugler: The True Story of a 12-Year-Old in the Civil War,''
who was interviewed in the middle of a re-enactment of the Battle
of Cedar Creek near Winchester, Va., indicated in vivid fashion how
storytelling could serve history.
</P>
<P>
   Even more effective in describing how books are something more
than repositories of information for well-informed citizens was the
writer and editor Anne Fadiman. In an appearance at the Library of
Congress to talk about her book ``Ex Libris: Confessions of a
Common Reader,'' she recalled how her first building blocks were
the 22 volumes of a set of Trollope that belonged to her father,
the writer, editor and television personality Clifton Fadiman.
</P>
<P>
   Those volumes, she added, are now in her library, with her
father's notes in the margins, and her own and her brother's, as
well as numerous fingerprints _ evidence of the essence of a
family.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of intensely private experience is a large part of
what books are all about. And that's what Book TV will be about
more and more if it finds a way to erase the lines it draws between
intellect and imagination, and to better balance the concerns of
public life with those of the public's lives.

 &HT;    Victims' families have mixed reactions to deal with McDuff
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Family members of three women allegedly killed
by Kenneth Allen McDuff expressed mixed reactions Tuesday over news
that McDuff's nephew got a reduced prison sentence after the
notorius killer helped authorities find three bodies earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the American-Statesman cited anonymous sources who
said McDuff (who was executed Tuesday evening) provided precise
directions to the bodies of two women _ Regina Moore and Brenda
Thompson _ near Waco. McDuff then was taken from prison under heavy
guard in October to help find the body of Austinite Colleen Reed,
which was found about 15 miles from McDuff's hometown, Rosebud,
southeast of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a federal judge reduced the 15-year sentence of
McDuff's nephew, Michael Wayne Royals of Waco, to 10 years for a
1992 conviction on charges of delivering
amphetamines/methamphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders familiar with how the bodies were found insist no
explicit deal was struck with McDuff. Yet Roma Thompson, the mother
of the late Brenda Thompson, questioned involving McDuff's nephew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think his nephew should have anything to do with it.
That's like bribery,'' she said. ``He's no better than anyone else
who's convicted of drug-dealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lori Bible, Reed's sister, said she was unaware of how McDuff
was persuaded to help locate the bodies that had been missing for
seven years. She declined comment until she talks to authorities
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Miller Carpenter of Elm Mott, the mother of Regina
Moore, said she ``definitely'' supported law enforcement's
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we found our babies,'' she said. ``It was
comforting.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Moore disappeared from Waco in October 1991 and
Reed was kidnapped from an Austin car wash on Dec. 29 that same
year. A jury convicted McDuff in 1994 of murdering Reed, based
primarily on the testimony of an accomplice, though authorities had
not found her body.
</P>
<P>
   The three women, kidnapped within three months of one another in
1991, suddenly were found within a week in late September and early
October.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, authorities denied rumors that McDuff had been
taken from prison to help locate the bodies. Assistant U.S.
Attorney Bill Johnston, a leading figure in finding the bodies,
said then, ``No one will get a deal on this. This won't lead to a
deal for any accomplice.''
</P>
<P>
   While McDuff's nephew, Royals, is not accused as an accomplice
in his uncle's crimes, Johnston heads the Waco office where both
were prosecuted. He and Judge Smith have declined comment. A person
familiar with the chain of events, however, said a McDuff relative
asked authorities if they would consider helping Royals if the
relative could get McDuff to cooperate on locating the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers paint Royals, 42, as a wholesaler for a network of
up to 26 people selling drugs in Central Texas in the late 1980s
and early 1990s. A confidential informant cited by police claimed
Royals made $500,000 one year selling drugs. He had been convicted
on at least four state charges and paroled from prison before he
was convicted on the federal drug charge and sentenced to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, according to a police affidavit, Royals pointed a
pistol at an officer who stopped him, but fled the scene without
firing the weapon.

COMEDIAN HOPES TO PUT FINANCIAL WORRIES TO REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALENCIA, Calif. _ These days, the thing that's tickling Lee
Bayless's funny bone isn't his stand-up comedy routine; it's his
hammock.
</P>
<P>
   Bayless, a professional comedian who lives in Valencia north of
Los Angeles, is the inventor of the L.A.-Z-Dude, which he bills as
the world's first fully portable hammock.
</P>
<P>
   It all started about 15 years ago, when he bought a rope net
hammock on a trip to Mexico that was rendered useless in the
sterile apartment and condo complexes where Bayless lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had two trees or two poles to tie it up between,'' he
said. ``For five or six years, when I went from apartment to condo
I couldn't use it, there was no place to put it up anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1989 he did what any self-respecting, intellectually
restless comedian would do: He drew up some plans for a framework
that would hold a hammock, bought the material, took the metal bits
and pieces to a welding shop and emerged with the first
L.A.-Z-Dude.
</P>
<P>
   He obtained his first patent on the product in 1991, and has
since received three other patents and patents pending on other
models, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After coming up with the initial model, he spent about five
years _ and $60,000 _ bouncing around from manufacturer to promoter
in hopes of getting the L.A.-Z-Dude to market, without much
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I finally decided to do it all on my own,'' Bayless said.
</P>
<P>
   He approached a number of companies about their using the
L.A.-Z-Dude for promotional purposes. And in February, he entered
into a partnership with Team Manufacturing Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Company President Ed Ellis said Bayless initially approached
Team Manufacturing about simply making the product for him. But
company officials saw some commercial potential for the L.A.-Z-Dude
and offered to go into a 50-50 partnership with Bayless _ something
Team Manufacturing has done with new inventions only a handful of
times in its 23-year history, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing else on the market like that that we could
find,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Bayless has sold about half the 1,000 L.A.-Z-Dudes the
partnership has manufactured. L.A.-Z-Dudes come in three models and
retail between $199 to $239.
</P>
<P>
   ``New products take quite a while to come on board; this one has
come a little faster than we anticipated,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The hot summer is gone and the fall isn't a particularly good
season to sell a product such as the L.A.-Z-Dude.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) we're happy with the sales and we're looking forward to
spring, which should be very good,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership has been getting the hammock into a number of
direct mail catalogs, and this summer the product appeared on QVC,
the cable television shopping channel.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the L.A.-Z-Dude will appear at a show organized by
Nation's Best Sports, a Fort Worth, Texas-based sporting goods
buying group.
</P>
<P>
   Randy George, head of Nation's Best divisional merchandise
section, said the L.A.-Z-Dude was an interesting enough concept to
have merited Bayless an invitation to the show.
</P>
<P>
   Camping divisions are the most apt to take a close look at the
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a novel concept and if the price is right, it could be a
viable product,'' George said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The flat, sprawling warehouses of Nashville are leagues away
from a New York literary lunch and repartee with a prominent
author, but this prosaic side of the nation's $8 billion consumer
book market _ packing, shipping and delivery _ has become a key to
its future.
</P>
<P>
   With the industry roiled by consolidation and the growth of
Internet bookstores, gentle readers are now the focus of a frantic
effort to deliver them the literary equivalent of steaming Big
Macs: fast, cheap and wrapped to go.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement this month that the nation's leading
bookseller, Barnes &AMP; Noble, will buy the leading wholesaler, the
Ingram Book Group, for $600 million is just the latest move in a
shifting field of distribution networks.
</P>
<P>
   There is a basic explanation for the dazzle of distribution.
With sales growth projected at less than 5 percent a year, the
conglomerates that own the big publishing houses are trying to
squeeze as much savings as possible from back-office functions.
Such top booksellers as Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com are looking
for ways to make electronic commerce profitable and competitive by
sending more of their orders through their own distribution
centers.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, this means that delivery will become swifter,
setting a standard of 24-hour service for online bookstores, but
also increasing the speed at which special orders are filled by
stores on terra firma.
</P>
<P>
   While top publishers troll for new alliances to share
distribution, regional distributors are on a spree of buying
smaller independent publishers to spread their costs and to secure
a customer base. Daily there is speculation that Amazon.com, the
e-commerce pioneer, is preparing to buy a wholesaler of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankee Group, a technology research organization,
forecasts that online sales of books will climb to $700 million by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that they will be left by the wayside, restive
independent booksellers fret that a wholesaler owned by Barnes &AMP;
Noble could be manipulated to reduce service to them or to tap into
their records.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be able to find out what our sales are, what the
profit margin is and then find out just how vulnerable these stores
are and then move in,'' said William Petrocelli, the co-owner of
Book Passage, an independent store in Corte Madera, Calif., just
north of San Francisco. He is circulating a letter among
booksellers to challenge the sale with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Borders Group bookstore chain started building up its
distribution network long ago and now owns nine centers, including
four new ones in Nashville. Last week it also announced the hiring
of a new chief executive, Philip Pfeffer, who, when he was chief
executive of Ingram Distribution Group, presided over the expansion
of the company into the largest wholesale distributor of trade
books in the world. The book and distribution groups are both owned
by Ingram Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always viewed distribution as a strategic asset, but
frankly we used to get hammered for it because our competition
didn't pay much attention to it,'' said Robert F. DiRomualdo,
chairman of the Borders Group. ``We've got to become more efficient
as an industry, so I'm not surprised that everyone is moving in
that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble's purchase of Ingram is just the most visible
example of the industry shift. According to several top publishing
executives, Amazon.com had also been talking with Nashville-based
Ingram about a sale and remains interested in a purchase of Baker &AMP;
Taylor, the No. 2 wholesaler, which is based in Charlotte, N.C.,
and has 5 distribution sites to Ingram's 11.
</P>
<P>
   In response to such speculation, Baker &AMP; Taylor president James
Ulsamer said, ``Anyone at the right time at the right price is for
sale.'' But he added, ``There is nothing in the works.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon was just as cryptic. ``We neither confirm nor deny
rumors, speculation or chitchat about what we may be or may not be
doing,'' said Bill Curry, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   One top publishing executive said Amazon had moved to cut its
ties with Ingram, but John Ingram, chairman of Ingram Book Group,
said that to his knowledge no such break had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he sent out more than 5,000 letters to independent
booksellers urging them to trust in the company's history of
integrity and commitment to treat all customers equally. ``We've
never shared information,'' Ingram said. ``I wouldn't have done the
deal without those assurances. Ingram people will continue to run
our business with the same high degree of integrity as we've always
done. Barnes &AMP; Noble would expect nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble chairman and chief executive Leonard Riggio said
his company would ``never, ever'' ask for information from Ingram
about a competitor. ``From my point of view, we're actually rooting
for them and every other good bookstore in America,'' he said,
noting that his company needed the support of other booksellers for
Ingram to grow. ``We don't see this as a Darwinian struggle. So we
see our interests lining up with them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that many booksellers will break with the company
as they approach Christmas, their busiest and most profitable
season. But Ingram's pledge gives little comfort to the American
Booksellers Association, which is deeply distrustful of Barnes &AMP;
Noble and has sued the company in San Francisco, accusing it of
unfair trade practices. ``I'm having a difficult time finding
solace,'' said Avin Mark Domnitz, the chief executive of the trade
group. ``It's like putting the fox in the henhouse and taking his
word that he's not going to eat the chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the almost visceral hostility from independent
booksellers, said Albert Greco, an associate business professor at
Fordham University who follows publishing, Barnes &AMP; Noble's move
was born out of its need to remain competitive in ``the face of
potentially damaging market inroads made by online book operators,
which will transform the selling of books.''
</P>
<P>
   Most publishers and distributors are already proceeding as if
the Barnes &AMP; Noble purchase is a fait accompli, yet antitrust
lawyers and even Wall Street analysts are more cautious about how
federal regulators will regard the deal. They predict that it will
probably take much longer for the purchase to be approved than the
30 to 45 days foreseen by Barnes &AMP; Noble executives.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson PLC's purchase of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education division,
announced in May, remains tied up in a second round of review by
the Justice Department, although the company keeps saying approval
could come any day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the deal was expensive and may be difficult to close
because of regulatory concerns,'' Danielle Turnoff Fox, an analyst
for J.P. Morgan Securities, said of the Ingram acquisition. Ms. Fox
said that unless Barnes &AMP; Noble set up some system of fire walls,
as the new owner of Ingram it would have access to extensive
information about Amazon.com's actual unit sales of books online.
``There are competitive issues that are likely to come under
intense scrutiny,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Cooper, a lawyer who specializes in antitrust cases
at the Washington firm Bryan Cave, said the Federal Trade
Commission would be likely to review the deal because of its
experience analyzing other mergers in the book industry. ``If there
are any real issues when they do their first look, this could take
some time,'' he said, adding that he expected the Ingram purchase
to face a second round of intensive review that could take up to
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, others in the industry are sizing up ways they can use
distribution to overcome sluggish growth. Last year, sales of
consumer, or popular, books grew only 1 percent from 1996, which
means they did not even keep pace with population growth.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Time Warner's trade book division and
HarperCollins, which is owned by News Corp. were in talks about
forming a joint distribution network, but they failed to come to an
agreement, said two top publishing executives who insisted on
anonymity. This month, Random House Inc., now owned by Bertelsmann
AG, announced a multimillion-dollar investment to expand its book
distribution center in Westminster, Md., while also setting a date
to close its warehouse in Des Plaines, Ill., near Chicago. After
opening a $30 million center near Charlottesville, Va., last year,
the German media conglomerate Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck
is still in the process of adding its publishing houses to the
network.
</P>
<P>
   While publishers strive to streamline distribution networks,
regional distributors that serve independent publishers have in
turn started buying up some of those publishing houses, partly to
secure their customer base and to spread the costs of back-office
functions. Two leading distributors, Publishers Group West in
California and the National Book Network in Maryland, are buying
heavily these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at perhaps three or four different deals,'' said
Charles Winton, chief executive of Publishers Group West, which in
the last three years has acquired four publishers through its
parent company, Publishers Group Inc. ``Right now I have eight
different prospectuses sitting on my desk. It's amazing how much
activity there is.'' He said he expected to double revenue from its
publishing companies to nearly $20 million within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of change has been dizzying to publishers, booksellers
and distributors, who talk about these recent shifts and the spate
of mergers and consolidations as a sea change in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process has sped up dramatically,'' said National
Book Network president Jed Lyons. ``In the past, it would take
maybe two or three weeks and the book would arrive. Today consumers
aren't willing to wait two or three weeks. They want it tomorrow.''

   DREPUNG, Tibet _ In a stony courtyard, in the shadows cast by a
jumble of old walnut and cherry trees, a hundred young monks in
blood-red robes squatted in small groups one recent afternoon to
debate the deeper meaning of life.
</P>
<P>
   Some yelled, clapping their hands for emphasis. Others sparred
in softer tones. Some yawned. Some laughed. In ``debating,'' as
this part of a monk's education is called, the point is to probe
thoroughly timeless philosophical issues with ordinary questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a horse runs away from its owner, is it really free?'' one
young monk asked several fellow novices gathered here at Drepung,
Tibet's largest monastery, a sprawling complex that for centuries
has served as a spiritual bank of religious life.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this peaceful setting, which seems to reflect a healthy
tolerance for open religious worship, is a more strained reality.
Over the last four years, Chinese authorities have carried out a
careful campaign to tighten control over Tibetan monasteries, which
Beijing has come to see as nests of opposition to Chinese rule over
this starkly devout Himalayan region.
</P>
<P>
   The number of monks allowed to enter monasteries has been
sharply cut back, and entrance to one of these centers of Buddhist
learning is now strictly vetted. All monks are required to swear
patriotic allegiance to China, even though many see Beijing as an
occupying foreign power.
</P>
<P>
   Monks have also been required to declare formal opposition to
the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader whom Tibetans revere as a god and
a king and Chinese authorities consider a bitter enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of monks deemed ``unreliable'' by the authorities for
resisting the clampdown have been expelled from monasteries,
according to the Tibet Information Network, a nonprofit
organization based in London. Several dozen have even been jailed
for voicing sensitive political opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Though abbots still nominally lead the monasteries, Chinese
officials confirm that authority has shifted to administrative
committees that, while theoretically elected by monks, answer
directly to Communist Party authorities. Monasteries remain
self-financed, relying heavily on donations and not on government
money, except in isolated cases of rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chinese authorities have ordered that all monks
under 18 leave the monasteries and return to normal schools and
that no more underage monks be accepted. Chinese officials say that
although the rule has not yet been uniformly enforced, more than
500 young monks have already been forced to leave.
</P>
<P>
   At Drepung, a majestic collection of white-and-maroon buildings
just outside Lhasa, Tibet's capital, religious worship is a shadow
of its former greatness. Drepung once claimed to be the world's
largest monastery with 10,000 monks, but today there are only 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to sit through a lot of patriotic education,''
complained a young monk with a shaved head and bushy eyebrows.
``You just mumble the words and nod.''
</P>
<P>
   A second monk, with sleepy eyes, added: ``Everything is
controlled by the administrative committee. These people do not
understand our religion. They think we are dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities say Communist Party leaders decided at a
conference on Tibet in Beijing in 1994 to limit the total number of
monks and nuns in Tibet. It was later determined that a total of
46,000 monks and nuns would be permitted to study at the 1,700
temples scattered throughout the Tibetan Administrative Region,
which does not include Tibetan areas in other Chinese provinces,
where religious practice is more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is enough to satisfy the current need,'' said Ma
Yingchou, deputy director of minority and religious affairs in
Tibet. ``We are strictly controlling the number of entrants as
monks and nuns.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing's view, few monks would naturally oppose Chinese rule
and monasteries are centers of dissent because they have contact
with anti-China forces overseas, namely in India, where the Dalai
Lama's government-in-exile is based, and in the United States,
where many other Tibetan activists live and work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, some of the thinking at some monasteries was
a bit chaotic,'' Ma said, referring to political opinions that
China regards as nonpatriotic. ``Monasteries must maintain a
correct quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Justifying China's tough campaign in monasteries, Ma argued that
efforts to repopulate monasteries after the vast destruction of
temples by leftist fanatics in the 1960s and 70s had made them too
lax in the 1980s. Demonstrations that erupted here in 1987, 1988
and 1989, Ma asserted, happened largely because the authorities
were too soft.
</P>
<P>
   The tough stance adopted in 1994 has achieved its purpose, other
officials say. In a recent report to Communist Party authorities,
Deputy Secretary Raidi reported that an ``indoctrination and
rectification campaign'' had been successfully completed in Tibet's
temples and monasteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has solved, in a direct way, glaring problems in the area
of Tibet's spiritual culture, building a stronger socialist
spiritual civilization and strengthening leadership at all
levels,'' said Raidi, who like many Tibetans uses one name. ``Once
these decisions were made and put into effect, no matter what
resistance or what degree of interference they encountered, the
regional party committee united as one to carry them out firmly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tibet Information Network reported that increased control
and surveillance of monasteries has led to an upgrading of security
work by these administrators, beyond their original duties as
informants. Plainclothes officers, some dressed as monks, now
patrol larger monasteries.
</P>
<P>
   To monks at Drepung, forbidding anyone under 18 to enter a
monastery is particularly distressing because it cramps the study
of Tibetan Buddhism's complex battery of ancient texts into what
they consider an almost impossible time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes years to master the basic texts,'' said the monk with
bushy eyebrows. ``If you don't start until you are already an
adult, it makes it very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials counter that too many monks are deprived of a
basic education, and that many young monks who have entered a
monastery as young as 8 do not do so voluntarily, but are instead
generally following their parents' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should have a basic education,'' said Xu Zhenchang,
the Chinese principal of Lhasa Middle School, where both Chinese
and Tibetan are languages of instruction. ``Even those students who
choose to become a monk at 18 can make a better choice once they
have learned a broader range of subjects. I think they will make
better monks.''
</P>
<P>
   The new restrictions apply to nuns as well.
</P>
<P>
   At Anitsangkung, a convent on a back street in Lhasa, several
nuns objected to the way that Chinese authorities now decide who
can be allowed to join the convent, where 103 nuns make their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work teams'' of Chinese officials arrive every two months, one
nun said, to review the progress of the rectification campaign and
to make sure that no one is taking part in any activities that
might be deemed ``unpatriotic.'' Only one nun was expelled last
year, she said, but nearly 20 were forced to leave in the three
preceding years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very careful what we say,'' the nun said, her
shaved head and simple red robe making her look younger than her
age, 36.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the sunny courtyard in front of her convent's small
temple, a chorus of melodic morning vows in the background, another
nun lamented the tightening of control over Tibetan worship by the
Chinese authorities. ``They make the rules,'' she said, ``We live
within them.''

NOVELL AND CISCO SET COMPATIBILITY ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Novell Corp. and Cisco Corp., two major players in
the computer networking industry, will announce Wednesday that they
have agreed to make their software and hardware broadly compatible.
</P>
<P>
   The move is seen as a victory for Novell in its effort to halt
the advances of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT, an operating system
that incorporates office networking technologies, a market that
Novell once dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Directory programs that permit computers and computer users to
track the location of network resources have become increasingly
crucial as business networks have grown to include tens of
thousands of computers, printers, servers and disk storage systems.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, the largest player in the market for network routers and
switches, has previously agreed to support Microsoft's Active
Directory service for office networks.
</P>
<P>
   However, both Microsoft's Windows NT and its Active Directory
software projects have suffered lengthy delays and will not be
available until sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Novell has refined its Netware Directory Services, or NDS,
software and has struck compatibility agreements with both Lucent
Technologies and Nortel, two other makers of computer networking
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisco's customers pushed very hard for a directory deal with
Novell,'' said Novell chairman and chief executive Eric Schmidt.
``This permits both management and remote configuration of Cisco
routers and switches from our software.''

FULL BARGAINING SESSION CALLED FOR FRIDAY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a week and a half of stalled talks, the
National Basketball Association's labor dispute took a turn for the
better Tuesday when internal negotiating teams for both sides met
and agreed to schedule a full bargaining session with owners and
players on Friday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour meeting at a midtown hotel was described as
amicable by the league and represented the first contact in 10 days
between the two parties. With the opportunity to begin the season
before January fading fast, it also pointed to renewed concern for
the players and the owners to negotiate rather than postulate.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern, the deputy commissioner, Russ Granik,
and Steve Mills, the league's senior vice president for basketball
development, met Tuesday with the union's representatives: the
executive director, Billy Hunter; the president, Patrick Ewing, and
the vice president, Herb Williams. The league said no progress was
made, but the fact that the NBA's nine-member labor relations
committee and the union's negotiating committee of more than 20
players will be in the same room on Friday for the first time in
more than three weeks speaks volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't start making progress soon, the season is in
jeopardy,'' said Granik, who added that negotiating around the
holiday season would be difficult. ``We'll give it one more try on
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks of the season have been lost to the dispute as the
games of Dec. 8-14 were canceled last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been making compromises all summer long, and they
haven't made any,'' Ewing said before Tuesday's meeting. ``They
still haven't made any. Now it's up to them.''

ENERGY DEPT. SEES SUSTAINED LOW OIL PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Asia's economic troubles will depress oil and gasoline
prices for nearly a decade, saving drivers roughly 13 cents a
gallon in 2000 alone, the U.S. Energy Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the Asian crisis has already helped cut energy costs,
Tuesday's report offers the strongest evidence that the effects
will be deep and long-lasting. In the United States, continued low
energy prices are likely to restrain inflation, reducing the usual
friction between strong growth and stable prices, economists say.
Weak Asian demand and heavy global production also reduce the
nation's vulnerability to oil-import disruption.
</P>
<P>
   But with crude oil at $12 to $15 a barrel, there are few
economic incentives for saving energy or using renewable sources to
reduce the carbon emissions often blamed for global warming.
Falling production costs and the opening of new regions have added
to supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the Energy Department and the oil companies doubt
that crude oil prices will necessarily remain at their current
level below $13 a barrel. But the department, relying on economic
forecasts by DRI/McGraw Hill, sees Asia recovering so slowly that
the average price in 2000, adjusted for inflation, will still be
below $14 a barrel. That compares with $20.61 predicted by the
department last year before the scale of Asian troubles became
evident.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Information Administration does not see oil prices
returning to where they would have been, excluding Asia's woes,
until about 2007.

 &HT;    Fort Hood general warns troops to stay off Texas 195
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Until state highway officials make significant
safety upgrades to Texas 195, a Fort Hood general said Tuesday he
does not want his troops traveling the road that has claimed the
lives of nine soldiers this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 15 civilians have died this year while driving
along the 31 miles of highway stretching from Interstate 35 north
of Georgetown to the Army installation in Killeen. The most recent
crash victims were Fort Hood Sgt. Alexander Graham, 31, and Pfc.
Andre Cohen, 21, who died in separate cars in a head-on collision
Saturday just south of Killeen.
</P>
<P>
   Texas 195 is the shortest route from Killeen to Austin, a
popular weekend destination for soldiers. All the fatal crashes
involving soldiers happened on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas Department of Transportation officials wrestle with
the task of lessening the danger along the winding two-lane route
through the Central Texas hills, Lt. General Leon LaPorte wants his
42,000-plus soldiers to find another path to Austin _ preferably
U.S. 190 to Interstate 35 in Belton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting on a full-court press at Fort Hood to prevent
further fatalities,'' LaPorte said. ``I'm asking them to take that
extra six or 10 minutes and use U.S. 190 and I-35.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the number of fatal accidents on Texas 195 has been
on the rise, according to DPS statistics. That year saw four car
crashes resulting in at least one death each. Then, in 1996 and
again in 1997, seven Texas 195 wrecks caused fatalities, according
to DPS. Last year 59 traffic accidents on the highway resulted in
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In response to LaPorte's concerns, state transportation
officials have agreed to try to speed up a $30 million construction
project that will convert 12 miles of Texas 195 to a four-lane
divided highway from Killeen to the Bell/Williamson county line a
few miles north of Florence, said Jim Cowan, state engineer for
Bell County. The agency originally planned to begin seeking
construction bids for the project in April, but may move that date
to February, Cowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a bid is awarded, the project could take 2 1/2 to three
years to complete, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has hired an engineering consultant to come up with a
plan to expand the divided highway through Williamson County in the
near future, Cowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fatal accidents in 1998 have involved drivers
speeding, falling asleep at the wheel, failing to wear seat belts
or driving while intoxicated, LaPorte said.
</P>
<P>
   To try to keep the death toll from climbing any further, LaPorte
and Col. Dudley Thomas, director of DPS, have arranged for military
police to ride along with state troopers patrolling the highway.
Although the military police have no jurisdiction outside Fort
Hood, they may be able to help the troopers deal with soldiers
during traffic stops, LaPorte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to expedite our efforts to make that a safe
highway,'' LaPorte said. ``People are just driving too fast and
losing control of their vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the highway expansion is complete, LaPorte is asking the
department of transportation to consider lowering the 70 mph speed
limit and posting caution signs at particularly dangerous points
along the route.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Marble Falls, also is putting pressure
on the highway department to make Texas 195 a priority, according
to William Scott, Fraser's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has asked the (DPS) to work with TxDOT in identifying the
more dangerous portions of the road. . .and then to go back and see
what they can do, whether it's increased traffic enforcement or
maybe even lowering the speed limit,'' Scott said.

KUWAITIS PUZZLED BY LACK OF U.S. ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT CITY _ There is much affection in this rich little
kingdom for the United States, still seen widely as liberator and
protector after the events that began _ many Kuwaitis feel the need
to cite the exact date _ on Aug. 2, 1990. That was the day when
Iraq invaded Kuwait and then sacked it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another peaceful end over the weekend to a showdown between
Iraq and the United States and Britain did little to dispel a
conspiracy theory held by many people here and in other Arab
countries, that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq gives the West,
and especially the United States, an excuse to keep a military
presence in the Persian Gulf to protect oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment was summed up by Eassa al-Farhan, 32, and his
wife, who were buzzing through a parking lot in one of the many
fancy shopping malls here Tuesday in a shiny new sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only talk, they don't do it,'' said Mrs. Farhan, 28, who
insisted that her first name not be used. ``I think they need
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had the bombs,'' Farhan said, ``we'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they are astonished at that logic. But
Ahmad Bishara, leader of the National Democratic Movement, a
political group here that supports a more open government and
opposes Islamic fundamentalism, said it was not so crazy for people
to feel that way in a tiny nation that could not feel safe as long
as Saddam is in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Saddam makes a problem the rational thinking here
is this is the time to hit him,'' Bishara said. ``And at the last
moment America backs out. This feeds into the theory that Americans
don't really want him out. I don't subscribe to it. But that's the
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, Kuwaitis are ``very frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the calmest one you are going to talk to,''
Bishara added.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews around the capital Tuesday showed near unanimity in
favor of using military force against Saddam, the sooner the
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should start bombing _ now,'' said Mohamed Dashty, 28,
chief of security for a new mall along the Persian Gulf waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Kuwaitis, as well as many officials in Washington and
London, Dashty had no doubt that Saddam would once again run afoul
of the United Nations weapons inspectors, who returned to Iraq on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe six months, or three months, he'll do the same,'' Dashty
said.
</P>
<P>
   For many residents Saddam's grasp on power remains one of the
last obstacles to returning to the days before 1990 and 1991, when
Iraq occupied the nation for seven months. Kuwait has spent tens of
billions of dollars to rebuild roads, government buildings and oil
refineries. Today there are few signs of war in this clean and
gleaming capital.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait is so rich that there are more foreigners here who cater
to Kuwaitis than Kuwaitis themselves. But the wealth is not enough
to guarantee safety or close wounds. A sign on a downtown building
reminds passers-by of the 620 people who Kuwaitis believe are still
held in Iraq. The sign says, ``We will not forget our POW's.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the government of Kuwait strongly supports President
Clinton's decision to back off and reverse an order to fire
missiles into Baghdad. Saddam crumbled in the face of a real threat
from America and Britain, said Sulaiman Majed al-Shaheen, under
secretary of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clear humiliation to the Iraqis,'' Shaheen said.
``And I hope that the Iraqis have absorbed this lesson well.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen said, however, he did not believe that Saddam would
behave for long. ``His history is a chain of miscalculation,'' he
said. ``I'm sure that he will repeat it again and again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shaheen declined to predict whether Clinton would bomb if Saddam
broke his promise on the inspectors again. But there seems to be a
widespread belief among Kuwaitis that the American threats are
empty. In fact, the confrontations appear to have worked their way
into the national routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, it's not the last time,'' said Tarek Ismail, 38, a
merchant walking near the central market. ``Next time it will be
another thing. They go to the United Nations, and in six months
they make this play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Iraq, America is afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   In the market, Ali al-Ali, 22, said the best that he expected
was limited bombing, but not the overwhelming force that it might
take to destroy Saddam or his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein is like a lion who is injured,'' Ali said.
``They can't control him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on stools chatting in a gulf breeze Salman al-Shatti,
39, and Samir al-Eisa, 38, said they had enormous respect for the
United States. ``They made us free,'' Eisa said.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing Clinton, Eisa added: ``I don't think he's going to
bomb Iraq. He's chicken. He's always chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Shatti considered that and did not find it unreasonable. But he
was one of very few who said the latest round between Clinton and
Saddam seemed somehow different. ``They gave him an opportunity to
stop,'' Shatti said, ``and next time they're going to bomb. No more
playing games. No more.''

SMILE! YOU'RE BACK ON `CANDID CAMERA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)  
 (bl)  
 By ANDY MEISLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ On a rainy Saturday morning, in a rented
storefront a few yards from Cannery Row, a crew from the CBS series
``Candid Camera'' prepares for a long day. The ``gag'' they're
attempting is deceptively simple: unwitting citizens who drop off
film at a one-hour photo-developing shop will return to find that
establishment inexplicably transformed into a dry cleaner. The
shop's mock proprietor _ in both cases, Peter Funt, the show's
executive producer and co-host (with sitcom-actress Suzanne Somers)
_ will profess benign noncomprehension of his customers' quandary.
Said customers' reactions will be secretly recorded by a hidden
camera and microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Since the segment is to be spontaneous and unscripted, almost
nothing has been left to chance. The stunt has been discussed and
planned for weeks, possible locations scouted, camera angles and
lighting fine-tuned, camera moves repeatedly rehearsed. To insure
and control the flow of subjects, the production company has set up
a make-believe suite of offices, hired four temporary workers _ two
for the morning and two for the afternoon _ assigned them busywork
and carefully scheduled their photo-shop ``errand.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backup, a real photo-developing shop nearby has been paid
to feign equipment failure and direct its customers to the ``Candid
Camera'' trap.
</P>
<P>
   It takes hours of hard work to erect a reversible set and dress
the Fast Photo outlet to Funt's specifications. At midmorning comes
discouraging news: only one of the morning temps has shown up for
work, the temporary agency is closed for the weekend and rain has
reduced foot traffic in the real photo shop to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Funt sighs and orders the remaining temp dispatched. In a back
room the camera and sound recorder are manned and the rest of the
crew crouches silently. A few minutes later a serene-looking young
woman named Andrea Montes arrives. She is taped dropping off a roll
of film for her employer, being instructed to return in one hour
and departing.
</P>
<P>
   The instant she is out of sight the crew springs from its hiding
place and, with tense efficiency, turns Fast Photo into Mitchell's
Cleaners. This takes about 30 minutes. Funt changes into different
clothing and stands nonchalantly behind the counter. Forty-five
minutes later, Ms. Montes returns, passes back and forth several
times in front of the store, then disappears up the street. Funt
and his associates maintain their positions. And strict silence.
Five minutes later Ms. Montes returns, enters and _ eyes flickering
slightly with confusion _ approaches the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have cleaning?'' asks Funt.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Ms. Montes, mildly nonplused.
</P>
<P>
   For several minutes Funt maintains the charade, evoking several
more brief expressions of puzzlement. Finally, Funt breaks
character and informs Ms. Montes that she has been caught by
``Candid Camera.'' Ms. Montes smiles shyly, signs a release form
proffered by a waiting staff member and is on her way. This
incident, for an episode scheduled to be shown Dec. 4, will yield
roughly 30 seconds of footage.
</P>
<P>
   To an invited guest, watching the action via a small backstage
monitor, this seems a particularly grueling and stomach-churning
way to create television comedy: more masochism then voyeurism,
merry pranksterism laced with strict discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why ``Candid Camera'' _ at least a collateral
precursor of such varied fin de siecle phenomena as ``America's
Funniest Home Videos,'' ATM surveillance cameras, nannycams, FBI
sting operations, ``The Truman Show'' and Linda Tripp _ remains an
absolutely noncontroversial, even beloved institution.
</P>
<P>
   And undoubtedly this is why CBS, struggling with the other
broadcast networks to attract a larger share of a shrinking
audience, has chosen to return to its roots and revive this
51-year-old franchise. Although rerun-drenched baby boomers might
assume that the show had never left the air, ``Candid Camera'' had
a 30-year hiatus, at least as a regular network series.
Reintroduced as a half-hour series in February 1997, it promptly
rewarded its CBS benefactors by turning in more than decent
ratings, at considerably lower cost than a star-driven sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year to date, it's done around a 7.8 rating and a 15
share, and in this day and age, a 15 share means survival,'' says
Bill Croasdale, executive vice president of Western International
Media, a Los Angeles media management company. Croasdale adds that
the show's audience ``skews toward the older demographic'' but that
at 8:30 p.m. Friday, against ABC's teen-ager-oriented lineup, it
does as well as or even better than could be expected.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Botwick, CBS's senior vice president for specials and
current programming, says: ``It may feel a little retro, but that's
OK. It's actually an American cultural icon. It says a lot about
the strength of the show that it's remained at that level of
stature even after long spells off the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And everybody,'' adds Botwick, ``knows the theme song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At times,'' says Peter Funt, over lunch near his phony
photo-cleaners shop, ``I'm worried about the proliferation of
hidden cameras for other purposes. Just because I'm the guy who
eavesdrops on people with a camera for a living doesn't mean that
I'm comfortable with the fact that the government might eavesdrop
on me _ or that a fast-food store is photographing me or that an
ATM is taking my picture or that that guy from a TV news magazine
is watching me as I'm getting my tires rotated or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Funt leans forward, his voice rising for emphasis: ``I think
that hidden cameras are very, very potent and as such a potentially
dangerous tool. They have got to be in the right hands, and they
have to be used responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Funt, the 51-year-old son of Allen Funt, ``Candid
Camera's'' creator, the responsible use of hidden cameras _ a credo
he says his show adheres to strictly _ entails a basic respect,
even admiration, for the persons being secretly taped. ``I think
the public is aware of the fact that we are on guard _ that they
don't have to worry about being embarrassed uncomfortably. They
don't have to worry about us invading people's privacy. It was very
clear in my dad's work that he cared about people. And I feel the
same way. I believe people are wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Funt adds, wonderful ``Candid Camera'' segments walk
a fine line between humiliation and good-natured provocation, one
that he maintains is never intentionally crossed.
</P>
<P>
   This year's segments have included a dentist's office where
patients in the waiting room are subjected to loud banging,
groaning and cries of pain from the next room; a Halloween pumpkin
patch with a free ``all you can carry'' offer; a toll booth
installed on a New Hampshire hiking path; a bank teller selling
counterfeit money at an attractive discount, and a movie theater
manager who instructs arriving cineastes to line up in alphabetical
order. All would have fit perfectly in many of the show's previous
incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Funt, who started ``Candid Microphone'' on radio in 1947,
brought the concept to ABC's television division the following
year. ``Candid Camera'' was broadcast on various networks and in
various time slots until 1960, when it entered what must be
considered its golden age.
</P>
<P>
   Produced in New York, it became part of CBS's powerhouse Sunday
night lineup, which included ``Lassie,'' ``The Ed Sullivan Show''
and ``What's My Line.'' The show was frequently in the Nielsen top
10; in 1962 it finished second, with a staggering 31.1 rating, to
``The Beverly Hillbillies.''
</P>
<P>
   During most of the 1960s, Allen Funt was a national symbol of
ingenious merriment; Peter, who first appeared on the show as a
shoeshine boy at age 3, spent his summer vacations helping out on
the set and appearing in gags, most notably as a spray-painted
Roman statue who jabbed museumgoers with his spear when their backs
were turned. The show was swept off the CBS schedule in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 Peter Funt joined his father (``He was getting older and
it was a little bit tough for him,'' he says) to be co-host of the
show's 40th-anniversary special, and from then on worked full time
in the family business, now based in Pebble Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Allen Funt suffered a disabling stroke that forced him
into retirement. (He is now 84.)
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, says Peter Funt, he discovered that his
overseas distributor had been withholding royalties and letting the
show's archival material disintegrate. A long legal battle ensued,
during which time network programmers, with memories of a failed
syndicated version in the '70s still fresh, were not interested in
``Candid Camera.'' Funt says, ``That was a very bad period.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, however, CBS relented and ordered a 50th-anniversary
special, which won surprisingly high ratings when shown opposite
``Friends'' on NBC. Several more specials followed, then a network
pickup. As a full-fledged series _ nestled against ``Kids Say the
Darndest Things,'' another golden age throwback _ it has already
been renewed through the rest of the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Funt sees no reason to tinker with the show's
age-old formula, especially the meticulous attention to detail and
_ truly astounding in these days of mace, lawsuits and
million-dollar-per-episode performers _ the practice of ambushing
ordinary citizens, letting them make mild fools of themselves, then
paying them $30 to appear on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one, says Funt, refuses to sign his waiver. ``Well,
people are basically good-natured about it,'' he explains. ``I
guess they just say, `Gosh darn it, they got me!' and trust that we
won't portray them in a mean or spiteful way.''
</P>
<P>
   And even as people grow more technologically sophisticated, he
adds, they remain just as susceptible as their parents and
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except, perhaps,'' says Funt, ``it's easier for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that's a direct contradiction, because in
simpler times perhaps people were simpler,'' he adds. ``Not so. The
more complicated the times, the easier it is to fool someone.
People today are liable to have 110 things on their mind. They're
talking on a cell phone. They're listening for their pager. They're
picking up their child at soccer practice. They're so overloaded
that when we step in with our little joke, they're easier to fool
than ever before.''

 Finding Information On Starting A Business  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Could you recommend a book or software program that
outlines a step-by-step approach to starting a business, including
all the necessary forms that need to be completed and filed with
state and local authorities?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  The California secretary of state's office has a
wealth of information ( &LR; www.ss.ca.gov &LR; ) under its business programs
heading, including information on required filings. The San
Francisco Mayor's Office of Economic Development also has published
Getting a Business Started: A guide to doing business in San
Francisco. The booklet explains local, state and federal
requirements that apply to businesses. You can get a copy of the
booklet by calling (415) 554-6969.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce also has startup kits for
a variety of different businesses tailored from materials provided
by the state Chamber of Commerce. The kits include state and local
forms. Call (415) 392-4520 &UR; .  &LR; Other chambers of commerce often can
provide similar information for other Bay Area communities.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco business consultant Ian Blei recommends relying
more on printed information than any advice you receive on the
phone since the person answering your call may or may not have all
the right answers. He also likes Berkeley's Nolo Press
(www.nolo.com) as a source of self-help information and legal
forms. But it's best to also check with your city, county and state
for local requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Organizational Options
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages (including cost
and tax liability) of incorporation for a three-person
architectural firm in San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: There are basically three choices of organization for a
three-person architectural firm based in California: a professional
corporation, a partnership or a limited liability partnership
(LLP).
</P>
<P>
   None of the options is a panacea, according to Napa and San
Francisco tax attorney John Carr. Picking the structure involves
trying to limit both legal and tax liabilities, which isn't so
easy.
</P>
<P>
   For a professional corporation, the personal assets of the
owners are not in jeopardy in the case of a lawsuit. That's the
good news. But profits are taxed twice. Profits are taxed first at
the corporate level (35 percent at the federal level and 9.3
percent by the state). And what's left over and distributed to
owners is subject to taxation at the individual's personal rate.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of a general partnership are simple: No state
filings are necessary and profits are taxed only once. But there's
a major drawback: The partners' personal assets are not protected
in case of a lawsuit against the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Many business owners favor a limited liability corporation
because it shields personal assets of partners from lawsuits
against their company and in most cases is taxed like a
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   But architects, like doctors, accountants and lawyers, can't opt
for a limited liability corporation structure in California because
they are governed by the state's Business and Professions Code.
</P>
<P>
   But these professionals can form a limited liability
partnership, and that is often the best choice because income is
only taxed once (at individual tax rates). LLP partners cannot
shield the partnership or their personal assets from liability
suits against their companies, but they can shield their personal
assets against lawsuits brought against their fellow partners.
</P>
<P>
   Legal costs to set up a partnership are probably a bit more than
a corporation, but a small architecture firm should be able to do
it for about $3,500 to 5,000. Other expenses should be less: Filing
fees for a limited liability partnership are just $70 compared with
$915 to establish California corporation. Corporations also must
pay an annual franchise fee of about $800.
</P>
<P>
   Business Benchmarks
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before I go into business, how do I check out financial
models and what are the norms for specific industries?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: That's a good question. Getting into business without
knowing how to read the financial gauges is like trying to fly a
plane without being able to read the instruments.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of important financial ratios such as
debt-to-assets and inventory turnover (net sales divided by average
inventory) that vary industry by industry.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco marketing consultant Roberta Guise suggests
several guides:
</P>
<P>
   _ Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios
calculates 14 ratios in an industry-average format for 800 types of
businesses. The ratios are presented by Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) number and are grouped by annual sales into
three size categories.
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Morris Associate's Annual Statement Studies includes 16
industry-average ratios presented in four sales size categories.
</P>
<P>
   _ Troy Leo's Almanac of Business and Industrial Financial Ratios
provides 22 financial ratios and percentages broken out by 12 size
categories for all major industries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The main San Francisco library has these directories. You
might seek more personal help from the Service Corps of Retired
Executives, which is staffed with experienced volunteers in several
Bay Area cities.

 Comdex Focuses on Y2K Kink  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Las Vegas &QL; 
 &QL; 
When Richard Kabzinski's Australian startup couldn't get financing
to produce a new computer data protection program, it started
fishing around for new ways to make some quick cash.
</P>
<P>
   So Kabzinski hurriedly developed a device &UR;  &LR; to cash in on the
biggest anxiety facing computer owners _ the Year 2000 Problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how Y2K Corp. was born,'' said Kabzinski, who came here
to Comdex to search for customers, investors and partners.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K Corp. was one of a dozen companies in a special Year 2000
Pavilion, a first for the computer trade extravaganza. Sponsored by
Seattle software-maker WRQ Inc. and the U.S. General Services
Administration, the pavilion showcases existing Y2K solutions and
new ones that will be flooding retail shelves and computer catalogs
in the 408 days before January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The approach of that date, when computer programs designed to
recognize only the last two digits of a year may or may not go
haywire, has created an opportunity for dozens of entrepreneurs
like Kabzinski.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pavilion, unknown little companies like Y2K Corp.
hawked their wares alongside big, well-known ones like Symantec
Corp., the Cupertino software maker best known for its antivirus
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Y2K fixes is expected to be hectic throughout
1999, particularly as consumers and small-business owners realize
they may have problems.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. retail market alone could be worth between $50 million
to $100 million, said Enrique Salem, chief technical officer with
Symantec.
</P>
<P>
   At Comdex, Symantec showed off Norton 2000, a consumer-oriented
version of a corporate Y2K product it released in late summer.
Norton 2000 is just hitting the retail store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   And Astral Systems Inc. of Fremont debuted its Astral PC2K, a
desktop Y2K program that is supposed to reach shelves at stores
like Office Max in late December.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Those two companies were trying to be heard above the din from
representatives pitching products and services such as Check 2000,
the Millennium Bug Compliance Kit, Y2K PC Pro, Centurion 2000, MFX
2000 and Express 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these Y2K solutions can scan an individual desktop or a
larger network system to find programs and data that could
potentially fail once 2000 rolls around. Some list the programs
that could be affected so that the PC user or network administrator
can go in and decide what need to be fixed. Other programs
advertise they can fix problems automatically.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Jim Wiggins, an account executive at Intelliquis of Utah, said
Comdex has already proven profitable for his software company,
which made a deal to sell 20,000 copies of its Fix 2000 software.
Like Norton 2000 and Astral PC2K, Fix 2000 retails at about $50,
but some of the other products aimed at corporate customers cost as
much as $2,000 per computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K Pavilion drew a small but constant stream of visitors,
who listened to salespeople explain how their products were better
than the others. Greenwich Mean Time-UTA of Great Britain had a
woman dressed as a green Millennium bug to call attention to its
Check 2000 PC software.
</P>
<P>
   Yet experts say there is no such thing as a one-product ``silver
bullet'' that consumers and small business owners can buy off the
shelf to fix everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the products do the same thing,'' said Axel Kling, a
Y2K consultant with ChaseIT Technology, a Swedish consulting
company. Kling and Marten Framback, a product manager with Chase,
came to the pavilion to check out new products and options.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice for anyone looking into a Y2K solution, whether
it is an IT manager or home desktop user, is to research what their
system may need, Framback said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no silver bullet, only a lot of hard work,'' Framback
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Kwapinski, program manager for the GSA's Year 2000
division, said his agency co-sponsored the pavilion not to promote
individual products, but to raise general awareness about solutions
to the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   The government will launch a telephone hotline in January to
help consumers sort through the products and get answers to Y2K
problems, Kwapinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Other resources include the Small Business Administration's Web
site, at  &LR; www.sba.gov &LR; , and the Federal Y2K Commercial
Off-the-Shelf Products Database, at  &LR; y2k.policyworks.gov &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal of uncertainty and a great deal of
concern,'' Kwapinski said. ``We know in general larger businesses
are going to do best (at fixing Y2K problems), but as we go down in
size, they are going to do less well,'' Kwapinski said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Gartner Group research firm found that 23
percent of all U.S. companies haven't even started preparations to
prevent the Y2K problem from affecting their computers.
</P>
<P>
   About 83 percent of those businesses are smaller companies with
fewer than 2,000 employees. And half of the smaller companies can
expect at least one critical Y2K problem between the fourth quarter
of 1999 and 2003, the Gartner Group said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kwapinski said research and preparation are the answer to
the Y2K problem, not running out to the store because of the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are doomsayers out there, people in this world who are
titillated by prophesies of gloom and doom,'' he said. ``It is an
emotional issue for a lot of people. (But) peoples' pacemakers are
not going to stop, elevators are not going to drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kabzinski is counting on the hype to help sell the
Y2K++, a $149 piece of hardware that looks like a plug for a

   FED REDUCES INTEREST RATES BY QUARTER OF A POINT AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again by a quarter of a
percentage point to help keep a gradual economic slowdown from
turning into a recession, but it signaled it might hold off on
further reductions in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The cut was the third by the central bank in seven weeks, and
like the previous two it was driven by the concern that the global
financial crisis was making it hard for companies to raise money,
threatening the long expansion in the United States. In related
economic news, prices consumers paid for goods and services rose a
modest two-tenths of a percent in October, indicating that
inflation is tame. And sustained consumer spending suggests that
the danger of a recession has receded.

   MAJOR LEGAL SETBACK FOR MICROSOFT
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, whose business practices are being challenged by the
government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal setback on
another front when a federal judge in California ordered the
company to stop shipping Internet software that violates its
contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   As the government's antitrust trial against Microsoft continued,
a senior IBM executive accused Microsoft of imposing contract
restrictions on other computer companies that prevented OS/2, IBM's
personal-computer operating system, from effectively competing with
Microsoft Windows. Though the suit does not include complaints
about Microsoft's monopoly hold over personal-computer operating
systems, its competitive business practices are central to the
case.

 Paul Allen Invests $54 Million in ZDTV  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen wants his ZDTV.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening his new-media portfolio, the 45-year-old billionaire
yesterday plunked down $54 million to buy one-third of the 24-hour
high-tech cable channel, which is based in San Francisco's
Multimedia Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   The investment by Allen, who already owns what will soon be the
nation's seventh-largest cable operator, could help ZDTV
dramatically increase its viewership.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have one of the computer industry's great technology
visionaries make such a significant investment is a tremendous vote
of confidence for us,'' ZDTV CEO Larry Wangberg said in a phone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan Ventures, the Bellevue, Wash., investment company founded
by Allen, now owns part or all of 50 technology and entertainment
companies, including the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the NBA's
Portland Trailblazers.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Vulcan Ventures spent $4.5 billion to acquire St.
Louis' Charter Communications, the nation's 10th-largest cable
company. In April, he purchased Marcus Cable, a Dallas cable
company, for $2.8 billion. Allen plans to merge the two companies,
which have 2.4 million subscribers combined.
</P>
<P>
   Since its launch in May, ZDTV has been struggling to persuade
more cable operators to put it on the air. So far, it reaches only
9 million homes and its biggest markets are in Nashville, New
England and Louisville. The service is available in the Bay Area
via DirecTV satellite dishes (Channel 273).
</P>
<P>
   ``ZDTV has definitely been an also-ran for content on cable
systems,'' said broadcast analyst Gary Arlen, president of Arlen
Communications in Bethesda, Md. ``Allen's investment creates an
opportunity for them, because he can add ZDTV's unique content to
his cable operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlen, nonetheless, said ZDTV will still face tough competition
for space on cable systems from popular networks such as ESPN, CNN,
Discovery Channel and others.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the $54 million investment should let folks at
ZDTV breathe easier. The division's parent company, Ziff-Davis, has
reported weak quarterly numbers, prompting a 10-percent companywide
layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the poor results, executives have privately said they
plan to give ZDTV ``at least four years'' to establish an audience,
sources said.

 Franchises offer time-tested way to be your own boss  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Buying a franchise is a popular way to enter the entrepreneurial
world without starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 2,500 franchisors with close to half a
million operating units in North America with opportunities ranging
from maid service to muffler repair, pretzels to pet products, and
travel to termite control. For a fee of $5,000 to $5 million, plus
a slice of the sales, you might operate anything from a tax-return
franchise to a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, purchasing a franchise is a ``time-tested,
paint-by-the-numbers method of starting a new business,'' said
Robert Bond, owner of Source Book Publications in Oakland, which
publishes a comprehensive $29.95 annual franchise guide. ``It
avoids many of the myriad pitfalls normally encountered by someone
going into business and vastly improves the odds of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchises provide a blend of operating independence with a
proven system that includes detailed blueprints on starting and
managing the business as well as training and other support.
</P>
<P>
   But Bond notes many people, including himself, might chafe at
always having to be a team player and operating under someone
else's rules. ``If you don't like being told what to do or can't
follow the rules,'' he advises, ``don't consider franchising.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, franchises are hardly immune from competitive
pressures and are only as good as their owners make them. That
often involves working 60-plus hours per week until you can justify
delegating some of the day-to-day responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity Breeds Contentment
</P>
<P>
   For those breaking into the franchise business, it often helps
if you already are familiar with the field and good at it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider packaging engineer Jim Andrews who left Lockheed Martin
in 1995 to buy a Handle With Care Packaging Store franchise in San
Francisco. For the previous 12 years, he worked for the aerospace
firm, designing shipping containers for Trident II missile
components.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Andrews, 56, designed a host of other products,
including the foam egg carton and hinged container for McDonald's
Big Mac. (He received only $1 per patent, which he notes was one of
the drawbacks working for a big company.)
</P>
<P>
   Andrews began scouting for something new when the company his
wife worked for was taken over and it appeared she would be
relocated from Palo Alto to New Jersey. He explored opportunities
in the packaging field because that was something he knew about. He
was drawn to Handle With Care because he previously had a good
experience using the firm to ship an antique desk across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that his wife did not have to move. But by then,
Andrews was hooked on the franchise. He now has three packaging
store franchises in San Francisco, specializing in shipping large,
awkward and valuable items like sailboats and computer servers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Responsibilities
</P>
<P>
   Andrews paid in the ``six figures'' for his first franchise in
San Francisco, financing half from personal savings and half from a
10-year loan from the previous owner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Andrews likes working with customers and designing custom
packaging but isn't thrilled about paying all the bills and other
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running your own business is a headache,'' he said. ``But it's
your own headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews says it is essential to know what you're doing and make
certain your franchisor provides sufficient training and support.
Also be ready to spend plenty of time on marketing. ``If you just
want to stand behind the counter,'' Andrews warns, ``you will be
out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   And be patient. Andrews figures it takes at least two years to
break even on a new store franchise, maybe less if you buy an
existing one.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying a franchise, experts suggest you check it out
carefully and even work for a spell as an employee in one of the
outlets. Also check out how many franchises already exist in the
area you are targetting as well as competing brands.
</P>
<P>
   Fast Food, Slow Profits
</P>
<P>
   ``Franchises are often a tough business,'' said Bond, owner of
Source Book Publications. ``A lot of people assume they can make
$100,000 a year but work their asses off and make half that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many owners make a lot less than that. Mina Abhang, who came to
California from Bombay, India, said she once worked at McDonald's
for $3.50 an hour and later earned $12 per hour at IBM. But she
yearned to run her own business. In 1994, she bought a Subway
sandwich shop franchise in San Jose with a $40,000 loan from the
previous owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a person like myself, with only a high school education,
this looked like a chance to get ahead,'' she said. But four year
later, Abhang, 43, still runs the shop all by herself 13 hours a
day, seven days a week. After $700-a-month debt repayment, 8
percent royalty payments and all the other costs, she figures she
makes about the same as she did flipping burgers for McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work is not always enough to make a franchise pay off. Part
of Abhang's problem is that a neighboring Blockbuster video rental
outlet moved four months ago, taking an unexpected 50 percent bite
out of her business.
</P>
<P>
   There are also 15 other Subway outlets just in San Jose. Still,
Abhang remains hopeful. ``The people are nice,'' she said. ``The
food is great. And in eight more months, the loan will be paid
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Dollars and Diligence
</P>
<P>
   Ned Perry, a former lawyer for Lehman Brothers, also ``harbored
a dream of being my own boss'' but got into the franchise business
from a very different starting point than Abhang.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, tired of the frenetic investment-banking lifestyle in
Tokyo and New York, he considered buying a family-owned commercial
printing business in Vermont that was emerging from bankruptcy
protection. ``But after a lot of due diligence,'' he said, ``I saw
there was a lot I didn't know about the business and realized I
could get easily overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, 47, then began exploring franchises and ended up setting
up a new Alphagraphics shop in Santa Rosa where his wife is his
partner. It's a 10 minute commute from home and his kids often drop
by after school.
</P>
<P>
   A Small Business Administration loan helped cover about $400,000
in startup costs. Perry figures he broke even last month after two
years in operation and could soon be back to earning a six-figure
income.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he wanted a franchise where he would primarily deal
with other businesses rather than consumers. He then set up a
franchise in a part of town already filled with other print shops
so that he could win business and get referrals for Alphagraphics'
high-quality quick printing. His store prints everything from
training manuals for Hewlett-Packard to specialty wine labels.
</P>
<P>
   Perry still works more than 40 hours a week. ``There's always
something to be done,'' he said, ``but no one calls in the middle
of the night anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Do's and Don'ts
</P>
<P>
   Perry advises doing plenty of homework and number-crunching
before entering the franchising fray.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly is no shortage of information from those in the
franchising trade, which accounts for about 13 percent of U.S.
retail sales, and those who make a living writing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying a franchise, Rieva Lesonsky, editorial director of
Entrepreneur magazine, recommends calling at least 20 other
franchisees, including many in areas similar to the one you are
considering.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise giants are mostly likely harder to bargain with,
but you might win concessions, like postponement of fees, from
newer companies. Lesonsky says some of the hottest niches are kids'
services, personnel and employee leasing, and upscale sandwich
shops like Sandella's.
</P>
<P>
   But beware of franchisors that expand too fast. Some, like
Boston Market and Manhattan Bagel, ended up filing for bankruptcy
protection, leaving some of their franchisees in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Bond figures that the success rate for franchise owners is far
better than for small businesses in general, where as many as 38
percent drop out after the first year. By contrast, he guesses that
only a third of franchises go out of business after five years.

 ProLogis to Buy Meridian Industrial  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
ProLogis Trust, the largest owner of warehouse and industrial
properties in the United States, said yesterday it will buy
Meridian Industrial Trust of San Francisco in a deal worth nearly
$1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation of the two real estate investment trusts comes
at a critical time for their industry.
</P>
<P>
   REITs are finding it nearly impossible to borrow money for real
estate acquisitions from the many major lenders that have suffered
losses in the global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, REITs are reluctant to use their own stocks to
buy properties because the stocks are depressed. A REIT index
compiled by Morgan Stanley is down nearly 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The wisest course for REITs, analysts say, is to merge with each
other and take advantage of economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Irving F. Lyons III, co-chairman and chief investment officer of
ProLogis of Denver, noted that 85 percent of Meridian's assets are
in ``the eight largest distribution markets'' in the United States.
``That made it a very attractive opportunity for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meridian owns 36 million square feet of warehouses, distribution
facilities and other industrial properties nationwide, including
major Northern California installations in Hayward, Tracy, Stockton
and Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Jay P. Leupp, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens in
San Francisco, said ProLogis and Meridian combined probably can
earn an extra 3 or 4 cents per share by eliminating ``overlapping
overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior management of Meridian, led by Chairman and chief
executive Allen J. Anderson, will not continue with the merged
company, and Leupp speculates that the Meridian headquarters office
in San Francisco might be shut down.
</P>
<P>
   However, two Meridian directors _ yet to be chosen _ will get
seats on the ProLogis board, which is being expanded to 10 members
from seven.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson could not be reached for comment yesterday. In a press
release, he called the deal ``the greatest potential for future
growth and value creation for Meridian shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 3 to 6 cents per share eventually can be saved by
terminating Meridian's contracts with outside property-management
firms, Leupp said.
</P>
<P>
   ProLogis manages and leases its own properties, and Lyons
confirmed that it will take over the management of Meridian's
properties as well.
</P>
<P>
   Under the complicated terms of the acquisition, ProLogis will
issue 1.1 shares of its stock and up to $2 in cash for each of
Meridian's 34.5 million outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ProLogis has agreed to assume $560 million of
Meridian's debt and buy out $50 million of Meridian preferred
stock, bringing the total value of the deal to $1.457 billion,
based on ProLogis' closing stock price yesterday of $20.50 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Meridian shareholders will get cash as well as ProLogis stock if
the ProLogis stock price stands lower than $22.73 at the time the
deal is consummated _ probably at the end of March. The amount of
cash will go as high as $2 if ProLogis stock is below $20.91.
</P>
<P>
   Meridian stock closed up 68 cents at $22.88 on the NYSE.

 H&AMP;Q's Departed Technology Guru Resurfaces  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bruce Lupatkin is back on the radar.
</P>
<P>
   After unceremoniously exiting his post at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist last
August, the San Francisco investment bank's former director of
research says he's ``breaking his radio silence.''
</P>
<P>
   As many researchers and analysts eventually do, Lupatkin is
hanging out his shingle and launching his own asset-management
firm.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the spirit of the John Glenn-rally, what makes
Lupatkin think he has the right stuff to be a money manager?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been making investments on behalf of myself and H&AMP;Q over
a number of years, (and) it's what I think I am the best at,''
Lupatkin says.
</P>
<P>
   As the name of his fund might imply, North Bay Technology
Partners will concentrate on investing in (what else?) Silicon
Valley companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lupatkin's private investment partnership will be a
``cross-over'' fund, meaning it will invest in private as well as
publicly held companies.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the firm is sort of a hybrid between a hedge
fund and a venture capital fund. For example, a fund that Lupatkin
holds up as an inspirational model is Roger McNamee's Integral
Partners in Palo Alto. Catching early stage tech companies at the
right time can sometimes reap huge rewards, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the great technologies tend to percolate up from the
private sector,'' Lupatkin says.
</P>
<P>
   And getting to understand them early during venture rounds ``can
make you a better investor,'' Lupatkin says.
</P>
<P>
   Lupatkin won't say how much dough he intends to raise. But to
seed his partnership, he hopes to tap the thick wallets of some of
the Bay Area's myriad multimillionaire executives. As the top
researcher of a technology-driven underwriter, Lupatkin gained the
acquaintance of a bevy of the Valley's top brass over the years.
The fund will be run from the One Bush office tower in San
Francisco _ the same quarters of his former employer, H&AMP;Q.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The fund ``is still in the formative stages, but we'll be up
and running by the first of next year,'' Lupatkin says.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, what does he think of the brief bear market and the
subsequent rebound?
</P>
<P>
   Lupatkin envisions that a lot of initial offerings will get
pushed out of the pipeline now that the Internet-related deals have
rekindled institutional appetites for new offerings. But don't
expect smooth sailing. He thinks market volatility is rising _ not
the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it's over. I don't think that the
correction every one has just lived through is the end (of a rocky
market),'' Lupatkin says.
</P>
<P>
   More H&AMP;Q Rumblings: Lupatkin's resignation was the precursor to
another high-profile exit from the regional investment bank _ last
week's surprise departure of Chief Financial Officer Patrick Allen.
As previously reported in this column, Allen is returning to his
old stomping grounds at Cruttenden Roth in Irvine, near Newport
Beach in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the exodus of top talent at H&AMP;Q has not dampened
investor enthusiasm. H&AMP;Q's stock jumped more than $2 to close
yesterday at $23.50 a share _ the exact same price it reached a
week ago fueled by takeover rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz persists, but the only H&AMP;Q news to hit the wires
yesterday involved British brokerage, Beeson Gregory. H&AMP;Q owns a 10
percent stake in the firm, which apparently is fending off numerous
European suitors.
</P>
<P>
   You know, I just don't think that hostile bids for bloody Beeson
are what's driving up the price of H&AMP;Q's shares.

 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The drug industry's top scientist called yesterday for new federal
regulations for nutritional and herbal supplements, saying
consumers had no way of knowing ``what was in the bottle'' when
they purchased these alternative remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The call was issued by Larry Augsburger, a drug researcher at
the University of Maryland and president of the American
Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, which is holding its
annual meeting this week in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, medical professionals have amplified their
criticisms of alternative medicines and remedies, including
so-called nutraceuticals _ vitamins, herbal extracts and
nutritional supplements that many consumers are using in addition
to, or in lieu of, pharmaceutical drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Augsburger said that in contrast to strict Food and Drug
Administration rules governing drugmakers, nutraceutical
manufacturers ``have no one looking over their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his association, which represents more than 7,000
scientists who work for universities, drug companies and biotech
firms, thinks it will ``require congressional action'' to impose
new rules on supplement vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ford, executive officer of the National Nutritional Food
Association, a Newport Beach (Orange County) trade group that
represents nutraceutical makers, said his industry doesn't need any
new rules.
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress gave the FDA the power in 1994 to regulate the
manufacturing process for vitamins and supplements. But he said the
agency so far has not exercised that power because it already has
its hands full inspecting drugmakers and lacks the money to police
more factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they would enforce the law they have, they could rid our
industry of its scoundrels, which every industry has, which would
make it better for the mainstream players,'' said Ford.
</P>
<P>
   He said his trade group is in the process of developing
self-regulatory procedures to govern the quality and labeling of
alternative remedies.
</P>
<P>
   It was ironic for pharmaceutical scientists to call for federal
regulations to be imposed on a competing industry because
drugmakers often complain that FDA oversight impedes them from
bringing new drugs to market.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, other speakers at the pharmaceutical gathering
said the FDA was impeding the study of a drug that pediatricians
are using to treat premature infants who can't keep their food
down.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, Cisapride, won FDA approval in 1995 as a treatment for
nighttime heartburn in adults. Since then, pediatricians have
started giving the drug to premature infants who face disease or
death because they throw up their food.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregory Kearns, a pediatric researcher at Children's Mercy
Hospital in Kansas City, said doctors are guessing about the proper
dose of Cisapride to give infants. He wants FDA approval to conduct
scientific trials to study the drug in premature patients. But the
FDA has dragged its feet, citing concerns that Cisapride might lead
to irregular heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are using it,'' Kearns said. ``The drug has to be
studied.''

SIX L.A.-AREA BUSINESSES QUALIFY FOR TOP-500 EXPANSION LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Consider them the cream of the local crop.
</P>
<P>
   Six area technology businesses made the cut Tuesday for
consulting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP's 1998 Fast 500 list, a
national tracking of companies' expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the growing concerns were: Chatsworth-based MRV
Communications Inc. (No. 146); Camarillo-based EOS Corp. (No. 175);
Simi Valley's Eltron International Inc. (No. 209); MicroPulse Inc.
of Camarillo (No. 234); Nova Development Corp. in Calabasas (No.
241); and Camarillo-based ACT Networks Inc. (No. 410).
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, entrants must have had revenues of at least $50,000
in 1993 and $1 million in 1997. Deloitte &AMP; Touche ranked qualifying
businesses based on their cumulative growth over the past five
years, with the lowest qualifier this year generating just over 500
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   MRV, the best area performer, had a 2,128 percent increase in
revenues, while ACT Networks grew by 692 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Communications dominated locally. MRV and ACT each manufacture
data and voice network equipment, while MicroPulse makes high-tech
antennas. Eltron, which recently merged with a competitor and is
now a Ventura County-based subsidiary, makes bar-code printers.
Nova Development produces clip art software and EOS makes power
supply adapters.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, statewide 31 percent of businesses were in software
and just 15 percent in communications.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 26 percent of the 500 companies are California-based,
with 62 in Silicon Valley and 49 in Southern California, according
to the report.

 Judge Rules for Sun Over Microsoft  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a big win for Sun Microsystems and yet another legal blow to
Microsoft, a federal judge in San Jose yesterday ordered the
software giant to make Windows and other products comply with Sun's
standards for its Java programming language.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte issued a preliminary injunction
giving Microsoft 90 days to make the changes in its version of
Java, or it will be forced to stop shipping those products.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a jarring setback for Microsoft, which has been
battling Sun in court at the same time it's trying to fend off
federal prosecutors in a landmark antitrust trial in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Microsoft might not be able to make the necessary
changes in time and therefore could be forced to halt shipments of
Windows 98, which runs more than 90 percent of all new personal
computers. The Redmond, Wash., company also could be forced to stop
distributing its popular Web browser, Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't change the code in 90 days, so they'll have to
press forward with an appeal and try to get the injunction
overturned,'' said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real mess for them,'' he said, adding, ``I don't think
they have a contingency plan. They thought they were going to win
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun, a Mountain View computer- and software-maker and one of
Microsoft's most vocal critics, sued Microsoft for $35 million in
October 1997, claiming that Microsoft had breached a 1996 agreement
under which Sun licensed its Java code.
</P>
<P>
   Java was developed by Sun as a programming language that could
be used on any computer, regardless of the operating system or
software. It's used primarily by software developers to create
animation and interactivity for Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said the contract required Microsoft products to pass Sun's
compatibility tests for Java.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, Sun claimed that Microsoft planned to ``pollute''
the market for Java by creating browsers, operating systems and
other software containing Java code that would perform better with
Microsoft software than with products from competing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said Microsoft wanted to destroy Sun's Java business and
dominate the market for Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft countersued, arguing that Sun breached the contract by
not making its compatibility tests available. Microsoft also said
its version of Java worked equally well with Microsoft and
non-Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling yesterday, Whyte said that Sun is likely to
prevail in the case, and might suffer ``irreparable harm'' if
Microsoft continues to distribute the altered version of Java.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction does not force Microsoft to recall any products
already shipped. However, the company must provide upgraded
versions of products that pass Sun's tests. Or it could simply
remove Java from its software, which is not a likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gratified with this ruling,'' said Alan Baratz,
president of Sun's Java software division. ``This is a win for Java
licensees, developers and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Baratz said Sun will continue to battle Microsoft in the
marketplace while the case unfolds in court. Whyte has not yet set
a trial date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to use our enormous energy in the marketplace
... to deliver high-performing Java technology that outperforms
Microsoft's incompatible technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan told Bloomberg the company was
disappointed by the ruling, but that it would comply with the
injunction. ``We are disappointed in Sun's short-sighted legal
strategy, which we believe will deny choice to customers and
developers,'' he said.

<P>
   KRASNOYARSK-26, Russia _ When Andrei Sokolov came to this
nuclear city more than 30 years ago it was a bastion of privilege
for the Soviet Union's scientific elite.
</P>
<P>
   Its very existence was a state secret. Behind barbed-wire
fences, and hidden inside a mountain of granite, three nuclear
reactors produced tons of plutonium for nation's nuclear arsenal.
Its scientists, the nation's brightest, lived the Soviet dream: the
best food and wages the Kremlin could provide.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk-26 remains closed off from the world. But these days
it is an impoverished ward of the state, and a vexing worry for
Russian and American officials who fear Russia's best scientists
will leave for aspiring nuclear powers like Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov, 58, one of the city's top nuclear specialists, says he
is not leaving. He sometimes goes months without his meager salary,
and he and his neighbors recently endured a few weeks without heat.
Like the humblest Russian peasant, his wife, Nadezhda, helps make
ends meet by canning cabbages, cucumbers and tomatoes from the
garden at their dacha, and she cannot look back without a twinge of
regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better then,'' she said. ``The city was clean.
Everything was in abundance. There was no economic panic. We were
young and everything seemed beautiful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Sokolovs are stoical about the future, nobody can be
sure about the thousands of other specialists in Russia's 10
nuclear cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has become so concerned about the
tumbling morale of its top nuclear scientists that it has ordered
its security services to secretly monitor them, Russia's minister
of atomic energy said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Energy Department has pledged as much as $30
million in assistance through 1999 to start up new businesses in
the hope that the enterprises will be able to attract hundreds of
millions more in Western investment.
</P>
<P>
   But critics worry that the aid is too little to make a
difference. And with Russia's economy in crisis and investors
fleeing, attracting foreign investment is harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As winter begins creeping across the heartland, nuclear workers
have taken to the streets to demand back pay. Guards at nuclear
laboratories have abandoned their posts to forage for food. Power
shortages threaten to shut down electronic security systems
designed to safeguard stores of bomb-grade materials.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk-26 has endured its share of tribulations: a restive
workforce, months of unpaid wages and the temporary shutdown of its
lone nuclear reactor, which forced residents to endure the bitter
Siberian chill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in the nuclear closed cities is very close to
catastrophic,'' said Viktor Orlov, director of the Moscow-based
Center for Policy Studies and an expert on Russia's nuclear
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The armed guards at the checkpoint for Krasnoyarsk-26 provide a
sobering reminder to visitors that they are about to enter a state
within a state.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders must get the blessing of the Federal Security Service,
the heir to the KGB. Passports are inspected and, in the case of
foreigners, escorts provided.
</P>
<P>
   The residential heart of this city of seven square miles gives a
hint of its past glory. There is an artificial lake with three
beaches. Its movie theater, which used to receive first-run Soviet
films the day after they appeared in Moscow, displays an ad for the
American film ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more sports facilities than in most Russian cities of
this size, and a well-tended park, which features a statue of Lenin
staring vacantly into space. (It had been looking approvingly at
Stalin before Nikita Khrushchev launched his campaign to
de-Stalinize the nation and the dictator's statue was removed.)
</P>
<P>
   The train station that the city's scientists and engineers use
to go to work looks like a typical suburban platform, save for the
fact it is protected by armed interior ministry guards and serves
an electric train that heads straight into a fortified mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The subterranean complex at the other end of a three-mile-long
tunnel is a cavernous, multistory honeycomb of nuclear reactors,
plutonium laboratories, cafeterias and workshops _ some 3,500 rooms
in all.
</P>
<P>
   It is the mountain that persuaded Stalin and Lavrenty Beria, his
secret police chief, to build the complex in this remote stretch of
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The granite peak, they calculated, would shelter the complex
against an American nuclear strike, enabling the Soviet Union to
produce bomb-grade plutonium after a nuclear war. The nearby
Yenisei River, one of Siberia's mightiest, would cool the
plutonium-generating reactors.
</P>
<P>
   No efforts were spared to turn this cold war project into a
reality. The chief construction engineers were military officers.
Most of the brawn, however, was provided by slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the city's records, some 70,000 prisoners worked
here from 1950 to 1964, digging out the mountain _ excavating more
rock than was used to build Egypt's largest Pyramid.

 Fed Cuts Interest Rates   By Sam Zuckerman  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates yesterday for the
third time in seven weeks, signaling its concern that the U.S.
economy is still vulnerable to global financial weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's rate-setting committee trimmed its target for
the key federal funds rate _ the one banks charge each other for
overnight loans _ by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also cut the more symbolic discount rate by a similar
amount, to 4.50 percent. The discount rate is what the Fed charges
in unusual instances when it lends directly to banks.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and investors had expected the Fed to ease interest
rates. Signs of slower economic growth in the United States and
only small glimpses of financial recovery in Asia and other trouble
spots around the world had convinced Fed watchers more interest
rate action was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The move came at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Fed's
rate-setting open market committee. A month ago, the Fed cut rates
in between committee meetings, surprising central bank watchers.
</P>
<P>
   The last two rate cuts took place while financial markets were
under siege, as investors unloaded virtually all stocks and bonds
except ultra-safe U.S. Treasury securities. At the time, many
experts sounded the alarm about an impending credit crunch in which
financing could become scarce for American businesses and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, yesterday's Fed move came after U.S. stock and bond
markets had largely bounced back from the two months of turmoil and
plunging prices from August to October.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Fed's last cut October 15, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average jumped 13 percent. And the prices of many debt securities
also recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rebound, experts warned that the U.S. economy
remains exposed to conditions overseas and that investors are still
jittery after last summer's wild ride .
</P>
<P>
   ``Although conditions in financial markets have settled down
materially since mid-October, unusual strains remain,'' the Fed
noted in a statement about yesterday's rate move.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed needed to act to reassure investors that it's still
prepared to ease credit conditions if markets relapse, market
participants said.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's move ``shows the Fed's absolute commitment to
provide sufficient liquidity to preclude the kind of financial
crisis we saw last summer,'' said Clyde Kendzierski, chief bond
trader for Sanwa Bank California.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market largely shrugged off yesterday's move. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell 24.97 to 8986.28, while the S&AMP;P 500
Index rose 3.46 to 1139.32. The Nasdaq index rose 16.84 to 1878.52.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden was really on the Fed,'' said Gary Schlossberg,
senior economist at Wells Capital Management. ``There was so much
expectation built into the market that, if they had done nothing,
you might have seen a sell-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the latest easing should lower rates on
adjustable-rate loans, such as those levied for credit cards, auto
loans and some home loans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the nation's largest banks, including North
Carolina's BankAmerica Corp. and New York's Chase Manhattan Corp.,
said they were trimming their prime rates 0.25 percentage point to
7.75 percent. The prime rate is traditionally the rate banks offer
their best business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, long-term interest rates, including those charged on
fixed-rate mortgages, rose since the last Fed easing and could edge
up again, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because mortgages and other long-term rates are pegged to
Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond prices had soared and yields had plunged in August
and September as investors snapped them up in a flight to quality.
When other assets stabilized, investors sold Treasury bonds,
pushing prices down and yields back up.
</P>
<P>
   If markets remain relatively stable, ``short-term rates will
remain low or possibly fall further, while long-term rates will
remain high relative to short-term rates, or possibly move even
higher,'' said Sanwa's Kendzierski.
</P>
<P>
   The days of 6.75 percent 30-year mortgages may be over, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good possibility we've seen the lows'' in fixed-rate
mortgages, Kendzierski said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the central bank will ease credit a fourth time at its
next rate-setting meeting in December is far from clear, Fed
watchers noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is, was this the last of the easings,'' Schlossberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's future actions will depend on whether economic reports
suggest further economic slowing, Schlossberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed itself, using the kind of tortured syntax for which its
chairman Alan Greenspan is famous, hinted its recent actions may be
enough for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the (0.75 percentage point) decline in the federal funds
rate since September, financial conditions can reasonably be
expected to be consistent with fostering sustained economic
expansion,'' the Fed said in its statement'
</P>
<P>
   Still, some forecasters suggested, a weakening economy could
force the central bank's hand.
</P>
<P>
   As demand dries up around the world, demand for U.S. goods is
drying up as well. As a result, during the three months ended in
September, industrial production registered its first quarterly
decline in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is across-the-board evidence of weakening demand and
slowing job growth,'' the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor
confederation, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in an
extraordinary joint statement urging Fed action to buoy the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation remains subdued. In a report issued before
the Fed acted yesterday, the Labor Department said inflation the
Consumer Price Index rose a scant 0.2 percent in October.

 KRASNOYARSK-26, Russia: the pyramids.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many were veterans, farmers and workers, who may have done
little more than steal a sack of potatoes to feed their families.
Several hundred foreigners were also brought here for forced labor,
including, the city's punctilious records show, prisoners from
Germany, Poland, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Spain, Finland and
``one Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Krasnoyarsk-26 are named after Soviet heros and
city founders, but the only trace of the prisoners is the pitiful
plot of overgrown and unmarked graves that straddles the border of
the town. Now, some graves have been defaced by local vandals while
others have been covered by a garage.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk-26's fall from grace has made its present troubles
harder for many of its residents to bear. Unlike Russia's sorry
factory towns or collective farms, this city got used to being a
pampered enclave for the nation's top engineering talent, and many
inhabitants cannot look back without a nagging sense of regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early days were full of enthusiasm,'' said Ivan
Mashkovtsev, a former KGB official who used to oversee security at
the nuclear complex.
</P>
<P>
   Its workforce earned 50 percent more than its counterparts
outside the city gates. Food was ample and there was no rationing
or lines. Vacations were generous: 36 work days a year and 48 days
for those who labored inside the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of national purpose was fortified by ironhanded
secrecy. For the first few years, none of the residents was allowed
to leave. Later, when travel within the Soviet Union was allowed,
the word ``plutonium'' was stripped from their vocabulary. If
anyone asked, they could say that they worked for an iron ore mine
or lived on a military base.
</P>
<P>
   There were no telephone lines connecting Krasnoyarsk-26 to
nearby cities and villages; the telephone lines used by the top
leadership ran straight to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Because the city was left off Soviet maps, residents called it
Krasnoyarsk-26, using the number on the post office box where their
mail was sent at the open city of Krasnoyarsk, 40 miles south.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk's plutonium industry did not stay secret for long.
According to Russian officials, American intelligence learned about
the reactors in the 1963, several years after its second reactor
began to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Krasnoyarsk-26's reactors kept churning away. According
to some Western estimates, they produced more than 40 tons of
bomb-grade plutonium, about one-third of the plutonium used to
build the Soviet arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   With the world awash in deadly plutonium, two of the three
reactors here have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining reactor provides heat for the city. It still
produces plutonium as a byproduct that is separated from the
reactor's nuclear waste and stored as a powder for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   To many, the loss of the secret city's cold war mission has been
a devastating psychological blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem is probably not the loss of material
wealth,'' Mashkovtsev said. ``The problem is the way people look at
the nuclear industry. People here feel like they are unneeded,
especially when they hear others say that everything they did was
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   For Valery Lebedev, the director of Krasnoyarsk-26's nuclear
operations and a veteran resident of the city, holding the complex
together is an increasingly daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 people still work at the nuclear complex. But it has
received only two-thirds of the government funds it was expecting
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices have increased but we cannot raise wages, because
we do not even pay people what they are supposed to be paid,''
Lebedev said. ``We try to do our best to pay something. If we don't
have money we give food.''
</P>
<P>
   The money crunch has taken its toll. Even keeping the lone
reactor running is not a simple proposition.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a budget shortfall delayed a shipment of uranium
fuel. Then workers in the radio-chemistry laboratory, where
plutonium is separated from the nuclear waste, mounted a brief
protest. The reactor was out of operation for weeks, leaving the
city without heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned when a person has to think all the time about
how to feed his family,'' Lebedev explained. ``That's not a good
time to carry out some important operations.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also affecting arms control efforts. The Russian
government has promised the United States it will convert the
Krasnoyarsk-26 reactor and two similar reactors at another closed
city, Tomsk-7, so that they no longer produce plutonium by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials said the conversion will almost certainly
have to be delayed because of budgetary and technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Without generous funds from Moscow, the city's character has
begun to change. It is quieter, greener and safer than most than
most Russian cities, but it is no longer walled off from the
problems of modern-day Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of funds has affected the city's medical services
which suspended all but emergency operations in August when
medicine and surgical gloves ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Like other scientists, Sokolov and his family have felt the
blow. They live in a cramped, but tidy apartment, crowded with
books and pictures of grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov, tall, lean and graced with an impish sense of humor,
relishes his work and his colleagues and regales guests with tales
of his trips through the still untamed taiga, the storied Siberian
wilderness that stretches north to the Arctic tundra.
</P>
<P>
   Their rewards for long years of service behind the barbed-wire
city limits, however, is a meager one. Sokolov's salary, which
sometimes has been delayed for months, is about $150 a month. His
wife, a chemist, has been paid more regularly, but only receives
$30 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Their salaries are supplemented by small pensions, granted in
recognition of their decades of toil. Each receives $37.

 KRASNOYARSK-26, Russia: a month.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their children have delivered their verdict on the city's
future. The Sokolovs' son works in the city, but their two
daughters, who received degrees in science, moved away years ago
and have no desire to return.
</P>
<P>
   Pensioners and laid-off workers have an even harder time.
</P>
<P>
   Valentina Mazurova worked as a construction engineer when
Krasnoyarsk-26 was a boomtown. A sturdy woman with an engaging
smile, she has given up her dreams of travel and supplements her
monthly pension by selling dried fruit in the outdoor market. On a
good day, she may earn $2.
</P>
<P>
   Others residents have turned to the world outside the wire for
work. Each weekday morning, several thousand pile into a caravan of
cars and buses that snakes its way to the city of Krasnoyarsk.
</P>
<P>
   Lebedev would like to see the secret city opened up. That, he
believes, would bring in new business and money and make the city
less dependent on the dying military sector.
</P>
<P>
   Few residents, however, agree. They see the barbed-wire fences
as a final barrier against the turmoil sweeping the land and want
to keep Krasnoyarsk-26 closed despite the economic costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stronger the crisis the more people want to live in
isolation,'' said the Andrei Katargin, the mayor of Zheleznogorsk,
the name of the residential area inside the fences.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the closed cities have become a heavy burden for
Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's atomic energy minister. Krasnoyarsk-26 is
just part of the problem. The director of the nuclear design center
Chelyabinsk-70 shot himself in 1996, as that closed city faltered
under the weight of unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
   Morale is so low that Adamov regularly lectures the authorities
in the nuclear cities not to pay plumbers and common laborers more
than nuclear scientists. The approaching winter threatens to make a
bad situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   Closing down the cities is not an option. They are still needed
to disassemble weapons and safeguard nuclear materials, and nobody
wants the scientists to be tempted to go abroad.
</P>
<P>
   As the cities deteriorated, Russian intelligence began the
secret monitoring of the top Russian scientists, whose
bomb-designing skills would be particularly valuable to an aspiring
nuclear power or to the United States, Adamov said. The United
States itself is worried about Russian scientists' leaving to help
Iraq, Iran, North Korea and other aspiring nuclear powers. It has
agreed to provide money for their employers to switch to
non-nuclear ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians ``call them sensitive professions,'' Adamov said.
``and we know all these people by name. Even they don't know that
they are in this group. We make sure they are provided for.''

 KRASNOYARSK-26, Russia: provided for.''

<P>
   The atomic energy ministry's long-term plan is to cut the
nuclear workforce by as much as a third and create an equivalent
number of new jobs in the commercial sector. Of the three-quarter
of a million people who live in the closed cities, 125,000 work
directly in the nuclear enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the closed cities are like children,'' Adamov said.
``The gap between ordinary cities and the free market is quite big,
but the gap between people who lived in a closed city and a market
economy is enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are so high that the United States Energy Department
has forged an unusual collaboration with the atomic energy
ministry, its former archrival. It has earmarked $30 million
dollars to help launch new businesses, which might attract Western
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a small sum and the funds cannot even be disbursed
until Congress reviews the spending plan early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department is also planning to spend $200 million to
help Russia dispose of plutonium. That will also involve work in
the closed cities, though it is not clear exactly how those funds
will be spent and how much will go to American contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities were in trouble before, but now they are getting
desperate, said Kenneth Luongo, a former Energy Department official
and the head of the Russian-American National Security Advisory
Council, a private group that focuses on the problems of the closed
cities. ``What little economic progress there was is being erased
and serious action is required to prevent further deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   At Krasnoyarsk-26, Lebedev has not given up hope. His dream is
to transform his complex into a high-tech commercial center _ a
sort of Silicon Valley of Russia. He has tried one plan after to
try to lure business here but little has happened.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to assemble Samsung televisions collapsed after import
tariffs on electronic components were raised. He also drafted a
plan to make his city a tax-free zone for foreign investors. But
the government never acted.
</P>
<P>
   The complex is so desperate it would like to make money storing
nuclear waste. But Russian law forbids it from accepting nuclear
waste from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   These days Krasnoyarsk-26 is counting on the construction of a
$200 million factory to produce silicon for computer chips. The
Defense Enterprise Fund, a Pentagon-funded group that is trying to
help Russia convert its military industry to civilian production,
has paid for some of the planning. The Russian government has
already spent several million dollars to grow silicon crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoyarsk-26, however, still needs to line up major Western
investors. With Asia in a recession and the United States and
Europe possibly on the brink of a slowdown, persuading foreign
companies to sink hundreds of millions of dollars into a Siberian
nuclear city is harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As investors ponder their hand, Lebedev is weighed down by more
immediate worries. This summer, he sent his Moscow superiors a
blunt memo describing where this once-proud city was headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wage payments are three months behind schedule,'' he wrote.
``The social tension in the shops and factories has reached the
critical level, and its consequences are unpredictable.''

LIVENT THEATER COMPANY WEIGHS ITS OPTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS
BANKRUPTCY
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By MELODY PETERSEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Executives of Livent Inc., the financially troubled
Broadway theater company, are discussing whether the company should
file for bankruptcy protection or take another action to appease
creditors who are owed hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   While the curtain was opening Tuesday night on Livent's
productions _ including the Tony-award-winning musical ``Ragtime''
_ a company spokesman declined to comment on what ticket holders
and the company's frustrated shareholders could expect in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livent is carefully exploring the company's options,'' said
Don Nathan, the spokesman, ``and will pursue those actions that we
believe are in the best interests of the company and its
constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan declined to describe the options that the company's board
_ which is controlled by Michael Ovitz, the former president of the
Walt Disney Co. _ discussed at a meeting Tuesday evening or whether
board members had voted on a specific plan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to filing for bankruptcy protection, other choices
available to Ovitz and his management team _ who took over the
company in April _ could include selling the company or some of its
assets, including one or more of its six theaters in the United
States and Canada, or finding investors willing to put more money
into the business. A more drastic step, and a move that is
considered unlikely, is for the company to cease business and
liquidate all of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy lawyers and theater executives who have business
dealings with Livent said that the most likely action was for the
company to file for a financial reorganization under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy code. That move would give the company
months or even years to find a way to pay its heavy debts while its
theater productions continue.
</P>
<P>
   John Breglio, an entertainment lawyer who represents some
organizations that do business with Livent, said that he would
welcome a bankruptcy reorganization since it would show that the
company was at least moving forward in its struggles to recover.
Since Aug. 10, when the company announced that it had discovered
millions of dollars of errors in its financial records, management
has left its business associates, shareholders and creditors
largely in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now it's been a black hole,'' Breglio said. ``We'll know
better whether Livent will be an ongoing player.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has not traded on exchanges in the United
States or Canada, where the company is based, since Aug. 10 because
the company has been unable to provide even the most basic
financial information. Securities regulators in both the United
States and Canada are investigating the company's books, and the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police are conducting a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, management delayed, for the second time, the expected
date when the company would be able to release corrected financial
statements for 1998, 1997 and 1996. The executives now say new
statements will be released by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
   People in the New York theater industry, who declined to be
named, said Tuesday that the reason for the delays was that
management had found that the financial irregularities were on a
much wider scale than they first believed.
</P>
<P>
   Livent's new managers suspended the company's two founders _
Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb _ after discovering the
financial problems. But Drabinsky and Gottlieb have denied any
wrongdoing and have questioned the timing of the company's
announcement of the accounting problems, noting that Ovitz had
hired accountants to review Livent's books last spring before he
decided to invest $20 million and take over the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of question marks out there,'' said
David Weiner, a spokesman for Drabinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, the company has been negotiating with 15 banks and
financial institutions that own the majority of $125 million in
bonds that the company sold about a year ago to pay for its new
theaters, including the Ford Center for the Performing Arts in the
Broadway theater district, where ``Ragtime'' now plays.
</P>
<P>
   Under a provision in the bond agreement, the institutions can
immediately force the company to repay 101 percent of the bonds'
face value if Drabinsky and Gottlieb no longer manage the company's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The institutions have hired their own lawyer, Luc A. Despins, of
Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, a specialist in American and Canadian bankruptcy
reorganizations, to represent them. On Monday, the lawyer declined
to discuss what the institutions planned to do. And Tuesday, he did
not respond to a message left with his secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bankruptcy reorganization, the company would not have to
make payments on its bonds until it could renegotiate a payment
plan with its creditors. In the company's current predicament,
interest payments on the bonds are eating up far more money than
the company can make on productions, even when ``Ragtime'' is
leading Broadway grosses. Variety reported it had sales of $848,825
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, Livent's associates said all the company's
current productions were continuing as expected. Livent has met all
its immediate financial obligations on ``Parade,'' a new musical
play jointly produced with Lincoln Center Theater that is now in
previews, according to Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The dance musical ``Fosse'' is due to open on Broadway in
January. And, in New York on Tuesday, Livent held a workshop of
``Sweet Smell of Success,'' a new musical with music by Marvin
Hamlisch and a book by John Guare.

THE THIRD OFFENSIVE IN A GLOBAL DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to cut
interest rates again marks the completion of a three-part strategy,
put together over the last seven weeks by the Clinton
administration and Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, to insulate
the American economy from the worst effects of the global economic
turmoil that a few weeks ago seemed to threaten to explode into
something far worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily that things are better than on Oct. 1,''
a senior administration official said Tuesday, ``but people don't
feel the world is in free fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market surge that has occurred since the Fed started
cutting rates may be masking a disturbing reality: While emotions
have cooled, little has changed in the economies of the stricken
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The latest projections released Tuesday by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, suggest that Japan, the
world's second-largest economy, will not be growing again until
2000. Japan, where President Clinton is visiting this week on a
shortened trip to Asia, keeps throwing money into the gaping holes
of its economy, only to discover that the holes keep becoming
deeper. South Korea, Clinton's weekend stop, is backtracking on
some reforms but the administration is desperate to show that its
prescriptions are working, so Clinton is unlikely to chide
President Kim Dae-jung in public.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the administration has bought some time _ but little
else. ``We had to deal first with rebuilding confidence, so that
capital would stop flowing out of countries,'' Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin told a group of business executives here last week.
``That situation is improving.'' But changing the way economies are
run from Tokyo to Brasilia is messy business, he said _ a lesson he
learned most recently and brutally in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's strategy was laid out in pieces, first in speeches
by Clinton and Greenspan and then fleshed out by Rubin and his
aides. Part 1 was to cut interest rates here and convince the
world's investors that a global downturn, not inflation, was the
biggest risk to nations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Part 2 was to stabilize Brazil, with a $41.5 billion bailout
package that was finally sealed last week, before that country's
financial crisis became out of control. And Part 3 was to bolster
several nations _ led by Japan _ that seemed stalled and unable to
begin the painful cleanup of the nastiest banking crisis in a
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   The early returns on the world's stock markets are almost too
encouraging. The Dow has risen 1,500 points, and in places like
Thailand and South Korea, the countries first hit by the crisis,
investors are driving up prices, hoping that Asia has hit bottom
and has no place to go but up.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, there is little talk of ``global economic
meltdown,'' the chilling phrase whispered just a few weeks ago in
the hallways of the Treasury, the White House and, just down the
street, the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's strategy grew out of the panic in Russia
and was described for the first time in public on Sept. 14, in a
speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. The speech
came at Clinton's lowest moment; Kenneth Starr's report to Congress
had been delivered just days before, and people in the room were
murmuring about Clinton's chances of survival. The next week, the
Federal Reserve learned about the depths of the troubles at
Long-Term Capital Management LP, the huge hedge fund in Greenwich,
Conn., that was on the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But for several weeks it was unclear whether any of the
administration's prescriptions could be applied as cohesively as
Clinton, Rubin and others tried to suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those weeks it could have gone either way,'' said one
senior official of an international organization that was dealing
regularly with the administration on these issues. ``And the fact
is, we got lucky _ at least for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cut rates for the second time on Sept. 21, recovering
from an early miscalculation when it announced a quarter-point cut
while world markets were looking for more. European nations, after
appearing to resist coordinated action, got on board after an
early-October meeting of the World Bank and the IMF created an
atmosphere of imminent economic doom. And a new German government
began publicly pressing the Bundesbank to loosen monetary policy _
a division of opinion that created some hope that Europe was
beginning to take the crisis more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Japanese began to act, announcing both a bank
restructuring plan and an economic stimulus package. Both were
riddled with holes. But in markets, as in politics, the appearance
of action is often more important than the action itself. And the
message was that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, unlike his
predecessor, was fully engaged in solving the problem. That sense
was heightened on Monday when the United States and Japan, while
still arguing over market openings, jointly released a $10 billion
program to bolster Southeast Asia's economies and their efforts to
wade through a churning sea of bad bank debt.
</P>
<P>
   The fear now is that the stock market surges could take the
pressure off governments around the world, just as they are
starting to tackle the toughest reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The countries we need to be strongly concerned about are
Brazil and Japan,'' said Daniel Tarullo, Clinton's top
international economic adviser until earlier this year. ``I don't
think the Brazilians feel that the pressure is off, at least yet.
And the problem in Japan is that they haven't felt enough to begin
with.''
</P>
<P>
   But the history of the global financial crisis thus far is that
the shock has come from someplace where no one was looking _ and
where the effects have been greater than anyone expected. That is
what happened with Indonesia, and then with Russia. And it explains
why so many in the administration are talking up their successes
while keeping an eye on China, Hong Kong and Europe.

NO. 2 HINGIS FINDS ANOTHER IMPETUS TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Hingis has had a disconcerting week. First,
she had to cope with the fact that, no matter what she accomplishes
at the year-ending Chase Championships, it will not be enough to
wrestle the No. 1 ranking from Lindsay Davenport. So, like it or
not, and she doesn't, the record will show she was second-best in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if she didn't have enough pecking-order problems,
she had to cope with Patty Schnyder, the Swiss-born player who had
obediently played second fiddle to her until last month at Munich,
in the opening round Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The last time they met, the fuzzy-haired Schnyder, whose five
titles for 1998 earned her the WTA's most-improved-player award,
dealt Hingis a defeat and a case of leg cramps. This time the
19-year-old Schnyder seemed intent on toppling Hingis again, but
after powering herself to a 6-4 lead, the left-handed Schnyder
wilted just long enough to allow Hingis to regroup and reassert
herself as the steadier playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   True, they ran each other ragged. ``You just have to play and
run,'' Hingis said. But in the end it was Hingis, with a determined
glare giving impetus to every shot she launched, who advanced to
the quarterfinal round with a 4-6, 6-0, 6-3 comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strange how the second set was over, 6-0, in like 10
minutes, but then you have to fight for every point in the third
set. It was a little bit nerve-racking to have someone like her on
the other side of the net,'' Hingis said, referring to the pressure
inherent in playing her understudy. ``I was, like, nervous in the
first set. My concentration went up and down like a roller
coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Hingis' black headband felt tight as a noose in the
opening set, when she went up a break only to instantly surrender
it with a double fault that leveled matters at 3-3. And after
holding for 5-4, Schnyder again poured on the pressure and broke
Hingis for the set with a rambunctious inside-out forehand that
Hingis somehow dug out of the corner but managed to send only as
far as the net.
</P>
<P>
   But the momentum switched to Hingis' side in the virtually
one-sided middle set, when Schnyder forgot how to aim her missiles
within the boundaries. In the third set, the pair traded breaks in
the second and third games, but once Schnyder allowed Hingis to
wriggle out of an 0-40 deficit as she served in the fourth game, it
was the more famous Swiss player, not the homegrown one, who took
control.
</P>
<P>
   A pragmatist at heart, Hingis said she has already replaced her
chase for the No. 1 ranking with her pursuit of a first Chase
title. ``If you win this tournament, you go better into next
year,'' she said.

   &UR; Kristin Gore &LR; , 21-year-old vice presidential offspring, has
written ``The Life and Times of a Secret Service Agent,'' a
satirical story in the latest issue of the Harvard Lampoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around age 6,'' she wrote, ``I began communicating with the
outside world via my wrists. I spoke to them in surreptitious
fragments, ritually touching my earpiece. ... I spend my time
driving around the President of the United States in a camouflage
golf cart with a bullet-proof attitude,'' wrote Gore. ``I stop at
every second light to run background checks on foreign passers-by,
reload my paint-ball gun and make sure the Pres is strapped in
tight.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Washington Post asked the Harvard senior for a comment,
that newspaper received a formal statement through
 &UR; Tipper Gore &LR; 's press secretary, saying, ``I would never express any
disrespect for the Secret Service, and I regret if anyone
misinterpreted it that way.''
</P>

had been taken, Kristin Gore sent a letter of apology to Director
 &UR; Lewis Merletti &LR; .

``I would have gone in front of the American people and said, `Yes,
I'm having an affair with this woman. My wife is still behind me,
so it's really none of your business, and if this is not OK with
you, fine, get yourself a new president.' ''

   Meanwhile,  &UR; Tom Condit &LR;  suggests Easton Press' ``Collected

ROBERT ISSAASCON, DEALER IN FRENCH AND ENGLISH PAINTINGS, DEAD AT
71 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Isaacson, a former art dealer in Manhattan who helped
revive interest in 19th-century academic French and English
painters, died on Nov. 5 at his home in Manhattan. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said his companion, James Draper.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after opening the Robert Isaacson Gallery in 1960,
Isaacson mounted an exhibition of work by the once-popular English
painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, who specialized in renderings of
ancient Roman life.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first important exhibition dedicated to the artist
since his death in 1912. For the Vassar College Art Gallery in
1967, Isaacson arranged the first exhibition in the United States
devoted to the French painter of antiquarian scenes Jean-Leon
Gerome (1824-1904).
</P>
<P>
   At the New York Cultural Center in 1974, he organized the first
American museum show of work by the French painter William-Adolphe
Bouguereau (1825-1905), who was noted for his ultra-realistic
approach to mythological, historical, genre and religious subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The shows were harbingers of reemerging interest in these and
other academic artists; nowadays their work is owned and exhibited
by major museums.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson was born on Sept. 1, 1927, in St. Louis. He never
finished high school, instead moving to New York at age 16 to study
the harpsichord.
</P>
<P>
   Later, with backing from his mother, he opened his gallery,
where, besides the earlier artists, he showed contemporary realist
painters like George Tooker.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson retired from art dealing in 1970. He wrote occasional
scholarly articles and made significant gifts to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art and other institutions for purchases in the
decorative arts.

EDITORIAL: CHAMPIONING DEMOCRACY IN MALAYSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 18: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's prime minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, is fuming, and
his countrymen should relish every second of his discomfort. Vice
President Al Gore and other foreign leaders have used an economic
summit meeting in Mahathir's capital to call for greater democracy
and economic reform in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Championing the cause of freedom and human rights with a zest
that he has rarely demonstrated before, Gore was especially
effective in defending the cause of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's
former deputy prime minister. Anwar was jailed in September on
dubious charges of corruption and sexual misconduct and is now on
trial. Most Malaysians recognize the case for what it is, namely a
political vendetta against one of Southeast Asia's most articulate
and thoughtful reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's supporters have been roughed up in the streets and
otherwise intimidated. But their movement has endured and become a
force for needed political and economic change. Gore was not the
only visiting foreigner to raise concerns about the Anwar case.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made a point of visiting Wan
Azizah Wan Ismail, Anwar's wife, as did President Joseph Estrada of
the Philippines and Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic protocol calls for speaking positively of one's
hosts. Gore, Ms. Albright and the others were right to be rude.
America's interest in Asia is to encourage human rights and
democratic change, not to flatter embattled autocrats.

TEXAS SERIAL KILLER'S FINAL WORDS: `RELEASE ME' 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Kenneth Allen McDuff, a serial killer
believed to have murdered at least 15 people in Central Texas, was
executed by injection Tuesday night for the 1992 abduction and
slaying of a Waco convenience store clerk, Melissa Ann Northrup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to be released. Release me,'' McDuff said just
before the execution. He nodded to his family and they nodded back.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old killer was pronounced dead at 6:26 p.m., CST,
eight minutes after the lethal solution started flowing through his
veins.
</P>
<P>
   McDuff's niece, Janice McDuff, sobbed throughout the execution
and was comforted by a spiritual adviser. The family left
immediately after the execution, without commenting.
</P>
<P>
   Northrup's mother, Brenda Solomon, also witnessed the execution,
along with the families of other victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have closure in our family. We have a chapter that's
over with,'' she said afterward. ``We start a new chapter
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said her grandchildren, who are now 10 and 12,
understood what was taking place Tuesday, and she said she would
tell them, ``He died easily. He died nothing like your mother
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Moore, whose sister, Regina Moore, was believed to have
been killed by McDuff, though he was never charged with that crime,
said he pitied the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We killed a man. We killed a person,'' Moore said. ``He was a
terrible person. He deserved it, but still, the Bible says it's not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuff, who also was sentenced to die for the 1991 abduction and
murder of an Austin accountant, Colleen Reed, never publicly
admitted his role in the slayings, but in his final weeks of life
decided to show authorities where he had buried his victims. He was
convicted of capital murder in Reed's death although her body had
not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Scott, director of the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice, acknowledged Tuesday that last month, in a highly unusual
move, McDuff was taken off death row and driven to a location near
his hometown of Rosebud to show authorities where Reed had been
buried.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said McDuff spent about six or seven hours, shackled and
in a prison vehicle, helping prison investigators find the body.
They had been unable to locate the remains using a map McDuff had
drawn, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he could not recall another instance in which any
prisoner was taken from his cell to help authorities locate bodies.
He added that TDCJ used extreme security measures, including
providing a chase car, to ensure that McDuff did not escape.
</P>
<P>
   Several other officials familiar with the McDuff case said
Tuesday that the prisoner was the confidential source who provided
Waco officials with maps of where the bodies of Northrup and two
other Waco women _ Moore and Brenda Thompson _ were located last
month. McDuff was never charged in their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Even as McDuff was led to the death chamber at The Walls Unit,
it remained unclear whether he had led authorities to the bodies in
exchange for his nephew's sentence on federal drug charges being
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he did not know if McDuff cut a deal with the U.S.
Attorney's office in Waco to negotiate a reduced sentence for
Michael Wayne Royals, but the Austin America-Statesman reported in
a copyrighted story Tuesday that Royals' sentence had been reduced
from 15 years to 10. Orders signed by U.S. District Judge Walter
Smith on Nov. 10 have been sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Royals' attorney, Jerry Goldstein of San Antonio, declined to
comment on whether his client's sentence had been reduced or
whether there was any link to McDuff's decision to tell authorities
where the women's bodies had been buried.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Glen Castlebury said FBI, prison investigators
and a variety of local law enforcement officials also had queried
McDuff in recent weeks about a number of other unsolved crimes,
including the 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders, in which four
teen-age girls were slain and their bodies burned in a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury and other prison officials, however, said
investigators are confident that McDuff was not involved in the
yogurt shop case or any other slayings around Central Texas about
which he was questioned. He did not go to his grave harboring
secrets of other murder victims, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied that Kenneth Allen McDuff revealed all the
information he knew to authorities,'' Castlebury said. ``We don't
believe he did any other murders.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuff has constantly dropped hints about other murders he may
have committed, but the information he provided could have come
from newspaper reports about the slayings, Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   McDuff, who once bragged to an accomplice that ``killing a woman
is like killing a chicken. They both squawk,'' began his criminal
career as a sixth-grader, terrorizing folks in his hometown of
Rosebud. Starting out as a school bully, he turned to burglary,
robbery and theft before his first murder at age 20.
</P>
<P>
   That was the time he took his .38-caliber pistol _ a gift from
his mother when he was paroled after serving 10 months of a
four-year sentence for a string of burglaries _ and abducted three
teen-agers. He shot the two boys three times before repeatedly
raping the girl and then crushing her neck with a broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   McDuff was sentenced to die for those murders, but six years
later, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when
the U.S. Supreme Court banned capital punishment in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   That court ruling, combined with severe prison crowding and
controversial parole decisions, eventually led to McDuff's parole
in 1989. Within weeks, he was in trouble again for making
terroristic threats. His parole was revoked and then two months
later he was again let loose.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, young women in the Waco area, where McDuff
was attending a technical school, began disappearing, including
Northrup and Reed.
</P>
<P>
   It was McDuff's parole that outraged U.S. District Attorney Bill
Johnston of Waco. Johnston launched a federal investigation of
Texas parole practices, especially the practice of inmates and
their families hiring former parole officials to win the release of
felons.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation eventually led to the indictment of James
Granberry, former chairman of the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles. Granberry pleaded guilty in 1994 to lying during a
investigation of parole consultants, like the one that helped free
McDuff. Although Granberry was never charged with any wrongdoing in
helping McDuff get parole, he admitted he lied to a federal
magistrate about how many inmates he represented when he resigned
from the parole board in 1991.

 &HT;    Austin-to-Monterrey flights grounded
 &HT;    By Debbie Hiott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Business leaders concede there's a certain irony
to it all: In the same week that Fortune magazine named Austin the
best place to do business in North America and Monterrey, Mexico,
the second best in Latin America, the only direct commercial
flights between the two cities halted.
</P>
<P>
   Aerolitoral, one of Mexico's biggest commuter airlines, ended
flights to and from Austin on Oct. 31. They were Austin's only
direct flights to Mexico and its only scheduled international
commercial flights _ service Austin isn't likely to see again
before Austin-Bergstrom International Airport opens in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Aerolitoral pulled out of four other U.S. markets at the same
time it left Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The airline began flying between Austin and Monterrey on Jan.
12, then stopped Jan. 28 because of problems with U.S. Customs
staffing. Those were ironed out and service resumed in May. In
October, the company had only 351 passengers on flights to and from
Austin. Aerolitoral operates 19-passenger turboprop planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seeing increases, but they were not significant
enough,'' said John Jones, international director for Aerolitoral.
He said the company needed to see planes that were 40 percent full
for the twice-a-day flights to Monterrey and was getting only 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   What Aeroliteral's demise in Austin means is that customers will
have to either drive to San Antonio or fly out of Austin to another
U.S. airport that offers international flights.
</P>
<P>
   And it means that the city, which approved a $420,000 federal
inspection station in 1995, will once again be without scheduled
international flights. City leaders had no commitments to use the
station when it was approved, but said business would follow.
Aerolitoral was the only taker.
</P>
<P>
   Austin still has international cargo and non-commercial flights
at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he was baffled by the failure of the Monterrey
service to take flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made sense, but it just didn't happen,'' he said. ``We had
high confidence for that market.''
</P>
<P>
   Aerolitoral did more marketing than it normally does, Jones
said. There were billboards, radio spots and print ads, as well as
a special low fare for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is larger than just one airline's marketing
efforts, said J.R. Gonzales, chairman-elect of the Texas
Association of Mexican-American Chambers of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin has yet to make the connection to Mexico,'' Gonzales
said. ``Austin has really not marketed itself well to Mexico.''
Gonzales, who owns a public relations and marketing company, met
with Aerolitoral shortly before service was halted to discuss
bigger promotions, but he said it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback, airport officials say they're not ready to
take the ``international'' out of Austin-Bergstrom International
Airport. An international charter company, Adventure Tours USA of
Dallas, has said it will offer non-stop, twice-weekly charter trips
from the new airport to Cancun, Mexico, after the new airport
opens.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Griffith, executive director of the aviation department,
said he expects more will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very surprised if we didn't get some more
international flights when the new airport opens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

Texas.

 &HT;    Judge orders evidence to be turned over
 &HT;    By Pat Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ Attorneys for Lisa Costello, a former Jupiter
woman charged in the 1996 kidnapping and murder of New Jersey bus
company owner Frank Black, must provide prosecutors with evidence
they uncovered while investigating her defense, a judge ruled
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Judge James Alderman, a former chief justice of the
Florida Supreme Court, required Costello's attorneys to name their
witnesses and share evidence they discovered with the prosecutors
who will try to convict her in a trial, tentatively set for April
12.
</P>
<P>
   Costello's attorney, Richard Kibbey, argued his client should
not be forced to share her evidence because she has not asked
prosecutors to share their evidence with her. He said Costello may
appeal Alderman's order, while waiting for a ruling in a similar
case to be argued before the Florida Supreme Court next month.
</P>
<P>
   Kibbey acknowledged that the attorney for Costello's boyfriend,
Alan Mackerley, had given him witnesses' statements and evidence
prosecutors used to convict Mackerley of murdering Black in his
trial earlier this year. Mackerley was sentenced in March to life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Black, 59, disappeared in February 1996 after boarding a jet
from New Jersey to West Palm Beach. Prosecutors claim Costello used
an assumed name while luring Black to Florida under the guise of
conducting a business deal. They believe she met him at the airport
and led him to Mackerley's home, where Mackerley killed him and
later dumped his body from his speed boat into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Kibbey accused prosecutors of vindictively waiting two years to
charge Costello, 35, because she rejected their offers of limited
immunity and spent nearly 20 months jailed on a contempt charge for
refusing to tell them what she knew about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mackerley's attorney, who acknowledged before jurors that
Black was dead, Kibbey said he will not concede Black's death as a
fact in Costello's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kibbey asked Alderman to prohibit any mention of the
incriminating statements Mackerley made to his best friend and
former bus company owner, Bill Anderson, during Costello's trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed to hear testimony in January before deciding
whether Anderson could testify that Mackerley admitted killing
Black and throwing him from his boat.
</P>
<P>
   Kibbey alluded Tuesday that another New Jersey bus business
rival, Dennis Hammell, was a more likely suspect in kidnapping and
murdering Black. Hammell told investigators he was good friends
with Mackerley and he thought Black was greedy and was illegally
operating his bus business.

 &HT;    Grousing already begun in Florida's GOP circles
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ After winning both the Florida Governor's
Mansion and the legislature for the first time this century,
Republican unity lasted just long enough for Rep. Tom Feeney,
R-Oviedo, to get off a quip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like mosquitoes at a nudist colony, we don't know where to
start,'' Feeney said at the legislature's organizing session
Tuesday. House leaders wasted little time in discussing tax cuts
for business interests that supported their party, such as $109
million for restaurants that want to lose a beverage tax.
</P>
<P>
   And then Senate President Toni Jennings swatted down the idea
that all GOP leaders will think and act alike in Florida's Pax
Republicana.
</P>
<P>
   She proposed a $5,000 limit on ``soft money'' contributions that
corporations can give to political parties _ an idea proposed by a
Democratic legislator last year and promptly buried by the GOP
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can end the era when campaigns are fueled by unlimited
contributions to the political parties, the so-called soft money,''
the Orlando Republican said. ``The bad news is we'll be criticized,
sabotaged and attacked by some of the biggest interests in the
state, perhaps even by our own parties. And my party _ the majority
party _ has the most to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Newly elected House Speaker John Thrasher, while saying he would
be open to her initiative, later made clear his view: ``I still
don't think limiting contributions is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparently accidental seating at a news conference later in
the day with Jennings, Thrasher and Gov.-elect Jeb Bush made its
own quiet political statement: Jennings sat to Bush's left,
Thrasher to his right.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked about the soft-money proposals. Jennings jumped
in to answer for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask him that,'' she said, smiling. ``I haven't had time
to explain it to him yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``I didn't hear the full extent of it,'' adding he
would want to study the issue of campaign reform more broadly
before saying more.
</P>
<P>
   It was soft money that fueled much of Bush's campaign and helped
him beat Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious conflicts, leading Republicans put on a
united face. ``This is a team to be reckoned with,'' said Jennings,
as she posed with Bush and Thrasher for their first-ever
post-election photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always dreamed of the day this would happen. Very few of
us thought it would ever happen,'' said House budget chief Rep. Jim
King, R-Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ascension of the Republicans' first speaker this
century in 1996 _ with a behind-the-scenes power struggle to find
an alternate GOP leader to run a coalition House _ Thrasher was
elected to the top post without intrigue. Indeed, nine Democrats,
including several black members, joined the 73 Republicans to vote
support Thrasher over Democratic leader Les Miller.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Jennings assumed an unprecedented second term as
president, making her the most experienced leader in the GOP
troika. She named Sen. John McKay, R-Bradenton, who lost the budget
chairman's job two years ago during a bitter divorce, as rules
chairman. Locke Burt of Ormond Beach became budget chairman. Sen.
Al Gutman, R-Miami, under indictment for Medicare fraud, was not
given a chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of legislators from Palm Beach County and the
Treasure Coast found positions of power. Sen. William G. ``Doc''
Myers, R-Hobe Sound, assumed the post of president pro tempore.
</P>
<P>
   Myers' duties won't simply be ceremonial, though _ he will also
be in charge of a committee approving Bush's appointments. Sen. Jim
Scott, R-Fort Lauderdale with part of his district in Palm Beach
County, will head chair the powerful banking and insurance
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats including Tom Rossin of West Palm Beach and Ron Klein
of Boca Raton were given less-prestigious assignments heading the
joint legislative auditing and intergovernmental relations
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' proposal to limit soft-money contributions drew
applause from state Democratic party Chairman Mitch Ceasar, though
he was not holding his breath until it passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fine idea,'' Ceasar said. ``I just hope the
special interests in the Republican Party don't torpedo it.''

HACKETT'S WORDS SEEM WELL-PLANNED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During USC's first team meeting this week, coach
Paul Hackett admonished his players not to make any controversial
remarks about crosstown rival UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ironic gesture, considering Hackett had already
created the biggest controversy of the season between the two
schools.
</P>
<P>
   His comments last month that Oregon was the best team in the
Pacific-10 Conference _ just three days after the Ducks lost to
UCLA _ are still ringing in the Bruins' ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the team to beat,'' Hackett said of the Ducks.
``They don't turn the ball over against UCLA, they win the game
handily.''
</P>
<P>
   In the conventional analysis that followed, the incident was
portrayed as example No. 1 of how a coach puts his foot in his
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But was it?
</P>
<P>
   Could Hackett have shrewdly been sending a shot across the
Bruins' bow to distract them, weeks before the teams even met? Was
he laying the groundwork to turn attention away from USC's
seven-year losing streak? Was he trying to get people to focus on
him and not his young team during the most hectic week of their
season?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who deals with Hackett knows he's too organized and
detailed to ever make a careless remark. He may not have
anticipated that UCLA coach Bob Toledo would become a one-man rapid
response team to a comment made four weeks before the USC-UCLA
game, but he was hardly being naive either.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it all seems part of a carefully planned strategy.
Consider some of Hackett's follow-up remarks regarding the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   _ On watching UCLA's game films: ``You look at the film and you
can't see the numbers because of those beautiful baby blue
uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On UCLA's seven-game winning streak: ``That's been their claim
to fame the last seven years. They haven't been in the Rose Bowl
year in and year out. It's still incomprehensible to me that we
lost seven straight years.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On facing UCLA this Saturday: ``They've got a lot at stake.
We're just crawling ourselves up the ladder and we've got a
quarterback in his third start.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hackett has proved anything in his first season as USC head
coach, it's that he is a master at psychological warfare. Consider
how he was able to keep the media and fans in the dark the week of
the Washington game, when he decided to have Carson Palmer replace
Mike Van Raaphorst at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It's a talent that apparently comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey I lie sometimes, I thought I'd let you guys know that,''
Hackett said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But even as cunning as Hackett is, he never thought his Oregon
comment would goad Toledo as much as it has. He should have,
considering Toledo's feud with Cal receiver Dameane Douglas this
season, which prompted Toledo to say ``My daughter could catch 10
passes for 70 yards,'' mocking Douglas' stats after the receiver
said UCLA should really be ranked 27th in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   To which Douglas responded with: ``If his daughter can run those
routes, then why can't his players cover them?''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett would never let the banter get that acrimonious. It's
not subtle enough.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he and Toledo have been friends, though they are not
particularly close today. Toledo's wife, Elaine, babysat Hackett's
sons when the two families lived one block apart in Diamond Bar in
the late 1970s. And both were USC assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a close relationship since then, but certainly
one where we talk from time to time,'' Hackett said, who has
consulted Toledo about some of his players' NFL prospects the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
   With Hackett as the Trojans' minister of information, it may not
be necessary for the players to make any comments. But not every
Trojan has conformed to the vow of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not stand UCLA's uniform,'' Chris Claiborne said.
``Those uniforms are just ugly. That's what turned me off (from
going there).''
</P>
<P>
   Why did he hate the uniforms so much?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those colors? You have to ask,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful Hackett will chastise his Butkus Award finalist
for such a remark. Besides, it's not like Claiborne's predicting a
victory. That honor goes to UCLA linebacker Brandon Ayanbadejo who
said his team was ``going to win out,'' after the Bruins' victory
over Washington last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anything can be put on the bulletin board to
affect this rivalry,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, you can bet Hackett has already circulated
that quote throughout the USC locker room.

FOR GLAVINE, SECOND CY YOUNG IS ICING ON THE CAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After recently being married for a second time, Tom Glavine
considers the most important thing in his life his new bride.
</P>
<P>
   But the Atlanta Braves' star lefthander was happily diverted
from his No. 1 priority Tuesday morning when he answered the phone
at his Alpharetta, Ga., home and learned that for the second time
in his career, he had won the National League Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, the winningest lefthander of the '90s (171 victories)
and a native of Billerica, outpointed reliever Trevor Hoffman of
the San Diego Padres, 99-88 _ though Hoffman received more
first-place votes, 13-11 _ in balloting by 32 members of the
Baseball Writers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, 32, is the sixth Brave in eight years to win the award,
joining Greg Maddux, who has has won four times (one with the
Cubs), and John Smoltz, who won in 1996. Glavine (20-6), who also
won in 1991, became the first Cy Young winner not to receive the
most first-place votes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite posting a 2.47 earned run average and being the only NL
pitcher to win 20 games, Glavine was left off three ballots.
Hoffman saved 53 games in 54 chances, but his loss in the voting
can be attributed to the support given to his teammate Kevin Brown,
who was third with eight firsts and 76 points.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to 1991, when Glavine celebrated for a month, his
reaction was subdued, as the Braves had another disappointment in
the playoffs. They were eliminated by the Padres in six games in
the NL Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine's family came to Georgia over the weekend for his
wedding. The award becomes icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have the wedding first,'' said Glavine. ``That
way, no matter what happened with this award, I'd be happy. It's a
nice belated wedding present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, I didn't know how it was going to go. Trevor
and Kevin had great years. Maddux and Smoltz did, too. It just goes
to show you there were a lot of guys who had great years and
deserved consideration. Fortunately, it was the number of votes,
and not just those for first place, that add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine's father, Fred, said from Billerica that the family
thoughts were on the wedding, not the Cy Young, until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he deserved it,'' said Fred, ``but I knew it would be
close. He had a good year. But there was so much talk about Trevor
Hoffman. It worked out well. It's a treat for the family. As for a
celebration, I think we'll stay quiet this time. My wife is off
shopping and probably doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine thought the Cy Young had been sewn up in the first half
by Maddux, who was leading the majors with a 12-2 record and 1.54
ERA. But Maddux struggled down the stretch, going 6-7 with an
uncharacteristic 3.18 ERA. That he still finished with the league's
lowest ERA, 2.22, and won 18 games wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in August, I didn't think anybody would catch him, and I
said it at the time,'' said Glavine. ``All I wanted to do was to
continue to pitch well and get myself into contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that just shows a lot of things can happen over a
short period of time. I think that's why none of us try to get
caught up in the moment. The fact that Greg didn't pitch as well in
the latter part of the season opened up an opportunity for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine makes his own opportunities, said pitching coach Leo
Mazzone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom's been the best lefthander in the National League since
1991, and this just confirms it,'' said Mazzone. ``The thing you
like the most is that he's Mr. Consistency. He never gives in to
the strike zone. He refuses to bring the ball over the heart of the
plate to accommodate a hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's throwing harder in the last few years than he did in the
middle 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the award was vindication for Glavine in a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a burning desire to win it again, just to prove the
first time wasn't a fluke,'' he said. ``That part has been
proven.''

GIULIANI RELEASES MILLIONS TO END STANDOFF WITH COUNCIL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Giuliani administration agreed Tuesday to release
most of the $150 million that it had withheld from nonprofit groups
since July, completing a budget deal with the City Council that
also eliminates a 12.5 percent surcharge on the personal income tax
of New York City residents.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise came after a five-month standoff between Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who had pushed
for both the release of the money for the nonprofit groups and the
elimination of the surcharge. Although Giuliani had initially
opposed eliminating the surcharge, he said Tuesday that he had
changed his mind months ago.
</P>
<P>
   For its part of the deal, the council agreed to save $165
million it had earmarked for debt reduction, putting the money into
a reserve fund instead, as the mayor had insisted. It also agreed
to allot $15 million for renovations to the Museum of Modern Art,
something else Giuliani had wanted, but that the council cut from
the budget in the spring. The council also agreed to phase in
weekly recycling throughout the city during two years, instead of
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more question about the funding of the budget,'' a
beatific Vallone said at a Tuesday afternoon news conference. ``And
hopefully, we will be able to propel the city into the next century
not only in good fiscal shape, but with the quality-of-life items
that must be part of the greatest city in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vallone said the Giuliani administration had agreed to
release all but $20 million of the $150 million that the council
approved in June as part of the $34 billion city budget. The
council had earmarked the money for public schools, nonprofit
agencies and community groups, but Giuliani refused to spend it,
saying it was nothing but pork-barrel spending meant to improve
Vallone's chances in the race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Vallone accused the mayor of withholding
the money because the speaker opposed his plan to use tax money to
build a new Yankee Stadium in Manhattan. Although both men insisted
the battle was more about money than politics, it ended the day
after Vallone lost the governor's race, when they met for the first
time in months and agreed to fashion a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone and his staff appeared more excited about the budget
agreement than did Giuliani, who gruffly said he was releasing the
money only because the council had agreed to cuts in other areas.
In particular, Giuliani said he was happy that the council was
shifting $165 million from debt reduction into the reserve fund,
which will now have a total of $465 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will achieve the overall objective of keeping spending way
below the rate of inflation,'' Giuliani said of the compromise,
``which is the way that any executive has to discipline a
legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he had stopped resisting the elimination of the
income tax surcharge because it would expire on Dec. 31, and the
city could not continue it without the State state Legislature's
approval. He said the city would have to make budget cuts during
the next few years to make up for the loss of the 12.5 percent
surcharge, which brings the city $550 million a year in tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objection to the tax cut was not doing the tax cut,''
Giuliani said in a news conference. ``It was the order in which it
was done. First you should reduce the spending, then you cut the
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   For a married couple with two children and annual earnings of
$50,000, the elimination of the surcharge will save about $123 a
year. A single person earning $50,000 will save almost twice that
amount, and a single parent with two children and earnings of
$50,000 will save $177.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money that Giuliani had been withholding during his
standoff with Vallone will pay for social and cultural programs,
including foster-care and day-care programs, meals delivered at
home and other programs for the elderly, library programs, and
alternatives to jail. About $8 million will be used for weekly
recycling pickups by the city, which will be phased into every
sanitation district over 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk in City Hall about saving money through the
compromise, the city budget is actually increasing by about $600
million _ from $34.1 billion to $34.7 billion _ to absorb
unforeseen costs like police overtime and a health insurance rate
increase for city workers, aides to Vallone said. But unanticipated
tax revenues and state and federal funds will cover most of the
added costs, they said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The nonprofit groups that had been caught up in the budget fight
had complained bitterly, saying the loss of revenue had affected
services for children, the elderly and the poor. Most never had to
cut services, but they were not able to meet an increasing demand
for their programs. Some took out loans, while others sought out
private and state grants.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the budget compromise, the city's allocation to the
groups was cut by a total of $20 million. But officials of several
nonprofit groups said that their organizations could endure the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   For the Legal Aid Society, it means receiving only half of the
extra $10 million that the City Council had allotted for the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy to get just half of it, because half the year is
already gone,'' said Danny Greenberg, president of the Legal Aid
Society. ``With this money we will be able to hire more lawyers and
other staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the budget battle, the mayor has pointed to the
recent uncertainty on Wall Street and warned that the city could
soon face serious financial problems. But Vallone cheerfully
predicted Tuesday that the next budget process _ which gets under
way in January _ would be easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning the new budget sequence, which begins just
two months from now, in very good shape,'' he said. ``The city is
as secure financially as it could possibly be.''

DEATH RATE DROPS; RISE IN INFANT FATALITIES PUZZLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Amid a generally brightening picture of declining
Massachusetts death rates from all major causes, state public
health officials are puzzling over an increase in the number of
infant deaths in the latest mortality data _ the first such upturn
in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   There were 425 infant deaths in 1997, 22 more than in the
previous year, according to a yearly report on Massachusetts
mortality that state health officials plan to release next week.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the increase in infant deaths, the 1997 mortality
statistics continue a remarkable trend of declining death rates
overall and a decline in leading causes of death, from heart
disease (down 17 percent since 1990) to homicides (down 48
percent).
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to say whether the increase in infant deaths
represents a turnaround in the Commonwealth's infant mortality
rate, one of the nation's lowest. State officials do not yet know
precisely how many live births occurred in Massachusetts in 1997, a
statistic that is necessary to calculate an infant mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, public health officials said they are concerned
about the possible reasons for the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made us sit up and say: What is this? Where are these
deaths? What is this related to?'' said Deborah Klein Walker,
assistant state health commissioner for family and community
health. ``We're striving for no increases in infant deaths and a
continual improvement in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't point to any obvious area where there's some huge gap
we're not trying to address,'' added state health commissioner
Howard Koh. ``I still feel we will be proud of our progress in
reducing infant mortality. But every infant death is a tragedy. We
need to keep pushing on that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent clue to the unexpected increase, Koh and other
officials said, is that 1997 saw a 48 percent jump in babies born
weighing under 500 grams, from 94 in 1996 to 139 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts also had a 10 percent increase in multiple births
in 1997, which is associated with low birthweight and prematurity.
This, in turn, could be related to an unusually high number of
older mothers in Massachusetts, which in 1996 became the first
state in the nation to record more than half of its births among
women over age 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``With older women you have more multiple births and a greater
likelihood of low birthweight,'' Klein Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of fertility drugs among older mothers also increases
the chances of multiple births, prematurity, and low birthweight,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the real reason for the unexplained upturn in infant deaths
may be simply that more Massachusetts hospitals are reporting tiny
preemies who expire soon after birth as ``live births'' and infant
deaths, officials said. In 1996, health department spokesman Mark
Leccese said, state officials sent a letter ``reminding hospitals
strongly that a `live birth' is any birth in which the infant, no
matter at what stage of gestation, shows any vital signs.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``may have increased the number of hospitals reporting
exceptionally low-birthweight infants,'' Leccese said. A more
complete analysis of infant mortality is expected in January.
</P>
<P>
   In October, health officials first noticed the increase in
infant deaths. As word percolated through the public health
community that infant deaths were higher in 1997, a rumor received
widespread circulation that the Cellucci administration pressured
health officials not to let the information out prior to the
gubernatorial election Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe requested the mortality data _ through the state
Freedom of Information Act _ prior to the election, but did not
receive it until after Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Koh and other officials denied they had been pressured to
suppress the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people to say this was slow or delayed is incorrect,'' Koh
said last night. ``This was my call as a public health person. The
worst thing we can do is to release absolute numbers without rates
and not have a way to cogently explain the numbers in a way that is
helpful to the public health.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein Walker said any suggestion of holding off public release
of the infant mortality numbers prior to the election is ``not true
from anything I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Infant deaths aside, the 1997 mortality report, scheduled for
presentation next Tuesday to the state Public Health Council,
contains almost exclusively good news about Massachusetts'
improving state of health. One other exception, Koh said, is the
stubborn disparity between black and white death rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to summarize the report in one line, I'd say
Massachusetts is aging gracefully, as evidenced by continuing
declines in death rates for major chronic diseases,'' said Bruce B.
Cohen, the health department's director of research and
epidemiology. ``Our age-adjusted death rates are lower than the
nation's as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted that the Commonwealth's AIDS mortality rate is 45
percent below the nation's, deaths from injuries are 49 percent
lower than the US rate, stroke mortality is 22 percent lower, heart
disease death rates are 12 percent lower, and overall deaths are 10
percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   The state's cancer death rate is 3 percent higher than the
nation's, but Cohen said it is declining.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year the state has published death rates for
Asian ethnics. Like Hispanics, those of Asian descent have striking
low mortality rates overall and from major killers such as heart
disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this is due to the fact that Asian and Hispanic
populations tend to be far younger as a whole, a trait that cannot
be entirely corrected by statistical age-adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, to the extent that minority populations contain
significant numbers of immigrants, this also leads to lower death
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortality rates will reflect immigrants' death rates, and sick
folks don't immigrate,'' said Alec Walker, chairman of epidemiology
at the Harvard School of Public Health. ``Usually it takes a
generation or two for immigrant health patterns to equal the
patterns of people who have been long-term US residents because of
changes in diet and lifestyle.''

PALMEIRO TO GET ORIOLES' PITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Free agent first baseman Rafael Palmeiro, who has an
offer from the Red Sox, plans to meet Wednesday with Frank Wren,
the Baltimore Orioles' new general manager, and team owner Peter
Angelos, who are intent on persuading Palmeiro to remain with the
team for whom he has played the last five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles are believed to have offered Palmeiro a four-year
deal in the $32 million range, which is far short of the five-year,
$50 million deal he said last summer he intended to seek.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmeiro may have overestimated the market for his services.
The Texas Rangers, for whom he played five years, have not entered
the bidding, which leaves Palmeiro a choice between the Orioles and
Red Sox. There have been reports that the Sox have offered more
money to the 34-year-old lefthanded hitter who last season hit a
career-high 43 home runs while driving in 121 runs, but a Boston
official Tuesday said he thought Palmeiro would remain with the
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as of last evening, the Red Sox had not yet made an
offer to their No. 1 target, left fielder Albert Belle, who met
Monday with Yankees GM Brian Cashman. Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner told reporters Tuesday in New York he was awaiting a
recommendation from Cashman, manager Joe Torre, and other advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to others to tell me if they're interested,''
Steinbrenner said after a ceremony to open a Yankees World Series
exhibit in the Tweed Court House next to City Hall. ``It's what my
GM wants and my manager wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said the meeting with Belle in Arizona went well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I ever had a chance to meet with him,''
Cashman said. ``Seems like a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner would not say whether the team had made an offer,
but at the GMs' meeting last week in Florida, it was widely known
that the Yankees had a strong interest in Belle.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Red Sox are the only teams interested in Belle,
who has until Dec. 2 to decide whether to stay with his present
team, the White Sox. He has said he wants a deal by Thanksgiving,
and Tuesday night it did not appear one would be done by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, the Red Sox also are expected to meet
with free agent center fielder Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox Tuesday lost top reserve Mike Benjamin, who signed a
$1.4 million, two-year contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates, who
promised him a chance to start at second base. That's a chance he
wouldn't have gotten next season for Boston, even though Benjamin
filled in admirably at second and shortstop in the wake of injuries
to Jeff Frye, Mark Lemke, and Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing time has a lot to do with it,'' Benjamin said. ``I've
been primarily a utility infielder and I'd like the chance to be an
everyday player. I've always wondered what I could do in that
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Another day passed without Mo Vaughn accepting a six-year, $72
million proposal from the Anaheim Angels. Vaughn's agents are
talking to at least two other clubs, although the Orioles, who once
seemed a likely contender for the first baseman, say his price tag
is too high and they're not in the running.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Dodgers, who have to clear out salary in order
to sign Vaughn, and perhaps the Yankees, who can never be counted
out when a Boston superstar is on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The American League Most Valuable Player Award is to be
announced Wednesday. Garciaparra was in California, a team
spokesman said, after playing in Japan on a tour sponsored by Major
League Baseball. Like Pedro Martinez, who finished second to Roger
Clemens in the AL Cy Young Award voting, Garciaparra is expected to
finish runner-up to Texas's Juan Gonzalez, though the vote probably
will be much closer than it was for the Cy Young, which Clemens won
unanimously.

SPORTS COLUMN: ALASKAN COULD JOIN ST. JOHN'S, DEPENDING ON THE
WIND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Md., N.Y., N.J., N.C.)   (jw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is difficult to imagine that Carlos Boozer Jr.
will reject a scholarship to distinguished, buttoned-down Duke for
one to an open-collar commuter school like St. John's, but anyone
who has ridden the Alaska Marine Highway would know why he might.
For a reasonable fare, Boozer would have the luxury of moving from
Queens to midtown, Alumni Hall to Madison Square Garden, on an
express subway train.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little more complicated than that in his hometown of
Juneau, Alaska. Several years ago, my wife and I traveled to that
beautiful state capital on an oversized ferry with few frills that
originates north of Seattle. Three days, three nights, an open-air
ecological retreat through the narrow passages of the sparsely
populated archipelago that forms the long Alaskan panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   The views were breathtaking, the whales stunning, the bald
eagles inspiring. It also happened to be the middle of August, with
two pennant races raging in New York and from no point on the boat
could a radio signal or a baseball score be tracked. Aliens from
space could brawl on the Jerry Springer show, I tell you, and there
would be no word of it on the Alaska Marine Highway until the first
stop, Ketchikan, where I seem to recall a USA Today box
miraculously perched on the dock.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a setting to expect a bunch of gangly, sleepy-eyed
kids with equipment bags slung over their shoulders, in the middle
of a basketball road trip. Once a season, though, Carlos Boozer's
team, Juneau-Douglas High School, boards the ferry in Ketchikan on
a Sunday morning, about 9 o'clock. Eighteen hours later, give or
take a couple depending on the wind, the players roll up their
sleeping bags, back home in Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually get in about four or five in the morning,'' George
Houston, the Juneau-Douglas coach, said by telephone. ``Then the
kids go straight to school.''
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, Houston has been assistant or head coach in
Juneau, a basketball-mad town. Never has he had a Division I
recruit close to being as good as the 6-foot-9-inch Boozer, the son
of a former University of Maryland player with whom Houston has won
the last two state titles. By last season, the most famous
fast-talking basketball salesmen from what Houston calls ``TV
land'' were making their way into Juneau from the Lower 48. They
all had respectful things to say about the gymnasium and the crowd,
typically a few thousand strong. ``We are the only game in town,''
Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, far more than attracting fans, is booking
opponents. As Boozer said when he visited St. John's with his
parents this week, ``For games, it is isolated.'' So much so that
the 1,700-student Juneau-Douglas school has just two other regional
opponents, both smaller. Any other schools within sailing distance
are so diminutive that the sixth man could be a bear.
</P>
<P>
   So Houston said he plays Ketchikan and Sitka, a beautiful old
Russian port town, in two-game series, home and away, plus
tournaments in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Between games and
schoolwork, there are player fund-raising chores. Those upstate
games demand air expense, and a budget of about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most college coaches will sit in a recruit's living room and
bluster about the exotic travel his team does, perhaps not the
wisest pitch for a kid whose neighborhood rival can only be reached
by air and sea. ``It's sort of like the NBA right there,'' said
Boozer's father, Carlos Sr., of his son's basketball itinerary,
while watching St. John's dismantle North Carolina-Asheville Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   For his sake, I hope Mike Jarvis, the new Red Storm coach,
slipped young Boozer a map of the Big East Conference, which is
still, with some exceptions, accessible by Amtrak. From Boston to
Hartford to East Rutherford to Philadelphia to Washington, a nap
and a newspaper is all it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived in Juneau since his father, a computer analyst,
moved the family when he was 8, Boozer was bound to be excited by
bumping into people in a teeming city like New York. He got Martina
Hingis' autograph at the Garden Monday morning. Jayson Williams
just happened to show up at Alumni Hall that night. ``Very
business-like and powerful,'' Boozer called New York. ``A lot of
opportunities arise when you live uptown.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't exactly be living uptown, or downtown, but he would
get to play many home games right in the heart of the Apple. Then
he could take the escalator downstairs, board a New Jersey Transit
train, visit his sister, who is a student at Princeton. One hour by
train, give or take a few minutes, depending on the wind. &QL;

HUMAN-COW HYBRID CELLS ARE TOPIC OF ETHICS PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the request of President Clinton, the ethical implications of
creating hybrid human-cow cells were discussed by the National
Bioethics Advisory Commission at its meeting Tuesday in Miami, but
at least in the public portion of their discussion, none of the
commissioners voiced concern about the creation of the hybrid
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested the discussion last week in a letter to the
commission's chairman, Dr. Harold Shapiro of Princeton University.
Clinton said he was ``deeply troubled'' by news that Advanced Cell
Technology, a small biotechnology company in Worcester, Mass., had
created the hybrid cells. The company proposes to use the technique
to take any body cell from a patient, return it to its embryonic
form and use it to grow any of a variety of body tissues for
possible transplant back into the patient.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of the technique is that the patient would receive
tissues made from his own cells. Another is that no cells would be
taken from human embryos or fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that scientists had been fusing together cells of
different origin for years, Dr. David Cox of Stanford University, a
member of the commission, said, ``We should tell the president
there is nothing new in cells fused from different eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid cow-human cells consist of the nucleus of a human
cell inserted into a cow egg whose own nucleus has been removed.
Factors in the cow egg are thought to make the human cell nucleus
revert to its embryonic form. Because the proteins of a cell turn
over rapidly, the cow proteins are expected to be rapidly replaced
by human proteins. The mitochondria of the cell, however, are
likely to remain cowlike, giving rise at least initially to cells
that are not wholly human.
</P>
<P>
   An outside expert who spoke to the commission by telephone,
Ralph Brinster, a physiologist at the University of Pennsylvania,
said of the cow-human hybrid cell, ``Most scientists would not
regard it as a chimera.'' Chimeras are animals made from the cells
of two different individuals by injecting the embryonic cells of
one into the embryo of another.
</P>
<P>
   Making human chimeras is widely regarded as unethical.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael West, president of Advanced Cell Technology,
attended the commission's meeting and was invited speak. In
response to questions, he said he did not believe the cells formed
in his procedure, called embryonic stem cells, were capable of
forming a fetus if transferred to a uterus, something he said he
had no intention of doing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would prevent the technique from being misused,
such as in cloning a person, he suggested that the cloning of
humans should be made a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The commission members said they would draft a reply to Clinton.

PHILLIPS RETURNS TO WORK; METS MAKE OFFER TO SURHOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the day that Steve Phillips returned to work as
general manager of the Mets after an eight-day leave of absence,
one of Phillips' assistants, Jim Duquette, went to work on trying
to plug one of the team's main holes.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, Duquette offered Gregg Clifton, the
agent for B.J. Surhoff, a three-year deal for the 34-year-old
outfielder. Clifton did not reveal the amount of the offer, but it
was believed to be for $12.75 million _ or about the same offer
Surhoff has been made by the Baltimore Orioles, for whom he hit
.279 with 22 homers and 92 runs batted in last season.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters for both the Mets and Orioles, the
Pittsburgh Pirates have jumped into the bidding for Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received a four-year proposition from Pittsburgh for a
substantial amount,'' said Clifton, who would not reveal the offer.
But it was believed to be for a little under $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The low-budget Pirates do not usually shop around offering that
kind of money. But at least one person involved with major league
baseball reasoned Tuesday that with a new stadium opening in
Pittsburgh in 2000, the Pirates might be trying to show fans that
they are serious about competing, while trying to sell some
corporate suites.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton, who works for Woolf Associates, said he had told the
Mets of the Pirates' offer for Surhoff, a 12-year veteran who was
born in the Bronx, went to high school in Rye, N.Y., and apparently
remains interested in playing for the Mets. The feeling was that he
would stay with the Orioles if Baltimore's and New York's offers
were the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the Mets' offer,'' said Clifton, who
characterized Surhoff as being ``very excited about the Pirates'
four-year proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the Mets sign Surhoff, he would likely play left field in
an outfield with Brian McRae in center and the newly reacquired
Bobby Bonilla in right. Should the Mets lose out on Surhoff, they
might be in trouble in their search for another corner outfielder.
Brian Jordan is scheduled to visit Shea Stadium Thursday morning.
But Jordan, a Cardinal since 1992, has already met with the Braves,
will meet with the Yankees this morning and with the Orioles
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, Braves and Orioles all could probably outbid the
Mets for Jordan, who mainly plays right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our meeting with the Braves was extremely productive,''
Jordan's agent, Jim Turner, said Tuesday. ``We told them we'd like
to consummate a deal by Thanksgiving. And they're all for it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mets' other needs _ a second or third baseman and/or
a leadoff hitter _ John Boggs, the agent for Robin Ventura, is
hoping he hears from the Mets soon. Ventura, a third baseman, has
apparently narrowed his list to five core teams: the Indians, the
Mets, the Red Sox, the Cardinals and the Padres. But the Mets would
probably have to ante up four or five years in excess of $8 million
a season to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed-hitting Ventura would be a formidable presence
batting behind the right-handed Mike Piazza and in front of the
switch-hitting Bonilla in the Mets' order.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could also become interested in the free-agent second
basemen Roberto Alomar (who apparently has only received an offer
from the Indians) or Delino DeShields (who could solve the Mets'
leadoff problems).
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is up to Phillips _ although the Mets
apparently are still operating as a negotiating team (Duquette is
the team's director of player personnel) until Phillips settles
back into his everyday role. Thursday, Phillips spent a good part
of his time in meetings at Shea, which included the co-owner Fred
Wilpon and the team's vice president, David Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said that a threatened sexual harassment lawsuit against
the Mets and Phillips still had not been filed. Phillips did not
return phone calls Thursday. But Howard said the Mets, with
Phillips back, were ``getting our game plan together. We're ready
to go. In fact, we're going as we speak.''

 HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP TOM DeLAY: SAVVY SURVIVOR OF GOP COUPS  
 (bl)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The phone calls rattled Rep. Tom DeLay's Texas home
for days, a jangling reminder of the post-election chaos he now
faced as House majority whip and its third-ranking Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the count of dead or wounded Republican leaders
increased a notch. But, as this month's dial-a-putsch came to a
close, DeLay, one of President Clinton's severest critics, remained
the only one of the top leadership left standing, unchallenged and
more powerful than before. Somehow, the buckshot spray had missed
him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a feat that seemed especially striking to outsiders.
DeLay is, after all, the man who crafted a House ``war room'' to
impeach Clinton, feels tenderness toward the reviled pesticide DDT
and is known for twisting the arms of lobbyists on K Street.
</P>
<P>
   But, for most House Republicans, even a few who despise his
politics and sometimes his manner, DeLay's performance as whip has
been first rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does his job, and he does it exceptionally well,'' said
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate Republican from New York, who
has clashed ideologically with the unflinchingly conservative
DeLay. ``The main skill to bring to that job is to be able to count
and to be able to look someone in the eye and determine whether or
not that somebody is being truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while Republicans lamented the recent election defeats,
this slimmer majority practically guaranteed DeLay's job security.
With Republicans holding only a six-vote margin, the task of
counting votes and prodding nervous members to stay the party line
has taken on superhero proportions in the minds of many DeLay
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Few Republicans, even those moderates who are extremely critical
of DeLay's handling of the impeachment issue, proved willing to
gamble away DeLay's undisputed skills as a whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody probably wants the job,'' joked Rep. Matt Salmon,
R-Ariz., a conservative who said Delay had a ``sixth sense'' for
counting votes.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, 51, safeguarded his survival in those tumultuous
post-election days by doing what he does best as a whip: He
listened to his colleagues, counted the votes, watched Speaker Newt
Gingrich step down. Then he made his move.
</P>
<P>
   An astute politician, DeLay backed the emerging successor, Rep.
Robert Livingston, R-La., bringing with him the cadre of 65 whips
in his organization. The alliance clinched the deal for Livingston,
chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and, in so doing,
conferred greater power on DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a candidate for leadership, you want him in your
camp,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, another New York moderate.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, DeLay has not taken a position in the
three-way race for majority leader, the post held by a fellow
Texan, Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   Elfish and steely eyed, DeLay, a onetime executive of a pest
exterminating company in Sugar Land and Texas statehouse
politician, has created a reputation as a respected and feared
adversary, both in Congress and in the world of well-heeled
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Allies describe him as generous and upfront, a family man with a
wife and daughter, a ``father confessor'' who maintains an open
door for House members who want to chat about legislation or who
need assurances that they will not suffer for their vote. While
DeLay does not shrink from pushing his own agenda at times, even if
it means twisting some arms, he is seldom sneaky in his approach,
members say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's honest,'' said Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif. ``And he is
a member's member.''
</P>
<P>
   Late at night, DeLay transforms his suite of offices into
grazing central, laden with buckets of fried chicken or platters of
barbecue beef to keep torch-burning members happy and comfortable.
And he makes it a point to keep tabs on members' pet projects and
their districts, stepping in at opportune times to push their
ventures along.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Christian right, he is considered a champion of social
conservative causes. A rift between Republicans and social
conservatives that emerged earlier this year was healed after DeLay
cobbled together a ``values summit'' meeting between the two
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he digs his teeth into something, he's a pit bull on
issues and on winning,'' said Rep. Bill Paxon of upstate New York,
a close friend who is retiring this year. ``But that is not why he
is unopposed in this maelstrom. It's because of the personal
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to be respected in this town. But the real
reason for his personal success has nothing to do with people
fearing him. It's because they love him.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay, who grew up on oil rigs in Texas and Venezuela with
his father, an oil-drilling contractor who wanted a doctor for a
son, can rankle as often as he can please. Critics describe him as
glowering and undiplomatic. And while conservatives view him as
principled and sincere, moderates think he endangers the party's
majority with his ideological convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Once a small-business owner, DeLay came to detest government
regulations, and as the head of a pest control company, he
developed a special hatred for the Environmental Protection Agency.
In 1995, he tried to add 17 riders to the EPA's appropriations bill
that would have virtually wiped away pesticide and toxic-waste
laws. He once described DDT as ``not harmful,'' and in 1996 he
called the EPA the Gestapo of government.
</P>
<P>
   Another DeLay move that raised some eyebrows was his vote
against imposing a $300,000 fine on Gingrich as punishment for the
speaker's lying to the House ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   This year, DeLay led the charge in trying to kill legislation to
overhaul campaign finance laws, relishing his role as a defender of
free speech and growing hoarse from his many speeches on the House
floor. Even with the artillery of his whip organization, he lost
that vote.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, he sparked a feud within his own party when he
tried to muscle lobbyists into hiring Republicans, not Democrats, a
tactic some of his colleagues blasted as counterproductive, aides
and members said. DeLay has made it a mission to try to swell
Republican ranks along the lobbying corridors and has hit a few
rocky shoals because of it. He once faced two ethics complaints,
one for steering businesses toward his brother, a lobbyist, the
other for putting pressure on lobbyists. Both were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his fervor to impeach Clinton that propelled him into
the national spotlight. He was the first Republican leader to
harpoon Clinton after the Lewinsky scandal broke and call for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an outstanding whip, absolutely,'' said Rep. Christopher
Shays of Connecticut, a moderate. ``But his leadership skills and
his judgment hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes away our mantle of reform,'' Shays added. ``These are
really, what I think, the most unbelievably stupid kind of issues
that destroy what we are about as the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   A turning point in DeLay's relationship with his colleagues came
in the aftermath of an aborted coup, last summer, when news spread
that he had participated in a late-night cabal to overthrow
Gingrich. The attempted coup severed DeLay's friendship with Armey,
who had also attended the meeting, and further chilled his rapport
with Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues were furious at DeLay at first, accusing him of
treason. But at a revival-style caucus, DeLay apologized for his
role in the plot and delivered a contrite speech. That gesture
impressed most members. Many still mention it as a reason for his
endurance and for the loyalty he engenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that kind of stand-up mentality and
let-the-chips-fall-where- they-may is so refreshing,'' Salmon said.
``It endeared me as a diehard DeLay supporter. I told him that
night, `Tom, I would walk on broken glass for you.' ''

 LAWYER IN LOUIMA CASE SEEKS DETAILS OF SUIT

   NEW YORK _ The lawyer for a police officer charged with
attacking Abner Louima asked prosecutors Tuesday for details of a
lawsuit in which two men allege that Louima had filed fraudulent
claims with an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   The men claim they were dismissed by Country-Wide Insurance Co.
to keep them from disclosing information about Louima's claims,
which were related to injuries from a 1994 auto accident. A lawyer
for Country-Wide, Peter Panken, said there was ``nothing to cover
up'' and that the investigators had been dismissed for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In a request filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, Marvyn
Kornberg, who represents Officer Justin Volpe, asked prosecutors
for the results of what he said had been questioning by the FBI of
the two men, Eldon DeSenso, who had worked as an investigator for
the company, and John Gonzales, who had supervised its
investigators. Their lawsuit makes no reference to any such
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed last week in Superior Court in Monmouth
County, N.J., quotes a company official as saying that Louima had
tried to make some insurance claims with Country-Wide and that the
company had disclaimed them. Alan Vinegrad, a prosecutor in the
Volpe case, declined to comment. A lawyer for Louima, Peter
Neufeld, did not return a phone call, but in the past he has said
that Louima, who alleged brutal attacks while in custody of New
York police, had received ``a few thousand dollars'' from the
claim.

HYDE REJECTS WHITE HOUSE REQUEST FOR MORE TIME TO QUESTION STARR
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By ERIC SCHMITT and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided
Tuesday to call more witnesses in the inquiry into President
Clinton, and rejected a White House bid for more time to question
the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr at the committee's first
hearing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers said they wanted 90 minutes to cross-examine
Starr, instead of the half-hour that Republicans had offered. Starr
will have two hours to make an opening statement before any
questioning begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything less than 90 minutes would unfairly constrain our
ability to explore the basis for Starr's testimony, and for any
conclusions he may proffer,'' Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House
counsel, said in a letter to Rep. Henry J. Hyde, who heads the
committee. Tuesday night, Hyde rejected the request and gave
Clinton's lawyers until midday Wednesday to accept the original
offer.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans may announce their additional witnesses as
early as Wednesday but were waiting in part for Clinton to respond
to 81 questions from the committee, on whether he lied under oath,
obstructed justice or tampered with witnesses. The Republicans had
said that if he agreed to certain facts in the inquiry, that would
speed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting until we get the stipulations,'' said Rep. Mary
Bono, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said Clinton's lawyers were working on
the responses.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering came just two days before the committee is to
hold its first public hearing in the inquiry, showcasing the
prosecutor who investigated Clinton in a forum where full coverage
is planned by at least three television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we don't have a clear process in mind, but
we're going to go forward to get the facts,'' said Rep. Christopher
B. Cannon, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for Thursday's hearing, Starr delivered four more
boxes of documents to Capitol Hill on Tuesday. The material,
requested by Democrats, relates to Starr's investigation of Webster
Hubbell, a former No. 3 official in the Justice Department who
became embroiled in the Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were delivered after Democrats demanded to know
how Starr's investigation leaped from his original Whitewater
mandate into the Lewinsky scandal. Republicans said the documents,
which include grand-jury testimony and recordings of Hubbell's jail
house telephone calls, could help bolster the assertion in Starr's
report to Congress that the president obstructed justice by
concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At a hourlong meeting Tuesday, committee Republicans debated the
merits of calling additional witnesses, including Ms. Lewinsky,
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the president's confidant who helped her find
a job, and Betty Currie, Clinton's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans may also call or take a deposition from
John Huang, a former Democratic party fund-raiser who would testify
about his dealings with Hubbell. Starr indicted Hubbell last week
for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has sought to determine whether Huang might have steered
money to Hubbell to keep him quiet about what he knew of Clinton's
involvement in the Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they would try to show that many of the same
people who they say helped buy Hubbell's silence also tried to keep
Ms. Lewinsky quiet about her affair with the president by lining up
a job for her in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a clear possibility simply because we know from
published reports that Huang has cooperated with Starr,'' said Rep.
Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``That could make him a relevant witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats reacted with fury Tuesday over the inquiry's sudden
reach into Whitewater and procedures governing Thursday's hearing.
Democrats initially threatened to boycott the hearing but later
dropped the idea as Hyde expressed a willingness to accommodate
them.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, said at a news
conference Tuesday that ``if at this moment, we are launching into
material that has never been sent to the committee as part of a
referral, and there is going to be some oral presentation about
matters that are not in his referral, this is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans on the committee are facing pressure from
their own colleagues and weary citizens who want to see the inquiry
wrapped up and the scandal put to rest. A number of Republicans,
including moderates from the Northeast, say they will not support
articles of impeachment on the House floor, a move that would
surely doom the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there's enough evidence to warrant
impeachment,'' said Rep. Peter T. King, R-N.Y. ``I'm confident a
good number of Republicans feel the same way. Right now, the trick
is to end it and declare victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., said, ``Assuming there's no new
information, I'd vote against it.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter that sentiment, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a member of the
Judiciary Committee and one of Clinton's fiercest critics, held a
news conference with members of 10 national conservative groups to
shore up support for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   One day before House Republicans elect their leaders, many
conservative groups conditioned their future support for the
Republican leaders on a commitment to pursue impeachment
proceedings vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership has stalled on impeachment during
its entire four-year tenure,'' said Howard Phillips, chairman of
the Conservative Caucus, who demanded that Republican leadership
candidates ``make known now where he or she stands on this
historically crucial issue.''

AT 50, NEW YORK CITY BALLET IS LOOKING TO WHAT'S NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)  
 (fb) 
By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It isn't a trivia question to ask which of George
Balanchine's ballets were on the first program when the New York
City Ballet officially came into existence on Oct. 11, 1948. As
virtually every City Ballet subscriber knows by heart, the triple
bill consisted of ``Concerto Barocco,'' ``Orpheus'' and ``Symphony
in C.'' The same program will inaugurate the City Ballet's mammoth
50th-anniversary year Tuesday night at the New York State Theater,
just as it did the 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   An act of piety, this replay has its limitations. As the
50th-birthday celebration will suggest with a spread of 100 ballets
over the winter and spring seasons, the City Ballet never lived by
Balanchine alone. He was certainly its dominant figure, but an
appraisal of the company at its half century must also go beyond an
appreciation of Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is useful symbolism in Tuesday's program,
which includes a tribute to Tanaquil LeClerq, a muse to both
Balanchine and Jerome Robbins through her inimitable performances
in the 1940's and '50s. Looking back, it is clear what Balanchine
defined in the 1948 triple bill. With three signature pieces
choreographed to music by Bach, Stravinsky and Bizet, Balanchine
announced a company predicated not on ballet's stock repertory but
on creativity.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow Russian, the poet Marina Tsvetayeva, once defined the
creative compulsion in terms he would have recognized. In her essay
``Why I write ...,'' she explained: ``Not for the millions, not for
some one-and-only, not for myself. I write for the poem alone. The
poem, through me, writes itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the City Ballet's achievement is to measure a
comparable passion for choreography. It has been shared not only by
Balanchine but also by Robbins and Peter Martins, who served
jointly as the company's artistic directors from 1983 to 1990.
Martins has been sole artistic director since then. Balanchine died
in 1983; Lincoln Kirstein, who founded the company with Balanchine
and was general director, retired in 1989 and died in 1996.
Robbins, who left in 1990 but returned to choreograph new ballets
through 1997, died in July.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, then, the City Ballet finds itself bereft of
its founding fathers. Does it make a difference? Yes, if you expect
time to stand still.
</P>
<P>
   But as Martins has demonstrated, a company can change and still
be true to itself. He has asserted full control since 1991, when
the success of his splendid production of ``The Sleeping Beauty''
won over even those who will never forgive him for not being
Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   That he was hailed and assailed anew has become irrelevant. One
has yet to find a company that dances Balanchine and Robbins better
than the City Ballet or defends the value of the classical idiom so
consistently in its entire repertory. Martins is here to stay. The
City Ballet board has given him a vote of confidence by offering
him a contract for the next five years; he has agreed to sign.
</P>
<P>
   But any 50th anniversary should celebrate what has been achieved
in that half century. Essentially, the company has never faltered
in its unofficial mission, which is to lead the public, not to
follow it.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth recalling again the words Balanchine uttered upon
his arrival from Europe to settle in New York. ``Classicism is
enduring because it is impersonal,'' he told the British critic
Arnold Haskell in 1933. At that time, when there were barely any
permanent ballet troupes in the United States, few could understand
what Balanchine meant by an unmannered (impersonal) and codified
(classical) dance idiom.
</P>
<P>
   By affirming his faith in ballet's 300-year-old classical
vocabulary, which was hardly in vogue in the 1930s, he laid the
foundation for the company he was to establish with Kirstein.
Classicism in the larger sense, with its attributes of harmony and
balance, may have been implicit in his remark to Haskell. But the
truth is that Balanchine was advocating a return to the steps of
ballet's classical, or academic, lexicon. At a time when modern
dance and the Expressionist influence in ballet were in the
ascendancy, Balanchine expressed his loyalty to the language of
Marius Petipa, choreographer of ``The Sleeping Beauty.'' Renewed,
this idiom and the neoclassical style could help ballet take hold
in America and endure. ``Concerto Barocco,'' set to Bach's Double
Violin Concerto, and ``Symphony in C,'' to Bizet, look timeless
today because they are, in the best sense, ``impersonal'' and
effective as formal constructs. By contrast, ``Orpheus,'' with its
Stravinsky score and biomorphic decor by Isamu Noguchi, as well as
its images from modernist lyric theater, has a 1940s experimental
look.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to take the City Ballet's contribution to American
culture for granted. The quality of the Robbins and Balanchine
repertory, now brilliantly danced in most instances, is
self-evident. One should also not forget that in an era once
flooded with story ballets, the company waged an uphill battle to
convince a skeptical public of the value of pure-dance works.
</P>
<P>
   That Balanchine was drawn in this direction is no surprise. He
had grown up in Russia, a country that had recently rejected its
native realist tradition in art. It was not for his generation to
favor subject over style, or to feel a duty to solve civic problems
through art.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even an American like Robbins, following his success with
``Fancy Free'' at American Ballet Theater in 1944, opted for a less
pictorial approach in his choreography when he joined City Ballet
at its founding and became associate artistic director in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   If the City Ballet remains true to itself, this is because it
has been imbued with the consistent thinking that ruled its
precursors, the earlier companies directed by Balanchine and
Kirstein from 1934 to 1947. The American Ballet, Ballet Caravan
(directed by Kirstein alone but using Balanchine's dancers),
American Ballet Caravan and Ballet Society each had a different
emphasis. But each concentrated on new works, not stars, and
serious music, usually distinguished, often commissioned. Despite
exceptions, the focus in choreography was not on narrative and
decor but on the essence of classical dance: steps and the
combination of steps. ``Concerto Barocco'' and Balanchine's
``Ballet Imperial,'' both created for American Ballet Caravan in
1941, paved the way for the City Ballet's pure-dance esthetic.
</P>
<P>
   It is not, admittedly, a conception that fits everyone's view of
ballet. Even Kirstein allowed himself a momentary doubt about
Balanchine's reliance on music as a springboard for choreography.
In 1937 he wrote, ``I have come to feel that music unduly
tyrannizes him, but then I am not a trained musician nor a trained
dancer as he is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a choreographer, Martins has created his own ballets in the
Balanchinian style and encourages invited choreographers to do the
same, especially in the mini-festivals he calls the Diamond Project
(1992, 1994, 1997). That no one is on Balanchine's level is not a
surprise, but this does not obviate the value of these exercises in
neo-classicism, frequently admirable in Martins' case.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Kirstein, a fierce if inconsistent foe of modern dance,
has died, Mark Morris and Twyla Tharp (directors of their own
modern-dance troupes) will be allowed to storm the gates. They have
been invited to create new ballets in the year 2000. Ten years ago,
when numerous ballet troupes turned to modern-dance choreographers,
Kirstein with his siege mentality could still describe the City
Ballet as ``a fortress of the traditional classic dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers would be surprised to learn how eclectic the company
had once been in its early years. Invited to be part of the City
Center of Music and Drama by Morton Baum, the Center's finance
chairman, Ballet Society became New York City Ballet. Associated
initially with the New York City Opera, it became an independent
constituent of the City Center in 1949. From then to 1963, the City
Ballet was to a large degree Kirstein's company more than
Balanchine's. It reflected Kirstein's wide-ranging taste: Antony
Tudor, Frederick Ashton, Martha Graham, John Cranko and the
Japanese Gagaku ensemble were the companies or choreographers
invited in. After the City Ballet's move in 1964 to the new State
Theater at Lincoln Center, the balance shifted. Balanchine, who
created masterpieces like ``Agon'' at City Center, was now the
dominant creative force, not only in terms of quality but also in
terms of the increased number of his works in the repertory.
</P>
<P>
   To grow up in the 1950s with the company was nonetheless to see
choreographers as strangely disparate as Birgit Cullberg from
Sweden and William Dollar from the early Ballet Society days. The
Robbins imprint was especially strong, as epitomized by two of his
best known ballets, ``Afternoon of a Faun'' and ``The Cage.''
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine himself narrowed the scope of the company, eventually
dropping the Tudor and Ashton works. Ashton's ``Illuminations''
(1950) would be worth reviving, if only to show young
choreographers how a classical ballet translates into the
equivalent of the Symbolist poetry it comments upon. Who could ever
forget Tanaquil LeClercq as the aloof white figure of Sacred Love
in that ballet? By the time Martins joined the company as a dancer
in 1970, the City Ballet was a different place. Rising expenses at
Lincoln Center would soon usher in gala benefits, a far cry from
the City Center as a people's theater in the 1940s, when money was
donated by the unions represented on the center board. Kirstein was
even managing director of the entire City Center for several years.
</P>
<P>
   As the City Ballet enters a new phase, it will not be surprising
if it is Kirstein's absence that will be most keenly felt. There is
no one of his intellectual stature to hover in the background, no
matter how remotely. His erudition, connections and ruthlessness
made the City Ballet happen.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional material for the 50th anniversary celebration
contains photographs of Martins, Balanchine and Robbins but not of
Kirstein. This ahistorical gaffe is painful, comparable to American
Ballet Theater's omission of its own founder's name, Richard
Pleasant, at another anniversary gala.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this emphasis on creative figures is not totally askew.
Although Balanchine has been professionally mourned for 15 years,
his disciples, led by Martins, will continue to choreograph in his
style. Robbins was the company's other voice, with a style that
continually redefined itself.
</P>
<P>
   Martins knows well that fresh choreography is essential to the
company's profile. Asked recently about his focus for the future,
he replied without hesitation: ``New ballets will have to be
created and made on the premises. This is what this place is
about.''

EDITORIAL : A PRUDENT MOVE BY THE FED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 18: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The world's financial markets have calmed down since the Federal
Reserve first moved to lower interest rates seven weeks ago. But
economic problems remain, and the Fed acted wisely Tuesday when it
imposed its third cut in two months.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound in the Dow Jones industrial average, which has made
up nearly all its plunge of almost 20 percent this past summer,
overstates the extent to which financial markets have rallied since
the Fed signaled in late September that it was determined to fight
the prospect of world recession. Markets in other countries, and
for smaller stocks in this country, remain far below their peaks of
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, there are still signs of credit
stringency in the premium rates companies here and abroad must pay
to borrow money. Those conditions have eased from the peak of panic
in the summer, but are not back to normal. Most of Asia remains in
recession, and it is too early to know whether the Brazilian rescue
package will keep the Asian flu from infecting Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Fed's decision Tuesday to lower the federal
funds rate at which banks borrow from each other by a
quarter-point, to 4.75 percent, was a relatively close call. That
is because the American economy remains strong and consumers are
still spending. There are signs that rampant speculation is
returning, at least in Internet stocks. One such stock,
Theglobe.com, was unable to sell stock just four weeks ago. But
last week it sold shares at $9 each and saw the price leap to a
high of $97 within minutes. It has since come back down to just
over $40, but even that price shows a lot of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not such optimism is warranted for Internet
companies, the picture for the entire economy is mixed. While the
chances of a recession have declined, the weak international
economy means that corporate profits are not likely to be nearly as
strong as they were in recent years. The Fed's pre-emptive rate
cuts will help, but they cannot completely insulate the United
States from international economic woes.

NFL MVP? NO, BUT SANDERS' ABSENCE MAKES HIS WORTH GROW CLEARER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The words came softly and smoothly off the lips of Deion
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you can decide how much I'm worth, you need to ask
yourself. What am I? Am I just a cornerback? Am I just a punt
returner? Am I just receiver?
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I?''
</P>
<P>
   That was roughly a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question became painfully clear in the second
half of Sunday's 35-28 victory against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is the Cowboys' most valuable player and the leading
candidate to claim another defensive-player-of-the-year award.
</P>
<P>
   But most valuable player of the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   No. Denver's Terrell Davis has that one seemingly locked up.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that few players have been more
integral to their teams' performances than Sanders in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   You can really judge how important a player is to his team's
success by the way it plays in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: the 314-yard big-toe. With Sanders sidelined with a
sprained left toe, Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer amassed those
yards and a near-comeback victory Sunday _ making Sanders' value
obvious to even those who refuse to acknowledge his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of value. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones should be prepared
to offer another record-breaking deal to Sanders, whose contract is
up after next season.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: The bidding should start at $10 million annually and
Sanders doesn't expect to get less than the $12.99 million signing
bonus he got the last time.
</P>
<P>
   What's important right now is that the Cowboys find a way to get
him on the field Sunday for the Seahawks and quarterback Warren
Moon and receiver Joey Galloway. Sanders is not expected to
practice this week, and Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said it will be a
game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is preparing to limit Sanders' use at wide receiver and
on punt returns. Chris Warren will likely return punts, and Jeff
Ogden is expected to fill his spot in the four-receiver set.
</P>
<P>
   But we also found out against the Cardinals that an injured
Sanders can be effective. He set up a Cowboys touchdown with a
second-quarter interception that he nearly limped back for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he did it on reputation. Plummer agreed, saying
Sanders baited him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so far off,'' Plummer said. ``I tried to look up the
field. As I threw it ... here's Deion with a quick break to the
ball.''
O-Line questions
</P>
<P>
   Guard Everett McIver's imminent return from a knee injury and
Mike Kiselak's play in place of center Clay Shiver (sprained big
toe) last week have raised some interesting questions for Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Does rookie Flozell Adams, who has played extremely well in
place of McIver the past five games, keep the right-guard spot when
McIver gets healthy? And does the often-maligned and undersized
Shiver automatically get his job back?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who doesn't have a rule regarding a player not losing
his job because a injury, said he deals with such issues on a
case-by-case basis. In the case of McIver, Gailey said that he
probably will move him back into the starting lineup when he
returns from a knee injury in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The case could be different for Shiver. Gailey said that he
thought Kiselak played well against the Cardinals and that he will
evaluate that decision when Shiver is healthy. ``That's not a done
deal, yet,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Albeit with a reserve, precedent has already been set for such a
move. Just ask defensive end Antonio Anderson, who has been
available the past two weeks after missing the previous six with a
knee injury. Formerly the top backup at strong-side end and
defensive tackle, Anderson has been inactive the past two weeks
because the Cowboys are happy with the play of Hurvin McCormack,
who is backing up those two spots.
Inside the locker room
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are ahead of the game in preparing for the short
week preceding the Thanksgiving Day battle with Minnesota. Gailey
had the team work on the Vikings for two days during the off week.
... Former Country Day star Patrick Jeffers will see more time in
the regular offense in place of Billy Davis in some three- and
four-receiver sets in an effort to maximize Davis' time. Gailey
said the Cowboys are using Jeffers to rest Davis, who has taken a
larger role on special teams because of Kevin Mathis' injury.
</P>
<P>
   Yardsticks First and goal Last season, the Cowboys scored 25
offensive touchdowns. They have 26 through 10 games in 1998.
First and 10 If it seems that running back Emmitt Smith has been
passing a milestone every game, it's because he has. What can we
expect Sunday against Seattle? With 21 yards he would move past
Marcus Allen into sixth place on the all-time rushing list; he
passes Jim Brown with 90 yards. Question: Will Jerry Jones put
Brown on the pass list? Fourth and Long Cowboys left tackle Larry
Allen continued his shutout tour of opposing defensive ends. Allen
has not allowed a sack this season and made Cardinals end Simeon
Rice disappear Sunday, holding him to one tackle. The Cowboys lead
the league in fewest sacks allowed with 10.

`LITTLE ME': A MODEST STAR SHINES BRIGHTLY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y.)  (For release Sunday, November 22)  
(jw) 
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you missed Martin Short when he made his Broadway
debut in Neil Simon's ``Goodbye Girl,'' you probably have no idea
of his heft as a performer in the theater. Among other things, he
has the ability to dominate a Broadway stage as easily as he fills
the television screen. He's a singing, dancing actor of legitimate
style. He's someone who can change his appearance as easily without
makeup as with a fake beard or jokey eyeglasses or even, I suspect,
a bulbous red nose that honks when squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly his greatest gift: the ability to take over an entire
production without allowing the ego to show. He's a tireless
presence that abhors a vacuum. Yet, for such a powerhouse
performer, he displays a modesty that defines his singular
character as a star. Instead of intimidating the members of the
audience, like so many stand-up comics today, he seduces them with
high spirits.
</P>
<P>
   That is also what makes Short such good company at the Criterion
Center Stage Right, where he is currently giving insane substance
and coherence to ``Little Me,'' the Roundabout Theater Co. revival
of the schizoid 1962 Broadway musical. He is playing eight roles,
one more than Sid Caesar, who starred in the original production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Me,'' with its score by Cy Coleman (music) and Carolyn
Leigh (lyrics), is not often remembered as one of Broadway's
forgotten treasures. It appears always to have been a patchy show,
the sort that people keep thinking they can fix, without ever quite
facing the fact that what is good about it is the very thing that
makes it patchy.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's book, which he has reportedly revised for the new
production, is an adaptation of the Patrick Dennis comic novel, a
sendup of celebrity tell-all autobiographies epitomized in the
1950s by Lillian Roth's ``I'll Cry Tomorrow.'' The Dennis work, as
I remember it, is very broad, even for something intended as
parody. It is the tale of Belle Poitrine, born Schlumpfert on the
wrong side of the tracks in Venezuela, Ill., and how, against all
odds and in spite of her terrible treatment by men, she achieves
fame and fortune on the silver screen. Belle is the generic
Hollywood star as a sweet-natured, big-busted naif, stumbling
toward happiness through heartbreak as thick as smog.
</P>
<P>
   Designed as a vehicle for Caesar, ``Little Me'' had built into
it a problem that has haunted it ever since: The sketches featuring
the leading man inevitably overshadow everything else in the show.
That would include Belle, who becomes a supporting character in her
own story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Me'' is a revue masquerading as a book show. Though you
laugh a lot, it has just enough narrative to send you out of the
theater feeling vaguely confused, unfocused. When it was revived in
1982, with Victor Garber and James Coco taking over the Caesar
roles, it apparently worked even less well, closing after 30
previews and 36 regular performances.
</P>
<P>
   The new production, directed and choreographed by Rob Marshall,
co-stars the potentially delicious Faith Prince as Belle, but it is
a role that remains earthbound while Short takes flight in his
succession of cameos.
</P>
<P>
   One of the funniest: Noble Eggleston, the richest boy in
Venezuela, Ill., who falls deeply in love with Belle after he
wanders across the tracks and finds himself among the poor. When
the two young people touch hands, a crescendo of music is heard.
Snob that he is, Noble can't deny that Belle, though riffraff, is
the love of his life. He invites her to his Sweet 16 party, but
tells her to come to the back door.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, of course, objects to their association. The
almost-crestfallen Noble instructs Belle to go, but to return to
him after she has acquired the wealth, culture and social position
required of his consort. In the meantime, he is off to Harvard and
Yale (simultaneously) to study medicine and law. Such are the ways
of the rich, and of Simon's fertile brain at its most
wholeheartedly lunatic.
</P>
<P>
   Among Short's other roles: Amos Pinchley, a mean,
wheelchair-bound miser, fatally bewitched by Belle; Fred Poitrine,
an innocent World War I doughboy who marries Belle, only to suffer
a terrible fate in France, not in the trenches but in a clerical
accident; Otto Schnitzler, Belle's Hollywood director, who also
succumbs prematurely and in bizarre circumstances, and Prince
Cherney, the very Sid Caesar-like reigning monarch of a European
principality that's approximately the size of Sardi's.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Benny Buchsbaum who, with his brother, Bernie,
runs the vaudeville booking agency that introduces Belle to show
business. The Buchsbaum brothers could be the seeds that later
blossomed into Willie Clark and Al Lewis, the vaudevillians of
``The Sunshine Boys,'' possibly Simon's best play.
</P>
<P>
   The serviceable score has two first-rate songs, the waltz-time
``Real Live Girl'' and the sexily insinuating ``I've Got Your
Number,'' which is staged here in a way that is meant to be comic
but isn't. The material given to Ms. Prince, delivered with her
hearty mix of belt-and-brio, evaporates even as it charms.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's choreography recalls the work of Bob Fosse, the
original choreographer of ``Little Me,'' though at an intentionally
far remove. It is as if the Fosse movements had been sandpapered
smooth to eliminate their distinctively erotic thrusts, to soften
their sharp corners and angular silhouettes. In the one brief
moment in the show when he appears to be quoting Fosse directly,
it's to prompt knowing laughter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Something approximating the pure Bob Fosse continues to be on
view at the Shubert Theater where, on Nov. 14, Walter Bobbie's
revival of ``Chicago'' entered its third year. With the exception
of the matron of the Cook County Jail, still lustily played and
sung by the grand Marcia Lewis, all of the principal roles have
changed hands, sometimes more than once. Ann Reinking, Bebe
Neuwirth, James Naughton and Joel Grey are very much missed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the John Kander and Fred Ebb score, as well as the Fosse
choreography as recreated by Ms. Reinking, continue to make
``Chicago'' one of the blessings of Broadway at its cheekiest. And
what a smart show this is.
</P>
<P>
   The boldest casting decision: Ute Lemper, the German actress and
cabaret singer, who has performed in New York clubs and is now
making her Broadway debut. She has taken over for Ms. Neuwirth as
Velma Kelly, the role she originated in Bobbie's London production
of ``Chicago,'' in a performance that brought her an Olivier Award.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lemper has a face that resembles the young Garbo's after MGM
plucked her eyebrows. She is an accomplished singer and dancer and
is an actress of intensity. Whether she has an ounce of humor is
still anybody's guess. It is evident that she is a hard worker,
even though she appears to have little relation to the other
performers on the stage with her. There is something otherworldly
about her that has nothing to do with her tiniest trace of an
accent. It is as if she had been born and raised on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The performance is utterly baffling to me, unless her presence
is supposed to serve as a link to a genre of cabaret theater that
``Chicago'' would be pleased to acknowledge. It is certainly not a
bad performance; it seems to take place in another theatrical
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Far more conventional is Karen Ziemba, who has replaced Marilu
Henner, who replaced Ms. Reinking as Roxie Hart. The night I saw
the show, Ms. Ziemba took a while to find the center of Roxie's
small, brazen ambitions. When she did, sometime in the middle of
the first act, she was home free. Even her Little Orphan Annie
eyes, rimmed with mascara, amuse.
</P>
<P>
   The way that Brent Barrett plays Billy Flynn, Chicago's most
successful criminal lawyer, the character now looks very young and
slightly too pretty, but Barrett is good. He is a black-Irish
charmer, which helps him with juries. He is a star con artist in a
Roaring '20s city where con artists breed like voles. He is all
blarney and on the make; two of the show's best numbers (``All I
Care About'' and ``Razzle Dazzle'') are safe in his custody. I also
enjoyed Tom McGowan as Roxie's puzzled husband, Amos, though not
quite as much as Grey.
</P>
<P>
   One cause for mourning: because of the gulf that apparently
exists between the new Roxie and the new Velma, the show's superb
finale _ Roxie and Velma's singing and dancing double act _ has
lost most of its sardonic sting. The lyric asks ``Isn't it great?
Isn't it grand?'' The answer is now all too apparent: it isn't. The
irony has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Miller has good reason to be impatient with the way that
Americans respond to his work. ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan,'' his
dark comedy about a self-made millionaire who turns bigamist, was
first done in London in 1991, but it has only now reached New York.
It is at the Newman in the Joseph Papp Public Theater, but it
deserves to run far longer than Nov. 29, which is its scheduled
closing date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan'' is the most thoroughly involving
new Miller play I have seen in years. Here is a wise, merciless
examination of one totally self-absorbed man's dilemma as time
marches him toward the end of a life still unfulfilled. It is a
French farce as it might be conceived in the dark of a long, bitter
winter's night by a puritan who wants to be a rascal.
</P>
<P>
   When first met, Lyman Felt (Patrick Stewart) lies in bed in an
Elmira, N.Y., hospital. He is still heavily sedated after having
nearly died in an automobile accident, which might have been a
suicide attempt. As he drifts in and out of consciousness, he
becomes increasingly aware that he is going to be exposed as the
duplicitous heel he is.
</P>
<P>
   Theo (Frances Conroy), his WASP wife of 36 years, and their
daughter, Bessie (Kali Rocha), who live in Manhattan, are about to
meet Leah (Meg Gibson), the much younger Jewish woman Lyman married
nine years earlier without bothering to get a divorce. Leah lives
on the farm they share not far from Elmira.
</P>
<P>
   Lyman is a liar and a cheat and, though now plagued by guilt,
the last years have been astonishingly happy ones. In the city with
Theo, he lives the settled existence of a rather stuffy Upper East
Sider. In the country, he romps with his 9-year-old son, hunts,
collects foreign cars and even races them.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, he tells himself, he loves and needs both Theo and
Leah, each of whom he makes extremely happy. He must admit,
however, that the situation is peculiar: The longer he is with one
wife, the more he craves the wife in the other household. Only in
his dreams does he lie abed, sandwiched between the two women. ``Oh
the double heat of two blessed wives,'' he says. ``This is
heaven!'' In fact, he lives in perpetual transit.
</P>
<P>
   The play moves gracefully between Lyman's dreams and reality,
between humor that approaches the slapstick and ruminations on
Lyman's somewhat biased approach to his own morality.
</P>
<P>
   He is a big, complex character, played with enormous humor,
venom and rue by Stewart, who is hardly recognizable in gray hair.
It is actually a fairly decent wig that has the effect of grounding
the dramatically bald Stewart in the reality of the proper American
upper middle class. Ms. Conroy and Ms. Gibson are also attractive,
though the overall production, directed by David Esbjornson, seems
comparatively drab for such a lively and sometimes explosive text.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan'' deserves your attention, and
soon.

UCLA-USC HAS COMPANY AMONG RIVALRIES

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At last, a statement with which fans of UCLA and
USC can agree to disagree: When it comes to sports rivalries, the
Bruins and Trojans have a lot of competition.
</P>
<P>
   We should know, because we've celebrated the approach of
Saturday's football game by making a list of the 100 greatest
sports rivalries. Yes, the Bruins and Trojans rank up there. No,
they aren't No.1. Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see a lot of Los Angeles on our list. What can we say _
our rivalries are better than their rivalries. You'll see some
Russia, some Spain, some cyberspace, some Wall Street and a touch
of Harlem. You'll notice some history and some fiction, some
rivalries that burned out quickly and some that will simmer
forever.

WEEB EWBANK, 91, TOOK COLTS AND JETS TO TITLE VICTORIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md., Ohio) (fb) 
By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weeb Ewbank, who coached the Baltimore Colts of 1958 and the New
York Jets of 1968 to pro football championships in monumental title
games, died Tuesday at his home in Oxford, Ohio. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Ewbank, who attended the Jets-Colts game in Indianapolis last
Sunday, sitting in the Jet owner's box, was the only coach with
title winners in both the National Football League and in the
American Football League. That distinction has dimmed over time
because the NFL has been the only major league for decades. But in
the 1960s there were two competitive leagues, American and
National, and the Jets were the first from the AFL to win the
interleague championship, the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in Miami on Jan. 12, 1969, and it was certainly
the highlight of Wilbur Charles Ewbank's 45 years as a football
coach. The Jets of the AFL beat the Colts of the NFL, 16-7, in what
came to be regarded as pro football's greatest upset.
</P>
<P>
   It also established the competitive credibility of the Super
Bowl, which soon became the nation's most-watched sports event.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Super Bowl III linked Ewbank's name forever with
Joe Namath, the Jets' flamboyant quarterback, although coach and
athlete _ 36 years apart in age _ had little in common.
</P>
<P>
   Namath at first laughed at Ewbank and once during a game
described him as ``you little butterball.'' This was when the round
coach, 5 feet 7 inches and 195 pounds, was knocked into the mud
twice by a cluster of players.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of their Super Bowl season, the playboy Namath had
nothing but respect for his coach, the many fines forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Ewbank did, however, run a loose ship. He did not care about
Namath's Fu Manchu mustache, or various hair preferences of the
other players. Or even if they occasionally stayed out late.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they produce,'' he said. ``Their job is to play
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewbank had easily convinced the Jets that the Colts, who had
lost only one game and were favored by 18 points, could be beaten
and his game plan exploited a defect on the right side of the
Baltimore defense.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous during the contest, Ewbank continuously chewed ice cubes
and spit out the fragments. The fourth period, he said, seemed to
take forever to end.
</P>
<P>
   Ewbank died on the 30th anniversary of a game that season that,
in contrast to the magnificent Super Bowl upset, provided unhappy
memories. This was the so-called ``Heidi game,'' in which NBC
television cut away from the Jets-Raiders game in Oakland to show a
made-for-television ``Heidi'' movie with the Jets leading by 32-29
and 65 seconds remaining. The Raiders went on to score two
touchdowns and won by 43-32. Some fans who had been watching the
game on TV did not know the final score until they heard the 11
o'clock news.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the game, Ewbank telephoned his wife, Lucy, back
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``On winning,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the game,'' he informed her.
</P>
<P>
   In Ewbank's remaining five seasons as the Jets' coach, they
never played in another championship game and had only one winning
campaign. His overall record for 20 seasons as a pro football head
coach was modest _ 134 victories, 130 defeats, seven ties.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his two best-known title teams, he coached the
Colts to the 1959 NFL championship, when they defeated the Giants
in the title game for a second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   With the Colts and the Jets, Ewbank inherited losing teams and
rebuilt them into championship ones. It took five seasons in
Baltimore, and he finally achieved his goal thanks to the emergence
of another remarkable quarterback, Johnny Unitas.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, at the end of the 1958 season, beat the New York
Giants for the NFL championship in the first sudden-death overtime
game, something that helped project pro football into the nation's
consciousness. The final score was 23-17 and the common reference
became ``the greatest game ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   The modest Ewbank never made such claims. He took his triumphs
calmly, and after the Jets' Super Bowl victory, his midfield
comment to Don Shula, the losing coach, was almost an apology: ``We
had all the breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Ewbank publicly gloat about defeating the team owned by
the man who had dismissed him six years before, Carroll Rosenbloom.
That certainly hurt. But Ewbank remained grateful that Rosenbloom,
then a part-owner, had helped give him the chance to become a head
coach in the NFL in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a head coach at University High School in Oxford,
Ohio, 1930-1942, and at Washington University in St. Louis, in 1947
and 1948.
</P>
<P>
   World War II gave Ewbank the opportunity to move into big-time
football when he joined the Navy. He was assigned to the Great
Lakes Naval Training Station outside Chicago where he was an
assistant coach under Paul Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Ewbank and Brown had been college teammates, pint-size
quarterbacks, at Miami University in Ohio. Again he was one of
Brown's assistant coaches with the Cleveland Browns, during
1949-1953. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ewbank was voted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, five
years after his retirement. But the one he boasted about was the
Indiana Sports Hall of Fame, which quietly took in this native of
Richmond, Ind., in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Richmond, as a child, that Ewbank became Weeb because
that was how his brother pronounced his given name, Wilbur.
</P>
<P>
   Ewbank lived in retirement at his college town, Oxford, Ohio,
and for years had a full schedule of appearances at football and
charitable affairs. Almost always he had a shepherd, Lucy, his wife
of 72 years, who survives him along with three daughters, eight
grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.

<P>
   Is history about to repeat itself, with tragic consequences, in
Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   After more than seven years of cunningly exploiting the
cease-fire that ended the Gulf war _ and the growing divisions in
the U.N. Security Council _ Saddam Hussein looks set to snatch
another military defeat from the jaws of what looked like a
diplomatic victory in his battle over U.N. weapons inspections in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Defiantly ending all cooperation with UNSCOM, the special
commission whose job it is to strip Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction and the means of making or delivering them, Hussein has
thrown down his biggest challenge yet to the council. But patience
with him, even among his erstwhile supporters, is all but
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his promises to disarm, Hussein never really accepted
that, having lost the battle over his occupation of Kuwait, he had
also lost the right to hang on to his weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, over the past year he has used the weariness in the
Security Council, and the growing desire of Russia, France and
China for an end to economic sanctions and a return to
oil-business-as-usual, to wriggle slowly but surely out of the
weapons handcuffs that UNSCOM's inspections had clamped on him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his latest defiance has now united the Security Council
against him. So is diplomacy, backed by UNSCOM's inspections, now a
spent force? And if so, would force itself be able to contain the
threat that Iraq's hidden chemical and biological weapons still
pose to the outside world?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly diplomacy, UNSCOM-style, has achieved a lot. Tons of
weapon-ready chemicals and thousands of gallons of deadly germ
agents have been found and destroyed. So have the means to make
them, and dozens of missiles and thousands of shells to carry them.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's nuclear schemes have been dismantled by the International
Atomic Energy Agency. Yet the job is unfinished, thanks to
Hussein's obstruction, evasion, threats and lies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed his personal tribute to UNSCOM's effectiveness is that in
the past year he has dug his heels in so hard _ just as inspectors
were closing in on his still largely hidden biological weapons
complex. And that is now the crux of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein has no intention of letting UNSCOM disarm him. He does
not put it that way. He insists that he has no more secrets to
tell, and that UNSCOM's refusal to certify so is just an
American-inspired plot _ though weapons experts from many countries
back UNSCOM in this, including those whose governments have been
most prepared to give Hussein the benefit of any doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the admittedly sorry plight of many ordinary Iraqis
(he himself and his entourage comfortably excepted) hurt by
economic sanctions, despite U.N. efforts to help them, Hussein
demands a date for sanctions to end. But not even Russia, France
and China are ready to give him that.
</P>
<P>
   Last month they won him a new deal: let UNSCOM inspections
resume, in return for a ``comprehensive'' review of sanctions. By
spurning that offer once he saw its details, Hussein has both
angered those trying hardest to help him and focused minds on the
alternative to diplomacy: force.
</P>
<P>
   No one should relish that idea. While force has been threatened
in the past to back up UNSCOM in its disarming duties, this time
its purpose would be different: once missiles started to fly,
UNSCOM's role inside Iraq would be over.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could cruise missiles be certain to finish UNSCOM's job:
factories that are damaged can be repaired, and no matter how much
gets destroyed, the nuclear, chemical and biological know-how
remains inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Containing the Iraqi menace by force instead of by inspection
would require constant vigilance _ and repeated strikes at suspect
activity. And though the targets would be military, there are bound
to be civilian casualties this time and in future attacks _
something that, quite rightly, will trouble outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   This is a grim prospect. So is the possible damage to the West's
relationship with other Arab countries; and the longer military
action goes on, the likelier it is that the Security Council will
again be split.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a still grimmer one. With UNSCOM on his case,
Hussein cheated when he could. With UNSCOM now blocked, he can
cheat at will. And he has used chemical weapons before, both
against Iran and his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Although they do not say it in public, the chief concern of his
neighbors is that containment by force, if it has to be done,
should be done for as long as it takes. Hussein still has a little
time to change his mind. And if he will not? The dangers of letting
him run amok go far wider than the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's defiance, if allowed to stand, will encourage other
budding Saddams and badly undermine confidence in all the nuclear,
chemical and biological arms-control treaties that Iraq has broken
and that were devised to help keep some order in a dangerous world.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is one of the few mechanisms for tackling
such threats to world peace, and should do so. But if it will not
or cannot respond to Iraqi belligerence, its divisions should not
stop others _ in this case America with as broad support as
possible _ from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The worst outcome of all would be to let Iraq thumb its nose at
the world and get away with it. &QL;

THREE NEW YORK COUNCIL MEMBERS CALL FOR LAWSUIT AGAINST GUN MAKERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., La., Mass., Fla., Ill., Pa., Calif., Conn.)   (jw) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taking a page from the litigation against the tobacco
industry, three New York City Council members proposed Tuesday that
the city file a lawsuit against all the nation's gun manufacturers,
trying to recoup millions of dollars spent treating shooting
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents say they also hope to restrict the number of guns
entering the city.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would need the support of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
and if he agrees, New York will join a wave of cities that have
recently filed such suits.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, New Orleans became the first city in the country to
try the tactic. Boston announced plans for a similar suit on
Friday, and Chicago filed court papers the day before. Leaders in
Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Dade County, Florida, are also
considering lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun makers know they're an accomplice when someone gets
shot, but there's no incentive for them to do better,'' said
Councilman Kenneth Fisher of Brooklyn, a lawsuit proponent. ``The
gun manufacturers know that their guns are going to wind up in the
wrong hands, and the gun manufacturers know they're going to wind
up used in the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Bade Goodman, a senior litigator in the Office of the
Corporation Counsel, said suing the gun industry was ``something
we've been looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Giuliani said he was ``not against the idea'' but
added that he needed to research it.
</P>
<P>
   While Fisher and two of his Democratic colleagues on the council
_ Jerome O'Donovan of Staten Island and Sheldon Leffler of Queens _
are the chief proponents of New York's joining in lawsuits against
gun manufacturers, the City Council on its own cannot sue.
</P>
<P>
   None of the lawsuits filed by cities have yet gone to trial, but
similar cases filed by individuals have largely failed.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Oakland, Calif., ruled on Monday that a gun
manufacturer was not liable for the death of a 15-year-old boy who
was shot by a friend playing with his father's handgun. Earlier
this year, a jury in Brooklyn found seven gun companies not liable
for the 1994 shooting death of a teen-ager on the Brooklyn Bridge.
Other cases have been dismissed by judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going after the wrong people here,'' said Stephen
Sanetti, general counsel for Sturm, Ruger and Co., a manufacturer
of rifles, shotguns, pistols and revolvers that is based in
Southport, Conn. ``We shouldn't say let's sue the manufacturer of
the product; we should look at who's using it and how.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans suit focuses on product liability law, saying
the manufacturers do not take advantage of all the available
technology to make their guns safe. The Chicago suit, seeking $433
million in damages, claims that the manufacturers are creating a
public nuisance by knowingly making and distributing guns for
illegal uses.
</P>
<P>
   The New York council members said they were not sure how much
money the city should seek in a lawsuit against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Two advocacy groups that support such lawsuits _ New Yorkers
Against Gun Violence and Physicians for Social Responsibility _
estimate that treating a firearm injury can cost up to $400,000.
Citing Health Department records and other documentation, the
groups said that the total medical cost in 1992 for gunshot
injuries in New York City was more than $94 million.
</P>
<P>
   But gun industry leaders said that suing them was akin to
blaming a vintner whenever a liquor store sold to a minor. New York
already has strict laws governing the sale of firearms, they
pointed out. Guns are unlike tobacco, they say, because when used
correctly they cause no harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feeding frenzy out there right now, and the industry is
the red meat,'' complained Jack Adkins of the American Shooting
Sports Council, which represents 350 manufacturers, distributors
and retailers. `It's beyond guns now. It could be a potential
threat to just about any industry in this country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The basic theory that they're pursuing is that manufacturers,
distributors and retailers should be held responsible for the
criminal or negligent use of their products,'' Adkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the lawsuits say the courts are an important venue
in which to attack the gun industry, because legislative efforts
are often stymied by its powerful lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Hohlt, chairwoman of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence,
said that manufacturers made more guns than the legal market could
bear and that their advertisements were sometimes intended for a
criminal audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun companies couldn't make the profits they are making if
they were not knowingly producing for the black market,'' Ms. Hohlt
said. ``You've got to come up with a way of stopping them. There
have been a lot of legislative suggestions, but it's not going
anywhere.''

EDITORIAL: THE JUDICIARY STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 18: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats on the House Judiciary
Committee convene Thursday under the uncertain leadership of the
committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, the partisan interests will
be easy enough to discern. Republicans will be trying to determine
if recommending impeachment hearings to the full House will damage
them politically. Democrats will be trying to defend a president
whose conduct they find distasteful and shift criticism to an
independent counsel they will depict as dangerous. The question for
the rest of us _ and especially the next House Speaker, Bob
Livingston _ is what outcome would serve the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   This question must be addressed against the backdrop of current
political realities. There is still a mood of national revulsion
about President Clinton's conduct, his public lies to the American
people, his sworn misrepresentations in court and grand jury
proceedings and his use of others to lie for him, both in public
and in legal statements. But that mood is moderated by the
widespread belief, based on troubling evidence, that Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, used improper tactics to catch him.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there is little public backing for removing Clinton
from office by resignation or impeachment on the present evidence.
Yet it is imperative, as a matter of orderly governance in the
future, for Congress to find a way to condemn Clinton for his
signal failing in one of the core duties of his office _ to uphold
the rule of law. It must also find a way to air the arguments on
whether Starr has abused fairness or due process in investigating
the president.
</P>
<P>
   That means at a minimum that Hyde must allow Starr's tactics, as
well as the president's conduct, to be a full part of these
hearings. The matters with which Starr has been entrusted are too
important and his charges against Clinton too profound for him to
dodge a public accounting. Hyde cannot function as Starr's
bodyguard. Nor should he, or committee Democrats, rush ahead with
plans to call other witnesses until the import of Starr's testimony
can be digested. What will make this already polarized committee
into a shambles _ and invite the threatened Democratic boycott _ is
Hyde's decision to suddenly call witnesses like John Huang, the
campaign finance figure, without establishing an orderly context
for working through the entire case.
</P>
<P>
   The first priority Thursday is to give the Democrats and the
White House a fair chance and ample time to test Starr, just as he
must be given a fair chance to argue that his evidence warrants
impeachment. This page is eager to see Starr's response to the
accumulation of troubling disclosures about his methods. In the
past, we have defended the independent counsel against a White
House campaign of vilification that ignored his status as a duly
appointed government prosecutor. But the standard we set for him on
Jan. 22, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, still applies:
``The burden on him in this case is to prove he had reason to
pursue this line of inquiry. He must also show that he did not
exceed his mandate or abuse his prosecutorial powers through
entrapment or the use of biased or delusional witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation needs to hear Starr's answers to important questions
that the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have every right to
raise. Starr said in his referral to Congress that he first learned
of the Lewinsky affair from Linda Tripp on Jan. 12. But the office
may have been tipped on or by Jan. 9. That is the same day Ms.
Tripp suggested to Ms. Lewinsky that she refuse to sign her
affidavit in the Paula Jones case until Vernon Jordan guaranteed
her a job. Starr needs to react to the Democratic charge that the
alleged jobs-for-silence deal involving Jordan originated with his
witness, Ms. Tripp, or his prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Another area that needs an airing is whether there was collusion
between Starr's office and the attorneys for Paula Jones that could
have been designed to catch Clinton in a perjury trap. On Jan. 16
Starr's deputies confronted Ms. Lewinsky about filing a false
affidavit in the Jones case. Yet, at that moment, the judge in the
case had not yet received the document. How did Starr's staff know
about it? The question whether Starr knowingly allowed Ms. Tripp to
feed data about Ms. Lewinsky and her dealings with the prosecutors
to Ms. Jones' attorneys on Jan. 16 also looms large. Another
question is whether Starr's staff violated Ms. Lewinsky's rights
and Justice Department rules during their initial meeting by
threats designed to prevent her from calling her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the verdict on Starr, it will not solve the
overriding question of what Congress and the public can do to
protect the institution of the presidency from the recklessness and
disrespect inflicted on it by Clinton. The legal aphorism that
questions whether a miscreant should go free just because the
constable stumbles is useful here. Clinton's lawyers learned last
Dec. 5 that Ms. Jones' lawyers knew about Monica Lewinsky. That
means he presumably had more than a month before his Jan. 17
deposition to figure out a way to avoid lying. No matter how badly
the Republicans behave or Starr overreached, Congress has to take
notice when the possibility of perjury, subornation of perjury and
tampering with witnesses touches on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to the lively debate among politicians and
constitutional scholars, we are more firmly convinced that
congressional censure is not only allowable but essential to the
health of the Republic. Clinton has apologized only for behaving
badly. Congress will have failed in its duty as a guardian of the
American future if it does not formally condemn his failure to
respect and uphold the rule of law. Starr's blunders, Clinton's
recklessness and the tawdriness of the Lewinsky-Tripp tapes
released Tuesday all contribute to an atmosphere that will make it
difficult to reach a balanced, carefully considered conclusion. But
Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, is right to say that
Congress must go on record. At the conclusion of the Republican
leadership election Wednesday, Livingston, as the presumptive
Speaker, assumes the burden of guiding his fractious party and the
erratic Hyde toward that resolution. &QL;

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day that Newt Gingrich resigned, the chief beneficiary of
Republican disarray leaned over the fulsome leather of a seat on
Air Force Two and displayed his famous earnestness. He discussed
capital flows, information flows, Japanese demography; and, as he
demonstrated a firm grasp of these issues, he grasped a large mug
of tea in his large hand with self-assured authority.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft hit turbulence; the tea sloshed precariously inside
the mug; but Al Gore, vice-president and likely Democratic
presidential nominee, pressed home his point about Japan's
long-term fiscal balance and kept the mug in balance also.
</P>
<P>
   When this British interviewer complimented Gore on his
tea-handling skills, the vice-president did not miss a beat. ``Not
bad for an American,'' he replied, deadpan; and went on with his
lecture.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than turbulence to faze Al Gore. He has an
imposing physical and intellectual weight; he trundles forward like
a tank; he is not flashy or fast, but he is disciplined,
relentless.
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of Gingrich, the Congressional Republicans
are in turmoil; and Governor George Bush of Texas, the probable
Republican presidential nominee, has mused aloud about the pros and
cons of running for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, never lets anybody doubt that he means to
become president. He has assiduously wooed every single Democratic
faction, in and out of Congress. He has engaged in what one
prominent Democrat privately calls ``360-degree pandering.''
</P>
<P>
   Something of this relentlessness was evident in North Carolina,
just before the tea-balancing episode. If there is a weakness in
Gore's coalition of allies, it is that his famous environmentalism
scares firms that finance presidential candidates. And so, over the
past half-year or so, Gore has applied himself to this problem.
</P>
<P>
   He has hosted a roundtable for entrepreneurs. His friends have
started to put about the line that the vice-president has been the
key voice in Bill Clinton's ear, urging fiscal prudence on him.
And, before an audience of American and European executives in
North Carolina this month, Gore laid out his views on economics.
</P>
<P>
   The vice-president began by allaying fears that he would burden
business with a green and heavy hand: government has its place so
long as government knows its place, he said, adding that slump in
the developing world makes growth a top priority for governments.
</P>
<P>
   To promote growth, he went on, America needs to keep the budget
balanced, fix entitlement programs, and invest in education.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his few references to the environment, Gore called for
private-sector ideas that would ``stop global warming without
economic cooling.'' He did not, absolutely not, revive his 1992
suggestion that the internal combustion engine should be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore did not simply present himself as a sensible centrist
on economic policy _ a natural friend, in fact, of executives with
bulging wallets. He began his speech by shaking hands with Jurgen
Schrempp, the chairman of Daimler-Benz, and congratulated him on
taking over Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Having proved himself a friend of the global economy in this
way, Gore went on the offensive. The Japanese, he said, should
stimulate their economy; the Europeans should deregulate; both
should absorb more goods from countries hit by financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, Gore declared, should expect America to be the
``importer of only resort'' for the world's submerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   The full meaning of this emerged on Nov. 10, when Gore and the
president met representatives of America's steel industry. The
steel people are not in a good way: workers are losing their jobs,
they say, because of a flood of imported steel from Japan, Brazil
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is mulling sanctions on offending
foreigners, and Gore wants to sound concerned. Much as he wishes to
be the apostle of orthodox economics and free trade, he cannot
afford to seem insensitive to the losers in this system.
</P>
<P>
   Does Gore merely speak sweetly to all sides? Or would he, if
elected, actually try to deliver to all of them?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, the Clinton team has often tried to
please too many points of view: it has, for example, bashed Japan
and also tried to prop it up; it has advanced trade liberalization
and also retarded it by attaching environmental and labor standards
to the process.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is too much of a politician to be immune to such zigzags.
And yet there are two reasons to suppose that he would be more
decisive and consistent than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The first is this month's election, which has greatly
strengthened Gore and reduced the pressure to pander ceaselessly.
The Democrats' surprisingly strong showing lightened the threat of
impeachment hanging over the president, and so lessened the appeal
of a Democratic candidate running from outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Democrats' gains in the House may persuade Dick
Gephardt, the top protectionist in the party, not to run at all. He
is the Democratic leader in the House: if he sits still, a strong
Democratic showing in 2000 will make him Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's efforts to be all things to all men were at their
worst in the first year of his administration, because he had come
through a primary election in which he had faced strong challengers
of all complexions. Barring fresh scandal, Gore has reason to hope
primary opposition to him will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason to expect a decisive Gore goes back to his
moment with the tea mug. The man who drills home his point on
Japanese demography, oblivious to turbulence and sloshing tea, is
not a man who loses sight of his goal easily.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to Bill Clinton, you are impressed by his way with
words, his ability to spin out grand ideas with charm and levity.
But you also feel that he could argue just as brilliantly the other
way, and indeed might soon do so.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is not like that. There is no levity about his policy
lectures; there is a tank-like advance towards the logical
conclusion. The pause for a joke is efficiently brief. So, with any
luck, will be the pauses for pandering. &QL;

CALIFORNIA RULING IS A SETBACK FOR MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for complete rewrite; expands by 900 words)  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., whose business practices are being challenged
by the government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal
setback on another front Tuesday when a U.S. judge in California
ordered the company to stop shipping its own version of Java, a
programming language owned by a rival, Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Under a licensing agreement signed in March 1995, Sun gave
Microsoft the right to ship Java, the most popular language for
programs that run on the World Wide Web, with Microsoft's Windows
operating system and its Web browser, Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   However, in 1997, Microsoft altered parts of the Java language
so that programs written in Java for other operating systems would
not run on Windows machines and vice versa. Microsoft said it was
improving Java, but many others in the industry, including Sun,
said it was an attempt to ``pollute'' a language that threatened
Microsoft's operating system monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Sun sued, claiming that its licensing agreement did not allow
Microsoft to make changes to Java.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Judge Ronald Whyte, who is hearing that suit, ruled
that Sun was likely to prove its claim in a trial next year and
ordered Microsoft to begin shipping Sun's version of Java within 90
days. If, after that time, Microsoft continues to ship its
operating system or browser with its own version of Java, it will
be in contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Microsoft said the ruling would not require
recalls of either Windows 98 or its World Wide Web browser,
Internet Explorer 4.0. Although a company spokesman said the
changes ordered by the judge would be costly, he declined to be
specific.
</P>
<P>
   What, if any, impact Tuesday's preliminary injunction in a
private lawsuit in California might have on the government's
antitrust case, now being heard in Washington, is uncertain. But
the allegations in the government's suit do include the practices
that are at the heart of the breach-of-contract case.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft in the
antitrust case say this is part of a pattern of illegal practices
by the software giant intended to protect and extend its tight grip
on the market for personal computer software. If Sun's Java became
an industry standard, the government asserts, it could pose a
serious challenge to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Java potentially allows developers to write a software program
once and have it run on a wide variety of computers, regardless of
the underlying operating system. That is a threat to Microsoft's
control over the direction of software development.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors interact to insure the continuation of Microsoft's
operating system monopoly. First, the vast majority of programmers
write their software first _ and often exclusively _ for the
Windows operating system because has a better than 90 percent share
of personal computer operating systems. Second, Windows users are
reluctant to change operating systems because switching requires
buying all new programs.
</P>
<P>
   However, programs written in Java could, at least theoretically,
run on any operating system, meaning that a user could abandon
Windows for Apple Computer Inc.'s Mac OS or any flavor of the Unix
operating system and run the same Java programs that he or she had
purchased to run on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mail exchanges among Microsoft executives made public in
both the Sun trial and the government antitrust case, this
possibility was referred to as ``commoditizing the platform,''
meaning that Windows would lose its proprietary grip on newly
developed programs, a serious threat to Microsoft's monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The California ruling is badly timed for Microsoft, but the
spillover, if any, to the antitrust case in Washington is difficult
to determine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department will argue that a breach of contract is
part of the pattern of bad acts by Microsoft and of its intent to
monopolize,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division. ``It helps the
atmospherics of the government's case, but it's not clear beyond
that what the effect will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Tuesday is a preliminary injunction, Litan noted, and
the Sun-Microsoft trial is not scheduled to begin until next year.
Meanwhile, the antitrust trial is already well under way, and Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson is expected to rule early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a final ruling in the contract case, it would
have far more direct impact on the antitrust case,'' said Litan,
who is now at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The California ruling, industry analysts say, is not likely to
have a significant impact on Microsoft's business anytime soon _
though it does raise questions about the company's strategy of
trying to influence the industry to accept Microsoft's version of
Internet software standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the judge gave it 90 days to comply, there is no
business interruption for Microsoft,'' said Richard Sherlund, an
analyst for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``Microsoft does not have to pull
products out of distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Sherlund noted, the ruling does ``rein Microsoft in, and it
clearly comes at an awkward time for the company, given the
antitrust case.''
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit, Sun accused Microsoft of trying to foil any
chance for Java to become a universal programming language.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it was disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maritz, a Microsoft group vice president, said: ``We don't
anticipate any disruption to any products, including Windows 98.
Customers need not fear any disruption.''

lectures; there is a tank-like advance towards the logical
conclusion. The pause for a joke is efficiently brief. So, with any
luck, will be the pauses for pandering. &QL;

 UNDATED: any disruption.''

<P>
   In a conference call Tuesday evening with reporters and industry
analysts, Maritz said the ``option of not supporting Java is open
to us.'' But most industry analysts doubt that Microsoft would walk
away altogether from Java, a popular Internet programming language
developed by Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Sun welcomed the preliminary ruling, and Michael Morris, the
company's general counsel, said that when the case was tried, Sun
planned to seek unspecified monetary damages from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came as many industry executives had gathered at a
major computer trade show in Las Vegas known as Comdex. The early
reaction to word of the ruling was generally favorable, based on
the assumption that the eventual effect of the decision would be to
encourage a single, industry-standard version of Java for which
software developers could write programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single Java standard is what the industry needs,'' said Eric
Schmidt, chief executive officer of Novell Inc., a maker of
software that links computers in networks. Schmidt was Sun's chief
technology officer at the time Sun introduced Java in 1995 as a
language designed specifically for software that runs on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In his 31-page ruling, Judge Whyte based his preliminary
injunction on the his judgment that Sun was likely to ``prevail on
the merits'' in its suit. The dispute between Microsoft and Sun
focuses on whether the 1996 contract allowing Microsoft to license
Java technology _ which was gaining a strong following in the
industry _ also allowed Microsoft to tailor the Java language for
use with its own software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that its fine tuning merely improved the
performance of Java, but Sun countered that Microsoft's real agenda
was to undermine a challenge to Microsoft by co-opting it. This
tactic was described in the antitrust trial last week by an
executive for Intel Corp., who quoted a Microsoft executive as
saying, ``embrace, extend and extinguish.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Judge Whyte wrote that Sun has ``demonstrated a
reasonable likelihood'' that the contract ``does not authorize
Microsoft's extension of the Java language and its corresponding
modifications to the Java language compiler.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun, among other things, took issue with Microsoft's licensing
policies for distributing software that includes Microsoft's
modified version of Java. Microsoft's licensing deals, according to
Whyte, require its business partners to exclusively distribute
Microsoft's Java-based technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court finds that negotiating for or enforcing the
above-mentioned licensing terms constitutes an unfair business
practice,'' Whyte wrote. ``Microsoft does not argue that these
licensing provisions bear any utility which outweighs the harm
asserted by Sun.''

JURY INDICTS 6, BUT NOT LEADER OF YOUTH RALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York grand jury has decided not to indict
Khallid Abdul Muhammad for his actions at the end of a Harlem rally
in September that erupted in violence, prosecutors said Tuesday.
The decision angered city officials, who had said the black leader
tried to incite a riot at the event.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the grand jury indicted six other people on charges of
attempted assault and reckless endangerment. The violence started
after police officers in riot gear moved in on the speaker's podium
at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   The violent end to the Sept. 5 event, which organizers had
called the Million Youth March, led both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Police Commissioner Howard Safir to call for the arrest of Muhammad
on charges of inciting a riot. They said he urged people at the
rally to fight back if the police confronted them.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney's office said it had reviewed 26
videotapes of the event and interviewed more than 50 witnesses in
its investigation. But investigators were able to identify only one
of the six people indicted _ James Washington, who surrendered to
the police just after the rally after being recorded on videotape
punching a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said prosecutors presented
evidence to support indicting the six on rioting charges, but that
the grand charge declined to do so. Since the grand jury was
unwilling to say anyone had rioted, law enforcement officials said,
there was no way to charge Muhammad with inciting a riot.
</P>
<P>
   Safir expressed disappointment, saying he still believed that
Muhammad, a man he once referred to as a ``Black Hitler,'' was
guilty of inciting a riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this business over 30 years,'' he said, ``and
I've seen grand juries do things that are in my view illogical. But
that's the criminal justice system, and so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad could not be reached Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, the police were sharply criticized by some
neighborhood leaders for blocking access to the event, and then
moving in too quickly and too forcefully to shut it down.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since Nov. 3, it looks as if California's
hyperactive environmentalists have yet another endangered species
to worry about: Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The state party that gave the world Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan not only lost the governorship (by more than 20 percentage
points) and the race for the Senate in Washington (by ten).
</P>
<P>
   It also lost five Assembly seats, two state Senate seats, and
all but two of the statewide offices, including all the ones that
matter. (One crumb of comfort: Chuck Quackenbush was reelected
insurance commissioner with 50 percent of the vote.)
</P>
<P>
   Party pessimists assert that demographics are turning against
them. The past decade has seen 2.6 million immigrants moving to the
state, most of them Latino and Asian; it has also seen more than
1.6 million Californians moving to other parts of the United
States, most of them the sort of middle- and working-class whites
who used to make up the party's natural base.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, it might seem, are ill-equipped to break the
Democrats' hold over this changing electorate. Being a minority in
the state legislature, they will have little influence over the
reapportionment of the state's seats in the House of
Representatives in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   And their shortage of statewide office-holders means that they
lack obvious candidates for future Senate and governor's races.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly true that the Californian electorate is changing
with astonishing speed. In 1994 a Los Angeles Times exit poll said
that 81 percent of those voting were white; this year it said only
64 percent were.
</P>
<P>
   But the declinists exaggerate the strength of party loyalties in
this increasingly individualistic state, and they underplay the
power of referendums (such as those on taxes and race-based job
appointments) and maverick millionaires to shake up the system.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time California's Republicans have had
their obituary written. In 1976, in the wake of Watergate, the
party lost every single statewide race; in 1992 it saw two
Democratic women returned to the Senate and Bill Clinton trouncing
George Bush in the presidential race. Both times, it managed to
bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   The party can point to plenty of special factors to explain this
year's debacle. Sixteen years of Republicans in the governor's
office created a feeling that it was time for a change; and
Governor Pete Wilson's enthusiasm for immigrant-bashing and
union-busting meant that two powerful constituencies were
determined to get rid of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Fong proved a bumbling and inarticulate candidate for the
Senate. The Monica Lewinsky affair played badly in a state where
people tend to believe they should be allowed to reinvent
themselves every day _ often with the help of plastic surgery _
rather than pay the price of their indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' biggest problem, however, was that the election
happened at a time when the economy is booming and crime falling.
This prevented the Republicans from playing their strongest cards.
And it persuaded the business community either to abstain or to
tilt Democratic, so that even the left-leaning Barbara Boxer could
outspend Matt Fong two-to-one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be a foolish Democrat who would claim that an
election will never be fought on the economy again, or that crime
will never be a galvanizing issue in a state with a combustible
underclass and journalists whose motto is ``If it bleeds, it
leads.''
</P>
<P>
   That will not matter if the Democrats can use the next few years
to tighten their grip on their new supporters. But political
machines are hard to build in a state where one in six voters is a
registered independent and a third of voters claim no strong
political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are delighted that more than three-quarters of
Latinos voted for them this month. But Latinos are unlikely to stay
so Democratic. The Republicans won up to 40 percent of the Latino
vote under Nixon and Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in House races in the country as a whole, 37 percent
of Latinos voted Republican (compared with 21 percent of Jews); in
Florida and Texas the figure was far higher.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the Latinos' taste for starting family
businesses and buying houses is liable to push them towards the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Wiser heads in the Democratic Party are well aware of how
fragile their success may prove. The party co-opted some typically
Republican issues (which suggests the election was more a revolt
against Republicans than against Republicanism).
</P>
<P>
   Gray Davis, the new governor, mocked Dan Lungren for not
fighting in Vietnam; even the Democratic establishment supported
the death penalty and the ``three strikes'' tough-imprisonment law.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis will find it hard to emulate Tony Blair's policy of
robbing the right of its ideas and the left of its influence. Far
from being out of power for the past 16 years, the Democrats have
dominated the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most powerful figures in the party are not exactly
centrists: Sheila Kuehl, the Assembly's majority leader, is a
homosexual-rights activist; John Burton, the president pro tempore
of the Senate, is an archetypal product of San Francisco; Antonio
Villaraigosa, the Assembly speaker, is a former labor organizer.
And Davis himself is in debt to the unions for more than $7 million
in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans cannot just sit and wait for the
Democrats to mess things up. They need to rid themselves of their
reputation as the party of enraged white males. There are signs
that this is beginning to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The state's new open primary has produced a larger number of
centrist Republican candidates than ever before. The number of
Latino Republicans in the state legislature has risen from one to
four, and the Republican caucus in the Assembly has elected a
Latino, Robert Pacheco, as its new leader.
</P>
<P>
   There are those in the party for whom such changes are anathema.
But if they kick up a fuss they can always be reminded of the
debacle of Nov. 3. &QL;

IRA DISARMAMENT LOSING PRIORITY IN ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ In a gradual but distinct change in policy,
the British and Irish governments are relaxing pressure on the
Irish Republican Army to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The operation of the new Northern Ireland Assembly has been
thwarted by the disarmament issue since the assembly was set up by
a peace agreement approved in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant leaders say the IRA must start to disarm before its
political wing, Sinn Fein, can fully take part in the new body. The
IRA says it will not disarm until the peace agreement is fully
enacted, an event scheduled for the spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland said the
disarmament issue should be ``parked'' until the spring.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the highest British official in the north, Mo Mowlam,
the Northern Ireland secretary, defended the early release of IRA
and other prisoners despite the IRA's refusal to disarm. About half
of the 400 prisoners, Catholics and Protestants convicted of
terrorist acts, have been released early in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, in an unusually conciliatory statement, the
chief of the Northern Ireland security forces said that the
16-month cease-fire being observed by the IRA could help bring
permanent peace in the predominantly Protestant British province of
Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, who is in charge of 12,000 police officers and 15,000
British army troops in the province, was clearly trying to break
the deadlock over disarmament. The police force is about 93 percent
Protestant; the IRA has killed about 800 police officers and
soldiers in the last 29 years, but Flanagan, in an interview on
Irish national radio, said that the IRA cease-fire would give
politicians time to work out a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he was agreeing with Gerry Adams, the president of
Sinn Fein. Adams has repeatedly said that while the IRA, with an
arsenal estimated at 100 tons of weapons and explosives, will not
disarm immediately, its cease-fire is convincing evidence that it
wants a political solution to the conflict that has killed nearly
3,300 people since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan referred to the cease-fires being observed by all but a
few of the northern paramilitary groups, of which the IRA is the
largest. But officials and experts said his words were aimed at
reassuring Protestant politicians that the IRA cease-fire was
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great irony,'' Flanagan said of the refusal to disarm
and the cease-fire. ``While on the one hand they pose a threat, on
the other hand, they pose the opportunity to deliver this true,
lasting permanent peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In another attempt to break the impasse, the highest Catholic
official in the province, Seamus Mallon, the deputy first minister
of the new assembly, said his mainstream Catholic Social Democratic
Labor Party favored allowing Sinn Fein to hold Cabinet posts in the
new Northern Ireland government, even if the IRA does not disarm
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, at a party conference on Saturday, said that if the IRA
still had not disarmed by the final settlement in 2000, then he
would move to have Sinn Fein expelled from the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was aware of Protestant Unionist fears that Sinn Fein
would ``pocket'' concessions made by the British and Irish Republic
governments, ``then will fail to honor'' its disarmament
obligations. He also noted that Sinn Fein fears that the Protestant
Unionists would keep finding obstacles to block the political
reforms intended to give Catholics more power in the new
government. ``We will not allow anyone to play political games,''
he said.

   The boss of Netscape, Jim Barksdale, likes a joke. ``If we fight
(Microsoft) together we can win. The enemy of my enemy is my
friend. Your comrad (sic), Joseph Stalin,'' he wrote in October
1995 to ``Franklin D.'', alias Steve Case, chief executive of AOL,
an online service.
</P>
<P>
   When the message was recently aired at the antitrust trial of
Microsoft, it suddenly seemed less amusing.
</P>
<P>
   The final outcome of the case, which could determine the rules
of the software industry, may be years off. But it has already had
one effect. Firms are trying to police their employees' e-mail
traffic, and that could harm the spontaneity that is the medium's
chief attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Some 66 million American employees use e-mail, and this number
is rising fast, according to International Data Corporation, a
consultancy. One billion electronic messages jostle America's
corporate networks each day.
</P>
<P>
   This digital tsunami has caught most companies unprepared.
Employees are still learning how to deal with e-mail. They are
blunter online than they would ever be on paper. A harmless
difference in opinion can rapidly escalate to a full-fledged fight.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, people view e-mail as ephemeral, even though electronic
messages do not disappear when you hit the delete button. They
survive, for example, on the backup tapes of corporate networks,
and can easily be downloaded and searched.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Monica Lewinsky, they were recovered from the
hard disk of a home computer. More than 3,000 exhibits have been
submitted in Microsoft's trial, and most of them consist of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Firms are now wondering what nasty surprises lurk on their own
servers _ and are implementing strict e-mail policies. So far,
according to surveys, about half of American firms have such
policies in place.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement, however, is rare, because it is too expensive to
read tens of thousands of e-mails. But that could change as firms
install software that scans messages for danger. Some programs even
display a warning if a user types something that is not acceptable
under the company's speech code.
</P>
<P>
   Firms will also try to stop employees' sending vast quantities
of e-mail by using e-postage, according to Ferris Research, a
consultancy in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies are already charging about 10 cents for the
first kilobyte (about a double-spaced page), which is enough to
make employees think twice about whether that large report really
needs to go to dozens of colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   All this may help avoid lawsuits and save on overheads, but at a
price. Employees will feel spied on. It might inhibit the rapid and
unfettered sharing of information upon which high-tech firms, in
particular, thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Better to teach employees how to use e-mail and ensure that
messages are deleted after 90 days. At Netscape, executives
discussing delicate issues now use the telephone. Sometimes they
even meet in person.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Western Professional Hockey League suspended
Austin Ice Bats captain Craig Johnson for 12 games on Tuesday for
his part in a melee Friday night against the Waco Wizards. Ice Bats
Coach Al Tuer was suspended for two games, and defenseman Ryan
Anderson for one game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, Tuer and Anderson sat out Austin's 3-2 shootout loss to
the Monroe Moccasins on Saturday. Anderson can play Friday when the
Moccasins return to the Travis County Exposition Center, but Tuer
will sit out one more game and Johnson will not return to the Bats'
lineup until Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The league also levied fines on both teams for not controlling
their players after the game when the battle continued between the
dressing rooms underneath the Belfry, the bar/restaurant at the
Expo Center's west end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Tuer, who declined to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   It is WPHL policy to not disclose the amount of the fines, Brad
Treliving, the league's Director of Hockey Operations, said
Tuesday. Austin and Waco were tied 2-2 with 4.4 seconds left in the
game when Ice Bats forward Craig Stahl was checked from behind by
Bill Wright. Stahl suffered a concussion and Wright received a
two-game suspension for the hit. Scuffling between the teams'
players followed the hit, and then the fracas intensified when
Johnson and Waco goalie Kory Cooper got in each other's face.
</P>
<P>
   Treliving, who watched the melee from the press box at the Expo
Center, said Johnson swung a fist at Cooper who retaliated by
swinging his stick. Cooper received a four-game suspension, and
Waco coach Todd Lalonde was suspended for two games.

SPARRING FOR MOYNIHAN SEAT, ROUND 1: ANDREW CUOMO VS. GIULIANI
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wis.)   (jw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fueling the widespread speculation about his
political future, Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban
development, said Tuesday that he had not ruled out running for the
Senate from New York in 2000, and he said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
would be a potentially formidable Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo said that while Giuliani ``is widely perceived as
having done a good job'' as mayor, he might not have the skills and
personality required to be an effective legislator in a body of 100
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very flexible, you have to be very
compromising,'' Cuomo, the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, said
during an hourlong discussion with Capitol Hill reporters. ``That
is not the style he has demonstrated as mayor of New York. Let's
say that. But I don't know if he would want to do it. I don't know
if he would be capable of it. That, we would have to wait and
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a Queens-flavored baritone reminiscent of his
father's, Cuomo called Giuliani ``a talented man'' who would be
tough to beat because he could win many votes in New York City,
where Democrats have traditionally dominated in statewide races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani will do relatively well in the city, would be my
guess, which would somewhat frustrate the normal equation,'' Cuomo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has not decided yet whether to seek higher office, but
the Cuomo comments brought a retort from City Hall. ``It sounds
like Andrew Cuomo has made the first mistake in his potential run
for the Senate,'' said Jack Deacy, a mayoral spokesman. ``He's gone
negative immediately, even before he's announced.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Cuomo was keeping his name alive in the contest to
replace Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, another possible candidate,
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was announcing that he had decided against
running for the seat, which his father once held.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from California, where he was giving a
speech on the environment, Kennedy said that after much discussion
with his family and friends during the last week he had decided
that a Senate campaign would keep him away from his family far too
much.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 44, said he made up his mind after talking to Mark
Green, the New York City public advocate, who lost in the
Democratic primary this year, and Rep. Charles Schumer, who
defeated Sen. Alfonse D'Amato two weeks ago. The two men told him
that he would have to make tens of thousands of phone calls and
spend six out of seven days a week for more than a year to raise
enough money and build sufficient support to win a statewide race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that to make this run, I'd have to give up my
family life,'' said Kennedy, who has five children ranging in age
from 1 to 14. ``I want to see my kids grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense
Council, whose sister Kerry is married to Cuomo, said he had been
encouraging his brother-in-law to run for Moynihan's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Since Moynihan announced earlier this month that he would not
seek re-election after his term ends in 2000, a raft of well-known
politicians and officials have said they are considering running
for the seat, or allowed supporters to float their names as
potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cuomo, the Democrats include State Comptroller H.
Carl McCall; Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester; two of Cuomo's fellow
Cabinet secretaries, Donna Shalala of Health and Human Services and
Robert Rubin of Treasury; Assemblyman Michael Bragman of Syracuse,
the Rev. Al Sharpton and George Stephanopoulos, television
commentator and former adviser to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Giuliani, the Republicans include Rep. Rick Lazio
and Rep. Peter King, both of Long Island, as well as former Rep.
Susan Molinari of Staten Island and Thomas Gulotta, the Nassau
County executive. D'Amato has also been mentioned as a possible
candidate, but his aides have said that he is not thinking about
running for anything right now.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo offered one reason for keeping quiet about running, saying
that he might lose his ability to work with Republicans in Congress
on housing legislation if he proclaimed an interest in the Senate
seat. ``As soon as you run that political banner up the pole, you
polarize Democrats and Republicans, and we'll lose the progress
we're making,'' he said.

CHINA GRAPPLES WITH THE INTERNET

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For China's aging, Soviet-trained leaders, the
Internet must seem a puzzling thing indeed. Information streams
through it at the speed of light, newfangled jargon swirls around
it and the whole mess is governed haphazardly, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its cutting-edge newness, the Internet poses what is
for China a very familiar problem: how to benefit from spectacular
new technology without being transformed by it.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Zhidong, a high ranking Qing Dynasty mandarin,
contemplated a similar dilemma late last century and proposed a
pithy formula for resolving it: ``Chinese learning for the
fundamental principles, Western learning for practical
application.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply substitute ``on-line content'' for ``fundamental
principles,'' and that is how China today is trying to limit the
social and political impact of its burgeoning involvement with the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As much as any nation, China stands to benefit by applying the
technology of the Internet to commerce, finance, science,
entertainment and education. More than most, however, it also has
reason to fear the Internet's freewheeling ways with uncensored
news and unapproved views.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities were quick to see the threat to their
near-total monopoly of news and information. About a decade ago
they began to set tight restrictions on anyone accessing foreign
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   But then there were few computers and telephone lines in China,
and, as the central telecoms authority controlled virtually all
access to international gateways, it was easy to block the path to
unfriendly foreign websites and to monitor any on-line shenanigans
within China.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is much harder, after rapid growth in both Chinese
telecoms and information services. As a result, Internet use in
China is skyrocketing. There were 1.5 million Chinese wangchong
(net bugs) by the end of July, and they are increasing by an
estimated 150,000 every month.
</P>
<P>
   The government expects to have 5 million Chinese Internet users
by the end of 2000; industry groups predict 9.4 million Chinese
will be surfing the Internet four years hence.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet businesses are glad to see such growth, they are
not yet sure how they will make money in China. Even in developed
markets it is tough enough. China also faces other challenges: its
tiny number of credit-card holders limits the prospects for
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, high access fees charged by the state-owned companies
that monopolize China's connections to the Internet make it hard
for China's estimated 200 Internet service providers to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any do, according to Yun Tao, vice-president of one
Beijing-based provider, Cenpok Intercom Technology. ``It is not yet
possible to make money in China on the Internet... I have been at
it for the last few years and I tell you, I am bleeding now,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chinese government, increasing Internet usage has not
only made adherence to Zhang's formula all the more important, but
has also forced a change in tactics. Rather than slap endlessly
(and increasingly ineffectively) at hands that click on to
disapproved sites, China is trying to lure the wangchong with its
own approved sites.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by China's state-run news agency, Xinhua, and the
central telecoms authority, China Internet Corporation (CIC), it
has developed what it calls the China Wide Web (www.cww.com).
</P>
<P>
   For the network, computers and software, it has relied on
western firms like Netscape, Oracle and Sun Microsystems. For
content, it offers some of the flashiest Chinese-language material
on the Internet. It buys news from leading western agencies, but
does not use anything controversial or offensive to the Chinese
government. Nor does it make apologies.
</P>
<P>
   What China's Internet industry most needs, according to Peter
Yip, CIC's vice president, is ``localized content that reflects our
heritage, our culture and our values.'' So, in a week when John
Glenn's space trip and the Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, both
made headlines worldwide, visitors to CWW could read only about
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to another CIC website (news.china.com) were invited to
peek at the ``News Site of the Week'' encouraged by the tag line
``We do the surfing for you.'' The link connected to a perfectly
pleasant and perfectly innocuous site called ``The Flora of
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Zhidong, one imagines, would be pleased to see his advice
being heeded once again. In his own day, he was widely hailed for
his wisdom and his words became something of a rallying cry for his
era's pragmatic reformers. But try as they did, they found it
difficult to unravel the foreign technology from the values that
produced it, and China's imperial system soon collapsed. &QL;

MUSIC REVIEW: UCHIDA PLAYS CHOPIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The music of Chopin seems to trigger in Mitsuko
Uchida's playing something close to raw emotion. So refined in
Mozart, so subtly introspective in Schubert, this estimable
Japanese pianist plunged headlong into two nocturnes, the 24
Preludes and the A-Flat ``Polonaise-Fantaisie'' on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The refinement and thoughtfulness were there for Chopin's more
leisurely moods, but the big statement, often in the form of an
up-tempo challenge, was met with impetuosity bordering on the
heedless. Even the B-flat minor Prelude, one of pianism's most
daunting races, set new standards for reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
   This Carnegie Hall recital began with Bach's G-minor ``English
Suite,'' an appropriate gesture given Chopin's status as Bach's
biggest fan. The nocturnes in B Major and E Major and the
``Polonaise-Fantaisie'' sought out Chopin in his blackest moods.
The first two couch lovely melodies in some of the most arcane and
original harmonies ever written. The last is a long and bitter
struggle, a black hole of a piece that emits its moments of light
only rarely.
</P>
<P>
   The Bach is scarcely less difficult, made more so by playing it
on a modern piano. The baritonal texture, clearer on earlier
instruments, clots on ones of newer invention. Indeed, the Prelude
sounded like early Brahms; the Musette almost lolled. Ms. Uchida's
stony insistence on the Sarabande's considerable dissonance entered
the 20th century. This is Bach reinvented, Bach translated into a
more contemporary language. And why not? Bach, like Shakespeare,
lends itself to successive reinventions, which is why both survive
so hardily.
</P>
<P>
   In the Preludes, Chopin pays tribute to Bach's ``Well-Tempered
Klavier.'' There are no fugues, but the format of major and
relative-minor keys progressing around the circle of fifths remain
his guide. The D-Major and B-Major items hurtled into
unintelligibility, but so genuine is Ms. Uchida's enthusiasm that
it was hard to complain. She has that unusual gift of making a
large hall seem small. Touch, color and a sense of scale help, but
mostly it is personality. Who else would play Schoenberg as an
encore?

GOP MEMBERS OF PANEL EXPECT BROADER CLINTON INQUIRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the opening gavel looming, Republicans on the
House Judiciary Committee planned late Tuesday to expand the
impeachment inquiry into President Clinton beyond his alleged
cover-up of a White House sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic members of the committee, which begins only the third
presidential impeachment investigation in the nation's history
Thursday, threatened to boycott the session.
</P>
<P>
   But late Tuesday, they relented after learning that the
president's lawyers would participate in cross-examination of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, the only witness set to appear
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats groused about plans by committee chairman Henry
Hyde of Illinois to question Democratic fund-raiser John Huang,
either in a public hearing or in sworn deposition, about alleged
hush money paid to longtime Clinton friend Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a closed-door meeting with GOP colleagues, Hyde
declined to discuss who he wants to question other than Starr.
``We're working on it,'' Hyde told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, as most Americans for the first time heard
the secretly taped voice of Lewinsky, Starr turned over to the
committee two more boxes of documents. The new information
reportedly relates to Hubbell, a former Justice Department official
and one-time law partner of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell was indicted last week on 15 charges, including lying
under oath about $100,000 he received from the Riadys, an
Indonesian family that employed Huang. Starr, who suspects that
Hubbell has taken hush money from the Riadys and other Clinton
supporters, has granted Huang immunity from prosecution in exchange
for help in determining whether Clinton was aware of the payments
to Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hubbell nor Huang were mentioned in Starr's 445-page
report to Congress in which he outlines 11 possible offenses that
he says could prompt the president's impeachment. The allegations,
which all grew out of Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky and his
effort to keep it secret, boil down to lying under oath, witness
tampering, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Starr turned over to Hyde's committee two boxes of
information from his investigation of Kathleen Willey's encounter
with Clinton and alleged efforts to convince her not to publicly
discuss it. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In two interviews under oath and once on national television,
Willey described a November 1993 incident outside the Oval Office
in which Clinton allegedly fondled her. Clinton acknowledged
meeting with Willey but denied any improper behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Willey also told investigators that a Democratic financier,
Maryland real estate developer Nathan Landow, discussed the
incident with her and urged her not to testify against the
president. When questioned before a federal grand jury, Landow
declined to testify citing his 5th Amendment right against
self-incrimination. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Willey and Hubbell documents were turned over to the
Judiciary Committee without reference to possible impeachable
offenses. However, by making the documents available, it frees
Starr to discuss those portions of his investigation without fear
of violating grand jury secrecy laws. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The New York Times quoted a lawyer familiar with Starr's
investigation as saying that when he appears Thursday the
prosecutor will put the allegations of presidential perjury and
obstruction of justice in the Lewinsky matter into ``historical
context'' by drawing parallels to the Willey and Hubbell incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to securing Huang's testimony, Hyde also discussed
with Republicans _ they have the votes to control the direction of
the committee's investigation without Democratic cooperation _
calling several other witnesses, including the president's personal
secretary, Betty Currie; his closest confidant and deputy White
House counsel Bruce Lindsey; and Lewinsky herself.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the committee released copies of audio tapes made by
Linda Tripp, a former White House secretary who befriended Lewinsky
when they both worked at the Pentagon. The tapes, secretly made by
Tripp during more than 20 hours of telephone conversations with
Lewinsky, provided Starr with enough information to seek expansion
of his four-year investigation of Clinton's business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans who have followed the sex scandal since it first
became public in January, the tapes also provide the first earful
of Lewinsky's earnest, sometimes high-pitched voice as she confides
in Tripp. Although transcripts from the tapes were made public in
early October, the sound of Lewinsky's voice was the last remaining
gap in the public's knowledge of the Valley Girl whose trysts with
Clinton near the Oval Office threaten his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At times silly, at other times moody or petulant, Lewinsky in a
few of the tapes weeps uncontrollably when she realizes her affair
with Clinton has ended. Tripp, who speaks in a throatier, more
mature voice, is often eating during the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Although a poll last week found that three of every four
Americans did not want the Tripp tapes released, the committee made
copies available Tuesday morning. Within minutes, segments were
being played on cable news television channels.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the president had not listened to the
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got more important things to do and more interesting
things to do,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows what's on these tapes. I think everybody has
seen all of the information they are going to see on this story. My
guess is that most people around the country won't be paying much
attention, but (for) the people obsessed with this story, this will
just be a day in heaven for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter delivered late Tuesday to Hyde, White House Counsel
Charles F.C. Ruff said he, special counsel Greg Craig and the
president's private attorney, David Kendall, accepted the
Republican's invitation to participate in Thursday's hearing.
Instead of the 30 minutes set aside by Hyde, Ruff said the
president's legal team would need 90 minutes to properly question
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde rejected the request.

 &HT;    McDuff executed in Texas
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than three decades after he committed the
first in a series of brutal murders and nearly 10 years after he
was freed from a crowded Texas prison system to kill again, Kenneth
Allen McDuff was executed Tuesday evening for the abduction and
slaying of a pregnant mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to be released; release me,'' McDuff said before he
died at 6:26 p.m. from a lethal injection that was administered
shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last minute plea to
delay the execution.
</P>
<P>
   He was the 17th Texas inmate executed this year.
</P>
<P>
   McDuff was put to death for the March 1992 abduction and slaying
of Melissa Ann Northrup, 22, a Waco convenience store clerk he once
worked with.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old McDuff also had been convicted and condemned for
the kidnapping and murder of 28-year-old Austinite Colleen Reed,
who was abducted in December 1991 from a downtown carwash.
</P>
<P>
   McDuff, whose crimes rallied lawmakers to embark on an
unprecedented $2 billion prison construction program and pass laws
to virtually shut down parole in the state, was also a suspect in
the disappearance of at least 11 others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't hurt anybody else and he doesn't control my life
anymore,'' said Lori Bible, Reed's sister, who chose not to witness
the execution, but who did travel to Huntsville where the execution
occurred. ``I don't have to go through another hearing, another
appeal and I don't have to look at him again.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuff, who once predicted that liver disease would kill him
before the state did, is believed to be the only condemned inmate
ever paroled and then returned to death row for another murder.
</P>
<P>
   For many, McDuff embodied evil. A prosecutor in the Northrup
case once described him as ``the monster who comes out of the dark
and snatches innocent people off the street and slaughters them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many followers of the McDuff saga believe the former machine
operator took to his death the answers to numerous unsolved crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Glen
Castlebury said that during McDuff's last days, investigators spent
hours grilling him in connection with other crimes and were
``satisfied that McDuff has no more information or is aware of any
more crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this fall, McDuff cooperated with authorities to help
them find the bodies of three of his victims _ Reed, Regina Moore
and Brenda Thompson _ the American-Statesman reported. Authorities
even took the extraordinary measure of pulling McDuff out of prison
under heavy guard so that he could show them where one body was
buried.
</P>
<P>
   After the bodies were found in late September and early October,
a 42-year-old nephew of McDuff's had a drug sentence cut from 15 to
ten years, sources said, although they deny that any explicit deal
was made.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials on Tuesday refused to confirm the story.
</P>
<P>
   As McDuff ate his final meal _ he ordered two16-ounce T-bone
steaks, five fried eggs, vegetables, french fries, coconut pie and
a Coke _ his lawyers were unsuccessfully arguing that the U.S.
Supreme Court should delay the execution for additional tests on
hair samples that authorities used to connect McDuff to the
Northrup killing.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Rosebud, a small town south of Waco, McDuff was sent
to prison for the first time in 1965 for burglary. He was paroled
10 months later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, McDuff and an 18-year-old companion abducted three
Tarrant County teens _ two boys and a girl _ from a ballpark near
Fort Worth. McDuff shot Robert Brand and Marcus Dunham in the face
as they begged for mercy and raped Edna Louise Sullivan before
strangling her with a broomstick, the accomplice told
investigators. McDuff was convicted of murdering the girl and
sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   But McDuff got a reprieve in 1972 when the U.S. Supreme Court
declared Texas' death penalty unconstitutional and his sentence was
commuted to a life term.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1989, he was paroled from a crowded Texas prison
system and within days of his release, the body of a 31-year-old
woman was found in Temple, where McDuff's parole officer was
located.
</P>
<P>
   A year after his release, McDuff returned to prison for
violating the terms of his parole. But within two months, in
December 1990, he was set free again.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, three women would disappear in Central
Texas. On Dec. 29, 1991, McDuff and an accomplice abducted Reed, an
accountant with the Lower Colorado River Authority, from a Fifth
Street car wash.
</P>
<P>
   McDuff's companion, Alva Hank Worley, told investigators that he
and McDuff repeatedly sexually assaulted and tortured Reed and
killed her in a field near Lake Belton. Reed's murder, coupled with
the infamous slayings of four teen-aged girls at a yogurt shop
several weeks earlier, helped shatter Austin's sense of small-town
security.
</P>
<P>
   Police said McDuff kidnapped Northrup in her own car from the
Quik-Pac store where she worked on March 1, 1992. Nearly two months
later, her body was found floating in a remote gravel pit, her
hands tied behind her back with shoestrings and a sock. An autopsy
disclosed she had been strangled with a rope.
</P>
<P>
   After investigators determined that McDuff had once worked with
Northrup and found his abandoned 1985 Thunderbird a block away from
the convenience store, he became the target of a nationwide
manhunt. After he was featured on the television show ``America's
Most Wanted,'' he was recognized and arrested in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted and sentenced to die for Northrup's murder in
February 1993, and received the same sentence in the Reed killing a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   A public outcry over his exploits and those of other freed
violent criminals led to tougher parole rules, a 1993 rewrite of
Texas' criminal laws to make them tougher and a construction
program that tripled the size of Texas' prison system in what
became the biggest prison expansion in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The McDuff case also helped spark an investigation of the parole
board. Board chairman James Granberry, who had voted to free
McDuff, was accused of lying under oath about working as a paid
consultant to parole applicants after he left the panel. Convicted
of perjury, Granberry served six months in a halfway house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should make sure we never forget him so we don't forget the
mistakes that were made by the system in releasing him,'' State
Sen. John Whitmire, the Houston Democrat who authored the 1993
overhaul of Texas' criminal laws, said of McDuff. ``I believe
safeguards are now in place to keep a Kenneth McDuff from every
being released early from prison again.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For China's aging, Soviet-trained leaders, the
Internet must seem a puzzling thing indeed. Information streams
through it at the speed of light, newfangled jargon swirls around
it and the whole mess is governed haphazardly, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its cutting-edge newness, the Internet poses what is
for China a very familiar problem: how to benefit from spectacular
new technology without being transformed by it.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Zhidong, a high ranking Qing Dynasty mandarin,
contemplated a similar dilemma late last century and proposed a
pithy formula for resolving it: ``Chinese learning for the
fundamental principles, Western learning for practical
application.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply substitute ``on-line content'' for ``fundamental
principles,'' and that is how China today is trying to limit the
social and political impact of its burgeoning involvement with the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As much as any nation, China stands to benefit by applying the
technology of the Internet to commerce, finance, science,
entertainment and education. More than most, however, it also has
reason to fear the Internet's freewheeling ways with uncensored
news and unapproved views.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities were quick to see the threat to their
near-total monopoly of news and information. About a decade ago
they began to set tight restrictions on anyone accessing foreign
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   But then there were few computers and telephone lines in China,
and, as the central telecoms authority controlled virtually all
access to international gateways, it was easy to block the path to
unfriendly foreign websites and to monitor any on-line shenanigans
within China.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is much harder, after rapid growth in both Chinese
telecoms and information services. As a result, Internet use in
China is skyrocketing. There were 1.5 million Chinese wangchong
(net bugs) by the end of July, and they are increasing by an
estimated 150,000 every month.
</P>
<P>
   The government expects to have 5 million Chinese Internet users
by the end of 2000; industry groups predict 9.4 million Chinese
will be surfing the Internet four years hence.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet businesses are glad to see such growth, they are
not yet sure how they will make money in China. Even in developed
markets it is tough enough. China also faces other challenges: its
tiny number of credit-card holders limits the prospects for
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, high access fees charged by the state-owned companies
that monopolize China's connections to the Internet make it hard
for China's estimated 200 Internet service providers to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any do, according to Yun Tao, vice-president of one
Beijing-based provider, Cenpok Intercom Technology. ``It is not yet
possible to make money in China on the Internet... I have been at
it for the last few years and I tell you, I am bleeding now,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chinese government, increasing Internet usage has not
only made adherence to Zhang's formula all the more important, but
has also forced a change in tactics. Rather than slap endlessly
(and increasingly ineffectively) at hands that click on to
disapproved sites, China is trying to lure the wangchong with its
own approved sites.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by China's state-run news agency, Xinhua, and the
central telecoms authority, China Internet Corporation (CIC), it
has developed what it calls the China Wide Web (www.cww.com).
</P>
<P>
   For the network, computers and software, it has relied on
western firms like Netscape, Oracle and Sun Microsystems. For
content, it offers some of the flashiest Chinese-language material
on the Internet. It buys news from leading western agencies, but
does not use anything controversial or offensive to the Chinese
government. Nor does it make apologies.
</P>
<P>
   What China's Internet industry most needs, according to Peter
Yip, CIC's vice president, is ``localized content that reflects our
heritage, our culture and our values.'' So, in a week when John
Glenn's space trip and the Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, both
made headlines worldwide, visitors to CWW could read only about
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to another CIC website (news.china.com) were invited to
peek at the ``News Site of the Week'' encouraged by the tag line
``We do the surfing for you.'' The link connected to a perfectly
pleasant and perfectly innocuous site called ``The Flora of
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Zhidong, one imagines, would be pleased to see his advice
being heeded once again. In his own day, he was widely hailed for
his wisdom and his words became something of a rallying cry for his
era's pragmatic reformers. But try as they did, they found it
difficult to unravel the foreign technology from the values that
produced it, and China's imperial system soon collapsed. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rookie quarterback Cory Sauter, a member of the Cardinals
practice squad, was waived by the team on Tuesday for violation of
NFL rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals quickly filled his spot by signing Andy
McCullough, a rookie receiver from Tennessee who was the New
Orleans Saints' seventh-round draft pick this year, to the practice
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Sauter (6 feet 4, 218 pounds), an undrafted rookie who holds
nearly every passing record at the University of Minnesota, was
waived after selling his complimentary tickets to the sold-out
Cowboys game for more than face value, a violation of league rules,
sources close to the situation said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals confirmed only that Sauter had been waived but
refused further comment.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough (6-3, 210) was a long threat for Tennessee
quarterback Payton Manning last season. His 22 receptions went for
a 19.3-yard average. &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ For China's aging, Soviet-trained leaders, the
Internet must seem a puzzling thing indeed. Information streams
through it at the speed of light, newfangled jargon swirls around
it and the whole mess is governed haphazardly, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its cutting-edge newness, the Internet poses what is
for China a very familiar problem: how to benefit from spectacular
new technology without being transformed by it.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Zhidong, a high ranking Qing Dynasty mandarin,
contemplated a similar dilemma late last century and proposed a
pithy formula for resolving it: ``Chinese learning for the
fundamental principles, Western learning for practical
application.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply substitute ``on-line content'' for ``fundamental
principles,'' and that is how China today is trying to limit the
social and political impact of its burgeoning involvement with the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As much as any nation, China stands to benefit by applying the
technology of the Internet to commerce, finance, science,
entertainment and education. More than most, however, it also has
reason to fear the Internet's freewheeling ways with uncensored
news and unapproved views.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities were quick to see the threat to their
near-total monopoly of news and information. About a decade ago
they began to set tight restrictions on anyone accessing foreign
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   But then there were few computers and telephone lines in China,
and, as the central telecoms authority controlled virtually all
access to international gateways, it was easy to block the path to
unfriendly foreign websites and to monitor any on-line shenanigans
within China.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is much harder, after rapid growth in both Chinese
telecoms and information services. As a result, Internet use in
China is skyrocketing. There were 1.5 million Chinese wangchong
(net bugs) by the end of July, and they are increasing by an
estimated 150,000 every month.
</P>
<P>
   The government expects to have 5 million Chinese Internet users
by the end of 2000; industry groups predict 9.4 million Chinese
will be surfing the Internet four years hence.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet businesses are glad to see such growth, they are
not yet sure how they will make money in China. Even in developed
markets it is tough enough. China also faces other challenges: its
tiny number of credit-card holders limits the prospects for
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, high access fees charged by the state-owned companies
that monopolize China's connections to the Internet make it hard
for China's estimated 200 Internet service providers to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any do, according to Yun Tao, vice-president of one
Beijing-based provider, Cenpok Intercom Technology. ``It is not yet
possible to make money in China on the Internet... I have been at
it for the last few years and I tell you, I am bleeding now,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chinese government, increasing Internet usage has not
only made adherence to Zhang's formula all the more important, but
has also forced a change in tactics. Rather than slap endlessly
(and increasingly ineffectively) at hands that click on to
disapproved sites, China is trying to lure the wangchong with its
own approved sites.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by China's state-run news agency, Xinhua, and the
central telecoms authority, China Internet Corporation (CIC), it
has developed what it calls the China Wide Web (www.cww.com).
</P>
<P>
   For the network, computers and software, it has relied on
western firms like Netscape, Oracle and Sun Microsystems. For
content, it offers some of the flashiest Chinese-language material
on the Internet. It buys news from leading western agencies, but
does not use anything controversial or offensive to the Chinese
government. Nor does it make apologies.
</P>
<P>
   What China's Internet industry most needs, according to Peter
Yip, CIC's vice president, is ``localized content that reflects our
heritage, our culture and our values.'' So, in a week when John
Glenn's space trip and the Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, both
made headlines worldwide, visitors to CWW could read only about
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to another CIC website (news.china.com) were invited to
peek at the ``News Site of the Week'' encouraged by the tag line
``We do the surfing for you.'' The link connected to a perfectly
pleasant and perfectly innocuous site called ``The Flora of
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Zhidong, one imagines, would be pleased to see his advice
being heeded once again. In his own day, he was widely hailed for
his wisdom and his words became something of a rallying cry for his
era's pragmatic reformers. But try as they did, they found it
difficult to unravel the foreign technology from the values that
produced it, and China's imperial system soon collapsed. &QL;

GET OVER IT, MICHAEL: AS RECORD FELL, COWBOYS WON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. Sullivan 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 11 seasons of close observation, a personal milestone was
achieved last Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   I caught the same number of passes as Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Alarming, I know. But look at it this way _ from where I sat in
Sun Devil Stadium's vertigo-inducing press box, a mere Leonid
meteor's throw from the playing field, I was probably more open
than Mike was.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy Aikman didn't throw to me, either. Which is exactly my
point.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman didn't have to. He and the Cowboys were too busy scoring
35 points.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for whatever reason, this story won't go away. Coach Chan
Gailey spent a far-too-generous portion of his weekly news
conference yesterday addressing the ``Irvin situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I need to go talk to him?'' Chan wondered aloud. ``I
probably will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I need to. But I probably will.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me suggest three words, Coach. Feel free to use them as
often as you feel necessary:
</P>
<P>
   Get ... over . . . it.
</P>
<P>
   As in, ``Get over it, Michael. We've got a season going on
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Irvin will. Maybe. I think. Won't he?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, he won't do anything drastic, like start giving people
haircuts. Or start tossing trash cans. Or, just to relieve the
frustration, go out and buy a new flaming-purple outfit.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, just a number. Most consecutive Cowboys games
catching a pass, 117. One teeny line in the franchise record book.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get over it. I think. Won't he?
</P>
<P>
   There is, indeed, a season going on here. An eye-opening season.
A season rich in promise, and perhaps getting richer.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever numbers the Cowboys accrue in this season of
resuscitation are relatively meaningless. The more poignant algebra
is that the new coach seems to know what he's doing. The
quarterback is happy. The running back has a bounce in his step
again. The offense has found new life.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, here was Gailey yesterday, having to say, ``I talked
to him. It was not easy on him. It was not easy on me. It was not
easy on anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to be the offensive coordinator when a 117-game
streak ends? But I was, and I'm sorry it had to end. I hate to see
it come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   And at that dramatic interlude, let's let it end, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   The streak means nothing. The abrupt ending of it says nothing
about Irvin, or about Irvin's bond with Aikman, or even about
Irvin's role in the Cowboys' new offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have weeks, unfortunately, when someone might
not catch a pass,'' Gailey admitted. ``Might go two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defenses say, `We're not going to get beat by Michael Irvin or
by someone else.' Where you get into trouble is when you can't get
the ball to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get him the ball,'' Gailey continued, ``but I
wasn't going to put in six hitches behind the line of scrimmage,
just to get him a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, again, is exactly the point. Gailey didn't have to
force-feed Irvin into the offense in Arizona last Sunday. The
gratuitous slant pass that Aikman aimed at him on the Cowboys'
final possession was dicey enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' defense, mostly Aeneas Williams, performed a
Michael-ectomy. Judging, however, from the 35 points that the same
defense allowed, I'd say the patient died.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three weekends, Ernie Mills has seven receptions.
Irvin, Billy Davis and David LaFleur each have six. And the Cowboys
are averaging 28.3 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Find the flying trash cans in that picture. I just don't see a
need for any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the passes go are dictated by the defense, not by us,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way around here, of course. It used to be,
circa 1997, that if Irvin was double-teamed, Aikman tried to
missile-shoot it in there anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The message of last Sunday is that Aikman doesn't need to. While
the defenses are escorting Michael, Emmitt Smith has run for 100
yards for the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are confused. They appear to be using last year's game
plans.
</P>
<P>
   They think Emmitt doesn't want to run hard anymore. They think
Nate Newton and Erik Williams are fat and overrated. They seem more
than willing to make Mills and Billy Davis have to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cowboys have a promising 7-3 season going on.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it in terms that Irvin can understand, it could mean
more jewelry. It could mean a ring.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing _ that was just a number. And he'll get over it.
I think.

SMITH'S CONTRACT EXTENDED  
 COYOTES REWARD GM WITH 3-YEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB McMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He loves the goaltending. He couldn't be happier about the play
of his defensemen. And he applauds the job being done by the
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   But what you won't hear from Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith
is anything self-congratulatory about the his role in the Coyotes'
8-2-2 start and eight-game unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Smith said flatly, ``I ``do'' mind. I want to be
in the background where I should be. It's the players and the
coaches who are sweating and bleeding out there. They deserve the
attention. Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but Smith has been rewarded for his efforts
nonetheless. On Tuesday, ``The Arizona Republic'' learned Smith has
been given a three-year contract extension from Coyotes Owner
Richard Burke.
</P>
<P>
   The deal actually was reached about two months ago, according to
Burke, who said the two met over lunch at a Scottsdale restaurant
and agreed to terms ``in less than five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's original contract was set to expire at the end of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him a couple times about it last year, if he was happy
what he was doing, if he liked where he was and if he wanted to
stay,'' Burke said. ``We got together a while back and he said he
was and he did, and I asked him how long (of an extension) he
wanted to start with. It was a pretty quick conversation _ even the
money part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, we got it done and he'll be around for a
while. . . . I'm committed to him and he's committed to the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Smith was asked specifically about his contract
situation during an interview on Monday, but he declined to reveal
he had signed any extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard and I have spoken about it, but it's not a big issue
with me,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the team chose to keep the signing under wraps without
so much as even a news release, Burke replied: ``I guess it didn't
occur to me. Bob probably preferred it that way. Besides, I didn't
view it as being there was any likelihood he was going anyplace.
Whether it was last month or six months from now, it was going to
get done.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been persistent rumors, however, that Smith was being
privately courted for an executive position by the expansion
Minnesota Wild, which will begin NHL play in two seasons. The
franchise has yet to name a general manager and Smith, the NHL's
Rookie of the Year in 1979, spent nine of his 15 years in the
league playing for the Minnesota North Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't ask (permission to speak with Smith). Jac wouldn't
do that,'' Burke said, referring to Jac K. Sperling, the chief
executive officer of the Wild. ``He and I are good friends and have
a good working relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   So do Burke and Smith, each of whom are relative neophytes at
running an NHL operation. They both got their start two years ago
when Burke bought the Winnipeg Jets and moved them to the Valley,
and Smith was brought in fresh after completing a Masters degree in
business at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Smith seems to have pulled all the right strings despite being
on the job for such a short time. This, after taking an exorbitant
amount of criticism after his first season in the front office,
which included the firing of rookie Coach Don Hay after Hay had
guided the team to a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith strengthened the club by trading for the likes of
center Jeremy Roenick and defensemen Keith Carney and Gerald Diduck
and signing free agents such as right wing Rick Tocchet and
defenseman Jyrki Lumme. He also picked up key role players like
center Bob Corkum and backup goalie Jimmy Waite in the Waiver
Draft, and prolonged the nucleus of the club by extending the
contracts of stars such as left wing Keith Tkachuk and defensemen
Teppo Numminen and Oleg Tverdovsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it last year and even the year before, Bob's done a
marvelous job,'' Burke said. ``Patience was necessary. Bob did what
we planned to do, which was try not to do everything over night or
make wholesale changes all at once. We're definitely seeing results
and improvement right now and the one person I feel the happiest
for is Bob Smith.'' &QL;

   Arizona Coach Dick Tomey hopes he's wrong. So does his team.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he's picking Southern California over unbeaten UCLA
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really look for UCLA to beat USC,'' Tomey said
Tuesday. ``I hope UCLA wins, but I would be very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   A UCLA victory figures prominently in Arizona's hopes for the
Rose Bowl. A loss would be UCLA's first in the Pac-10 and, more
importantly, probably would knock the Bruins out of the No. 2 spot
in the Bowl Championship Series rating. The top two BCS teams will
play for the national title at the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA falls from the BCS' top two, it automatically goes to
the Rose Bowl by virtue of its 55-28 victory at Arizona (10-1, 6-1
Pac-10).
</P>
<P>
   Tomey likes USC's chances because the Trojans were off last
Saturday while UCLA played at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big advantage to have a bye week late in the season
against a rival who is playing that week,'' he said. &QL;  &QL; 
Still talking &QL;  &QL; 
Wildcats cornerback Chris McAlister wasn't specific about the
trash-talk exchange he had Saturday with California receiver
Damaene Douglas throughout Arizona's 27-23 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, McAlister said, couldn't be printed in a
mainstream newspaper. A day after the game, Douglas told Bay area
media that most of the talk came from Wildcats associate head coach
and secondary coach Duane Akina, whose emotions are never far from
the surface. But, like McAlister, Douglas wasn't specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll keep that on the field,' said Douglas, who then took a
rip at UCLA Coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   After UCLA's victory over Cal, Toledo took shots at Douglas for
his uninterrupted talking during the game. Apparently, Douglas is
angry that Toledo chose to do his talking afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not like Toledo,'' said the Pac-10's leading receiver, who
did provide an edited summary of McAlister's commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said McAlister called him ``slow and said I couldn't
beat him long.''
</P>
<P>
   A postscript: Douglas also said McAlister was ``three or four
times better than any cornerback I had faced.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Briefly &QL;  &QL; 
Running back Trung Canidate, a junior from Central High, has a
chance to reach the 1,000-yard mark against Arizona State on Nov.
27. He has 937 yards. His game average, 93.7 yards, is second in
the conference to Washington State's Kevin Brown at 96.1. ASU's
J.R. Redmond ranks third at 90.2.
</P>
<P>
   Record rate: The Wildcats are averaging 430.2 yards a game in
total offense. Arizona's record, set in 1975, is 424.2. &QL;  &QL;

ADVERTISING: NEW CALVIN KLEIN CAMPAIGN FEATURES E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: CORRECTS title of novel to `Bridget Jones's Diary' in 19th
graf, The reply ...) 
(bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calvin Klein is going online.
</P>
<P>
   Klein is making his first foray into cyberspace with an
interactive campaign for CK One, the unisex fragrance from the
Calvin Klein Cosmetics Co. unit of Unilever. The scent has become a
worldwide best seller since its introduction in 1994, though sales
in the United States have flagged recently.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign replaces a previous one that featured corps of edgy
androgynes dishing out hip, flippant chatter. Now, a smaller cast
of slicker, sleeker characters use electronic mail in recounting
their fictitious, interconnected relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for CK One, estimated at $10 million, is indicative
of marketers' efforts to capitalize on the increasing consumer use
of personal computers. That is particularly true for brands seeking
to create personas that appeal to trend-setting shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is entering the
electronic-commerce realm by selling Levi's and Dockers apparel at
two World Wide Web sites, www.levi.com and www.dockers.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be of the moment,'' Klein, president and chief
executive at Calvin Klein Inc., said in an interview Monday at his
office in midtown Manhattan. ``To watch people who stand for what
the fragrance is all about communicate in the most modern way
speaks to the consumer we're trying to reach.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes e-mail appropriate, he added, is that it echoes how
``very personal'' the choice of a fragrance can be.
</P>
<P>
   The concept for the CK One campaign came from the New York
office of Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, the Portland, Ore., agency that handles
brands like Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Nike. The campaign was
developed in collaboration with CRK Advertising, the in-house
agency at Klein.
</P>
<P>
   By presenting cyberspace as the answer to the question ``Where
does Calvin Klein want to go today?'' the ads offer a contemporary
twist on a traditional ploy _ the serialized or continuing
campaign. Examples include the flirtatious couple hawking Taster's
Choice coffee for Nestle SA and the unconventional couples peddling
Klein's Obsession fragrance in surrealistic spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people will say `Who wants to talk to any of these
characters?' and you don't have to,'' Klein said, smiling. ``But
over the years we've found that people are interested in the
models, the characters, in our commercials, and want to find out
more about them.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail addresses of the CK One characters are featured
prominently in the campaign, which begins this week with television
commercials in Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America. The
initial three characters are Anna, a schoolgirl who is ``13 going
on 30,'' Klein said; Tia, a 20-something woman embarking on a
career, and Robert, a 40-ish urbanite.
</P>
<P>
   Missives to the three addresses _ anna(AT)cKone.com,
tia(AT)cKone.com and robert(AT)cKone.com _ are answered with
prepared responses meant to be in the characters' voices, in which
they ruminate on their complicated lives in and out of love. The
replies expand on remarks they make in the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Models portray the characters in the TV spots, as well as in
radio commercials, print ads and posters; the e-mails are actually
produced by Brant Mau, a copywriter at the Wieden &AMP; Kennedy office
in Portland, who works with the co-creative directors of the
agency's New York office, Stacy Wall and Michael Prieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is about now,'' said Prieve, who had been
co-creative director on the agency's Microsoft account, ``and
fashion is supposed to be. The question was how could we combine
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if people write back and say `This is a joke; I can't
believe you're doing this,''' he added, ``they're responding to the
campaign, and that's great, instead of just sitting around watching
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign _ titillating in a voyeuristic, ``Rear
Window''-meets-Windows way _ marks the first CK One work from
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy since its New York office was selected in
September to share brand duties with CRK Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   When an e-mail was sent to Anna's address, the reply resembled
the hasty, chatty online argot of teen-agers. It was centered on a
crush Anna has on a boy at school, who is ``smart and gorgeous and
totally perfect and really really sweet,'' and included emoticons
like : ) for a smile and : ( for a frown.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail reply from Tia, far more polished than Anna's,
described her new job at a ``superhot TV production house'' called
Manic _ an in joke? _ and her problematic love life involving
Jason, a boyfriend left behind in Seattle, and Ian, an ``annoying
guy'' she met during the shooting of a dog-food commercial in
London.
</P>
<P>
   The reply from Tia states, in a style evocative of the novel
``Bridget Jones's &UR;  &LR; Diary,'' ``Note to myself: Men equal Confusion.
Avoid at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   And Robert's reply, in world-weary tones, revealed him to be a
``happily married'' man on a business trip to London, who feels
``some unspoken connection'' to a woman he just met while shooting
a ``bloody dog-food commercial.'' Of course, it's Tia. (Later, it
turns out that Anna is his daughter.)
</P>
<P>
   There will be no fixed schedule by which computer users will
receive subsequent e-mail from the characters, said Robert Triefus,
senior vice president for worldwide communications at Klein, ``to
make it as realistic as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be surprising in the way e-mail can be,'' he added,
``with the next one coming immediately or a couple days later or a
couple weeks later.'' And if consumers tire of the cybersoap opera,
they can send e-mail asking for the correspondence to end.
</P>
<P>
   The story is intended as ``an unfolding drama,'' Prieve said,
and is not completely plotted out, so ``if everyone falls in love
with one character,'' his or her role can be expanded. Plans call
for as many as seven additional characters to be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with the characters, Prieve said, they will
``stay away from the piercings and the tattoos'' that were
hallmarks of the first batch of models promoting CK One. That shift
comes after a refocusing of Klein's apparel advertising this year
to emphasize a clean-cut look.
</P>
<P>
   And consumers will be spared static shots of the characters at
keyboards, Klein said, because ``it isn't really necessary to get
the idea what this is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Jacobs, vice president at CRK Advertising, said that the
campaign would begin in this country with television ads in 30
markets, radio spots in more than 20 markets and national
commercials on cable networks like MTV. The print ads and posters
will appear regionally and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials were directed by Mark Romanek and the print ads
and posters were photographed by Richard Burbridge; Steven Meisel
produced the original CK One campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As plugged in as the new campaign is supposed to be, the Klein
foray into cyberspace is only partial.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always said to us we should have a Web site for
image,'' Klein said. ``We'll get there because I'm convinced it
will mean enormous business one day, but it's not the main priority
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And though his company is moving online, Klein is remaining most
resolutely off line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to sit in a room and e-mail,'' Klein said.
``My life just doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``I can't type'' _ though he is ``debating
whether I should take lessons.''

 &HT;    Marietta pastor elected president
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ga. _ Georgia Baptists meeting at the Columbus Civic
Center unanimously elected a Marietta, Ga. pastor as the new
president of their convention, signalling that the acrimony of many
recent presidential races has ended.
</P>
<P>
   With conservatives firmly in control and moderates, for the most
part, absent, the Rev. J. Gerald Harris, 57, pastor of Eastside
Baptist Church in Cobb County, was unopposed to succeed the Rev.
Frank Cox, pastor of North Metro First Baptist Church in
Lawrenceville as head of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In his nominating speech, the Rev. Tony Dickerson of Pinehurst
Baptist Church in Columbus described Harris as ``a Baptist
blue-blood '' with degrees from Mercer University in Macon and
Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C.
Harris, said Dickerson, ``has consistently sounded the trumpet of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference following his election, Harris said he
hopes to ``continue to build a sense of oneness and unity'' among
Georgia Baptists. ``I do think there are a lot of things we can
agree on, such as evangelism and missions,'' he said. ``I will open
my arms to all Georgia Baptists and look forward to seeing what we
can do together.'' Harris preached a rousing ``doctrinal sermon''
at the convention Tuesday morning, telling the 2,000-plus
``messengers'' and their families, ``there's got to be a greater
reason for us to stick together than stick-togetherness. What we as
Baptists can do when we decide to walk cooperatively _ we can make
a profound difference in this world for Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of North Carolina, growing up in a church pastored by
his grandfather, Harris said, he accepted Christ at age 9 and felt
called to full-time Christian service as an adolescent attending a
camp with former University of Alabama football star John Oliver,
who became a missionary to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior in high school, he said, he knew he would be a
pastor, and as a sophomore in college, he became minister at a
small Baptist church near Sparta. He served as youth pastor in
Barnesville and pastored churches in North Carolina, South Carolina
and Mississippi before returning to Georgia as pastor of Peachtree
Corners Baptist Church in 1990. In 1994, he moved to Eastside, now
a church of 6,000 members but, he jokes, ``it would take the CIA
and a thousand bloodhounds to find them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Danny Watters of Douglasville, a member of the
convention's executive committee, said Harris is ``a charismatic
leader who will appeal to all Georgia Baptists.''
</P>
<P>
   His election, said Watters, shows ``a unity among Georgia
Baptists we haven't had for many, many years. I think in that unity
we're going to be able to do more missions and evangelism than we
have ever done as a convention.''

GET OVER IT, MICHAEL: AS RECORD FELL, COWBOYS WON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 11 seasons of close observation, a personal milestone was
achieved last Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   I caught the same number of passes as Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Alarming, I know. But look at it this way _ from where I sat in
Sun Devil Stadium's vertigo-inducing press box, a mere Leonid
meteor's throw from the playing field, I was probably more open
than Mike was.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy Aikman didn't throw to me, either. Which is exactly my
point.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman didn't have to. He and the Cowboys were too busy scoring
35 points.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for whatever reason, this story won't go away. Coach Chan
Gailey spent a far-too-generous portion of his weekly news
conference yesterday addressing the ``Irvin situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I need to go talk to him?'' Chan wondered aloud. ``I
probably will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I need to. But I probably will.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me suggest three words, Coach. Feel free to use them as
often as you feel necessary:
</P>
<P>
   Get ... over . . . it.
</P>
<P>
   As in, ``Get over it, Michael. We've got a season going on
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Irvin will. Maybe. I think. Won't he?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, he won't do anything drastic, like start giving people
haircuts. Or start tossing trash cans. Or, just to relieve the
frustration, go out and buy a new flaming-purple outfit.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, just a number. Most consecutive Cowboys games
catching a pass, 117. One teeny line in the franchise record book.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get over it. I think. Won't he?
</P>
<P>
   There is, indeed, a season going on here. An eye-opening season.
A season rich in promise, and perhaps getting richer.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever numbers the Cowboys accrue in this season of
resuscitation are relatively meaningless. The more poignant algebra
is that the new coach seems to know what he's doing. The
quarterback is happy. The running back has a bounce in his step
again. The offense has found new life.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, here was Gailey yesterday, having to say, ``I talked
to him. It was not easy on him. It was not easy on me. It was not
easy on anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to be the offensive coordinator when a 117-game
streak ends? But I was, and I'm sorry it had to end. I hate to see
it come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   And at that dramatic interlude, let's let it end, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   The streak means nothing. The abrupt ending of it says nothing
about Irvin, or about Irvin's bond with Aikman, or even about
Irvin's role in the Cowboys' new offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have weeks, unfortunately, when someone might
not catch a pass,'' Gailey admitted. ``Might go two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defenses say, `We're not going to get beat by Michael Irvin or
by someone else.' Where you get into trouble is when you can't get
the ball to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get him the ball,'' Gailey continued, ``but I
wasn't going to put in six hitches behind the line of scrimmage,
just to get him a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, again, is exactly the point. Gailey didn't have to
force-feed Irvin into the offense in Arizona last Sunday. The
gratuitous slant pass that Aikman aimed at him on the Cowboys'
final possession was dicey enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' defense, mostly Aeneas Williams, performed a
Michael-ectomy. Judging, however, from the 35 points that the same
defense allowed, I'd say the patient died.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three weekends, Ernie Mills has seven receptions.
Irvin, Billy Davis and David LaFleur each have six. And the Cowboys
are averaging 28.3 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Find the flying trash cans in that picture. I just don't see a
need for any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the passes go are dictated by the defense, not by us,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way around here, of course. It used to be,
circa 1997, that if Irvin was double-teamed, Aikman tried to
missile-shoot it in there anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The message of last Sunday is that Aikman doesn't need to. While
the defenses are escorting Michael, Emmitt Smith has run for 100
yards for the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are confused. They appear to be using last year's game
plans.
</P>
<P>
   They think Emmitt doesn't want to run hard anymore. They think
Nate Newton and Erik Williams are fat and overrated. They seem more
than willing to make Mills and Billy Davis have to beat them.
</P>

   Putting it in terms that Irvin can understand, it could mean

FIXES SLUG, BYLINE 
GET OVER IT, MICHAEL: AS RECORD FELL, COWBOYS WON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 11 seasons of close observation, a personal milestone was
achieved last Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   I caught the same number of passes as Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Alarming, I know. But look at it this way _ from where I sat in
Sun Devil Stadium's vertigo-inducing press box, a mere Leonid
meteor's throw from the playing field, I was probably more open
than Mike was.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy Aikman didn't throw to me, either. Which is exactly my
point.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman didn't have to. He and the Cowboys were too busy scoring
35 points.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for whatever reason, this story won't go away. Coach Chan
Gailey spent a far-too-generous portion of his weekly news
conference yesterday addressing the ``Irvin situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I need to go talk to him?'' Chan wondered aloud. ``I
probably will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I need to. But I probably will.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me suggest three words, Coach. Feel free to use them as
often as you feel necessary:
</P>
<P>
   Get ... over . . . it.
</P>
<P>
   As in, ``Get over it, Michael. We've got a season going on
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Irvin will. Maybe. I think. Won't he?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, he won't do anything drastic, like start giving people
haircuts. Or start tossing trash cans. Or, just to relieve the
frustration, go out and buy a new flaming-purple outfit.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, just a number. Most consecutive Cowboys games
catching a pass, 117. One teeny line in the franchise record book.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get over it. I think. Won't he?
</P>
<P>
   There is, indeed, a season going on here. An eye-opening season.
A season rich in promise, and perhaps getting richer.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever numbers the Cowboys accrue in this season of
resuscitation are relatively meaningless. The more poignant algebra
is that the new coach seems to know what he's doing. The
quarterback is happy. The running back has a bounce in his step
again. The offense has found new life.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, here was Gailey yesterday, having to say, ``I talked
to him. It was not easy on him. It was not easy on me. It was not
easy on anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to be the offensive coordinator when a 117-game
streak ends? But I was, and I'm sorry it had to end. I hate to see
it come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   And at that dramatic interlude, let's let it end, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   The streak means nothing. The abrupt ending of it says nothing
about Irvin, or about Irvin's bond with Aikman, or even about
Irvin's role in the Cowboys' new offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have weeks, unfortunately, when someone might
not catch a pass,'' Gailey admitted. ``Might go two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defenses say, `We're not going to get beat by Michael Irvin or
by someone else.' Where you get into trouble is when you can't get
the ball to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get him the ball,'' Gailey continued, ``but I
wasn't going to put in six hitches behind the line of scrimmage,
just to get him a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, again, is exactly the point. Gailey didn't have to
force-feed Irvin into the offense in Arizona last Sunday. The
gratuitous slant pass that Aikman aimed at him on the Cowboys'
final possession was dicey enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' defense, mostly Aeneas Williams, performed a
Michael-ectomy. Judging, however, from the 35 points that the same
defense allowed, I'd say the patient died.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three weekends, Ernie Mills has seven receptions.
Irvin, Billy Davis and David LaFleur each have six. And the Cowboys
are averaging 28.3 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Find the flying trash cans in that picture. I just don't see a
need for any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the passes go are dictated by the defense, not by us,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way around here, of course. It used to be,
circa 1997, that if Irvin was double-teamed, Aikman tried to
missile-shoot it in there anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The message of last Sunday is that Aikman doesn't need to. While
the defenses are escorting Michael, Emmitt Smith has run for 100
yards for the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are confused. They appear to be using last year's game
plans.
</P>
<P>
   They think Emmitt doesn't want to run hard anymore. They think
Nate Newton and Erik Williams are fat and overrated. They seem more
than willing to make Mills and Billy Davis have to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cowboys have a promising 7-3 season going on.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it in terms that Irvin can understand, it could mean
more jewelry. It could mean a ring.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing _ that was just a number. And he'll get over it.
I think.

IGNORE PREVIOUS 
SEVERAL COMPONENTS SUGGEST GONZALEZ WILL WIN MVP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rangers outfielder Juan Gonzalez played on a first-place team
this year and led the American League in runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Those two factors make him the favorite to be named the American
League most valuable player when the results are announced today.
The balloting is done by two baseball writers from each American
League market.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the voting since the award was instituted in 1931
shows voters tend to first favor players who perform on a winning
team and, second, who lead the league in RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 134 previous winners in both leagues, 92 played on a
first-place team. That includes Gonzalez, who won his first MVP
award in 1996 when he led the Rangers to a division title.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics also weigh heavily, and RBI seem to be the voters'
favorite. Fifty players who have led their league in RBI have gone
on to be named MVP. Only 28 home-run champions, 23 batting
champions and 18 pitchers have won MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he has as good of a chance as anybody if you look at
his numbers,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``What would we
have done without him? Our story would have been totally
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez drove in 157 runs this past season in leading the
Rangers to another division title. That was the most RBI in a
season by one player since Ted Williams and Vern Stephens drove in
159 in 1949 for the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Rangers player to win an MVP award was outfielder
Jeff Burroughs, who was honored in 1974 after leading the league
with 118 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Gonzalez is the best,'' said St. Louis first baseman
Mark McGwire, who gained much more attention hitting 70 home runs.
``He's not just a home-run hitter, he's a great hitter. RBI are
somewhat overlooked. But you talk to any hitter who gets the big
bucks and he'll tell you the biggest thing is getting runners in.
I'll take a bloop single to drive in a run any day, but that
doesn't excite people.''
</P>
<P>
   It does MVP voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of RBI,'' Gonzalez said. ``MVP would be great,
very exciting. I put up good numbers, but it's not up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has another advantage, one that worked for him in 1996.
Despite another good season by catcher Ivan Rodriguez, Gonzalez is
the clear MVP candidate from the Rangers. Three other teams have
two equally strong candidates: Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez, New York's Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter and Boston's
Mo Vaughn and Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez won by three points over Alex Rodriguez in 1996.
Gonzalez got 11 first-place votes, Rodriguez got 10 and Griffey
received four. Controversy erupted in Seattle when the two voters
there revealed they voted for Griffey instead of Rodriguez. If they
had voted for Rodriguez, he would have won the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the Yankees as a team, he's as good as you can
pick,'' Oates said. ``It's either him or the Yankees team.''
</P>
<P>
   History strongly suggests it will be Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   National baseball writer T.R. Sullivan handicaps the leading
contenders for AL MVP:
Juan Gonzalez, RF, Rangers, 3-1 .318, 110 runs, 45 HR, 157 RBI
</P>
<P>
   Leading in RBI will make the difference
Nomar Garciaparra, SS, Boston Red Sox, 5-1 .323, 111 runs, 35 HR,
122 RBI
</P>
<P>
   Being pushed by East Coast media
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, SS, New York Yankees, 6-1 .324, 127 runs, 19 HR, 84
RBI
</P>
<P>
   Best player on one of the greatest teams ever
Ken Griffey Jr., CF, Seattle Mariners, 7-1 .284, 120 runs, 56 HR,
146 RBI
</P>
<P>
   Great HR year overshadowed by McGwire.
Alex Rodriguez, SS, Seattle Mariners, 7-1 .310, 123 runs, 42 HR,
124 RBI
</P>
<P>
   First 40-40 season ever by a SS
Albert Belle, LF, Chicago White Sox, 10-1 .328, 113 runs, 49 HR,
152 RBI
</P>
<P>
   Great, but virtually meaningless second half
Manny Ramirez, RF, Cleveland Indians, 10-1 .294, 108 runs, 45 HR,
145 RBI
</P>
<P>
   Reputation as a rockhead hurts him
Ivan Rodriguez, C, Rangers, 12-1 .321, 88 runs, 21 HR, 91 RBI
</P>
<P>
   Great defense always overlooked
Mo Vaughn, 1B, Boston Red Sox .337, 107 runs, 40 HR, 115 RBI
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra wins Red Sox primary
Bernie Williams, CF, Yankees, 15-1 .339, 101 runs, 26 HR, 97 RBI
</P>
<P>
   Injuries keep stats lower than others

YANKS TALK TO BELLE, WITH WILLIAMS ON DECK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill., Md., Mass., Mo., Ariz., Canada)  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees' aggressive pursuit of the
slugger Albert Belle appears to be accelerating negotiations with
another free agent, Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, has asked to meet with George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Boras is looking to engage in his first face-to-face negotiation
with any Yankee official since the star center fielder became a
free agent last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the mean time, the Yankees will play host to another
free-agent outfielder, Brian Jordan, at Yankee Stadium Wednesday.
Jordan will meet with New York Mets officials Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boras could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but the meeting
will come at a critical time in the Yankees' courtship of Belle,
who hit 49 home runs for the Chicago White Sox this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, played golf with Belle in
Phoenix on Tuesday, and Brian Cashman, the team's general manager,
met with the player and his agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he was very interested in us,'' Torre said.
``He was easy to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the temperamental Belle, Steinbrenner asked rhetorically:
``Can you handle him? I believe we can. It's what my manager wants
and my general manager wants. I have no fear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees were to sign Belle _ who may draw a four- or
five-year offer of between $10 million and $13 million a year from
the Yankees _ they would presumably end negotiations with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The ties would be cut between the center fielder and the team
for which he has starred and led to two world championships. In
addition, the Yankees' withdrawal from negotiations with Williams
could cost the center fielder millions and millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Mike Piazza signed a seven-year, $91 million
contract with the Mets, Boras suggested that Williams could get an
even richer contract than the all-star catcher did. Boras maintains
that a large number of teams remain interested in Williams, though,
as his consistent practice, he declines to identify those teams.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, however, it appears as if the market for
Williams has shrunk dramatically in the last month. The Los Angeles
Dodgers were said to be interested, but they signed Devon White.
The Colorado Rockies supposedly were ready to make a major push,
but they re-signed Darryl Hamilton and are focusing their efforts
on Kevin Brown. Texas apparently will not make a significant offer
to Williams because they do not want to complicate future
negotiations with Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles have stated an interest in Williams, but
probably would not be willing to offer him anything close to the
package to which Boras referred. (The Orioles have offered a
three-year, $22.5 million deal to their own free agent first
baseman, Rafael Palmeiro.)
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox are meeting with Williams on Thursday and
Friday, and it is unclear whether they would be willing to offer
Williams more than the failed five-year, $63 million deal they
dangled before popular first baseman Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks met with Williams last week and their
interest in Williams appears to be sincere. But executives with
other teams believe the Diamondbacks are the front-runners in the
bidding war for left-hander Randy Johnson. What is not known is
whether any Arizona offer to Williams would be diminished in the
event the Diamondbacks sign the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' interest in Williams has always served as a
negotiating anchor for Boras, but now the Yankees may be pulling
out and that could curtail Williams' asking price. The Yankees are
serious about Belle; Cashman's get-together Tuesday with Belle and
his agent is said by others to have gone well.
</P>
<P>
   Arn Tellem, Belle's agent, is expected to field offers from the
Red Sox and the Yankees in the next 48 hours and perhaps complete a
deal by the weekend. Belle also has the option of returning to the
Chicago White Sox for the remaining three years and $30 million of
a deal he signed after the 1996 season. Belle must make that
decision by Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan appears to be the Yankees' third choice, for now. He will
meet with officials Wednesday at Yankee Stadium, after having met
with the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday. Jim Turner, Jordan's agent,
said the discussions with the Braves were ``extremely productive,''
though he declined to say whether Atlanta made any concrete offers.
Jordan will also meet with the Orioles later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have also approached the Anaheim Angels about a
possible trade for center fielder Jim Edmonds and the Montreal
Expos about a deal for Rondell White, who has specifically asked
his team to trade him to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Montreal general manager Jim Beattie said any team
interested in acquiring the 26-year-old White would have to give up
a lot to get him.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their effort to complete a 1999 contract with Darryl
Strawberry, Yankee officials will gather with representatives of
the players' union and the owners' Players Relations Committee
Wednesday. Eric Grossman, who represents Strawberry, said the deal
eventually will be completed, with the Yankees paying the
outfielder $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees do not want his salary to be subject to a luxury
tax in the event that Strawberry, who is recovering from colon
cancer, is unable to play for part or all of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said Strawberry had four rounds of chemotherapy last
week and suffered no side effects. Strawberry's weight, Grossman
said, has increased from the low 180s to 205 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's even started throwing some light weights around,'' said
Grossman, who reiterated that Strawberry's intent is to be ready to
play next season.

   NEW YORK _ A parolee charged with shooting a Brooklyn pawnshop

<P>
   The suspect, Demeris Tolbert, committed at least one of the
killings, three other shootings and three robberies over the last
year while out on parole after serving 30 months of a 54-month
sentence for a 1994 drug conviction, Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   The case was the latest example used by Safir and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in their push for New York to join 28 states and the
federal government in abolishing parole. A law that sharply limits
parole for first-time violent offenders in the state _ requiring
them to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences _ went into
effect Sept. 1, but Safir said Tuesday that the law had not gone
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night's shooting is probably as graphic an example of why
parole should be abolished as any I've seen since becoming a police
commissioner,'' Safir said Tuesday. ``It is incredible to me how we
can continue to let felons like this out on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert, 30, and a 15-year-old described by the police as an
accomplice were arrested shortly after 8 p.m. Monday in connection
with the killing of Savinder Oberio, a pawnbroker whom police said
the suspects tried to rob as he walked near his store. The suspects
then fled to a housing project, where officers confronted them and
ordered them to come out with their hands up, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age suspect, not identified because of his age, began
to comply, police said, but Tolbert opened fire and shot Officer
Tanagiot Benekos in the hand. Benekos' partner, Dominick Cappiello,
barely escaped injury when a bullet tore through his pant leg,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects then fled, but were captured shortly afterward,
police said. The officers were treated at a hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert was charged with second-degree murder, two counts of
attempted murder of a police officer, criminal possession of a
weapon and criminal trespass, police said. If convicted of the
murder, he could face up to life in prison. The teen-ager was
charged with the same counts.
</P>
<P>
   The case gained special attention from Safir because of
Tolbert's long criminal record and his troubles while on parole.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested for his first robbery just before his 14th birthday,
Tolbert has spent much time since then in the criminal-justice
system on robbery, drug sales and drug possession convictions, a
cycle prosecutors call ``doing life 90 days at a time.'' He was
most recently convicted in 1994 for possessing and selling
controlled substances, and sentenced the following June to a
54-month prison term.
</P>
<P>
   But Tolbert did not remain for his full sentence, according to
police records, which show that he was released on Jan. 27, 1998,
and then placed on parole until April 26, 2003. The release was
discretionary, said Thomas Grant, a spokesman for the state
Division of Parole, adding that ``under the statutes, the parole
board has the authority to grant discretionary relief and in the
case of this individual they exercised that authority.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Once out on the street, he returned to a life of crime, Safir
said, adding that Tolbert has admitted to at least one other
murder, a bank robbery, two other robberies, one attempted robbery
and three shootings over the last 11 months. Safir also said
Tolbert had confessed to three other murders, committed in Brooklyn
in 1989, 1990 and 1991, but he refused to discuss details of those
killings or any of the other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses recalled the shock of hearing gunshots Monday
afternoon and seeing Oberio as he lay bleeding on the sidewalk near
his store. Customers and fellow business owners said Oberio, who
was married with three daughters and a son and who came to the
United States from India 20 years ago, kept money in the pawnshop's
safe, which was out in the open, a fact that may have tempted
robbers to attack him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was usually fair,'' said Hazel Miner, a 48-year-old
customer who said she pawned jewelry at his store every four months
or so for extra cash. ``I just hope he didn't fight to protect the
gold. It isn't worth dying for.''
</P>
<P>
   Daljeed Oberio, the victim's brother, echoed the calls to end
parole. Speaking of Tolbert, he said: ``This has killed us. If this
guy were still serving his prison term, my brother might still be
alive.''

<P>
   Just eight days ago, former Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds
sat down to dinner with Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz in
Baghdad. The two men had already spent four hours in Aziz's office
_ Reynolds reminding the Iraqi of the need for compromise in any
crisis, Saddam's man (in full militia uniform) insisting, over and
over again, that it was Washington's intention to destroy Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the two men resumed their talks at the Iraqi
official's home, Mrs. Aziz was already cooking their dinner in the
kitchen: a traditional Iraqi dish of rice, chicken and lamb
followed by ice cream and six cups of tea. Alcohol is banned for
all officials in Baghdad. Reynolds has always been a teetotaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tariq Aziz's suspicion was that the Americans wanted to wipe
out the Iraqi people,'' Reynolds told me last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that repeatedly. He said if there was any other nation
subjected to this treatment of sanctions, it would be regarded as a
slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who helped to frame Northern Ireland's ``peace process''
was, of course, virtually ignored when he left Baghdad. By the time
he arrived on business in New York at the end of last week _ when
the Stealth bombers were already lining up on the runways _ he was
able only to talk on the phone to a few lowly State Department
officials about this trip. America didn't want any messages from
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   When Reynolds drove around to the headquarters of the United
Nations Security Council Official Monitors (UNSCOM) in Baghdad, he
was also told _ by one of three inspectors he met _ an intriguing
piece of information. A Finnish U.N. arms inspector claimed that
UNSCOM was only probably three months from completing its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have the Iraqis been told this?'' Reynolds wanted to know. The
U.N. man had no idea _ it wasn't his job to talk to the Iraqis.
Reynolds went back to Tariq Aziz. Aziz said: ``Decisions might have
been taken very differently if Iraq had known about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's easy to exaggerate a dinner-time chat between a Saddam
underling and an ex-Taoiseach of Ireland. Reynolds was a powerless
attention-seeker, a U.S. Official said privately. And it's true
that Richard Butler, UNSCOM's head, had several times stated, if
somewhat cynically, that the inspectors'' work had been nearing its
end.
</P>
<P>
   But Reynolds had, nonetheless, touched the roots of this latest
miserable, billion dollar crisis: Iraq's belief _ almost
unalterable and certainly not without reason _ that the U.S. never
intends to lift sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Tariq Aziz's comments to Reynolds can be found in the annex to
this weekend's Iraqi letter to the Security Council which
ultimately kept the bombers on the ground _ though it contains no
reference to that $100 million which the U.S. Congress has voted to
overthrow the Iraqi regime. The U.N. can hardly be blamed for that.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, then, it all came back to the purpose of sanctions
rather than the undiscovered anthrax spores which may or may not
remain in Saddam Hussein's laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds had been sickened by the medical conditions and deaths
of thousands of Iraqi civilians. Yet oddly, this plight has in a
perverted way become just another reason to continue the U.N.'s
ruthless sanctions machinery.
</P>
<P>
   When Madeleine Albright stood up at the U.N. to demand a
continuation of sanctions recently, she argued her case by saying
that there was photographic evidence that Saddam Hussein was
continuing to build massive and opulent palaces for himself and his
personal entourage all over Iraq. Aerial pictures showed the
buildings under construction.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam Hussein could go on amassing his personal wealth, then
sanctions had yet to bite him. The irony, of course, is that those
who wish to maintain the embargo do so by demonstrating its
failure. For if Saddam can still build palaces, then U.N. sanctions
clearly do not work _ but Madelaine Albright tried to argue the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   European nations believe that sanctions have become a kind of
dogma. Since they haven't worked for eight years, they must go on _
and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is asking about what the French call the ``very
strong smell of petroleum'' that surrounds the pax Americana in the
Gulf. If the oil embargo was lifted, where would the current low
price of oil collapse to?
</P>
<P>
   Like a bad Western, both Baghdad and Washington appear to have
adopted totally irrational policies. The Americans want to use
force without knowing what they will do afterwards. The Iraqis risk
an American offensive because they do not know if they have a
future.
</P>
<P>
   Questions rather than rhetoric might be a worthy outcome of the
latest nonsense in the Gulf. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ From the rise of television to the development of
Internet publishing, technology has often appeared as a threat to
the newspaper industry because of its potential for siphoning
readers and advertising revenues to new media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Now an upstart U.S. company, PressPoint, hopes to turn that
presumption upside down by launching global printed editions of a
stable of international newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Through an alliance with Xerox Corp. announced Monday,
PressPoint plans to deliver on-demand copies of titles like El
Mundo of Spain, Der Standard of Austria and The Times of London to
business travelers at hotels in major cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Primis, the company's chairman and a former president of
The New York Times Co., called it the newspaper equivalent of
narrowcasting, whereby television broadcasters use the
proliferation of channels afforded by digital technology to aim
programming at smaller and smaller audiences.
</P>
<P>
   While globalization has bolstered the market for a handful of
truly international newspapers, PressPoint intends to use digital
printing technology to open up the global market for many smaller,
regional titles.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is not to publish a global view, but to take local news
around the globe, or as Primis put it in an interview here, ``give
the business traveler something from home.''
</P>
<P>
   George Brock, managing editor of The Times of London, said
PressPoint offered ``an extremely effective way'' of reaching
readers in North America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to spread our international presence,'' said Julio de
Andres, deputy general manager at El Mundo. Currently, the paper
sells only about 5,000 copies a day outside Spain and reaches U.S.
newsstands a day late.
</P>
<P>

SAFETY PANEL CITES POOR OVERSIGHT OF PUBLIC BUSES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mo., Wash., Tenn.) (fb) 
By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reviewing four bus accidents, including a fatal
crash in New York City last year, the National Transportation
Safety Board said Tuesday that the federal government cannot spot
hazardous conditions for public transit buses because data
collection and oversight are poor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the board said that the Transportation Department agency
that helps finance public transit, the Federal Transit
Administration, cannot even accurately count the number of people
killed each year in accidents involving such buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a void,'' said James E. Hall, the board's chairman, who
said that federal oversight of other modes of transportation was
much better. ``There's no reason for bus passengers to be
second-class citizens in regard to safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The board met Tuesday to discuss a staff report on bus safety
that looked at the four bus accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York case, a driver apparently suffered a seizure and
his bus ran uncontrolled for seven blocks, killing a pedestrian and
critically injuring a New York Times reporter, Neil MacFarquhar,
who was riding a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The board also looked at an accident in Normandy, Mo., in which
a trainee killed four people at a bus stop, and another in
Cosmopolis, Wash., in which a 10-year-old boy stepping off a public
transit bus was killed by a utility truck. The fourth accident
studied was in Nashville, where a bus hit several other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said after the meeting that the New York bus driver ``had
been involved in two injury-causing accidents in 15 years preceding
this accident,'' and was known to have a history of alcoholism,
which can contribute to seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to be there in an oversight role, overseeing
safety,'' Hall said. He said that of the four systems studied, only
the New York one had any state oversight, and even that had not
been sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal government should impose safety standards on
bus systems that receive federal aid, or have the states do so. The
Federal Transit Administration provides about $2.5 billion a year
for bus operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Federal Transit Administration, Mary
Knapp, said that the head of her agency's safety office had
attended the meeting but would not comment until the board's report
was formally delivered, in one to six months.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board also found that the Federal Transit
Administration cannot keep track of bus fatalities, in some years
counting as many as 40 fewer than a sister agency, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which compiles statistics on
all road deaths.

   LONDON _ From the rise of television to the development of
Internet publishing, technology has often appeared as a threat to
the newspaper industry because of its potential for siphoning
readers and advertising revenues to new media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Now an upstart U.S. company, PressPoint, hopes to turn that
presumption upside down by launching global printed editions of a
stable of international newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Through an alliance with Xerox Corp. announced Monday,
PressPoint plans to deliver on-demand copies of titles like El
Mundo of Spain, Der Standard of Austria and The Times of London to
business travelers at hotels in major cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Primis, the company's chairman and a former president of
The New York Times Co., called it the newspaper equivalent of
narrowcasting, whereby television broadcasters use the
proliferation of channels afforded by digital technology to aim
programming at smaller and smaller audiences.
</P>
<P>
   While globalization has bolstered the market for a handful of
truly international newspapers, PressPoint intends to use digital
printing technology to open up the global market for many smaller,
regional titles.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is not to publish a global view, but to take local news
around the globe, or as Primis put it in an interview here, ``give
the business traveler something from home.''
</P>
<P>
   George Brock, managing editor of The Times of London, said
PressPoint offered ``an extremely effective way'' of reaching
readers in North America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to spread our international presence,'' said Julio de
Andres, deputy general manager at El Mundo. Currently, the paper
sells only about 5,000 copies a day outside Spain and reaches U.S.
newsstands a day late.
</P>
<P>
   PressPoint's global editions are a cross between a tabloid
newspaper and an office document. The stapled, 32-page publications
are printed by Xerox's worldwide document service on 11-by-17-inch
coated paper with four-color capability.
</P>
<P>
   Each newspaper controls its own layout and editorial content,
which fills half the edition, while PressPoint arranges advertising

ADELPHI, OUSTED PRESIDENT SETTLE SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Adelphi University agreed Tuesday to pay its
ousted president, Peter Diamandopoulos, $1.4 million before taxes
in a settlement that resolved all the suits and countersuits over
his removal last year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also provided $3.5 million for Adelphi, which the
university said it would use to hire new professors and begin to
refurbish its small campus here.
</P>
<P>
   Diamandopoulos, whose unusually high pay and benefits led to his
highly publicized downfall in 1997, had sought more than $4.5
million but settled for less than a third of that after refunding
part of his salary and paying rent owed on a luxury condominium in
Manhattan that the university had bought for him, and reimbursing
Adelphi for legal fees and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Adelphi's chairman, Steven Isenberg, said the settlement
``closes the books on what was a difficult and sad chapter in the
life of this university.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and professors expressed relief. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``We just need to get over it,'' said Diane Malinauskas, 21, a
speech pathology major from Glen Cove, N.Y. ``It got to the point
where it was kind of embarrassing to say you went to Adelphi. But
things have turned around. Morale's definitely up.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamandopoulos, who was named president in 1985, had sought to
transform Adelphi from a commuter college into one with an
international reputation, with advertisements that called Harvard
``the Adelphi of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   But as tuition soared, enrollment dropped and financial troubles
forced layoffs and cuts in programs &UR; .  &LR; Growing dissatisfaction with
Diamandopoulos' personality and policies erupted into an
out-and-out battle three years ago after it was reported that his
$523,000 a year in pay and benefits ranked among the highest for
the nation's college presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by a coalition of critics _ including faculty leaders,
former trustees and administrators, alumni, parents and students _
the state Board of Regents held 27 days of hearings before removing
18 of the 19 trustees for neglect of duty and misconduct in
February 1997. The Regents cited the trustees for granting
excessive compensation to Diamandopoulos, failing to review his
performance and allowing some trustees to engage in private
business with the university.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents appointed a new board, headed by Isenberg, which
dismissed Diamandopoulos. After he sought to stay on as a tenured
professor, the new board went to court to cancel his contract
rights, and he countersued. State Attorney General Dennis Vacco
sued the former trustees for restitution of misspent money, and
they sued the Regents.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Tuesday, in which neither Diamandopoulos nor
the former trustees admitted wrongdoing, settled all the
litigation.

BRUINS GIVE '96 FILM 5 STARS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fourth-quarter deficit, the fourth-down pass
to Mike Grieb, LaVale Woods' fumble, the blocked field goal, Skip
Hicks' overtime run _ the Bruins replay the 1996 double-overtime
victory over USC each training camp and nearly every week
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge game for our program,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
``We constantly look back to that game. We have a video that we
show the players when practice starts, and that game is a big part
of it. When you keep playing hard, you have a chance. And we've
come back a lot of times since then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins scored 17 points in the final six minutes of
regulation and won it with Hicks' 25-yard run in the second
overtime. UCLA is 19-2 since that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had the most impact of any game this decade,'' offensive
tackle Kris Farris said. ``People were leaving. When they got the
ball back with seven minutes left (leading 38-21), the aisles were
full. There was no noise. It was just parents there.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpool: Toledo and USC coach Paul Hackett commuted together
from Diamond Bar when they were assistants on John Robinson's USC
staff in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked football,'' Toledo said. ``It was a clinic each time
we drove in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro package: UCLA tailback Jermaine Lewis believes USC has the
best defense the Bruins have faced this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get great leadership from the middle linebacker,'' Lewis
said of Chris Claiborne. ``He's a drill sergeant.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he sees of Claiborne on videotape, Lewis said: ``I
see NFL material.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Right tackle Brian Polak did not practice Tuesday
because of a sprained right ankle and knee, leaving his status for
Saturday in doubt. If he cannot play, Josh Webb will start with
Dave Wilford in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's yellow alert,'' Toledo said. ``He's played enough where
he can go the whole week (without practicing) and still play.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 tailback Keith Brown strained his back during practice
Tuesday. His status will be determined later in the week.

CONCERN GROWS OVER SOWARD'S INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a growing feeling that USC wide receiver
R. Jay Soward may not be able to play Saturday against UCLA, still
bothered by his badly sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Soward received an anti-inflammatory injection in his ankle, but
did not run as planned Tuesday because trainers wanted to take
another set of X-rays. Preliminary reports detected no damage to
the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Soward even told teammates Tuesday that he had seen a voodoo
doctor about his ankle, which is probably better news than what was
said officially.
</P>
<P>
   He will try to practice today, but it's clear that if Soward
manages to play, he will be less than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't tried to run. It's kind of hard,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Paul Hackett was emphatic that Soward would play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little more concerned now than before today,'' Hackett
said. ``(But) there's no way that he won't make the game. The
question is what is the level of effectiveness?''
</P>
<P>
   Matock available: Defensive tackle Marc Matock, who broke his
ankle against Arizona State, has been cleared to play, but Hackett
said he is reluctant to use him before the Notre Dame game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remarkable,'' Hackett said of Matock's recovery. ``I don't
think we'll put him in a position to play, but who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux commits: Long Beach Poly cornerback Darrell Rideaux gave
USC a verbal commitment Tuesday morning. Rideaux selected USC over
Notre Dame and is considered one of the best players in the country
at his position. He is the defending state champion in the 100
meters and will run track at USC.

ARIZONA JOINS BID FOR ROCKY MOUNTAIN PRIMARY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona and seven other Western states are vying for the ``big
leagues'' of politics with a proposal to hold their presidential
primaries on the same date beginning in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A regional task force, including the chairs of Arizona's
Republican and Democratic parties, on Tuesday approved the plan to
launch a ``Big Sky'' primary on the Saturday after the first Monday
in March.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, that would be March 11.
</P>
<P>
   The idea? To make the Rocky Mountain states a crucial prize in
the 2000 presidential sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, there's strength in numbers,'' said Arizona GOP
Chairman Mike Hellon. ``If we can expand the pool of delegates that
are up for grabs on that date, I believe we can get more attention
from national candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Gov. Fife Symington, who engineered Arizona's 1996
GOP presidential primary, said the state's political leaders are
``kidding themselves by thinking there's any benefit to Arizona''
under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you join a regional primary, there will be a severe
dilution'' of Arizona's influence, Symington said. ``You won't see
the candidates here as much because everybody will be spread pretty
thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of joining a regional primary, Arizona leaders should
defend the state's February presiden tial primary ``as vigorously
as New Hampshire defends its date.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona gained national attention in 1996 with its Feb. 27 GOP
primary, a contest that launched the campaign of wealthy publisher
Steve Forbes and precipitated the collapse of Pat Buchanan's
insurgent candi dacy.
</P>
<P>
   However, other Western states long have complained of being
overlooked by presidential candi dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West has been left entirely out of the process,'' Utah
Gov. Mike Leavitt said. ``By the time we got suited up, the game
was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest proposal, Ari zona would join seven other
states: Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in those states must first approve the plan by the
Western Presidential Primary Task Force, which met this week in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Symington's admonitions, the multistate primary plan has
won support of Republican Gov. Jane Hull, Democratic Chairman Mark
Fleisher, members of Arizona's con gressional delegation and key
law makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is very much for this. The Democratic Party is
for it because it allows them to partici pate, and the
congressional delega tion is for it,'' Hellon said. ``I think
ultimately that's going to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan approved Tuesday would place the Rocky Mountain primary
between two major political events _ primaries in California and
New York and ``Super Tuesday'' in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bigger than California and we are bigger than Texas,''
Leavitt said. ``It's time for the voice of the West to be better
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Arizona should sur render its Feb. 27 primary, Leavitt
said there is strength in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If states start going individually in the West, we would end
up dividing our influence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's 1996 primary cost tax payers more than $2 million, and
the proposed 2000 plan likely would cost about the same, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher said state Democratic leaders support the plan because
it would allow Democrats to partici pate in the primary. In 1996,
they were shut out by their own party rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``That won't happen this time,'' Fleisher said. ``I think the
parties are working together.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt has been promoting the Rocky Mountain primary for years,
lobbying Western governors and lawmakers. He wants national can
didates to pay more attention to the West, which contains some of
the fastest growing states and vast tracts of public lands.
</P>
<P>
   He and others said a Rocky Mountain primary would force pres
idential candidates to focus on issues facing the West, including
growth, the environment and the exploitation of natural resources. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ USC and UCLA's fiercest competition might not be
with each other, but with other great rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   We should know, because we've celebrated the approach of
Saturday's football game by making a list of the 100 greatest
sports rivalries. Yes, the Bruins and Trojans rank up there. No,
they aren't No.1. Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see a lot of Los Angeles on our list. What can we say _
our rivalries are better than their rivalries. You'll see some
Russia, some Spain, some cyberspace, some Wall Street and a touch
of Harlem. You'll notice some history and some fiction, some
rivalries that burned out quickly and some that will simmer
forever.

PARSING THE BUCK  
 NO TIME FOR TITANS 
ROGER &AMP; RUDY 
TIN PAN RHAPSODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So how many of Pearl S. Buck's books have you read?
She wrote more than 80, including ``The Good Earth,'' a novel about
Chinese peasant life that established her as a prize winner in the
1930s with a Pulitzer and a Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably four or five,'' said Kathleen Gill Bowman, the
president of Mrs. Buck's alma mater, Randolph-Macon Women's College
in Lynchburg, Va. ``Not as many as Valerie Harper.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be why Ms. Harper was given a writing credit for ``All
Under Heaven,'' at the Century Theater on East 15th Street, near
Park Avenue South. Ms. Harper, who has said that she read Buck's
books as fast as the Book of the Month Club delivered them when she
was growing up, laid claim to ``about 30 percent'' of ``All Under
Heaven.'' (Dyke Garrison wrote the rest.)
</P>
<P>
   Randolph-Macon was listed as 50 percent of the show's producers
(Ms. Harper's husband, Tony Cacciotti, was the other 50 percent).
And Ms. Harper handles 100 percent of the roles in the one-woman
show, which played to an opening-night audience that included Mary
Tyler Moore, her sitcom pal in the 1970s; Iva Rifkin, her real-life
roommate in the 1960s; Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, and Charles
Gibson, the ABC News correspondent whose wife, Arlene, once taught
at Randolph-Macon.
</P>
<P>
   And the $100,000 that Randolph-Macon put into the play? ``A good
investment,'' Bowman said. ``You could easily spend $30,000 for
several months for a media consultant. We did that, and it yielded
us nothing. This got attention.''
</P>
<P>
   NO TIME FOR TITANS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Things are different now, declared David Rockefeller,
who stepped down as chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank 18 years ago.
Busy executives have no time to do good anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present business culture seems to be so influenced by
security analysts, whose focus is on quarter-by-quarter earnings,''
he said. ``Executives who don't spend their full time on
quarter-by-quarter earnings are criticized and often thrown out. I
think this has meant that senior executives are giving less time to
city problems and public problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller said this before he headed off to Lincoln Center,
where he was the guest of honor at a dinner given by the New York
City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce. He was a founder of the
Partnership in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have now built something like 14,000 affordable homes
with 80 percent private funds, scattered through all five
boroughs,'' he said. There was some whispering behind him.
``Fifteen thousand,'' he said. ``Up one since I last heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ROGER &AMP; RUDY
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani did not let a little thing
like a court order stop Michael Moore from doing what he does best:
point, shoot and ask pointed questions. Last week a judge ordered
Moore, who came too close for General Motors' comfort in the film
``Roger and Me,'' to stay at least 150 feet from Ira Rennert, the
corporate titan who went to court after Moore ambushed his
secretary and his doorman.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the mayor overruled his own Office of Film, Theater and
Broadcasting, which had denied Moore permits for three unrelated
projects. ``I have no objection to Mr. Moore filming anything'' as
long as he complied with the keep-your-distance-from-Mr.-Rennert
order from Justice Lorraine S. Miller of state supreme court,
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anything like this happen before,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   TIN PAN RHAPSODY
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday there will be purple cows. There is now a blue
piano. It will be played at Wednesday's naming ceremony for
Gershwin Way (50th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue) by
George Gershwin's nephew, Leopold Godowsky.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot 10-inch Steinway grand dyed maple veneer has 400
hand-cut mother-of-pearl stars. It also has a $145,000 price tag.
Steinway make 23 others for a total of 24, because Gershwin wrote
``Rhapsody in Blue'' in 1924.

 STOP-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The Senior PGA Tour is targeting a return to the Houston area in
2000.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The yet-to-be-named tournament probably will be in
mid-September, although an October date is possible. The site is
also to be determined, but it is believed the Deerwood Club or
Memorial Park Golf Course would have the best chances to host the
event.
</P>
<P>
   There is no title sponsor confirmed for the event, but local
golf sources said Tuesday the Senior PGA Tour has approached at
least one corporation with Houston ties and that the tour is
proceeding with plans to have an event in the Houston market in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing a Senior PGA Tour event to Houston would fill a void
that has existed since 1994, when the Doug Sanders Celebrity
Classic was last staged. That event brought golf's 50-and-over set
to Houston for seven years before folding.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to the Senior PGA Tour went unreturned Tuesday,
and officials at Memorial Park Golf Course and the Deerwood Club
said they were unaware of any move by the Senior PGA Tour to come
back to Houston. But representatives of both courses said they
would embrace such a return.
</P>
<P>
   And one Houston-area source who is linked to the Senior Tour
said: ``It's not a sure thing. But the tour is aggressively looking
to get back into the Houston market. And with a title sponsor lined
up, it looks good.''
</P>
<P>
   A meeting with the prospective title sponsor is expected this
month, and an announcement that the Senior Tour is returning to
Houston could come then or in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior Tour has grown since its inception in 1980. It is
expanding next year with an event in Dallas and is pursuing Houston
for a spot in its late-season schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Having a Senior Tour event in Houston for the 2000 season would
be terrific timing. The Senior Tour is for players 50 and older,
and a strong rookie class of seniors will begin play in 2000,
including Tom Watson, Tom Kite and Lanny Wadkins.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be one possible drawback to the Senior Tour's
return, but insiders do not believe it would be a deal-breaker. The
tour is adamant that a not-for-profit organization be responsible
for the operations of the tournament. The obvious choice to run the
event would be the Houston Golf Association, which runs the Shell
Houston Open on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But the HGA's plate is nearly overflowing. The organization has
only 170 members and relies on the help of those people and
volunteers to host the SHO. In addition, the HGA is responsible for
the operations of the Tour Championship in 1999, and every fourth
year after that, as it will return to Champions Golf Club on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the HGA figures to take a larger role in the Texaco
Grand Prix of Houston. The downtown auto race has an extensive golf
tournament that race organizers expect to become a more integral
part of the event's festivities next year.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with all of the local charity functions in which it is
involved, and its junior golf program, the HGA might be unable to
give a Senior Tour event the attention required without spreading
itself thin elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   HGA officials said Tuesday they have not decided whether to
become involved in the Senior Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   If the HGA does not step in as the tournament organizer, the
tour has other options. There are numerous experienced
charity-tournament directors locally.
</P>
<P>
   But the catch will be that the organizing group must be a
not-for-profit enterprise. The Senior Tour is unwavering on that
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Any number of charities would qualify, but they also would have
to employ a tournament staff to run the event.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible stumbling blocks for an autumn Senior Tour event
could be the fickle Houston weather at that time of year and what
kind of reception it would have.
</P>
<P>
   The area was hit hard in September by Tropical Storm Frances,
and courses in some parts of the city have suffered heavy flooding
in October and November. If this had been a year when the Tour
Championship was at Champions Golf Club, it would have been in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sports fans are more torn in the Houston market in
September than in April, when the SHO is staged. College football
is in full swing, and September is a prime month for hunting and
fishing. Kids also are back in school.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senior Tour appears ready to take the risks associated
with both problems. &QL;
