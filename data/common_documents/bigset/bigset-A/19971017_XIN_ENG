<HEADLINE> Iraq's 8th National Census Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's eighth national census,
the first one since the U.N. imposed embargo against the country
for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, started today.
</P>
<P>
About 159,500 government officials went door-to-door to help
fill in the census forms distributed to urban and rural areas
throughout the country to ensure it a success, an official from
Iraq's High General Census Committee told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be named, said the committee,
which oversees the census, is headed by Ezzat Ibrahim, vice
chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council.
</P>
<P>
The census is reportedly to cover, in addition to population,
property estate, crops, the social status of Iraqis and the
distribution of man power according to age. Iraqis residing
overseas will also be included.
</P>
<P>
The results will be released Friday. They may give some clue to
the toll taken by Iraq's war with Iran during 1980-88 and the 1991
Gulf War. The census is also expected to reveal the economic
situation of the Iraqi people living under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq never disclosed the number of people killed during the
Iraq-Iran war but the casualties were estimated at 1 million. But
it claimed the U.N.-imposed sanctions since 1991 have caused
hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, mainly children and the diseased,
to die due to the lack of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Traffic and travel were forbidden completely from 4:00 a.m. up
to 8:00 p.m. local time (0010-1700 GMT) today to facilitate the
census.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's first census was conducted in 1927 when the population
was recorded at 2,968,754, and the last one, in 1987 when the
country's population reached 16,278,316.
</P>
<P>
The country's population is estimated to have increased to more
than 22 million now.

<P>
PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- France today formally recognized
the victory of General Denis Sassou Nguesso in the four-month war
in the Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
"The power, from now on, is in the hands of Sassou Nguesso,"
said the French State Secretary of Cooperation, Charles
Josselin. "This is the man with whom one should discuss the
launching of a new democratic process."
</P>
<P>
But France deplored the "gearing of events in Congo since the
beginning of June" as well as intervention by foreign troops in
Congo, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that France was maintaining contact with the Angolan
government over the security of about 1,600 French nationals
trapped in Pointe-Noire, the oil capital of Congo, which was
captured by Angolan troops on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a message to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan,
the Angolan government accepted, Wednesday evening, that its
troops intervened in Congo. It said they did so for "pursuing
aggressors."

SEOUL -- South Korea's ruling New Korea Party (NKP) today filed
with prosecutors allegations of bribery, tax evasion and libel
against opposition leader Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
The NKP also handed the prosecution "concrete evidence" to back
its claims of corruption against Kim, the leader of the main
opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP).
</P>
<P>
The NKP charged that Kim had taken illegal bribes amounting to
more than 13 billion won (about 15 million U.S. dollars) from 10
business groups and had evaded taxes by stashing over 100 billion
won (about 110 million U.S. dollars) in secret funds kept in the

LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
Thursday that it would ban British political parties from
accepting donations from abroad and donations above 5,000 pounds
(8,100 US dollars) would also have to be made public.
</P>
<P>
"This is another step towards greater openness and transparency
in public life and demonstrates our determination to remove an
unnecessary layer of secrecy and undue influence in our political
system," Home Secretary Jack Straw said.
</P>
<P>
Straw added that the government would push a bill on donations
through Parliament as soon as possible and would ask the
Parliamentary Committee on Standards in Public Life to look at
"wider questions of party funding".
</P>
<P>
The committee would be asked to study the possibility of limits
on national election campaign spending and of state-funding of
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the Labor Party's election pledge to clean up
politics and donations.

<HEADLINE> Sassou Declares Victory in Congo Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Former President Denis Sassou
Nguesso of the Congo Republic has declared victory in the
four-month civil war and promised to set up "a government of
national union" in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
He made the declaration after his troops captured the capital
city of Brazzaville and the oil port of Pointe-Noire.
</P>
<P>
"For us, the war is finished, for we have the control of almost
the totality of the country, the total control of the political
capital (Brazzaville), the total control of the economic capital
(Pointe-Noire)," he told Radio France Internationale.
</P>
<P>
"In a few days, we will establish a government of national
union which will run a period of transition," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't know about the whereabout of his rival,
President Pascal Lissouba, who has been on the run after his
troops were defeated in Brazzaville by militiamen of Sassou
Nguesso early this week.
</P>
<P>
The power struggle between the two erupted on June 5 when
Lissouba soldiers surrounded Sassou's home in a crackdown on
private militia. It derailed a July 27 election which both men
planned to contest.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to broker a truce floundered on differences over power
sharing in the run-up to a new election in the central African
country, which used to be a French colony.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The pace of home buying in
Canada remained flat last month, according to the latest report
from the Canadian Real Estate Association.
</P>
<P>
The association reported 18,410 homes were resold in September,
unchanged from August and up 4.1 percent from the same month a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, house resales across the country have risen
from the previous month only twice, in April and July. They have
fallen slightly in every other month.
</P>
<P>
But this year's numbers are consistently higher than those of a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"Activity levels have run relatively steady since May," said an
economist with the association, adding that the levels are
healthy.
</P>
<P>
The resale numbers will remain on an even keel through the rest
of the fall, but is expected to pick up early next year.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamentals couldn't be better for housing," he said,
referring to low interest rates, strong job growth and good
housing affordability.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Plays Up Governing by Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- In an October 17 editorial,
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, calls for a governing
by law and socialist democracy.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "Making Great Efforts to Accelerate the
Process of Governing by Law", quotes President Jiang Zemin's
report to the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) as saying, governing by law is the fundamental
principle of the Party in leading the people and administering the
country.
</P>
<P>
Governing by law means that the broad masses, under the
leadership of the Party, run state affairs in various ways in line
with the Constitution and the law so as to gradually achieve the
systematization and legalization of socialist democracy, Jiang
said. He added the system and the law will not be changed simply
with a change of leaders.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the supreme authority of the
Constitution and the law must be safeguarded and that all state
affairs must be conducted in line with the law.
</P>
<P>
This principle is different from the practice of the past,
when state affairs were governed by individual decisions and not
by law, the editorial says .

<P>
Developing a socialist democracy, perfecting the socialist
legal system, and administering the country by law are important
component parts of Deng Xiaoping Theory and have been the fundamental
principle of the Party since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held in 1978,
the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping said in the early years of reform and
opening-up, China should reinforce democracy and the legal system,
the two sectors the country had neglected in the past.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, especially since the 14th CPC National
Congress in 1992, China has made great progress in establishing
a socialist legal system based on the Constitution, it says.
</P>
<P>
The 15th CPC National Congress, which proposes building a
socialist country governed by law, it adds, marked the deepening
of the Party's understanding of building China's socialist polity
with its own characteristics and the country has entered into a
new period of building the socialist legal system by focusing on
implementing the law.
</P>
<P>
The principle of governing by law is a requirement for the
socialist market economy, an important symbol of progress, and an
important guarantee for long-term stability, the editorial stresses.
</P>
<P>
The People's Congressional System should be adhered to and
perfected to guarantee its authority, it says. By 2010, a legal
system with Chinese characteristics is expected to take shape.
</P>
<P>
The dignity of the Constitution and the law must be
safeguarded, and everyone is equal before the law and no
individuals and organizations have the right to violate the
law, the editorial points out.

economic cooperation between the two governments has not yet

<HEADLINE> Mutual Fund Sales Up in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Mutual fund sales in Canada
continued to be strong in September, with investors sticking with
higher-risk equity funds as their favorite choice, local reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
Net new fund sales for September totaled 3.87 billion dollars
(2.79 billion USD), up from 2.89 billion dollars a year earlier
and 3.4 billion dollars in August.
</P>
<P>
Strong sales and good market performance sent total industry
assets up 5.2 percent in September from August to 283.72 billion
dollars, according to the Investment Funds Institute of Canada.
</P>
<P>
And Canadian investors continued to favor equity funds,
channeling 1.03 billion dollars into Canadian equity funds, the
most popular type of fund in September.
</P>
<P>
They shied away from the lower risk, lower yielding money
market funds which drew in only 57.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they also favored balanced funds that invest
in stocks and bonds as well as foreign equity funds, the institute
said.
</P>
<P>
A strong bull stock market, combined with low interest rates,
helped to propel the growth of mutual fund industry in the
country.

<HEADLINE> 80 Percent Ethiopians Use Traditional Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Close to 80 percent of the
total population in Ethiopia are users of traditional medicinces.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Abebe Demese, deputy general director of
the Ethiopian Bio Diversity Institute when he was opening the
Ethiopian Traditional Medicine Preparation and Research Society's
annual meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
The traditional medication system is gaining a wider
acceptance especially among the rural society which prefers using
traditional remedies to modern medical treatment, Abede said,
adding that the exorbitant price of drugs and their unreliable
remedial value have forced the public to resort to traditional
healers.
</P>
<P>
Previously traditional treatment and its experts were denied
the proper attention, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the readiness of his institute to incorporate
unrecognized professionals into the society and extend every
necessary support to help the realization of its plans and
projects.
</P>
<P>
There are about 250 species of plants in Ethiopia which are
useful for the preparation of traditional medicines.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Ethiopian Traditional Medicine Preparation and
Research Society has over 900 members.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Orders Security Review After Weapons Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen has ordered a military-wide security review
following the arrests of 14 people, including six Marines,
suspected of steal military weapons.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that we be confident that military arms and
munitions are tightly controlled and safeguarded," Cohen said in
ordering the 30-day review.
</P>
<P>
The arrests on Thursday were part of an ongoing 18-month
investigation into the theft of military weapons, including rocket
launchers, machine guns, mines, mortars and grenades.
</P>
<P>
Much of the ordnance was stolen from Camp Lejeune, the
sprawling Marine base in eastern North Carolina where five of the
Marines were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The sixth Marine, Capt. Thomas Crawford, was arrested in
Millis, Massachusetts, about 30 miles southwest of Boston.
Crawford recently transferred from Camp Lejeune to the Naval
Marine Corps Reserve Center in Worcester, Massachusetts, according
to Marine officials.
</P>
<P>
Charges were pending against the Marines. The eight civilians
were arrested and charged with a variety of federal crimes for
allegedly manufacturing and selling military explosives and
hardware.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Runner Sets Asian Record at National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- One Asian record was shattered
on the opening day of the athletics competition at the Chinese
Eighth National Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Li Xuemei from Southwest China's Sichuan Province clocked 10.90
seconds in the women's 100 meters heat to shave 0.12 second off
the listed Aisan record. The old mark was established by Liu
Xiaomei of China in Beijing four years ago. The finals will be
held on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Li jumped into the lead after 50 meters and she
apparently slowed down about five meters to go with others
struggling far behind her.
</P>
<P>
"She performed well," said her trainer Lin Gang, "We hadn't
expected her to break the record. I think she also has the
possibility to improve the Asian mark in her specialty -- 200
meters."
</P>
<P>
Li, who competed in the world championships last August,
equalled the Asian record in the 200 meters by timing 22.39
seconds in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
Middle and long distance runners from Northeast China's
Liaoning Province dominated the men's and women's 1500 meters
heats with "Ma's Family Army" setting the pace.
</P>
<P>
Song Weizeng, who is under the guidance of coach Ma Junren,
clocked three minutes and 40.23 seconds in the 1500 meters heat to
beat the national mark of 3:40.93. All the top five finishers,
three from Ma's team, also surpassed the national record.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 1500 meters heat, eight Liaoning runners
qualified for the finals, the other four finalists are from Henan
and Jiangsu Provinces.
</P>
<P>
After today's competition, Chinese track and field circles
predicted that Ma's team would make another haul of golds after
four years. At the Seventh National Games in 1993 in Beijing, Ma's
team set three world records.
</P>
<P>
"Ma Junren will make another surprise in the track," said Du
Huaice, coach of Henan team, "let's wait and see."
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Wang Junxia did not compete in the race as she
just resumed training in August. However, she came to Shanghai to
watch the Games and she said she was preparing for the Sydney
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Fund-Raising: Something New for China's State-owned Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists say that
state-owned enterprises need a more open environment and more
international capital to transform them.
</P>
<P>
A large number of large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises have applied for listing on markets to get more
development funds, and many smaller ones are using a joint stock
partnership system.
</P>
<P>
Chinese now have more than four trillion yuan in capital that
could be channeled into different sectors. One economist has
predicted that the reorganization of state-owned enterprises will
need two or three trillion yuan, so the ordinary Chinese could be
significant in this.
</P>
<P>
A securities investment fund is the preferred form of
investment for many ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has approved some temporary securities
investment fund measures to keep it fair.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shuqing, the secretary-general of the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy, says that China will open more channels
for raising funds in future, like investment funds, special
project investment, listing shares abroad, or bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dongsheng, deputy director of the State Planning
Commission's finance department says that one way is to issue
convertible bonds.

<P>
Only companies that are listed on the stock market can issue
convertible bonds. But China has 700 listed companies only, Zhang
notes. So, issuing convertible bonds by companies that are not
listed is compatible with China's condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, has made some
progress in opening up more investment channels. It plans to raise
10 billion yuan on the stock market, each year, for the next few
years, a municipal government official says.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some non-banking financial institutions have
gotten involved in banking transactions on a trial basis. The
emergence of more investment banks will lead to more competition
and integration of financial capital and industrial capital.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a capital market and the convergence of
China's practices and those of the international capital market
provide an opportunity to develop an investment banking system,
says Gao Shangquan, a noted economist.
</P>
<P>
He call for importing more foreign funds, establishing
Sino-foreign investment organizations, and training a contingent
of high-level managers.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Property Rights Agency has formed ties with
investment banks, financial consortia, and investment funds in the
United States, Japan, Britain, Australia and Hong Kong and has had
some good results.

<HEADLINE> First Baby Born from Frozen Eggs in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A 39-year-old Georgia women
gave birth to twin boys after being implanted with another women's
eggs that had been frozen two years earlier, researchers at a
private clinic in Atlanta said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first successful pregnancy in the United States
using an egg that had been frozen and it promises to make it
vastly easier for older women to remain fertile.
</P>
<P>
The consequence would be to allow women to freeze their eggs
when they are young, for use later when they are older and their
eggs are of poorer quality. It would make menopause obsolete, in
effect, because women could have their own babies, with eggs they
stored when they were younger, at any time in life.
</P>
<P>
It would also enable women who are undergoing chemotherapy,
which can damage the ovaries, to save their eggs for later use.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Reproductive Biology Associates said the
frozen eggs were from a 29-year-old women and they had been frozen
for 25 months before they were fertilized.
</P>
<P>
The same clinic in 1993 produced the first U.S. baby using
sperm injected directly into a woman's egg.
</P>
<P>
Until now, U.S. doctors have been able to produce pregnancies
from frozen embryos -- eggs fertilized with sperm and then frozen
-- but eggs alone proved too fragile.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a doctor in Australia was able to produce the first
known births from frozen eggs. A year later, a team of German
doctors also produced frozen-egg pregnancies.

<HEADLINE> US Housing Construction Up Sharply in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Construction starts of new
homes in the U.S. jumped by 7.9 percent last month, the sharpest
increase in seven months, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the U.S. housing starts increased to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.5 million in September
following drops of 5.1 percent in August and 2.5 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The construction of single-family homes rose by 6.9 percent in
the month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17 million.
Construction of apartments also jumped by 11.5 percent to an
annual rate of 330,000.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the housing starts increased in all areas in
September. Starts rose by 10.7 percent in the West, the largest
gain since January. They increased by 9.7 percent in the
Northeast, 9.3 percent in the Midwest and 5.6 percent in the
South.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, the housing starts in
the U.S. are running 2.2 percent below last year.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that applications for building permits --
a barometer of future building plans -- also rose in all regions.
They were up 3.4 percent nationally to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.45 million.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economists said that the larger increase in September
doesn't changed their view that housing construction won't quite
match last year's eight-year high of 1.48 million but remain
strong.

<HEADLINE> Strong Pound Hits UK Export Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturing has been
dealt a heavy blow by the strength of the pound with export orders
now at their lowest level for six years, the latest quarterly
survey of business by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC)
showed today.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 8,000 companies found that for the first time in
five years, the majority of firms are reporting falling export
sales and orders, which are at their lowest level since 1991. The
situation will not likely to improve in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The BCC blamed the sharp rise in the value of the pound since
last year for the fall in exports, saying that businesses were
losing out to foreign competition at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, businesses pleaded for relief from the Bank of
England in the form of no more increase in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see further increase in interest rates which
would fuel further rises in sterling," said Ian Peters, deputy
director-general of the BCC.
</P>
<P>
The survey also highlighted the growing disparity between gloom
among manufacturing firms and the bouyant state of the service
sector, which reported the highest levels of optimism since the
late 1980s and record levels of investment and employment.

<HEADLINE> WB President Stresses Poverty Eradication in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn today called for more efforts in poverty eradication
and offered more money in this field in Bangladesh, one of the
world's poorest and most densely populated countries.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh has no reason not to win its battle against poverty
and social injustice. You can count on the continued and growing
support of the World Bank Group in this endeavor," he told a press
conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, who came Monday on his first official visit here,
has agreed to commit upwards of 500 million US dollars annually,
instead of about 300 million dollars in recent years, in
interest-free credits, in the coming five years to support a
strong macro-economic and structural reform program.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is one of the largest borrowers from the
International Development Association (IDA), which provides
interest-free credits to poor countries. Dhaka has got over 7.5
billion U.S. dollar commitment in IDA credits since its
independence in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn told the reporters that he was deeply impressed by
the strength and courage of the villagers he met and the progress
made by some non-government organizations in fighting poverty in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Wolfensohn met with political leaders,
representatives of civil society and the business community. He
also visited World Bank-supported and other development projects
in action.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning his talks with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,
Wolfensohn said that they agreed that the IDA assistance should
place special emphasis on supporting expanded human resource
development, especially education and nutrition, and promoting the
equality of women.
</P>
<P>
The bank chief also stressed the importance of developing
long-term programs for improved infrastructure and water resource
management, the necessity of strengthening the financial system,
and the importance of private sector development.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank president is scheduled to leave here tomorrow
morning for a visit to Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Announce New Investment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Commerce Minister
Ishaq Dar said today the country will announce a new investment
policy for the current fiscal year by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
Dar disclosed this at the inauguration of the 4th Pakistan
International Footwear Exhibition here.
</P>
<P>
He said the new policy aimed to spur the country's economy and
to increase the country's exports to the world market.
</P>
<P>
As for the current devaluation of Pakistan's currency, the
rupee, Dar said it was no real devaluation but merely a long-due
readjustment of the rupee against a couple of other currencies.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the readjustment was necessary to retain
Pakistan's overseas markets as some of its competitors have
devalued their currencies, making the rupee overvalued with regard
to exports.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the readjustment will help his country achieve
the export target of 9.5 billion U.S. dollars for this fiscal
year.

ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Nobert Holl said today that a new methodology was
needed to bring an end to the civil war in Afghanistan, a report

Peace would not come to Afghanistan until complete harmony
exists with the neighboring countries, Holl said.

The international community was endeavoring to induce the
concerned countries to coordinate with the U.N. peace process on
Afghanistan, Holl added.

<HEADLINE> China Provides Academic Exchange Forum At Population Conference (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Today was the last day of the
23rd International Union for Scientific Study of Population
(IUSSP) General Population Conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, Chinese demographers held discussions
with their foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The conference provided a good opportunity for many people to
understand China's population and demographic research, according
to Prof. Dudley L.Poston of Texas A &AMP; M University.
</P>
<P>
Poston has visited China several times and says he has
witnessed great progress in the country's demographic work in the
past two decades, citing the many academic papers of the younger
generation of Chinese demographers now being published in
international journals.
</P>
<P>
Prof. John Caldwell, president of IUSSP, points out that the
fact of the international conference's being held in China is
itself significant, because, "What happens in China determines
considerablely what happens in the world."
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, more information about the nation's
population and demographic studies has been made available abroad,
and the seven formal and informal symposia on China at the
conference signified a new level of demographic study.
</P>
<P>
Discussions focused on censuses, statistics, family planning,
population migration and urbanization, aging and old age security,
marriage and the family, population and sustainable development,
women's issues and health issues of women.

<P>
"Like many developing countries, China faces the problem of a
large population putting pressure on economic development," says
Prof. Jiang Zhenghua, vice-minister of the State Family Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
But, the one child policy that took effect in the late 1970s
has helped the country control the fast growth of population,
Jiang notes, and the birth rate dropped to 17 per thousand last
year, from 33 per thousand in 1970.
</P>
<P>
"Many scholars in developing countries have expressed a hope of
visiting China to learn from the Chinese experience," he says, and
the conference and some travelling programs have made that
possible.
</P>
<P>
Foreign researchers have used the conference to understand
China better, and the more than 500 Chinese scholars there also
used the opportunity to make connections with foreign academics.
</P>
<P>
For many Chinese scholars, financial and language problems have
long been obstacles to communications with their foreign
counterparts. But, this conference, the first in China, made
Chinese one of the three working languages so that communication
between the Chinese and foreign scholars would not be such a
problem.
</P>
<P>
What was even more significant about the conference, Jiang
says, was that it will promote demographic research in China, and
the economic construction and opening-up as well.
</P>
<P>
China has placed much more importance on the quality of life
and sustainable development of the economy and society since the
1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development,
he explains, and "This conference will help Chinese demographers
and people involved in family planning work to have a better
understanding of those issues."
</P>
<P>
"At the turn of the century, we hope to have more exchanges
with our foreign counterparts in order to find better solutions
for China's population problems," Prof. Peng Xizhe, director of
Fudan University's Institute of Population Research, said at the
closing ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that our research on China's population issues
will make a greater contribution to worldwide demographic
studies," he says.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weaker At Weekend Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker today against its US counterpart, as players squared up
their positions ahead of weekend and expected good inflation news
next week.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index data due here next Wednesday is
expected to show the inflation rate at levels not seen in nearly
35 years.
</P>
<P>
"There is also some more talk about the possibility of an
easing when the data comes out next week," said a trader at a
domestic bank.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is likely to have fallen to a 35-year low in the
September quarter," Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig
James said.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank has forecast headline inflation to have
risen by 0.1 percent in the three months to September, for a
year-on-year gain of just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The currency ended at 73.42 US cents, down from 73.79 US cents
previously.
</P>
<P>
In early dealings today the Australian dollar was buoyed by
reports that the Federal Government could abolish the 9.8 percent
withholding tax levied on offshore holdings of federal and state
government bonds before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The local currency tapped a high of 74 US cents before edging
back in afternoon dealings. The market later sold the currency
lower to its closing levels.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 88.46 yen, from 88.82, and at
1.2912 marks, up from 1.2897.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Opera Festival Curtained Up in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Opera Festival,
the largest of its kind ever held in Hong Kong, was kicked off
tonight with the brilliant performance of Cantonese opera
"Assassination of Emperor Qin" by Hong Kong artists.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day festival presented by the Provisional
Urban Council of Hong Kong, more than 40 Chinese opera troupes
from China's inland and Hong Kong will perform their masterpieces
which vary from the popular Cantonese, Beijing, Sichuan and
Shaoxing operas to the rarely seen Hui, Qin, Han and Jin operas.
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong's return to the motherland, a tide of fervor for
appreciation and knowledge of Chinese culture could be strongly
felt in every sector of the community, Pao Ping-wing, chairman of
the Council's Culture Select Committee, said at the opening
ceremony this evening.
</P>
<P>
He added that not only does the festival offer a most
penetrative perspective to get to know Chinese culture, it also
offers a rare opportunity for maestros in Hong Kong and the inland
to share their artistic experiences and further promote this
incomparable art form.
</P>
<P>
Chinese opera is a unique performing art with deep cultural
roots and rich folk origins. Its strong presence can also be found
in the theoretical underpinning of Western performing art.
</P>
<P>
Through thousands of years' practice and evolution, Chinese
opera has developed into an artistic gem combining elements of
music, dance, drama, acrobatics, literature, elaborate stage
costumes and symbolic make-up all in a single performance.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Two Dismal Weeks for Australian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The first half of this month
may have been the most turbulent part in the political life of
Australian Prime Minister John Howard who came to power in March,
1996.
</P>
<P>
Howard's government plunged into a crisis in the past two weeks
over a travel allowance scandal that forced the resignation of
several cabinet ministers and a reshuffle of the cabinet.
The scandal was revealed in late September when former transport
minister John Sharp was forced to resign after being charged with
wrongfully claiming 8,740 Australian dollars (6,292 U.S. dollars)
of travel allowances.
</P>
<P>
The fraud later also forced the resignations of Administrative
Services Minister David Jull and Science Minister Peter McGauran
who were accused of trying to cover up the scandal.
The scandal also cost the political life of Howard's closest and
long-time political ally Grahame Morris, who masterminded his 1996
election victory over the Australian Labor Party.
On September 26, Howard announced that he had sacked his senior
political adviser Morris and office manager Fiona Mckenna. Howard
blamed them for not informing him of the travel allowance fraud.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who was accused by the Labor Party -- the country's
largest opposition party -- of trying to cover the scandal,
suffered another blow as Labor's then deputy senate leader Nick
Sherry shocked the nation by attempting to commit suicide on
October 2.
Sherry was also accused of mistakenly claiming travel allowances
in a tit-for-tat attack from the Howard government.
Howard was forced to announced on October 5 a reshuffle of his
cabinet in an effort to overcome the crisis over the travel
allowance scandal.
</P>
<P>
Howard is also under fire from an influential businessman.
Crown Casino boss Lloyd Williams publicly called for the return
of former prime minister Paul Keating, who lost the 1996 election
to Howard.
Williams has berated the government for being "totally out of
step" with Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I do think that Paul Keating had a wonderful vision for Asia,"
said Williams Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I only wish Paul Keating was here and he would have got rid of
the Hanson factor...I think she's doing some incredible damage to
us."
</P>
<P>
Independent MP Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party have
been advocating for a cut in the intake of Asian immigrants and
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Former PM Malcolm Fraser also criticized Howard for failing to
fight Hanson's divisive policies with sufficient speed or vigor.
This week, another ex-Liberal Party leader John Hewson joined the
fray.
</P>
<P>
Hewson said Howard had failed to effectively tackle the Hanson
threat and it was doing immeasurable damage with Australia's major
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
"Howard played the game to get there but they (the electorate)
didn't expect that when he got to government he'd continue to play
the game," Hewson said.
</P>
<P>
"They'd expected that he would deliver on the (economic) reform
messages that he had been talking about for so many years ... the
government is not delivering," said the ex-Liberal leader.
</P>
<P>
Big business also turned up the heat on Howard, criticizing his
government's piecemeal approach to industry policy.

<HEADLINE> Firing Incident Not to Affect Pak-Iranian Ties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif and visiting Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsin
Aminzada today reaffirmed that the recent killing of five Iranians
in Pakistan would not affect the relationship between the two
countries, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Aminzada here today, Sharif expressed
his deep condolence over the death of the five Iranian air force
cadets, who were shot dead by unidentified gunmen in Rawalpindi,
the sister city of Islamabad, on September 17, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif assured full cooperation of the government of Pakistan
in investigating the shooting case and said that the perpetrators
of this criminal act would not be able to evade justice.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also underscored their determination not to
allow such incidents to affect their countries' traditional
relationship, which they said was rooted deep in history, common
faith and shared cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister also said that he was looking
forward to meeting with Iranian leaders during the forthcoming
eighth summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to be
held in Tehran, Iran, in December 1997, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the visiting Iranian deputy foreign minister also
called on Pakistani President Farooq Leghari and Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan.

<HEADLINE> Peace Rally Held in Somali to Mark Signing of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- One of the largest peace
rallies took place today in south Mogadishu, capital of Somali
with supporters of the rival factions of Hussein Mohamed Aidid
and those of Osman Hassan Ali Atto participating.
</P>
<P>
The peace rally was held in support of the implementation of
the Sana peace agreement signed by Aidid and Osman Atto on May
12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 people gathered today at the university hall
controlled by Osman Atto's faction to witness the great event in
which an eight-point agreement was signed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Around the meeting hall, there were dozens of elders,
religious men, women and hundreds of militiamen from both sides
who embraced each other and cried for missing each other for so
long.
</P>
<P>
During the well participated ceremony, delegates from both
sides signed the eight-point agreement which ruled that both
sides should forgive each other and forget about the past.
</P>
<P>
The agreement prescribed the separation of the troops within
seven days, the formation of a joint committee within 48 hours to
oversee the implementation modalities of the agreed points and
that supporters of both sides living inside and outside the
country should help the fulfillment of this agreement.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the people to read Suratul Ikhlas (Koranic
sura usually read for the dead) for those who died during the
civil war between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
A considerable number of politicians, clan elites and other
dignitaries from all clans of Hawiye were invited to the
gathering. Between 5 and 40 dignitaries were invited from each
clan to witness the event which was held in a well decorated and
heavily fortified hall.
</P>
<P>
This important peace agreement was signed at a time when both
Hussein Aidid and Osman Atto are away from the country. However,
delegates representing them told reporters that things were going
on under the directives of their leaders and hoped that this
agreement would lead to a larger peace settlement for the
political crises of Somalia.

<P>
SHENYANG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The 15th Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) has given top priority to
agricultural production and placed demands for reforms and
development in the countryside, Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun says.
</P>

Jiang, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee in charge of agricultural affairs, made the
remarks during an inspection tour of Liaoning province, in the
northeast, this week.
</P>
<P>
Closer attention should be paid to agriculture, he said,
because it is closely related to other important issues like
reforms, development, and stability.
</P>
<P>
He called on those in charge of agricultural affairs and
farmers to reflect the essence of the CPC 15th National Congress
by working hard for another good harvest next year, and called for
a revolution in agronomy, increased efforts at industrializing
farming, increased rural reforms, and greater protection of
farmers' rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Border soldiers of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) seized two South Korean farmers
in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) today.
</P>
<P>
Military sources in the DPRK were quoted by South Korea's
Yonhap news agency as saying that the farmers were caught because
they had earlier crossed the military demarcation line, the center
line of the four-km-wide buffer zone, into the north.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Defense Ministry reported earlier that the two
villagers were picking corn near the military demarcation line
just before noon when 12 DPRK troops crossed the demarcation line
and carried them into the north side.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said there was no exchange of fire between
soldiers of the two sides, and Pyongyang said, hours after the
seizure, it would return the two farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on the matter
at the truce village of Panmunjom, but this ended fruitlessly this
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Situation Stable: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today the situation in Russia is under his "secure controls"
and he has options to resist the parliament's attacks.
</P>
<P>
Russia has a stable system of political power based on the
constitution, an Itar-Tass news agency report quoted the president
as saying in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
With "secure controls" over the entire country, Yeltsin said,
he could choose between the resignation and the resolving of the
parliament if the State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
expresses its no-confidence over the government.
</P>
<P>
It was common to see conflicts between the parliament and the
government in developed countries, and the conflicts do not lead
to disasters, he said. "There is no disaster in Russia now either."
</P>
<P>
On the State Duma's request for the resignation of the
government over the 1998 budget dispute, Yeltsin called for
dialogues and compromises between the executive and legislative
branches.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the crisis would be resolved as soon as possible
with the cooperation of all parties.
</P>
<P>
The president also confirmed his initiative on holding a
roundtable of political parties and a meeting of the "Big Four" --
the president, the prime minister and the parliamentary speakers
-- on major controversies.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, New Zealand Sign Trade Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and New Zealand
today signed a new treaty on trade and economic cooperation to
replace the 1961 Bilateral Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would provide for the enhancement of the
bilateral commercial relations and give impetus towards greater
collaboration between the two sides, Malaysian International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia-New Zealand trade in 1996 rose by 19.2 percent to
1,524 million ringgit (about 476.25 million U.S. dollars) with
Malaysia's exports amounting to 605 million ringgit (about 189.06
million U.S. dollars and its imports from New Zealand to 919
million ringgit (about 287.19 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said that New Zealand's investment in Malaysia remained
relatively small with capital investments from 1989 to 1996
amounting to 105 million ringgit (32.81 million dollars) for 10
approved projects.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's investments in New Zealand are concentrated in the
acquisition of commercial real estate.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah and New Zealand Trade Minister Lockwood Smith signed
the new agreement on behalf of their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand trade minister is in Malaysia for consultations
between ASEAN economic ministers and their counterparts from
Australia and New Zealand.

Minister Michael Wooldridge today called on Australian fathers to
promote breastfeeding by attaching importance to it and pitching
in with the housework for the good of their children.
</P>
<P>
The minister said lack of support by men was a key reason that
women gave up breastfeeding a new baby.
</P>
<P>
Men will be targeted in an Australian federal government-funded
campaign to boost breastfeeding, which Wooldridge said was a
factor in reduced ear and respiratory infections, allergies,
gastroenteritis, obesity and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Wooldridge said the father's attitude was the single most
important factor in babies being breastfed until they were six
months old.
</P>
<P>
"One Australian study found that 97 percent of mothers
breastfed when the father supported breastfeeding - where they
didn't, the rate dropped by more than one quarter," he said in
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the Nursing Mothers' Association of Australia
(NMAA) had won a 255,000 US dollar tender for a two-year community
education campaign which will focus on helping men support their
partners.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to see 80 percent of babies breastfed
until six months of age.
</P>
<P>
This means doubling the current rate of breastfeeding by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
At present 80 percent of women breastfeed at birth but this
drops to 60 percent by three months and 40 percent by six months.

<HEADLINE> Wu Yanyan Sets Swimming World Record at National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Wu Yanyan of Guangxi set a
world record in the women's 200 meters individual medley by
clocking two minutes 9.72 seconds at the Chinese Eighth National
Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The previous world mark of 2:11.65 was established by Lin Li of
Jiangsu province at the Barcelona Olympic Games on July 30, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning's Chen Yan, who broke the 400m individual medley on
Monday, was denied a chance today to win her fourth gold in the
National Games. The triple gold medalist finished second with
2:11.27, which was also a world-mark-breaking performance.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's Sun Guiling wound up third with 2:13.94.
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard victory," said Wu. "Chen was chasing me very
closely. Of course, I was unlikely to break the world record
without her challenge."
</P>
<P>
Wu, 19, who won a silver in the 400m individual medley after
Chen, owned today's victory to an upper hand in the breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
"I know I will lose again if I cannot build a lead in the
breaststroke," Wu said. "Chen is much stronger in freestyle in the
last 50 meters."
</P>
<P>
Wu, who took a shine in China's Olympic trials but returned
home from Atlanta without any medal due to a poor health, has
focused on all her attention on the National Games since last
year.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jicai, Wu's coach for 12 years, played a very important role
in bring her out of the Olympic disappointment.
</P>
<P>
"I told her the defeat is a temperary thing and you should look
to the future," the 61-year-old Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"She trained too hard before the Atlanta Olympic Games and got
a fever just before the games," the coach said.
</P>
<P>
After one year of training, the Olympian's efforts eventually
were paid off, improving her best time of 2:12.87 by more than
three seconds.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 100m butterfly, local favorite Jiang Chengji
completed a gold double following his 100m freestyle triumph with
53.28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Army's Zhu Yi retained his title in the men's 200m
breaststroke in 2:15.88 while the women's 4X100m medley relay also
went to the Army squad with 4:02.09.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Jet Bomb Claims 8 in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Eight civilians died in the
east of the capital Thursday evening after a bomb dropped by a
Nigerian jet exploded at Kissy, doctors at the main hospital
said.
</P>
<P>
About 20 others were seriously injured. They were in a market
place when the bomb fell and the corpses were badly dismembered,
some without limbs or heads.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs were also dropped at Wilberforce and Lecester peak
by another jet. This is the first time two jets from west African
peace-keeping forces known as ECOMOG took part in the military
operation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The bomb at Lecester peak damaged one of two solar panels of
the state-owned radio and TV station but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
The blast instantly disrupted all radio and TV transmissions.
"We are lucky there is very little damage to the vital
equipment," said Gipu Felix George, director-general of
broadcasting, who visited the site an hour after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The radio and TV station have been closed down for a couple of
days, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military government leader Major Johnny Paul Koroma
urged demonstrating youths "not to destroy properties belonging
to their opponents but to allow the government to take its own
measures."
</P>
<P>
Koroma's appeal came after demonstrating youths set fire to at
least four houses belonging to supporters of ousted civilian
leader Tejan Kabbah in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Furniture was taken out of the house of a former foreign
minister Desmong Luke and burnt in the street in the central part
of the capital.
</P>
<P>
"We decided not to burn the house as it is adjacent to a
petrol station," one youth explained to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In another development, diplomatic sources said Monday's
meeting in neighboring Guinea between the ECOWAS committee of
five and the Sierra Leone junta is "unlikely" to be held.
</P>
<P>
"Our information is that it will likely be either on Wednesday
or Thursday," one source said.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations on whether rebel leader Foday Sankoh,
now under house arrest in Nigeria, will be freed to take part in
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh is the deputy head of state in the military junta.

NICOSIA -- The Cyprus economy is expected to grow by about 4
percent next year, up from an estimated 2.5 percent this year,
according to a report by the Planning Bureau and the Ministry of
Finance today.
</P>
<P>
The joint report, presented to the House of Representatives,
says the economic prospects for 1998 are encouraging, mainly
because of a more favorable climate both abroad and at home.
</P>
<P>
The report says the agricultural sector is expected to pick
up, especially if weather conditions improve, while services,
which contribute to some 71 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP), will continue to play a major role in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is expected to fall to 3 percent from the
present 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The two new gas fields were named as Al-Qateef and Al-Teenat by
the Saudi National Oil Company "Aramco," the agency said.

Encouraging prospects on how the economy will fare in the current
year and in 1998 also have positively contributed to the gradual
restoration of negative investor psychology.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong entered a new era of
increasing strength and self-confidence after it returned to China
on July 1, Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of China's Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tung told about 700 business, trade, tourism and community
leaders at a luncheon that Hong Kong people are marching forward
with pride and confidence.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of being at last reunited with China and
confident that tomorrow will be even better," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the handover, "our economy continues to grow, our
financial foundation remains solid, and our society remains
pluralistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys by Hong Kong University showed that 85 percent
of the population in the region was confident about the future,
the highest percentage for Hong Kong under any administration.
</P>
<P>
Tung attributed the increased confidence to the "Basic Law"
which provides a constitutional framework for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Tung is on a three-day visit to Japan, the first trip to the
country as chief executive of the HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Intention to Attend Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today denied that it wants
to take part in the fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
Economic Summit to be held in Doha, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying Egypt
maintains its firm stance that its participation in Doha
conference hinges on a shift in the Israeli policy towards the
Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
"What have been mentioned by one of the U.S. official spokesmen
on Egypt's intention to attend the conference are groundless,"
said the spokesman, who is customarily not identified.
</P>
<P>
A final decision on whether Egypt will attend will be announced
in due time prior to the convocation of the conference, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Robin claimed on
Wednesday that the U.S. received pledges from a number of Arab
countries, including Egypt, to take part in the conference slated
for November.
</P>
<P>
Most Arab countries have either flatly rejected or threatened
to boycott the conference which will include Israel given the
Mideast peace process is going through a problematic phase.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been assiduously trying to talk the Arab countries
into attending the conference, even at lower levels, for its
symbolic value of an Arab-Israeli rapport.
</P>
<P>
As a direct spinoff of the peace process that started in 1991,
the annual MENA conference had been held in Casablanca, Amman and
Cairo since 1994. But peace prospects have generally deteriorated
since then.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Shake Off Pressure to Keep Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHERAN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The absence of three major
players puts China's World Cup finals hopes in doubt, but the
confidence is still held among squad for Friday's meeting with
group leader Iran here.
</P>
<P>
After six-time misery memories of failing to qualify for the
World Cup finals, each win over Saudi Arabia and Kuwait earlier
this month invested a real sense of hopes to China in the seventh
seeking.
</P>
<P>
But it seems a tall order for the Chinese team when it loses
full-backs Fan Zhiyi and Xie Feng and striker Li Ming in the match
against Iran for two yellows each taken from previous qualifying
matches.
</P>
<P>
The lose of Li, the one of China's best striker, puts more
pressure to the team's leading marksman Hao Haidong, who scored a
first-three-minute goal when China beat Kuwait 2-1 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
China, who run the same record to 2-1-1 with Saudi Arabia in
the Asian qualifying group A, look shabbier than ever in defense
in Friday's match but the team remains confidence mentally.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is on the same level, and we will play a great
match," said midfielder Ma Mingyu. "We lost the first leg match to
Iran, so we have no pressure as before."
</P>
<P>
Liu Jun, a possible replace of Li's position at right wing,
said, "We won't be softened in defense though we'll play without
Fan, Xie and Li. Someone is also capable to play the place. All we
should do is to make a good preparation as possible as we can."
</P>
<P>
China's left back is expected to be placed by Wu Chengying, who
was just called three days ago from Shanghai Shenhua, China's
Serie A league club.
</P>
<P>
"Wu is active at left," veteran Xu Hong said. "And with Sun
Jihai at right and the steady midfield, we'll play a more
offensive match against Iran. But tt's too early to talk about
what we could take from them (Iran)."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it seems that the host team is suffering much more
pressure to deliver the win.
</P>
<P>
The 4-2 win in the first leg boosted Iran's fans, who believe
their team is a class up on technique and patience. To prove it,
Iran must sharpen their attack as they did in the first meeting.
</P>
<P>
The result between Iran and China may set the best opportunity
for Saudi Arabia to move up to the group leader. The Saudians will
play weaker Kuwait in Friday's other group match.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait stands fourth in the group with 1-1-2 collecting five
points.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Relief Efforts Taken in Quake-Stricken Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Interior Minister
Carlos Figueroa today announced a series of emergency relief
measures to help people in the country's earthquake-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The measures, Figueroa said, included declaring the Fourth
Region, which was worst hit in the quake on Tuesday, as a disaster
area to make residents there eligible for more relief funding.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they also called for the establishment of two
committees to mobilize the resources of six government ministries
in undertaking relief and reconstruction efforts respectively.
</P>
<P>
The decisions were made at a meeting of cabinet ministers
presided over by President Eduardo Frei, and ministries were asked
to earmark special funding for supporting the relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Region of Coquimbo, with the regional capital at La
Serena, has been declared national disaster area for several times
in recent years due to either drought or flooding.
</P>
<P>
The latest devastation it sustained was the earthquake
measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale, which killed eight people and
injured nearly 100 others in central and northern Chile.
</P>
<P>
While about 3,000 residential houses were destroyed and 5,000
more damaged, some 15,000 people were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
Figueroa said his ministry is sending emergency relief goods,
as well as badly needed financial assistance, into the cities and
towns and more than 700 rural villages in the quake-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the early arrival of the help was hampered
by the poor conditions of the road leading to these areas, caused
earlier by flooding and lately by the quake.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, African Trade Union Symposium In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on Chinese and
African trade union work in the increasingly globalized economy,
sponsored by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (CFTU) and
the Organization of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU), opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
CFTU and OATUU representatives, and trade union representatives
from Cote d'Ivoire, Algeria, Niger, Togo, Rwanda, Benin, Cameroon,
Madagascar, and other countries were present at today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Li Qisheng, vice-president of CFTU, addressed the gathering,
saying that globalization and regionalization of the world's
economies has, to a certain extent, provided an opportunity for
promoting national economies and creating more employment, but has
also seriously challenged all countries, especially developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries, especially the African countries, have
suffered a lot because of an irrational international economic
order, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Many countries' trade unions are paying close attention to the
influence of economic globalization on labor, he said, and in
order to promote the national economies and safeguard the rights
and interests of workers, trade unions have done a great deal of
work.
</P>
<P>
So, the symposium is significant as a place where participants
can discuss economic globalization's influence on national
economic development, employee-employer relations in
foreign-funded enterprises, trade union work, increasing
solidarity and co-operation between trade unions of developing
countries, and safeguarding workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
OATUU representative Mujyambere Augustin said that trade unions
should intensify their work, reconsider their own structure, and
strengthen solidarity to resist the harmful influences of economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said he is satisfied with the good relations between OATUU
and CFTU and that the symposium will fuel co-operative relations
between CFTU and African trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Participants will also visit the Tianjin Economic and
Technological Development Zone and large state-run enterprises and
foreign-funded enterprises.

<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A finance street in Beijing
that the Municipal Government began planning in 1993 in the
western part of the city, is now taking shape.
</P>
<P>
Major Chinese banking institutions, including the headquarters
of the Peoples Bank of China, the People's Insurance Corporation
of China and the Bank of China, are lining up to get into the
88-ha. area with more than two million sq.m. of floor space. The
infrastructure cost 200 million US dollars to build.
</P>
<P>
The city wants to make it a multi-purpose administrative and
information center for banking and the securities and insurance
businesses.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, there will be 14 of China's leading
financial institutions there like the Construction Bank of China
(CBC) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, the Ping An Insurance Co.,
Merchant Bank, Communications Bank, CITIC Industrial Bank of
China, and the China Investment Bank.
</P>
<P>
Major international financial institutions are expected to have
offices there. Eleven foreign banks have branches in Beijing, and
200 overseas financial institutions have offices.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's status as the nation's capital and political and
cultural center have attracted foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the street will become a modernized community
focusing on financial business, according to the city's plan.

<HEADLINE> Israel Fears Sexual Complaint Harm Ties With Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel is concerned that the
sexual assault complaint against Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed
Bassiouny could adversely affect its relations with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Official sources in Jerusalem were quoted by Israel Radio as
saying today that they fear the embarrassment the incident caused
Bassiouny will be played up in Cairo's generally hostile
newspapers, and in turn will further aggravate the Egyptian
public's ill will toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
They also feared that the publicity over the incident will harm
efforts to win the release of Azzam Azzam, an Israeli citizen
imprisoned in Cairo for espionage.
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny, the Egyptian ambassador serving the post ever since
the two countries forged diplomatic relations in 1979, has been
investigated by Israeli police over the past two months for
alleged indecent advances to an Israeli belly dancer after
inviting her to a friend's apartment.
</P>
<P>
The belly dancer complained to the police, claiming that
Bassiouny had promised to use his connections to advance her
career. The woman's lover reportedly urged her to file the
complaint in a bid to blackmail the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The information about the investigation had been barred from
the news media and was exposed only after the complaint was
dismissed by State Attorney Edna Arbel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Eitan Bentsur offered
an apology to Bassiouny Thursday, saying Israel condemned the
harassment to him by the media and expressing the intention to
continue cooperation with him.
</P>
<P>
Bentsur also praised Bassiouny for his contribution to the
Middle East peace process and the Egyptian-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny said he was pleased that the case had been closed and
satisfied with the stand taken by the Israeli government during
the investigation. The incident would not affect relationship
between two countries, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Local news agency, Itim, said that Bassiouny affair was known
at the highest level including the president, prime minister and
foreign minister, "each of whom followed the progress of the
police inquiry very closely."

<P>
They also expressed concern over White House opinions
concerning human rights and trade issues, and disagreed with US
comments on domestic Chinese issues such as Taiwan and Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijian Calls for Peace-Keepers in Nagorno-Karabakh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijian today made a fresh
call for the dispatch of international peace-keeping forces to the
breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, said an Interfax news agency
report.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
must send troops to help implement the principles for bringing
peace to the region, President Geidar Aliyev was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev's made the remarks at a graduation ceremony of the air
force's pilot training school while commenting on the OSCE's
proposal for resolving the issue that also involves Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Armenia, a neighbor of Azerbaijian, has a military presence in
Nagorno-Karabakh to back the region's request for independence.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE formulated a series of principles at its December 1996
summit in Lisbon, Portugal, calling for granting Nagorno-Karabakh
a high degree of autonomy while keeping it within Azerbaijian.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Minsk group of the OSCE, consisting of
representatives from Russia, France and other European nations,
proposed accomplishing the peace process in two steps.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, some Armenian forces would leave the region
and refugees would return; and in the second step, all Armenian
troops would be out and the region would gain an autonomous status.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijian wants to have a peaceful end to the armed conflict
in Nagorno-Karabakh, Aliyev said today, adding that his government
has agreed in principle on the OSCE group's proposal.
</P>
<P>
On Azerbaijian's military power, the president said his country
now has its own regular armed forces and their current task for
the time being is to enhance combat capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The military has a mandate to defend the country's national
sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development today, Levon Zubadryan, press
secretary to Armanian President Levon Ter-Petrocyan, reportedly
said local authorities of Nagorno-Karabakh had already rejected
the Minsk group's initiative.
</P>
<P>
Armenia will join in future talks for a peace plan acceptable
for all parties involved in the conflict, Zubadryan said. And it
will endorse any document signed by Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Ter-Petrocyan told a news conference in
Erivan that talks on the Nagorno-Karabakh issue could be fruitful
only if representatives from the region are allowed to take part.
</P>
<P>
However, the Azerbaijiani government has a consistent policy of
denying the region's independence request and has been refusing to
have any contact with its representatives.

<HEADLINE> Germany Not to Use Spy Force to Monitor Scientology Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The German government today
decided not to use the country's overseas intelligence service to
monitor Scientologists abroad, defusing further row with
Washington which has been criticizing Germany for its treatment of
Scientologists.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's intelligence
services coordinator, Bernd Schmidbauer, German press agency DPA
quoted a government source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bonn was last month considering putting Scientologists abroad
under the surveillance of the country's overseas intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
Germany's domestic security service has been spying on
Scientologists at home since earlier this year after interior
ministers from the 16 federal states concluded that the group
posed a possible threat to democracy.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, neo-Nazi and extreme leftist parties are also being
likewise observed.
</P>
<P>
Scientology was recognized as a church eligible for tax-free
status in the United States in 1993. It was however accepted in
Germany as an enterprise with economic goals.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel last month described
Scientology as a "quasi-totalitarian" organization, which "is not
a religion or world outlook," in refuting the accusation by a
U.S. senator that Scientology was being persecuted in Germany.
</P>
<P>
German politicians also urged understanding to the need for
Bonn to actively defend democracy against perceived enemies, which
came as a result of such historical experiences as having suffered
from a Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
One of them said "...our American friends must understand that
in Germany we have a concept of defensive democracy: no freedom
for the enemies of freedom regardless of whether they appear in
the guise of religion or not."
</P>
<P>
The Church of Scientology was founded in Los Angeles in 1954 by
L. Ron Hubbard. It now has some eight million members around the
world and some 30,000 members in Germany.

</P>
<P>
This was one of a series of personnel changes in the top

Other changes include state minister at the Defense Ministry

The military lost several garrisons to the hands of the John
Garang rebel movement on the eve of formal negotiations between
the government and the rebels.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Coral Reefs in Shocking Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's coral reefs are
among the least healthy in the world, ravaged by over-fishing,
dynamiting and poison fishing, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Shocking results of the first global survey of coral reefs,
which looked at 300 sites in 30 countries and regions this summer,
were revealed here Thursday by the Reef Check '97 project.
</P>
<P>
Global coordinator of the project Gregor Hodgson said the
results showed there has been "serious damage" to worldwide coral
reefs, which are in much worse shape than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
Commercial fish and shellfish are absent from most sites, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, over-exploitation led to the near-extinction of
creatures such as the spiny lobster, which was abundant less than
20 years ago, said Hodgson, who is also a marine biologist with
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Of 11 species of fish or shellfish the researchers used as
"indicator species," only two, Trochus shells and butterfly fish,
were found in Hong Kong reefs.
</P>
<P>
Coral reefs, called "rain forests of the ocean," are one of the
world's most valuable natural resources, Hodgson said. He
advocated protected marine areas, regulation of fishing practices
and development of artificial reefs to provide breeding grounds
for reef species.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 scientists and divers participated in the
survey.

<HEADLINE> Mandela's Libya Trip Won't Violate UN Sanctions: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela's trip to Tripoli, Libya by land next week would
not be violating United Nations sanctions against Libya, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Peter Swanepoel said today.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel's remarks were clearly in response to concerns of
the United States over the visit.
</P>
<P>
The United States Thursday expressed disapproval of Mandela's
state visit to Libya.
</P>
<P>
"We would reiterate the fact that, according to UN Security
Council Resolutions 748 and 883, flights into Tripoli are a
violation of sanctions. So I think that would be a very specific
concern," State Department spokesman James Foley said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that diplomatic contacts ought to be
maintained at a low level, and we would be disappointed with the
visit of any head of state," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States regards Libya as a sponsor of international
terrorism and seeks to isolate it politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations banned flights to and from Libya because of
Tripoli's refusal to extradite two suspects for the 1988 downing
of a Pan Am airliner over Rockerbie, Scotland. The downing of the
plane by bombs killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel said Mandela's state visit to Libya would not affect
South Africa's relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Through the bi-national commission we keep one another
informed of our different positions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry spokesman added that the South African
government was well aware of the position of the United States,
but that South Africa also had bilateral relations with Libya,
which is a fellow member of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).
</P>
<P>
On the UN sanctions on flights into Libya, Swanepoel said
Mandela would be travelling by road from southern Tunisia to
Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
"The president won't be breaking any sanctions, he's not
flying in and out."
</P>
<P>
South Africa has insisted on developing relations with Libya,
Iran and Cuba, defying pressure and warning from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who plans to visit Egypt and Libya before attending
the Commonwealth heads of state meeting in Edinburg, Scotland on
October 24-27, is expected to broker some sort of resolution on
Rockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
Libya, backed by the OAU and the Non-Aligned Movement, has
suggested a compromise, calling for the trial to be held in a
neutral country, by Scottish judges under Scottish law.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Vice-minister Addresses Sino-US Trade Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), answered
questions concerning President Jiang Zemin's forthcoming US visit
and Sino-US commercial relations during today's State Council
Information Office news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Sun said Jiang's visit to US later this month will be an
important event in the history of Sino-US relations. China and the
United States share extensive common interests in maintaining
world peace, promoting prosperity and stability in the
Asian-Pacific Region and the world at large, solving social
problems of worldwide interest, and strengthening cooperation and
exchanges in areas such as trade, economics, technology, culture
and environment.
</P>
<P>
China is fully confident of bright future prospects for Sino-US
relations, said Sun, adding that Jiang's visit will strengthen
cooperation between China and the United States in all areas.
</P>
<P>
Sun noted that a Chinese commercial delegation will visit the
US in the near future. Zeng Peiyan, vice-minister of the State
Planning Commission will lead the delegation consisting of
government officials and representatives from large
export-oriented enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the visit is to inform businesses in both countries
that the Chinese government attaches great importance to
commercial cooperation with the United States and increasing US
exports to China.
</P>
<P>
Sun pointed out that many Americans are unaware of the fact
that China imports many US products.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope the delegation's visit will inform more
Americans of the importance of Sino-US relations.

<P>
Sun noted that Americans should fully understand that
increasing US exports to China will promote economic development
and employment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the delegation's visit will enhance
understanding between the two countries and create a better
atmosphere for further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will sign a series of contracts related to
aviation, petrochemistry and power stations, with the total value
of the contracts expected to reach several billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the delegation will also release information designed
to attract the interest of more US companies.
</P>
<P>
Sun also addressed China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), and noted that the nation has reached
agreements with New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and Japan in
some respects. He also pointed out that China and the United
States are still negotiating areas of disagreement, especially in
terms agricultural products and trade related to services.
</P>
<P>
Sun expressed full confidence that Jiang's visit will
accelerate the process of Sino-US negotiations and China's WTO
membership.
</P>
<P>
He said China has always maintained that the US government
should relax restrictions on exports of high technology
products. He added that Jiang's visit will play a positive role in
relaxing the US restrictions on exporting high technology products
to China.
</P>
<P>
Sun addressed questions concerning the Sino-US trade balance by
saying that the Chinese government attaches great importance to
imports from the United States. He expressed the hope that the US
government will remove roadblocks to Sino-US ties by providing
China permanent Most Favored Nation status and removing sanctions
on the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, the United States should provide assistance
which will enable US businesses to become more competitive in
China by relaxing export restrictions, providing favorable terms
for loans, and solving problems related to the Sino-US trade
balance.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Govt Spending Beyond Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is overspending financial budget, which, some
economists said, is likely to put Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel's ambitious budget targets in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
According to exchequer figures released on Thursday night, the
government spending for the first six months of the fiscal year
was up 11.5 percent over that of the same period last year,
compared with a budgeted rise in spending of only 6.1 percent for
1997/98.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Department tried to slash government spending in
real terms this fiscal year beginning April to reduce the deficit
and free up saving for the private sector.
</P>
<P>
A reduction in the deficit to four percent of Gross Domestic
Product is a crucial first step toward the growth targets in
growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy worked out
by the South African government.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted economists as saying that they were
increasingly worried that the fiscal targets would not be met,
which would be bad omen for Gear. Spending overruns are also
likely to harm fragile investor confidence, they said.
</P>
<P>
Economist Dawie Roodt said, to meet the targets, non-interest
expenditure would have to fall slightly in nominal terms for the
remainder of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to see how government will be able to achieve
that. Manuel is facing a big problem," Roodt said.
</P>
<P>
However, finance officials remained optimistic that the
targets could be met, saying the figure in the monthly exchequer
statement represented requests from departments and provinces for
funds to spend, rather than actual spending.
</P>
<P>
The final spending figures could be less, the officials said,
adding that they were working hard with provincial governments to
resolve the problems.
</P>
<P>
Finance Director-General Maria Ramos said last week she was
"still optimistic" about the deficit target.
</P>
<P>
"It is true expenditure is higher in the first half than we
wanted it to be, but we are likely to see a significant slowdown
in the second half. We are working closely with the provinces to
sort things out," she added.

<HEADLINE> Development Assistance to Poor Countries Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Development assistance to
developing countries fell by 3.8 billion U.S. Dollars in 1996, a
decline of 4.2 percent from 1995, a leading British aid agency
named Action Aid said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "The Reality of Aid 1997/98", noted that
the biggest cut came from Japan which reduced its aid to
developing countries by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that in 1995, 17 out of 21 Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) donors cut their aid
to sub-Saharan Africa while a quarter of the total OECD aid
reached the 48 least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient aid is being channelled to those countries which
need it most while the wealthier states in central and eastern
Europe have enjoyed a 10 percent increase in aid, added the
report, which came out on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that the world's rich countries were not
committed to eradicating global poverty, particularly in the most
disadvantaged countries in the South, mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
There is little indication that the OECD countries would
reverse the trend, which is blamed on the end of the Cold War,
the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Development assistance to Kenya dropped by 21 percent between
1991 and 1995 while external aid to the country accounts for 10
percent of Kenya's gross national product.

<P>
LAGOS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for Nigeria's 1998
budget have begun in earnest with the Finance Ministry listing 19
priority projects and programs to be accomplished within the
scope of the budget.
</P>
<P>
According to a ministry circular to various related ministries
and departments, the 19 priority projects and programs are to be
assessed under three categories.
</P>
<P>
These are ongoing projects which have gone beyond 70 percent
completion and can be competed before the end of the the next
fiscal year, and rehabilitation projects or those that will
enhance the utilization or performance of existing projects and
programs, as well as ongoing projects which are critical to the
statutory responsibilities of ministries and agencies.
</P>
<P>
The budget, in addition to other development plans, is aimed
at improving the performance of some key macro-economic
aggregates, which hitherto has showed sluggish response to the
various economic policies, the Punch newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, 10 main objectives and policy thrusts
have been sent out which the capital projects are expected to
help achieve, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The objectives include the expansion of the revenue base of
government, continuation of government's policy of deregulation,
as well as employment generation through poverty alleviation
programs.
</P>
<P>
The 19 projects and programs, according to the circular, cover
food production, iron and steel production, railways, machine
tools, solid minerals, security agencies, power plants, education
and health care.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of all ministries, agencies and
extra-ministerial departments started discussions on proposals to
the budget on September 29.

NEW DELHI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government on
Thursday announced further liberalization of the gold and silver
import policy, allowing 11 agencies to import gold and silver for
sale in the domestic market on payment of duty in rupees, the
local press said today.

<P>
Under the new scheme, three trading companies and eight banks
will now be allowed to import gold and silver and supply it to the
domestic market as well, apart from supplying it to exporters of
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
Before the announcement of the new scheme, imports of the
precious metals were allowed only with special import licenses or
for sales to jewelry exporters.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the new policy, Finance Secretary Montek Singh
Ahluwalia said these agencies will be allowed to import gold and
silver on consignment basis in response to the demand placed on
them by domestic buyers.

import, he said, adding that the import duty can be paid in
rupees.

<HEADLINE> Union Strike Blacks Out Parts of Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Power cuts and rationing
plunged parts of the capital and other areas in Lebanon into
darkness last night as the strike of Electricite du Liban (EDL)'s
employees ran into its third day.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper the Daily Star, the strike, which
started on Tuesday to protest the company's failure to meet the
employees' demands for higher pay, benefits and better conditions,
was echoed by nearly 5,000 employees across the country.
</P>
<P>
The employees refused to repair damages to the electricity
network and collect bill.
</P>
<P>
According to EDL sources, the most affected region until
Thursday was Beirut's southern suburbs, where 12 power units
supplying the area broke down.
</P>
<P>
Damage to the network was also reported in other areas like
Sidon, the biggest city in south Lebanon. The paper quoted a
worker, who requested anonymity, as saying that "At least 10
incidents of damage are reported on a normal day."
</P>
<P>
"After four days of being on strike the damages have
definitely piled up," he said, "We even got threats of violence
from people in the suburbs" against the workers' decision not to
repair damages.
</P>
<P>
Ali Ayoub, head of the company's union, acknowledged that he
would agree to suspend the strike, which has only brought
negative and discouraging results, in the light of four of their
demands having been met by the company.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between the representatives of employees and the
company administration is underway, and there are signs that the
strike would end today.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Unveils Surplus Budget for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today announced a
surplus Budget for 1998 with measures which seeks to restore more
aggressively investor confidence in Malaysia in the aftermath of
the currency and stock market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the Budget in Parliament here today, Malaysian
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said "Our economy is at a
crossroad. The direction of the economy is currently fraught with
uncertainties. The crisis in the financial markets is a test of
economic resilience and the effectiveness of policies."
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said the 1998 Budget
strategy is: strengthening economic fundamentals and stabilizing
financial markets; maintaining sustainable growth; continuing the
process of deregulation and liberalization of the economy; and
continuing the social agenda for further overall development.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Budget has a total expenditure package of 64.124
billion ringgit (about 20.038 billion U.S. dollars) for 1998
against the Federal government revenue estimated to be at 68.058
billion ringgit (about 21.268 billion U.S. dollars), showing a
surplus of 3.934 billion ringgit (about 1.23 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the loan repayments and transfers, the
overall surplus will be at 8.951 billion ringgit (about 2.797
billion U.S. dollars), or 3.2 percent of Gross National Product
(GNP), Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
The total allocation for 1998 represents an increase of 1.9
percent over the 1997 total allocation of about 60 billion
ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Of the total for the coming year, 45.633 billion ringgit (about
14.26 billion U.S. dollars) are allocated for operating
expenditure, up 1.7 percent as compared to the 1997 allocation,
and 18.491 billion ringgit (about 5.778 billion U.S. dollars) for
development.
</P>
<P>
Out of the development allocation, a sum of 8.828 billion
ringgit or 47.7 percent is for the economic sector, 5.890 billion
ringgit or 31.9 percent for the social sector, 2.433 billion
ringgit or 13.2 percent for the security sector and 840 million
ringgit or 4.5 percent for the General Services Sector, and the
balance of 500 million ringgit or 2.7 percent for the contingency
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Anwar announced steps to reduce the current account deficit,
increase export competitiveness, cut imports, increase import
duties for luxury items including cars, and further deregulate and
liberalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Malaysia is expected to register a moderate growth
of 7.0 percent in 1998, reflecting slower expansion of world
trade, slower rate of growth in demand and income as well as a
deceleration in agriculture output.
</P>
<P>
He said "We are confident that we can attain the forecast
growth if productivity and competitiveness can be improved."

<P>
NANJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- An album and bronze cigar case
which belonged to John Rabe have been added to the long list of
relics housed in a Nanjing museum commemorating people massacred
during the Rape of Nanjing in 1937.
</P>
<P>
Ursula Reinhardt, Rabe's granddaughter, donated the items
during a recent visit to the city.
</P>
<P>
Rabe, who worked for the Shanghai office of German-based
Siemens from 1931-1938, helped protect more than 200,000 refugees
in Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Rabe later returned to Germany and was arrested for disclosing
atrocities committed by invading Japanese forces.
</P>
<P>
A group of Nanjing residents sent the poverty-stricken Rabe a
gift of 2,000 US dollars and food in 1948.
</P>
<P>
The commemorative album, which recorded the generous gift by
appreciative and sympathetic Nanjingers, remained in the hands of
Rabe's family until the recent donation.

<HEADLINE> Colombo Bombing Won't Affect Sri Lanka's Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The massive explosion in
downtown of Sri Lanka's capital Colombo on Wednesday will not
affect the country's tourism industry, the Association of Group
Tourist Agents (AGTA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The swift handling of the aftermath by the government has
restored the confidence of the tourism industry, the AGTA said.
</P>
<P>
Though the attack was a set-back to the industry, AGTA
officials said they were confident the impact would be minimal.
</P>
<P>
One foreign tourist was among the 16 dead and 32 foreigners
were among the 108 injured in the bombing attack which seriously
damaged two five-star hotels, the Hilton and Galadari.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bombing attack was carried out by members of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has been fighting a
14-year-long ethnic war for a separate state of their own in the
north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Some tourism analysts expect tourist arrivals to drop in the
next few months but the AGTA said they had no intention of
canceling reservations made for the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's tourism industry, which was badly affected in 1996
because of the bombing of the Central Bank and a passenger train
at Dehiwela near Colombo, has recovered considerably this year due
to improved security conditions.
</P>
<P>
Up to July this year, tourist arrivals rose by 21 percent to
237,100 compared to 194,800 during the corresponding period the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
At a presidential news conference this morning, Tourism and
Aviation Minister Dharmasiri Senanayake said a total of 494
tourists arrived at Colombo on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Have Bigger Say in Family Life (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, the final decision on child-bearing is mainly up to
the woman, who has the final say on the timing of the pregnancy,
giving birth and becoming a mother.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed a major shift in the thinking of today's
females in China regarding questions such as "whether a woman
should end up with one man."
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, most urban women and nearly half of
rural women hold negative attitude toward having only one man in
their life. In the divorce cases during the last 10 years, the
number of women who are initiating the divorce has been increasing.
</P>
<P>
Women consider contraception liberating, allowing them to
regulate child-bearing. The survey reveals that, besides the
safety period method, 40.88 percent of urban men, 44.59 percent of
urban women, 23.51 percent of rural men and 69.01 percent of rural
women are found to use some form of contraception. However, the
main responsibility of contraception still falls on women.

<HEADLINE> PNA Weighs Reopening Hamas Institutions: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) is considering reopening the Hamas institutions
which were closed in the recent crackdown on terror, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
PNA Cabinet Secretary Abdul Rahman has informed leaders of the
Islamic Resistance Movement in Gaza that PNA President Yasser
Arafat would appoint a committee to review whether the
institutions could resume activities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA move came after the return to Gaza of Hamas founder and
spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin early the month, which has
brought considerable pressure on Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was freed by Israel in a deal with Jordan in exchange
for the release of two secret Mossad agents captured by Jordanian
police in a failed assassination attempt on a Hamas political
leader in Amman on September 25.
</P>
<P>
This gave a boost to the Islamic militant group, which has
claimed responsibility for a series of bombing attacks against
Israel with the goal to liberate all Palestine land. Twenty-five
people including five bombers were killed and 300 others wounded
in the latest two attacks in two central Jerusalem markets.
</P>
<P>
Although it gained fame through terror attacks carried out by
its secret military wing Izzadin Kassim, Hamas is in fact
primarily a political organization deeply-rooted in the
Palestinian society.
</P>
<P>
It has been running a wide network of charity institutions,
including schools, day-care centers and clinics, to serve the need
of the poor and neglected. Israel insists that they are the
infrastructure that supports the Hamas terrorism and demands the
PNA dismantle them.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from both Israel and the United States,
Arafat promised tougher security measures by arresting a large
number of Hamas activists and shutting down several of their
institutions. But Yassin's release has both undermined the Israeli
demand for security and weakened PNA's ability to continue the
crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Urges Tamils to Support Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga today called upon all Tamils and all citizens to give
their fullest support to her government's efforts to solve the
problems of the Tamil people and finish the never-ending-cycle of
terrible violence.
</P>
<P>
At a presidential news conference, the president said: "I
believe the Tamil people of Sri Lanka have no other alternative,
they have to support this government's policy which is the only
way out."
</P>
<P>
She expressed her determination to end the war successfully and
bring in the political solutions her government has proposed.
</P>
<P>
She said every evidence pointed to the fact that the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam had conspired the bombing of downtown
Colombo Wednesday morning, which killed 11 people and injured 108
others. Five LTTE rebels were shot dead by the security forces in
a crossfire following the explosion.
</P>
<P>
She also appealed the main opposition party, the United
National Party (UNP), to take a stand on "the only political
solution that have been offered by any government."
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the UNP to stop its politics of silence, it is
time for them to speak and tell the country what their stand is on
the solution we have proposed to end the war and to bring peace
back again to this country," the president said.
</P>
<P>
She accused some of the private media which had been sending
untrue reports with regard to the Colombo bombing and described
them as "irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
She said, contrary to those reports "that are full of complete
lies," the security forces was in total control in less than a few
minutes of the explosion site and of the whole of Colombo city and
the government is in total control of the situation now.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to finish reconstruction of all the
damaged buildings, several of them in a few weeks and the others
in a few months, she said.
</P>
<P>
She pledged to give support, financially and in every other
way, to the private institutions that were seriously damaged in
the explosion to undertake the reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist attack "has not deterred us in any way in any of
the major programs that the government has undertaken in the past
few years and has been implementing," she noted.
</P>
<P>
"This act will set us back for a few months, but I wish to
state that in the same way we bounced back after the terrorist
attack (on the Central Bank) nearly two years ago, we are bouncing
back, we shall recover," she added.
</P>
<P>
Also on the news conference, Tourism Minister Dharmasiri
Senanayake said the country's tourism industry, a cornerstone the
Sri Lanka's economy, was not affected by the bombing.
</P>
<P>
He said till now there has been no cancellation of tourist
charters and a total of 494 tourists arrived at Colombo on
Thursday.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Provinces in China are
beginning to cooperate in dealing with the once aimless exodus of
rural laborers without jobs.
</P>
<P>
South China's Guangdong Province, which became the country's
largest employer with its booming economic growth, has initiated
cooperative relations with other provinces to deal with migrant
workers returning from Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of the Ministry of Labor, this kind of
inter-regional cooperation has been expanded to more provinces.
Now, a South China Labor Market Information Network has been put
into use, linking eight provinces in the area, centered around
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The network's Guangdong Center has also connected with the
networks of the Ministry of Labor, north China, and east China to
provide more data for accommodating a surplus rural labor force.
</P>
<P>
Inter-provincial cooperation now focuses on management of
employment identity cards, which serve as a certificate for
migrant workers to seek jobs.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions have seen the benefits and are working in cooperation to
find work for the jobless, said Sun Qingqi, deputy-director of the

BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The nation's first Sino-Foreign
investment bank -- China International Capital Corp. (CICC) -- has
established a niche in the domestic capital market as an
authorized lead underwriter for A Share placements.
</P>
<P>
The corporation recently acted as the support underwriter for
two A share issues restricted to domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
Experts hailed the event as the starting point for the
convergence of the domestic and international capital markets, and
as a strong signal that more Sino-foreign investment banks will
enter the domestic capital market.
</P>
<P>
CICC, a joint venture between the China Construction Bank and
US-based JP Morgan, has actively tapped the international capital
market since its establishment in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The corporation acted as the financial consultant and
coordinator for the China Telecom (Hong Kong) acquisition of a 5.5
percent stake in Hong Kong Telecom. International syndicated loans
were used to purchase the share position from Britain's Cable and
Wireless, the parent company.
</P>
<P>
CICC was also one of the lead underwriters and the global
coordinator for the public share offering of China Telecom (Hong
Kong) in both Hong Kong and New York. The offering is expected to
raise the largest volume of overseas funds ever raised by a
Chinese company.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Phase out Chemical Pesticides in Flower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan flower industry has
identified a number of alternative pesticides for the production
of cut flowers and gradually phased out the use of methyl
bromide, the paper "Daily Nation" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Naivasha-based Sulmac Flower Farm,
the biggest one in the country, had reportedly reduced its
consumption of methyl bromide by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jack Juma of the company told an on-going workshop on Thursday
that Sulmac was aimed at completely stopping the use of methyl
bromide by June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Initially, he said, the company, which grows roses,
chrysanthemums and carnations for export, is reducing the area
under the chemical from 140 hectares to 25 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Sulmac used to be the biggest consumer of methyl bromide in
this east African country, importing 80 tons each year for soil
disinfestation.
</P>
<P>
Methyl bromide, a popular soil fumigant in the floriculture
industry, is one of the ozone-depleting substances targeted for
phasing out internationally.
</P>
<P>
According to the Montreal Protocol agreements, while developed
countries are expected to freeze the production and use of methyl
bromide by 2002, developing countries should have done the same
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should completely phase out methyl
bromide by 2015 while developed countries should have
accomplished the same by 2005.
</P>
<P>
A representative of Colombia, the world's number two exporter
of cut flowers, told the workshop that his country had completely
phased out the use of methyl bromide in the production of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is ranked third biggest cut flower exporter in the world
while the Netherlands is first.

<HEADLINE> 12,000 Kids Abducted in N. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- About 12,000 children have
been abducted from northern Uganda by the rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) over the last five years, reported "the
Monitor" daily today.
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Cravero, representative of the United Nations
Children Fund to Uganda, was quoted as saying that 50 percent of
these are feared dead while 25 percent have returned.
</P>
<P>
According to Cravero, about 70 percent of the abducted are
between ages of 12 and 15 and 50 percent are boys, 40 percent
girls and 10 percent adults.
</P>
<P>
Among the abducted girls, she said, only 10 percent of the
them have returned.
</P>
<P>
Cravero reviewed that this was possible because the girls are
made wives of the rebel commanders and are always near the camps,
giving them less chances of escaping.
</P>
<P>
Cravero disclosed that 80 percent of the abduction occur in
Gulu and Kitgum districts where the LRA rebels -- Christian
fundamentalists -- have been distablizing for the last 10 years,
though some have taken place in Moyo, Lira and Apac districts as
well as in northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cravero noted that more and more children are being
abducted in western districts of Kasese and Bundibugyo by the
rebels of Allied Democratic Forces who seems to copy LRA.
</P>
<P>
According to Cravero, 90 percent of abduction occur at home,
school and community places like water sources.
</P>
<P>
Cravero condemned LRA rebels for involving children in the
war.
</P>
<P>
"The problem has been more pronounced in the last three years
because voluntary recruitment into LRA seems to have dwindled
almost to nil," she said, adding that children's rights have been
violated, including witnessing murder of fellow children.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Have Bigger Say in Family Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China traditionally has been
considered a country where the husband dominates and the wife has
less power in decision-making on major family issues.
</P>
<P>
However, drastic changes have occurred according to a recent
survey which found that more than 93 percent of Chinese urban
women have the responsibility of managing the family's income.
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Population Research Institute of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) was conducted in Shanghai City,
Guangdong, Shandong, Jilin and Shaanxi provinces, and the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region. Results were announced at the ongoing
General Population Conference.
</P>
<P>
The survey reveals that the key to women's economic status in
family life is their income. The majority of Chinese women now
have an independent income and share common power with their
husbands in managing the family's economic activities, the survey
shows.
</P>
<P>
The rising economic status of women also has brought enormous
change to their thinking about child-bearing, divorce and other
issues, the survey reveals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese wives now play a bigger role in decisions on
child-bearing, according to the survey, and no longer are obedient
to parents and parents-in-law on that issue. They are more likely
to discuss it with their husbands.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Regulation to Standardize Job Switching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Municipal lawmakers passed a
regulation Thursday that will limit job-switching by people in
certain types of work.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will affect people in Beijing who have access to
national secrets and those who are in control of specialized
technology, business secrets or intellectual property rights
considered vital to the country, the department or the work unit
that hires them. The law becomes effective Jan 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Such people will face punishment if they quit jobs without
informing their employers or cause losses to their original
employers by disclosing business or technological secrets, or by
infringing on their intellectual property rights," the regulation
states. Serious violators may be brought to court.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also bans recruiters from hiring such people
and a fine of 10,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan may be imposed on
violators.
</P>
<P>
As the country moves toward a market economy, the old
life-long employment system is breaking down. People have the
right to choose jobs in their best interests. Last year alone,
60,000 people in Beijing switched jobs.
</P>
<P>
"The regulation is to standardize the personnel market, not to
discourage the normal flow of personnel," said one local
official.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt to Resolve Land Imbalance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has said the government will not hesitate to change the
constitution in its endeavors to give land to the landless black
people.
</P>
<P>
The government and the ruling ZANU (PF) are so determined to
give the people their soil that no statute would stop it from
doing so, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Forget what the constitution says. If it does not indicate
that we can take the land, then it will be changed and people
will just have to take the land," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing yesterday the Mashonaland East party
provincial leadership, heads of government departments,
traditional chiefs and other authorities in his ongoing
consultative meetings in Marondera of east Zimbabwe to assess the
land acquisition and distribution program.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the time has now come to call the soil of Zimbabwe
our soil because we are the sons of this soil."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe reiterated that political power should be matched with
economic gains, adding that it is folly to think that all is well
among blacks when only a minority group is sitting on most of the
land.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would never pay compensation to farmers
as this is tantamount to paying somebody who would have stolen
from you in order to get back one's stolen property.
</P>
<P>
The land was taken willy-nilly and thousands of black
Zimbabweans sacrificed their lives to win it back and yet the
government has never asked for compensation for the injuries and
losses of life suffered during the war of liberation, he said.
</P>
<P>
National Chairman of the Land Acquisition Committee Joseph
Msika stressed that the land is definitely going to be taken
before the end of the year and it is up to the people to make
full use of it.
</P>
<P>
"I know that in the 1940s most whites got huge tracts of land
and were given soft loans and we will do the same. We want a
back-up program and remove the monopoly which is in the hands of
the whites," said Msika.
</P>
<P>
Msika added, "this should be a land acquisition revolution and
we want everyone to be involved."
</P>
<P>
At least 62,000 families have been resettled since
independence but another 100,000 still wait for the land which
the government has been promising for the past 17 years.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Environmental Protection Goals for Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to raise its
environmental quality to levels required for ensuring the progress
of modernization in the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
A new blueprint issued by the State Bureau for Environmental
Protection (SBEP) calls for China to curb environmental
deterioration and dramatically improve environmental quality in
the first decade of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The country will control pollution and ecological damage by
2020, in addition to further improving environmental quality in
its urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China will be a prosperous and democratic socialist country by
the middle of the next century, with environmental quality meeting
the needs for modernization process, according to the blueprint.
</P>
<P>
SBEP Deputy Director Zhang Kunmin said that China will enhance
pollution control and ecological protection efforts, and will do
its utmost to curb environmental deterioration and improve
regional environmental quality in the remaining years of this
century.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, China closed more than 60,000 factories
causing serious pollution to the environment.
</P>
<P>
All industrial polluters in the Huaihe River Valleys have been
instructed to meet State emission standards prior to December 31,

<HEADLINE> China's Wushu Sets Sights Upon Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's judo has entered the
Olympic Games, South Korea's Taekwondo will be there in 2000. How
about China's Wushu, also named martial art?
</P>
<P>
Dated back earlier than the ancient Olympic Games, the Chinese
traditional sport is eager to find its way to become a full
Olympic medal event.
</P>
<P>
In its campaign, China has been putting tremendous efforts as
Wushu is left as the lone non-Olympic sport in the on-going Eighth
National Games where all the others were cut off in its bold
Olympic-oriented reform.
</P>
<P>
And golds in the sport are increased to 15 from seven in the
Seventh National Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 77 member countries have joined their ranks in the
International Wushu Federation (IWF), which was founded in 1990
and chaired by Wu Shaozu, also minister of the Chinese State
Physical Culture and Sports Commission.
</P>
<P>
"The number of the membership has met the requirements of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) for a full status in the
Olympic Games," said Zhang Shan, chairman of the arbitration
committee of the National Games Wushu competition.
</P>
<P>
The IWF will take concrete actions on its application in the
coming fourth World Wushu Championships slated late this month in
Rome, Italy.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch here on
Tuesday, minister Wu hoped Samaranch consider IWF's request during
the Championships.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we'll take it into consideration," said Samaranch, who
was invited by Chinese Olympic Committee for the National Games
opened on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wushu made its debut in an international meet as a formal event
at the 11th Asain Games held in Beijing in 1990, with the
participation of 96 players from 11 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"The 11th Asian Games marked a breakthrough for Wushu, heading
towards Asia and the world," said Li Jie, president of the Chinese
Wushu Federation.
</P>
<P>
Col Giuseppe Falconi, president of the Italian Wushu
Federation, had expressed his firm support for IWF's application
when the bidding campaign for the 2004 Olympic Games was in full
swing.
</P>
<P>
"If Rome won the rights to host the 2004 Games, we would try
our best to list Wushu as a full event, at least as an exhibition
event," said Falconi, also chairman of the Organizing Committee
for the Fourth World Wushu Championships.
</P>
<P>
"It's only a matter of time for Wushu to enter the Olympic
family," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Rome championships will be the largest-ever Wushu meet in
history. At least 55 countries and regions will send some 700
competitiors to fight for 25 golds.
</P>
<P>
To usher in Wushu upon the Olympic stage, Falconi, who also
practises Wushu by playing shadow boxing, said he will invite IOC
chief Samaranch to attend the championships.
</P>
<P>
But the difficulties cannot be down-played in the course of
pushing the fledging world sport to the international arena.
</P>
<P>
The biggest obstacle is the lack of standard regulations in
ruling the competitions as gymnastics, judo and taekwando, which
poses the great challenge and remains as an unshakable task for us
in bringing the sport towards the Olympic Games, Li Jie said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident of materializing our dreams as Wushu is not only
a popular sport in China, but also a promosing sport that has been
winning more and more enthusiasts abroad," he added.

<HEADLINE> Slowdown Envisaged in Malaysia's Economic Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economic
expansion in 1998 is clearly indicated to slow down due to an
envisaged slower pace of economic activities in the second half of
1997 following the volatility in its foreign exchange and stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
For 1998, its real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is
expected to grow at a moderate range of 7 percent against the
envisaged 8 percent in 1997 and 8.6 percent in 1996, according to
the Economic Report 1997/98 released here today by the Malaysian
Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A slower growth in nominal gross national product (GNP) of 8.3
percent in current prices in 1998 is envisaged against the
projected 10.2 percent in 1997 and 14.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Malaysia's per capita income in
current prices is envisaged to increase by 5.7 percent in 1998
compared with estimated 7.7 percent in 1997 and 11.7 percent in
1996, to 12,797 ringgit from estimated 12,102 ringgit in 1997 and
11,239 ringgit in 1996 (about 3.2 ringgit = 1 U.S. dollar at the
current rate).
</P>
<P>
The moderation in real output growth of the economy in 1998
reflects largely the impact of a moderate expansion in the volume
of world trade, slower growth in domestic demand and income, as
well as a significant negative turnaround in the output of
agriculture sector from a growth of 3.5 percent in 1997 to a
decline of 1.2 percent in 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has not been spared from the contagion effects of
developments in Thailand which have triggered volatility in the
region's financial markets, with its currency -- the ringgit --
depreciating by nearly 30 percent against the U.S. dollar since
July and stock prices dropped by some 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Output expansion in the manufacturing sector, the backbone of
the economy, is envisaged to slow down to a 10.5 percent increase
in 1998 against 12 percent in 1997, however the expansion remains
still strong.
</P>
<P>
With the manufacturing sector envisaged to expand at a rate
surpassing that of other sectors of the economy, its share to GDP
is expected to increase to 36.6 percent in 1998 against 35.5
percent in 1997 and 34.2 percent in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Construction starts in 1998 are expected to slow down with the
value-added of the construction sector to increase by 9 percent
against a projected growth of 11 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In line with the moderation in the growth of the primary and
secondary sectors of the economy, the report said the pace of
value-added of the services sector is expected to moderate
slightly to 8.6 percent in 1998 against 8.7 percent in 1997 with
its shares to GDP forecast to increase to 45.7 percent in the
coming year from 45 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Encouragingly, Malaysia's current account of the balance of
payments is envisaged to record a smaller deficit of 11.3 billion
ringgit against an estimated deficit of 13.1 billion ringgit in
1997, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit is forecast to narrow from 5
percent of GNP in 1997 to 4 percent of GNP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, inflation is likely to remain low, the report said
without giving specific rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
It said with further measures to be announced in the 1998
Budget, the fundamentals of the economy would be strengthened
further.

<HEADLINE> UTC Success Attributed to Adapting to Chinese Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- "When in Rome, do as the Romans
do." That philosophy has guided United Technologies Corp.'s
business in China, according to Richard Latham, president of UTC's
International Operation China.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Latham outlined UTC's
approach: "We have to get fit in the Chinese culture and society,
let the Chinese do their way, use the Chinese way of saying
things, and use examples from the Chinese history in modern
management."
</P>
<P>
This thinking has played an important role in UTC's success in
China, he said. UTC is one of the world's largest industrial
conglomerates with holdings in aerospace equipment, machinery and
electrical products.
</P>
<P>
In China, UTC has 22 joint ventures and cooperative enterprises
in operation and 10 joint projects under negotiation in such
diverse product fields as aerospace engines, air conditioners,
elevators, auto parts and combustion turbines for industrial use.
</P>
<P>
Six UTC-funded ventures are under way in central and western
China, relatively backward areas rich in natural resources. Five
of the next ten joint ventures will be in that same part of China.
</P>
<P>
UTC generated 24 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in 1996, one
billion of which was related to China in foreign trade and
domestic sales. Latham said China is UTC's market with the fastest
growth.
</P>
<P>
Latham, an American who studied in the Beijing University 16
years ago, said mutual understanding between the United States and
China is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
"Culture is like an egg." Latham said, "You get through a layer
and you learn a little more about the egg, and you learn a little
more about the culture.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is most people never get beyond 'the shell of the
egg'," Latham said, in commenting on cultural misunderstanding
which he views as harmful to smooth economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Latham said that foreigners who work for UTC here are required
to have information for staff members interpreted or translated
into Chinese. He also said that Chinese workers are promoted to
management when qualified.
</P>
<P>
"They are hardworking and very well educated," Latham said of
his Chinese work force. Latham also praised UTC's Chinese
employees for their work ethic.
</P>
<P>
Chinese employees of UTC's subsidiary in Shanghai, Carrier,
have traveled to other joint ventures in Asia to train workers to
improve product quality.
</P>
<P>
The 25 percent share of the Chinese market attained by UTC's
Otis Elevator subsidiary can be traced to the leadership of Huang
Xiong, Latham said. Huang is president of Tianjin Otis.
</P>
<P>
Twenty investment analysts visited China in September with
George David, UTC chairman. UTC's subsequent three-point stock
gain on the New York Stock Exchange was attributed by Latham to
the analysts' "favorable assessment" of the work discipline,
education level of Chinese workers and the quality of both the
products and Chinese management.

<HEADLINE> Water Projects Play Key Role in Fighting Droughts </HEADLINE>

<P>
SHENYANG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Water conservation projects in
northeast China's Liaoning Province are playing a crucial role in
the anti-drought drive, according to sources at the provincial
water conservancy department.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has been enduring unusually dry weather since spring,
a condition that is threatening more than 1.3 million hectares of
farm land.
</P>
<P>
Emergency water conservation measures have been taken to
minimize losses. A fund of 200 million yuan has been established
to deal with the water shortage.
</P>
<P>
One system consisting of six reservoirs in the center region of
the province has guaranteed water-supply for the major irrigated
fields.
</P>
<P>
About 730,000 hectares of irrigated fields in the region should
have enough water to increase grain production by more than 500
million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Twenty million cubic meters of water has also been diverted
from a northern reservoir to a grain base in the southern delta to
alleviate the water shortage.
</P>
<P>
These efforts are expected to raise the total output of 160,000
hectares of wheat fields in the province by more than 100 million
kilograms, officials said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, water-saving irrigation technology has been
implemented to decrease consumption.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 wells and ponds also have been dug or dredged,
providing water for 44,667 hectares of grain.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economic Growth Remains High in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economic growth
for 1997 is expected to remain high although at a lower rate
compared with that in 1996 despite its economy was affected by
speculative attacks on the regional financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected
to moderate to 8 percent in 1997 against 8.6 percent in 1996,
according to the Economic Report 1997/98 released here today by
the Malaysian Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
1997 is the 10th year for Malaysia to achieve economic growth
at a rate above 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nominal gross national product (GNP) is envisaged to grow at a
rate of 10.2 percent in 1997 against that of 14.3 percent in 1996
while per capita income in current prices is estimated to increase
by 7.7 percent in 1997, against 11.7 percent in 1996, to 12,102
ringgit against 11,239 ringgit in 1996 (about 3.2 ringgit = 1 U.S.
dollar at the current rate), according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the moderation in output growth is mainly due
to an envisaged slower pace of economic activities in the second
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has not been spared from the contagion effects of
developments in Thailand which have triggered volatility in the
region's financial markets, with its currency -- the ringgit --
depreciating by nearly 30 percent against the U.S. dollar since
July and stock prices dropped by some 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was successful in keep inflation at a low level, which
eased during the first nine month of 1997 to 2.6 percent, the
lowest since 1990, against 3.6 percent during the corresponding
period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
For 1997 as a whole, the inflation rate would be around 3
percent as the country replenishes its stocks of supplies for the
remaining months of the year with imports at higher prices from
countries whose currencies have recently appreciated against the
ringgit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the output performance of most sectors of the economy
remains strong, with the manufacturing, construction and some
sub-sectors in the services sector continuing to record
double-digit rates of expansion, it said.
</P>
<P>
Value-added in the manufacturing sector is envisaged to
increase by 12 percent in real terms with its share to the real
GDP expected to increase to 35.5 percent in the year against that
of 34.2 percent in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Though imposition of the limit on bank lending to the broad
property sector and the moderation in demand for properties are
expected to discourage new construction starts, value-added in the
construction sector is expected to grow by 11 percent in 1997 and
the share of the sector to GDP is expected to increase to 4.8
percent from 4.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Output growth of the agriculture, forestry, livestock and
fishery sector is envisaged pick up to 3.5 percent from 2.2
percent in 1996, the report said, adding that its share to GDP is
expected to continue to slide to 12.2 percent in 1997 from 12.7
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The output growth in the mining sector is envisaged to slow
down to 2.8 percent in the year from 4.5 percent in 1996 with its
shares to GDP to decline further to 6.8 percent from 7.2 percent
during the same period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that growth in value-added of the services sector is
expected to remain strong, although at a slower rate of 8.7
percent in 1997 against 9.7 percent in 1996 and the shares of
services sector to total GDP is estimated to increase to 45
percent against 44.8 percent in 1996,
</P>
<P>
The current account of the balance of payments is estimated to
record a slightly larger deficit of 13.1 billion ringgit in 1997,
compared with 12.3 billion ringgit in 1996, it said, adding the
current account deficit is envisaged to narrow to 5 percent of
GNP, against 5.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit is expected to be adequately
financed by net inflow of foreign corporate direct investment,
amounting to 13.2 billion ringgit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Given the contagion effects of the recent financial volatility,
Malaysia's economy is, however, projected to slow down to a growth
rate of 7 percent in 1998.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-six Ugandan children die
of diarrhoea everyday as a result of poor sanitation, reported
local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Josephine Nambooze, health consultant in the Health Ministry,
was quoted as saying that human excreta disposal in Uganda is
appalling and increasing the vicious cycle of sickness.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day seminar on sanitation here on Thursday,
Nambooze said that only 47.3 percent out of every 100 homes in
the country has latrines.
</P>
<P>
The situation, according to her, is grimmer in the northern
part of the country, where only four out of 100 homes have a
latrine.
</P>
<P>
Crispus Kiyonga, the health minister of Uganda, in his speech
disclosed that in Uganda 50 percent of out-patient cases are
sanitation related and the country spends 27 million U.S. Dollars
on their treatment, adding that some 10 million Dollars more are
lost in wasted work days.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kintu Musoke in his opening speech at the
seminar urged the local leaders not to blame their fellow
villagers, instead sensitize them and be their examples.

A Swazi government spokesman accused the SABC of not depicting
the truth about the strike and said news pictures broadcast on
Monday night were filmed in February.
</P>
<P>
SABC denied the claims, saying that the footage and interviews
were done this week.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Swaziland prime minister's office, Meshack
Shongwe, said the Swazi government and general public were
surprised and shocked at the screening of "a distorted and
unbalanced view of the current situation" on SABC television.
</P>
<P>
SABC spokesman Enoch Sithole said Thursday that Swaziland's
decision to cut the SABC feed was unfortunate for people who
benefited from the South African broadcaster's service.
</P>
<P>
He said the political freedoms gained in South Africa should
be extended to the Swazi kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"People should be able to watch whatever they like, and make
up their own minds," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide strike called by the Swaziland Federation of
Trade Unions (SFTU) began Monday, but aborted when workers of
three major sugar companies returned to work on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU was supported mainly by workers in the sugar industry
and plantation hands. Sugar is the kingdom's main foreign
currency generator.

<HEADLINE> Riyadh Insists on Boycotting Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia said that it
will boycott the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit
scheduled in Doha, Qatar in November which would include Israel.
</P>
<P>
The official Saudi Press Agency today quoted an official source
as saying that the kingdom will not be represented at any level at
the conference.
</P>
<P>
This was a downright denial of what U.S. State Department
spokesman James Robin said one day earlier that Saudi Arabia would
have some form of representation at the proposed conference.
</P>
<P>
The official source, who was not named, said "there is no
change in Saudi Arabia's position." Riyadh announced its boycott
after the Middle East peace process stalled due to Israeli
intransigence.
</P>
<P>
The annual event, launched in 1994, is traditionally attended
by Arab states, Israel and their major trade partners in the
industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
Several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, expressed their intention to boycott in line with
the Arab League decision to suspend normalization of relations
with Israel following the Jewish state's construction of a new
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is an Arab heavyweight and a member of the
six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which includes Kuwait,
the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has time and again expressed its resolve to host the
conference, but at a lower level of foreign ministers and said its
decision was made in the light of "progress in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The conference, which symbolized an Arab-Israeli rapport, has
been vehemently supported by the United States. U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright met GCC foreign ministers in Saudi Arabia
last month during her first Mideast tour to persuade the Arab
countries to take part in the summit.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister for

Kimiti promised that his ministry will do everything possible
to encourage local investors in these fields.

wait for foreign investors in the two sectors when Tanzanians are
capable of venturing into the fields with a strong government
backing.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "this year's World Food Day message is 'Investing in
Food Security'."
</P>
<P>
The minister added that it is important to revive the
agro-industries which will use local produce rather than import
raw materials when the country is potentially productive.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil-Processing Capacity Ranks 4th in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China's annual crude oil
processing has reached 210 million tons, fourth in the world, the
China Economic Times has reported.
</P>
<P>
China now produces 3.94 million tons of ethylene each year,
also fourth in the world. Ethylene is a gas used in synthesizing
organic compounds.
</P>
<P>
Those figures for crude oil and ethylene reflect the rapid
growth of the industry since China Petrochemical Corp. was founded
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the corporation processed 175 million tons of
crude oil, accounting for 80 percent of the country's total, and
2.95 million tons of ethylene, 75 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The corporation has made major strides in technical ability,
said Sheng Huaren, general manager of China Petrochemical.
</P>
<P>
China has developed its own oil-refining equipment, Sheng said,
and has the ability to design large modern oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
China also has imported foreign technology and equipment since
the 1980s to boost its petrochemical industry.

DHAKA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
seek only 1.46-billion-U.S.-dollar assistance at a Bangladesh Aid
Group meeting to be held here on November 4 and 5, the local press

According to a memorandum finalized by a special cabinet

provided by the aid group last year while the total commitment was

</P>

The meeting maintained that it would be better to adopt a
pragmatic approach with regard to aid rather than obtain a big
commitment from the donors and that the amount of the aid to be
sought should be kept within limits, the newspaper The Independent
quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Though it obtained a commitment for a large amount of loans
last year, the government failed to use the whole amount due to
the inefficiency of the implementing agencies, according to the

<HEADLINE> Women's Trap, Skeet Added to 2000 Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The women's trap and skeet
shooting events were added to the agenda of the 2000 Olympic Games
but the number of sharpshooters were reduced to 310, a top Chinese
shooting official revealed here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) on May 21 when the IOC finally ratified the application of
the International Shooting Federation.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of sharpshooters were reduced from 330 in
Atlanta to 310 in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Gong Liren, chief of the Chinese Shooting and Archery Sports
Center, said the IOC has made the right decision which manifests
the equality between the men and women shooters.
</P>
<P>
China once enjoyed its upperhands in these two women events as
Zhang Shan of Sichuan province beat her men opponents to take the
title of the men's skeet in the Barcelona Games, Gong said.
</P>
<P>
However, women sharpshooters have been prevented from competing
in the men's trap and skeet events after the Barcelona Games, and
many a countries had re-adjusted their Olympic-oriented strategies
to focus on the lone event of the women's double trap, including
China.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, we had lost our advantages in the events wherein Italy,
Russia and Finland have been keeping their trainings," Gong said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shan has not trained in her discipline of skeet for
years, and it's hard for her and her teamates to back to their top
forms in a short period of time after a hiatus of years, the
Chinese shooting officials lamented.
</P>
<P>
"However, we also have a few young sharpshooters of great
potential, including Chen Zhengru of Sichuan province, who once
shot 123 points which overpassed the world record of 119," Gong
Said.
</P>
<P>
While the women shooters of Italy, Russia and Finland will
become top favorites to win the trap and skeet events in Sydney,
China also has its medal hopefuls upon their perfomances there, he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Extend Massive Poverty Alleviation Loan to Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) announced today that competent
U.N. agencies will extend a massive loan of 20 million
U.S. dollars to Romania for alleviating poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
Leueen Miller, the UNDP representative to Romania, made the
announcement at the inauguration of a UNDP-sponsored "poverty
elimination week" in Bucharest, the Romanian capital.
</P>
<P>
Miller said the loan will be effective between 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the inaugural ceremony of the poverty
elimination week, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu vowed to
do his best to ensure a good life through reforms for the people.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu admitted Romania is facing a serious social
problem -- many people are living in poverty. To cover up the
fact is to be guilty of sustaining and deepening the problem, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to admit the fact in an effort to make it a priority
for the everyday work of the government, parliament and
president," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the Romanian government has taken
several measures to improve the situation including offering
living subsidies to poor families with many children, providing
stipends to high school and elementary school students and
improving pensions for farmers. But he also said those are not
enough.
</P>
<P>
Information distributed by the UNDP at a news conference
following the opening ceremony indicated that about 38 percent of
Romanians are living in poverty and 7 percent are unable to
maintain a normal life.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Polish telecommunications
industry has developed rapidly in recent years, with a marked
increase in the number of telephone subscribers, Minister of Posts
and Telecommunications Andrzej Zielinski said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Zielinski said that the current 7
million telephone subscribers nationwide represent a noteworthy
increase over the country's total of 3 million in 1990 and 4.5
million in 1993.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the total number of phone subscribers
nationwide is expected to hit 7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
In terms of phone subscribers, one in every 100 Poles possess
20 telephone sets today as compared with 11 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, 30 percent of the country's population will
have access to telephone service, reaching the average level in
Europe. This figure is expected to double by 2005, about the
current level in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cellular phones are being popularized nationwide.
The total number of cellular phones in use at present is 700,000,
seven times that two years ago.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, cellular phones in use are expected to
total 1 million, which will be further increased to 3 million by
2000.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications industry enjoys an even higher growth
rate in rural areas, Zielinski said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Fighting Worst Oil Spill After Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is fighting its
worst oil spill in the region following a collision between a very
large crude carrier (VLCC) and an oil tanker Wednesday night just
off the Singapore port limits in the Singapore Strait.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today that a massive cleanup operation
is now under way with a fleet of 34 anti-pollution craft being
called in to try to contain the oil spill and prevent it from
reaching the shores of the tourist attraction island of Sentosa
and Singapore island proper.
</P>
<P>
The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) raised last
night its estimate of the amount of oil spillage to 25,000 tons,
up from the previous estimation of 3,000 to 4,000 tons earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
The MPA has also called in resources of the Singapore Armed
Forces and made an appeal to Australia, Japan and the United
States for more equipment to help speed up the cleanup process.
</P>
<P>
An MPA spokesman told local newspapers that there are no plans
to close the shipping lanes in the Singapore Strait, one of the
world's most congested routes and that the "situation was under
control."
</P>
<P>
The collision occurred between an empty VLCC and an oil tanker
at about 9 p.m. Wednesday night. It took place just off the
Singapore port limits, where visibility then was about eight
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-registered VLCC "Orapin Global" of 129,702 gross tons
was transiting the Singapore Strait from east to west while the
Cyprus-flagged oil tanker "Evoikos," 75,428 gross tons, was
eastward-bound for Singapore from the United Arab Emirates, when
they were both warned of the impending collision by the Vessel
Traffic Information Service, the MPA said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The MPA said Evoikos was carrying about 120,000 tons of marine
fuel oil when the collision took place.

<HEADLINE> FAO Leader Appeals for More Investment in Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) today called on all countries in the world,
especially the poorer developing countries, to attach great
importance to more investment in food security.
</P>
<P>
FAO Direct General Jacques Diouf made this appeal in his
inaugural speech at the World Food Day ceremony held on the theme
"Investing in Food Security."
</P>
<P>
"If the goal of food security for all is reached, there must be
significant increase in food production and improved access to
food," Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
However, the director general also noted that much of the
investment in food security in poorer countries would continue to
be private, with three-quarters coming from millions of small
farmers, traders, village artisans, businessmen and others engaged
in the production and distribution of food in the poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
"The remaining one-quarter of investment, some 41 million
dollars each year, will consist of public investments to create
and maintain the conditions for profitable private-sector
activities," he added.
</P>
<P>
If bilateral and multilateral support remain at the same level
as in the past, some 15 billion U.S. dollars will be needed
annually to help the poorest countries meet the requirement of
investment in food security, said the FAO director general.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said Africa is a special area in which the encouragement
of cooperation is urgently needed and where development can set in
motion "the economic and political progress necessary for
eradicating poverty, famine and alienation."

<HEADLINE> Japan Olympic Organizer Criticizes Ski Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan's winter Olympic organizer
criticized the International Ski Federation of using the press to
intimidate Japan in a dispute over the length of the men's
downhill ski course for the 1988 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Asahi Evening News, Makoto Kobayashi,
director general of the Nagano Olympic Committee, said: "I want
people to understand our feeling. FIS is always intimidating us."
</P>
<P>
The International Ski Federation has repeatedly said the
current course falls short of Olympic standards. Japan's
organizing committee has insisted that it cannot be lengthened
without encroaching on protected national park land.
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi said that FIS President Marc Hodler tried last month
to sell a plan for extending the course to the media before even
consulting Japanese organizers.
</P>
<P>
The men's downhill will be one of the marquee events of the
February 7-22 games and the course has been criticized as too easy
for top international competition. The ski federation and the
International Olympic Committee want the start raised to an
elevation of 1,800 meters, from its current 1,680 meters.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Policies on Control Over Nuclear Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- To prevent the widespread
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear
weapons, is an important component of China's independent foreign
policy of peace, a senior Chinese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li Changhe of the Chinese Permanent Mission in
Vienna made the remark at today's meeting of the Zangger
Committee. During the meeting, China was accepted for the first
time as a full member of the organization.
</P>
<P>
"The prevention of nuclear proliferation is a long and arduous
task that calls for the joint efforts of the international
community," Li said, adding, "The Chinese government is ready to
make unremitting efforts with other countries for the common
development of both nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful use of
nuclear energy."
</P>
<P>
However, he emphasized that the prevention of nuclear
proliferation should in no way affect or hinder the normal nuclear
cooperation for peaceful use among various countries, let alone be
used as an excuse for discrimination or an application of willful
sanctions against developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based Zangger Committee, founded in 1971, is the
first international organization formed on control over nuclear
technology.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the committee, which groups 33 nuclear or
nuclear-related export countries, is to strengthen consultation
and cooperation on issues of nuclear non-proliferation and export
control under the principles of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
"China adheres to the policy that it will not advocate,
encourage or engage in the proliferation of nuclear weapons, nor
assist other countries in developing nuclear weapons," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He added that for many years the Chinese government has
exercised strict and effective control over nuclear and
nuclear-related exports, including exchanges of personnel and
information.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the three principles of China's nuclear policy,
which are to serve peaceful purposes only, to accept IAEA
safeguards and to forbid the transfer of technology to any third
country without China's consent.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the meeting on the Circular on Strict
Implementation of China's Nuclear Export Policy and the
Regulations on Nuclear Export Control the Chinese government
promulgated in May and September.
</P>
<P>
Under the circular, no agency or company is allowed to conduct
cooperation or exchange of personnel or technological data with
nuclear facilities not under IAEA safeguards.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear export control regulations established, in the form
of law, the three principles governing China's nuclear export, and
the policy of not providing assistance to nuclear facilities not
under IAEA safeguards.
</P>
<P>
The regulations provide that nuclear exports are monopolized by
units designated by the government and no other agency or
individual is allowed to engage in such exports.
</P>
<P>
Li added that relevant departments of China are stepping up
their efforts to complete the export-control regulations on the
nuclear-related dual use items.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Wins Confidence Vote in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government won a vote
of confidence in the Senate today with 168 in favor and 64
against, including a surprise vote from ex-President Francesco
Cossiga.
</P>
<P>
The former president said his vote did not mean that he has
joined the center-left majority, but he sees Romano Prodi's
center-left coalition government as the clearest political
solution for the moment.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Refoundation Party forced Prodi to resign last
week when it refused to back a cost-cutting budget plan, which
contains 3 billion U.S. dollars in spending cuts, most from
pensions and other social benefits.
</P>
<P>
The government said the cuts are vital for Italy to join the
European Monetary Union.

<HEADLINE> Fires on Rise in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Fires that have been ravaging
Indonesia's forests and brush for months are on the rise again,
despite intense efforts to combat them, the National Institute for
Flight and Aerospace (LAPAN) said today.
</P>
<P>
Satellite images detected at least 55 new fire spots between
late Wednesday and early Thursday, compared with only 21 on
Tuesday, according to a LAPAN report issued here.
</P>
<P>
The new fires were located in the regions of Sumatra,
Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Java.
</P>
<P>
The fires, which have devastated more than 300,000 hectares of
forest and bush and have covered other Southeast Asian nations
with smoky haze, have been declared a national natural disaster by
President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The government has revoked timber-use permits of 29 forest
companies for burning to clear land for plantations and has blamed
the El Nino whether phenomenon as the most instrumental factor
behind the worsening of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
But the Environmental Impact Management Agency has said only
heavy rainfall will help thousands of firefighters in their
struggle to extinguish the widespread fires.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a U.N. body said here that a rapid response is still
required to cope with forest fires in some areas in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Disaster Assessment and Coordination said that even
though the state of emergency appears to be over, the ongoing
peat, coal and surface fires continue to contribute to the
spreading haze.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Forum for Environment (WALHI)
announced that it has despatched 105,250 respiratory masks to
Kalimantan and Sumatra where an estimated 20 million people are
faced with respiratory problems because of the haze.
</P>
<P>
WALHI estimated that at least 1.7 million hectares of forests
have been damaged by the fires, but "the number is also temporary
which can be revised after all fires have been put off."
</P>
<P>
WALHI also estimated the total financial loss due to the fires
and haze at 6.2 trillion rupiah (about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The international community has up to date pledged cash
contributions to Indonesia valued at more than 1.5 million dollars
besides much material and technical assistance, official sources
said.

Kajell Magne Bondevik today announced the composition of a
three-party coalition government, according to news reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has appealed to the world community to join hands to curb food
shortages, improve food quality and provide a secure food supply
for all nations.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, total world food output could meet the
consumption needs of the global population, even exceed them,"
Soeharto noted when speaking at the commemoration of the 17th
World Food Day here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"But there is a disparity in food supply. On one hand, the
advanced industrialized countries have a food surplus. On the
other hand, the poor developing countries face an acute food
shortage, forcing them to import food to feed their people," he
noted. "This disparity should be mended."
</P>
<P>
He said the world community should realize that food supply is
still a major international problem. "Hunger, food shortage and
malnutrition continue to haunt many nations of the world."
</P>
<P>
He called on developed and developing countries to cooperate in
increasing the food resilience defense and reducing food crisis in
what he called the free trade era.
</P>
<P>
Entering the 21st century, he pointed out, food supply will
face various challenges including population growth, urbanization
and the changing pattern of food consumption and the food
technology.
</P>
<P>
Quoting U.N. data, the president said some 800 million of the
world population are suffering food shortage and critical
nutrition problem, of whom some 200 million are children under
five years old.

<HEADLINE> Exports, Remittances to Cut Philippines' Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines expects a lower current account deficit this year with
the positive impact of the peso depreciation on exports and
increased remittances from overseas Filipino workers.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published here today, Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson said the current account situation for the second
half of this year will be better than the first with the
improvement in the trade deficit and an increase in remittances
over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what has been projected for the end of this year,
the deficit should be somewhat smaller than last year's," the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government projected a deficit of 4.1 billion U.S.
dollars for this year, or 4.2 percent of the gross domestic
product. The 1996 deficit was about 3.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account is the portion of the balance of payment
representing merchandise trade, income earned from investments
abroad, money paid to foreign investors and transactions on which
the government expects no returns.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, the trade deficit declined
to 5.6 billion dollars from 6.1 billion registered a year ago
after exports increased by 22 percent and earnings from personal
income of Filipinos overseas workers grew by 17.9 percent to 3.2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the remittances by Filipino overseas workers totaled
4.3 billion dollars. Philippine banks are projecting an increase
in the remittances of up to 20 percent in the second half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Singson also expected higher receipts from the exports sector
in the second semester with the depreciation of the peso, which
has fallen by over 30 percent since July.

He said today that Ukraine received 13.5 million tourists in

mostly in other former Soviet republics. In the past few years,
only about four million foreigners visited Ukraine.

Jalovy said there are 673 travel agencies, one fourth of the
national total, located in the Ukrainian capital. The 21 hotels in
Kiev can accommodate 6,000 tourists a day and seven new hotels are
currently under construction.

The deputy mayor expects a tourism boom in 1998 when the

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Menem Discuss Free Trade Area of Americas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton attended two working meetings today with his Argentine
counterparter Carlos Menem to discuss regional economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state discussed topics on the Free Trade Area
of the Americas (FTAA) and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Wednesday night for an official visit to
Argentina. He advocated the rapid creation of FTAA before the
year 2005, an idea he proposed at the Ibero-American Summit in
December 1994 in Miami, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella said at a press
conference after the two presidential meetings that Clinton told
Menem that Mercosur and FTAA "do not exclude each other."
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, established in December 1994 to promote free trade in
the region, is the biggest trade bloc in South America. It groups
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, and has Chile and Bolivia
as associate members.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Menem discussed the concession by the United States
to Argentina of the Non-NATO ally status, which Clinton has
communicated to the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Di Tella said this status means that Argentina's relations with
the United States are good and many benefits will follow, such as
new confidence and investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, the two presidents also discussed the issue of
the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands. Di Tella said that Argentina has
not asked the United States to mediate in the case, because
Argentina now has good relations with Britain and has made some
progress in recent dialogues.
</P>
<P>
These two meetings were the most important part of Clinton's
Argentine trip. The U.S. president will hold more informal chats
during his trip to the city of Bariloche on October 17-18.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will end his visit to Argentina on Sunday and return to
Washington immediately. His Latin American tour took him to
Venezuela and Brazil.

VIENNA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Chen Lu led skaters
competing for the last berths of women's figure skating at next
year's Nagano Winter Olympics after the short program at an event
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The event, open to all skaters, serves the Olympic qualifying
round and the best six skaters entering for the qualifying
competition would book their tickets to Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Chen skated to third place overall but is the leader for those
seeking to qualify for the Nagano Games.
</P>
<P>
Skating to "Adios Nonino," Chen's marks for required elements
ranged from 4.7 to 5.1, and from 5.0 to 5.7 for presentation.
</P>
<P>
American Tonia Kwaitkowski, who is not entered in the
qualifying competition, led the whole field with a clean, though
not brilliant program to Japanese music.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Zoe Jones was second, landing a triple lutz-double
toe loop combination and a triple flip.
</P>
<P>
In the men's short program, Australian Anthony Liu skated
flawlessly to lead the event.
</P>
<P>
He was followed by American Dan Hollander, also not in the
qualifying event, in the second place. Russian Ruslan Novoselzev
was third.
</P>
<P>
In ice dancing, Belarussians Tatjana Navka and Nikolia Morozov
continue to lead after the original dance, to jive music. Vocal
music, allowed this year for the first time in skating history,
added a new dimension to the event.
</P>
<P>
Russians Ekaterina Davydova and Roman Kostomorov retained their
second position. Chait Galit and Sergy Sukhnovsky of Israel
remained the leading Olympic qualifiers, followed closely by
Britons Marika Humphreys and Philip Askew.
</P>
<P>
The finals for the men, pairs and ice dancing take place on
Friday. The women will skate again on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Emission of Greenhouse Gases on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada's emission of greenhouse
gases has been on the rise instead of going down as it promised
five years ago at the Rio Earth Summit, according to new data made
public today.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Canada signed the international climate-change
convention and pledged to stabilize its emissions of greenhouse
gases at 1990 levels by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the country's emission of carbon dioxide has
actually risen more than 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
For all greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, the
increase is between 12.6 to 13.7 percent, according to data from
Canada's Environmental Department.
</P>
<P>
This shows that Canada's strategy of voluntary reductions by
industry is not working, said Louise Comeau of the Sierra Club of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Emissions can come down if Canada does something about
it... Voluntary programs don't cut it," she told a news conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
But the government doesn't seem to be interested in plans other
than voluntary programs.
</P>
<P>
The government is said to be under heavy pressure from energy
producers not to go too far in Kyoto, Japan, where countries that
signed the Rio treaty will meet in December to negotiate binding
targets beyond 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The targets have to be realistic, realizable," insisted a
spokesman from Canada's Natural Resources Department.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely acknowledged that rising concentrations of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten to warm the global
climate.

Mayor Holmes Torres said that after an eight-hour rainstorm,
the waters of the Gibrantar and Sabaneta rivers damaged houses and

Department authorities said the Colombian government will have
to spend some 3 million U.S. dollars in solving the problem.

NEW YORK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- After a year-long battle with
testicular cancer, former world cycling champion Lance Armstrong
of United States was ready to return to competition with United
States Postal Service Pro Cycling Team.
</P>
<P>
The America's best-known cyclist was diagnosed with testicular
cancer that had already spread to his lungs and brain last
October. Then Armstrong went through extensive chemotherapy and
had two operations.
</P>
<P>
Armstong had a 1.2 million U.S. dollars a year contract with
the French team Cofidis before being stricken with cancer. Cofidis
dropped him earlier this month. The terms of the new contract were
not announced, but it was said that it was for much less money.

The two-time Tour de France winner and two-time Olympian said
his comeback was just a try and he had no design to win any
races. He had been training seriously since October.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong will return to professional cycling at the Redlands

<HEADLINE> US Survey Finds Sharp Drop in Aid to Poor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Aid from the world's richest
nations to the world's poorest has dropped to its lowest level
since such records have been kept, according to a U.S. survey
released today.
</P>
<P>
A report released by InterAction, an association of 158 U.S.
voluntary groups, said that the U.S. is the stingiest in terms of
the proportion of total wealth it donates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which devotes 0.12 percent of its GNP to foreign aid,
was at the bottom of the "generosity league," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Government aid by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), which groups the world's 21 wealthiest
countries, fell by 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, when it
totaled 55.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure, representing 0.25 percent of their combined gross
national product last year, is the lowest since statistics began
in 1950, InterAction said.
</P>
<P>
"Most donors are failing abjectly to live up to the (aid)
targets they have set themselves," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The OECD has a longstanding target for its members to devote
0.7 percent of GNP to ending world poverty. Currently, only
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands are meeting that
goal.
</P>
<P>
Most of the world's richest nations have demonstrated a total
lack of commitment to reach the OECD goal.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.3 billion people worldwide live in absolute poverty,
according to a World Bank estimate, which includes all those who
live on less than one U.S. dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest aid donor is Japan, followed by the United
States, Germany, and France. They account for 60 percent of all
overseas development assistance. All expect their aid to decline
in coming years, said the report.

<HEADLINE> California Researchers Study Gun Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in California of
the United States say three of every four guns seized by police in
crimes committed in the state capital Sacramento are handguns,
predominantly cheaply made ones obtained from Saturday night
specials.
</P>
<P>
The University of California-Davis study released today is
based on 1995 police records.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Sacramento's crime rate was higher than almost every
city of comparable size or larger in California, and worse than
metropolises such as Dallas, Houston or New York City.
</P>
<P>
Most confiscated guns had no ownership records, and two of
every five that did had been stolen, researchers found. And nearly
half of those arrested with illegally guns were aged between 12
and 24.
</P>
<P>
The study was the first of its kind since it was based on
police statistics.

final resolution allowing the setting up of a parliamentary
advisory assembly to strengthen cooperation between the
legislatures in the region.

The resolution also underlines the European orientation of the
states of the region and contains a decision to formally establish
dialogue between the national assemblies by organizing meetings of
the presidents of the region's parliaments on a regular and
rotating basis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the final session today, Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis underscored the importance of the parliaments of the
region in "escaping from the past" and in promoting and
consolidating democracy in the countries of southeastern Europe,
considering a necessity dialogue in the framework of the
parliaments for the forging of new policies, contacts among them,
and the expansion of their relations with the Europarliament in
order to make clear Europe's responsibility for its region.
</P>
<P>
The first-ever meeting of its kind was attended by the

NEW YORK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average slid more than 100 points today among mounting fears that
profit growth would be too strong and ignite spending.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell 119.10, or nearly 1.5 percent, to 7,938.88, after
recovering from a 161-point plunge.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 595.98 million

Broader stock measures also turned sharply lower despite a
strong bond market, where interest rates fell.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 10.47 to 955.25 after
recovering partially from a 15-point drop, and the NYSE composite

<HEADLINE> US "Disappointed" at Mandela's Plan to Visit Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States expressed
"disappointment" today at South African President Nelson Mandela
for his plan to visit Libya on his way to attend a Commonwealth
summit.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that diplomatic contacts (with Libya) ought to be
maintained at a low level, and we would be disappointed with a
visit of any head of state," State Department spokesman James
Foley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The South African embassy in Rabat, Morocco, announced Tuesday
that President Mandela will go to Libya and Egypt on his way to
the Commonwealth summit to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland, on
October 24-27 and visit Morocco on October 27 on his way back
home.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Mandela's visit to Libya was in response to
a long-standing invitation from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
"Libya is a country which was very supportive of the South
African liberation movements during the struggle against apartheid
and is one of the countries that the president has not visited
since his inauguration," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
But the United States regarded the visit as a "violation" of
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We would reiterate the fact that, according to U.N. Security
Council Resolutions 748 and 883, flights into Tripoli are a
violation of sanctions. So I think that would be a very specific
concern," Foley said.

<HEADLINE> US FMC to Bar Japanese Ships from US Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Maritime
Commission (FMC) is ready today to order the bar of Japanese cargo
ships from entering U.S. ports, but delayed enforcement for a day
hoping that last-minute talks could resolve the trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
The FMC, an independent government agency, ordered the action
after the Japanese shipping companies have expressed their firm
stand that they do not plan to pay an estimated 4 million U.S.
dollars in fines levied by the United States.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese official said earlier this week in Tokyo that the
United States would find itself in the "shameful" position of
taking money from innocent parties if Japanese shippers were
forced to pay penalty surcharged in a bilateral ports disputes.
</P>
<P>
The fines were imposed after negotiators between the two
countries failed to find a solution on American demands for freer
access to Japanese ports. The U.S. side has set October 15 as the
deadline for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States and
Japan were in negotiations over the matter and that the White
House had sought a delay in the commission's actions while the
talks were going on.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, which amount to 100,000 dollars per vessel, were
levied on Japanese cargo ships entering U.S. ports beginning
September 4. However, the three major Japanese shipping companies
involved had until Wednesday to actually pay the fines.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, the first imposed on Japan in a decade, came
during a shipping dispute that has simmered for years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other foreign shipping lines complained that Japan
requires all shippers to receive prior approval for even the most
minor operational changes in handling cargo at Japanese ports.
Negotiations to loosen the restrictions have failed to produce
changes acceptable to the U.S. side.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Urges Ban on Genetically Altered Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace urged European
environment ministers meeting in Luxembourg today to protect the
right of European nations to refuse genetically engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
The European Council of Ministers will discuss the
controversial genetically engineered Novartis maize, which Austria
and Luxembourg have tried to ban on health and environmental
grounds. Under pressure from the United States, the European
Commission is trying to overrule their national import bans.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting in Luxembourg, Greenpeace activists
displayed a cartoon showing the Statue of Liberty with European
Commission President Jacques Santer's face.
</P>
<P>
At the same time in Paris, activists hung a banner at the
French Statue of Liberty on the Seine, with the words "Protect
Europe's right to ban genetech maize." A chef's hat was also put
on the statue.
</P>
<P>
"US trade interests are forcing Novartis' genetically
engineered (GE) maize into Europe," said Susan Leubuscher of
Greenpeace's European Unit, "and the European Commission is
abusing its power by sacrificing European countries' democratic
rights, endangering the environment and putting at risk consumers
health protection."
</P>
<P>
Leubuscher asked the member states of the European Union to
insist that the Commission withdraw its proposal to deny Austria
and Luxembourg their right to ban the import of the GE maize.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace is also calling on France as the country which
originally authorized the maize to withdraw that authorization.
Even France itself has refused to add the GE maize on its national
plant variety list, thereby preventing the large-scale growing of
this GE maize by its farmers.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Falls Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar slid sharply
against the Japanese yen in more than five weeks on fears of a
trade war after the United States moved today to ban Japanese
ships from using its ports.
</P>
<P>
Also weighing down the dollar was speculation that the Japanese
government may soon unveil a new plan to boost the nation's
sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 119.65 yen, down from 121.16 Wednesday.
The drop of more than 1.5 yen was the biggest daily decline for
the dollar since September 9, when it fell more than 2.3 yen.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also fell to 1.7435 German marks from late
Wednesday's 1.7475. But the dollar rose against the British pound,
which slipped to 1.6179 U.S. dollars from 1.6239 U.S. dollars
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Also pressuring the dollar today was a U.S. government report
of consumer prices showing tame inflation. That reduced hopes that
the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates to slow the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4550 Swiss francs, down from 1.4585; 5.8503 French
francs, down from 5.8575; 1,703 Italian lire, down from 1,707; and
1.3860 Canadian dollars, unchanged from Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Americans Spend 33 Bln Dlrs Annually on Weight-Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Americans spend 33 billion
dollars a year on weight-loss programs as every one out of three
has weight problems in the nation, but often they are not able to
evaluate them or know whether they are dangerous, participants in
a government conference were told today.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission and several private and government
health organizations sponsored the two-day conference on problems
arising from the increases in obesity and weight-control programs.
</P>
<P>
About 33 percent of the U.S. population was overweight today,
increased from 25 percent in the 1960s, Dean Graybill of the
commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection told the conference.
</P>
<P>
"Today, there are over 48 million Americans who are on some
sort of diet," Graybill said. "Obesity is a paramount public
policy and health concern."
</P>
<P>
Obesity contributes to over 300,000 excess deaths each year.
Next to smoking, obesity is the second-leading cause of
preventable death in the United States, according to President
George Blackburn of the American Society of Clinical Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
But some participants noted that there was lack of law
enforcement on the weight-loss programs that may raise risks.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are left to guess about the cost, safety and
efficacy" of weight-loss regimes, said Leslie Byrne, director of
the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Many at the conference called for greater consumer education to
reduce the risks of ineffective or fraudulent diet products and
programs.
</P>
<P>
Some participants charged the government response is inadequate
and criticized the government for exacerbating the problem by
letting dietary supplements be sold without sufficient testing.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Investors Urged to Be More Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister
Musalia Mudavadi today called on Kenyan investors to take
appropriate steps to enhance their competitive edge against
foreign investors for survival and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of Kenya Breweries Ltd. (KBL) new
bottling line here today, he noted that with the gradual
liberalization of Kenya's economy, the level of protection had
now reduced substantially in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged all industries in Kenya to improve their
efficiency and quality of their goods and services if they want
to survive and prosper in the liberalized economy.
</P>
<P>
In order to create a market friendly environment, Mudavadi
said, his government has implemented prudent macro-economic
policies, reduced government borrowing, improved efficiency in
the financial markets and the condition of basic infrastructure
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that the Kenyan government was
committed to the expansion of the overall investment from the
present level of 20 percent of GDP to at least 23 percent in
order to generate and sustain higher economic growth rates.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi paid a high tribute to KBL as it has made efforts to
improve its efficiency and product quality by installing a modern
production line and achieving the international quality standard
ISO 9002.
</P>
<P>
The new bottling line which is said to be the fastest and most
modern bottling line on the African continent has a bottling
capacity of 80,000 bottles per hour.
</P>
<P>
The KBL is the second biggest brewing group in Africa with a
total brewing capacity of more than 4.5 million litres of beer
every year at its three breweries in Kenya.

BONN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
today made clear that if being re-elected in next year's general
elections, he would stay in office until 2002, denying rumors that
he is considering an early handover.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Germany ZDF television network, Kohl
said his candidacy for office in the 1998 elections was for the
full four-year term. "No chancellor would stand for part of it.
That would be the very last thing that I would do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl unleashed speculations about an early handover by a
surprise announcement on Wednesday that he wanted his key aide
Wolfgang Schaeuble to succeed him in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I would like Wolfgang Schaeuble to be chancellor some day," he
said at the end of a three-day congress of his Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) party in the eastern German city of
Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, 67, has been German chancellor for uninterrupted 15
years. He already ranks as Europe's longest-serving political
leader and the most durable German chancellor of this century.
</P>
<P>
By announcing his intention to seek another term of office in
April this year, Kohl said he felt obliged to guide Germany into
the new century in a united Europe.

<P>
HARARE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Society should be more involved
in improving the lives of street children as it is their right to
be protected, Zimbabwe's first lady Grace Mugabe said here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a one-day workshop on rehabilitating street children,
Mrs. Mugabe said, "I believe that convincing society to view the
plight of street children as their own problem is an uphill
battle," adding that the struggle should not be given up.
</P>
<P>
The first lady said there was a need to observe the rights of
children in conformity with international conventions such as
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
"We, therefore, have the obligation to ensure that our
children's rights to survive and develop to their fullest
potential are upheld," she said.
</P>
<P>
Harare Mayor Solomon Tawengwa said at the workshop that
children were living in the streets through no fault of theirs,
and called on society to respect these children as human beings.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics indicate that Harare alone has more than
1,000 street children, half of whom live in the central business
district. About 3,000 children live in and sleep on the streets
countrywide and another 12,000 to 15,000 come daily to the
streets to look for sustenance in this country which has about
one million orphans.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which was attended by top government officials,
representatives from urban local authorities and the private
sector, discussed the abuse of street children and the measures
that could be taken to stop it.

LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Chief Inspector of
Prisons David Ramsbotham has launched an outspoken attack on
jails, warning that conditions in some jails are as bad as a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
Ramsbotham, Britain's most senior inspector of prisons, said
Wednesday that conditions in some jails were what he would expect
in jails in the last century and that standards were dropping

His comment followed a report published Wednesday on his visit
in March to Lincoln adult prison which he said was in a "dreadful
state", with ripped and stained mattresses, and encrusted food on
the walls and ceilings.

He said that prison managers "must feel extremely concerned
about the future, in many other prisons, as numbers continue to

HARARE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's sugar processor, ZSR
Corporation today said sales of refined sugar on the domestic
market were buoyant, increasing by 12.6 percent over six months.
</P>
<P>
The company sold 111,593 tonnes of sugar during the six months
ended September 30, 1997, compared to the same period last year
when it sold 99,125 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the company Aldo Musemburi said a significant

sales were boosted by a longer trading period which included one
additional week.
</P>
<P>
"Exports of refined sugar to neighbouring countries remained
at previous levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
Refined sugar exports were pegged at 15,256 tonnes during the

LUANDA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A bank account named "Fao
Telealimento" was opened today at Angola's commercial and
industrial banks in Luanda to collect fund for farmers to brace
them up for natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The act is a measure taken to answer the call by the United

summit on food held in Rome in 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony to mark the opening of the bank account, the

Angolan Commercial and Industrial Bank made a deposit of 300
million Readjusted Kwanza (about 1,111 US dollars) in the

Pierre Gence, FAO representative in Angola, urged to give much
publicity to the account while calling for the utmost
transparency to the management and application of the money in
the account.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Set to Improve Service Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will improve its wide
range of professional services to promote the island as a regional
center for business activities.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by President Glafcos Clerides at the
opening ceremony of the country's third services exhibition
"CyServ '97" here today.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the service sector has become the most
significant part of Cyprus' economy and contributed to about 71
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) last year.
</P>
<P>
This fact "underlines our responsibilities to preserve our
competitiveness with the continuous improvement of the level and
kind of services offered," he said, adding that Cyprus has highly
skilled manpower is instrumental to the high quality of its
services.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou promised continued
support to the service sector, which he said has serious
potentials to further develop especially in non-traditional fields.
</P>
<P>
These fields include consultancy, training, management, medical
and educational services, production of advertisement films and
market services, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Swazi Unions Threaten With Border Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Swaziland Federation
of Trade Unions (SFTU) mounted fresh pressure on the government
by threatening to carry out two-day border blockades every month
after its call for a national strike collapsed.
</P>
<P>
It also said it would call for another nationwide strike,
South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
SFTU Secretary-General Jan Sithole made an announcement after
a SFTU council meeting in Manzini on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Sithole said the two-day blockades at border posts would be
followed by a national strike. However, he did not say when the
blockades or the strike would begin.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU is supported mainly by sugar industry and plantation
workers. Sugar is the main foreign exchange generator of the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Sithole also said the federation would again call on the
Swaziland Progressive Party, the Congress of South African Trade
Unions and the South African communist Party for support.
</P>
<P>
The latest national strike, which began Monday, aborted when
workers of the country's three major sugar companies returned to
work Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The workers reportedly resented SFTU leaders' concentrating on
politics at the expense of labor issues.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU is pressing for the introduction of political
reforms, including the lift of the ban on political parties.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Order Seven New Trident Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
announced that Britain would spend almost 100 million pounds
(about 160 million U.S. dollars) on seven new missiles for its
Trident nuclear submarines in an effort to reinforce its nuclear
deterrent force.
</P>
<P>
John Gilbert, Britain's minister for defense procurement, said
in a written statement to the House of Lords: "This will bring the
number of Trident missiles purchased or ordered by the UK to 58."
</P>
<P>
Explaining the new arms purchase, Gilbert said: "For the
present, however, we are committed to the maintenance of a minimum
level of deterrence, and this missile order is consistent with
that aim."
</P>
<P>
"Our future missile and warhead requirements remain under
consideration in the forthcoming strategic defense review," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Defense Secretary George Robertson flatly
denied the new missile order was an expansion of the country's
Trident nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
"This is not something that is new or different, it was known
about, and they are of course budgeted for," Robertson said in a
HBC Radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Robertson stressed that the new missiles were the last part of
the Trident program and the parts ordered were missile bodies and
not nuclear warheads.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Leaders Calls for Clarity on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- British business leaders have
called on the British government to clarify its position on the
European Monetary Union (EMU) following a spate of reports
suggesting Britain was poised to join the single currency shortly
after its launch.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Labor government remained undecided over its
first-wave membership of the single currency due to be launched on
January 1 1999, provoking various speculations over London's EMU
stance.
</P>
<P>
Adair Turner, the director-general of the Confederation of
British Industry, is quoted by the Times newspaper as saying that
the current muddle showed that the Government needed to have
clearer position.
</P>
<P>
Turner noted that he doubted whether any existing international
investors would close their factories in Britain simply because
London refused to sign up.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed if it became obvious that Britain was not
joining the single European currency named euro in the long term,
it could put off future investment.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not about existing investment, it is whether over
time incremental new investment into existing facilities or new
facilities would be somewhat higher or lower if we were out of
EMU," he said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-EMU European Movement said that statements from a
number of major companies showed that thousands of jobs would be
at risk if Britain stayed out.
</P>
<P>
"Any government will have to think carefully about the costs of
exclusion (from the single currency)," it said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> GM Works Council Fears Huge Job Losses in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- General Motors' European works
council today said that the U.S. carmaker could eliminate up to 14
percent of its employment in Europe if an efficiency study of
company was carried out.
</P>
<P>
The works council said after a meeting in Ruesselsheim, Germany
that it feared that about 12,000 jobs might be cut in the coming
years at GM's factories in Germany, Britain, Belgium, Spain,
Portugal and Austria. In Germany alone, job losses could total
6,000 to 8,000.
</P>
<P>
At the GM plant in Antwerp of Belgium, the management already
announced today that 1,900 of the 7,800 jobs there would be cut
over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the management of the GM European operations to stop
the so-called Template study, the council's chairman, Rudolf
Mueller, said the study was aimed exclusively at cutting jobs and
did not take into account the higher quality advantage of the GM
factories in Europe.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Official Optimistic of Eliminating Extreme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) Administrator James Gustave Speth has said that
"extreme poverty can be eliminated in a generation, with enough
will, wisdom and work."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a message to mark October 17,
International Day for Eradication of Poverty, which was
designated by the U.N. General Assembly to focus global attention
on the scourge of poverty and social deprivation.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated by UNDP that 1.3 billion people live in
extreme poverty and lack basic health, sanitation and education
services, surviving on less than one US dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
"The world has already made great strides in relieving the
worst aspects of poverty," Speth said, adding that much progress
has been achieved in this regard in the last five decades than in
the last five centuries.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that "Women and children are still
disproportionately affected by poverty. Not only do they earn
less incomes than men, but their opportunities to increase
earnings are more limited because of their reproductive and
household responsibilities, and because they have little access
to land, credit, and jobs that can help them and their children
overcome poverty."
</P>
<P>
"Many of the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa
and south Asia have gained much less than other developing
countries as a whole. Violent conflicts, the spread of HIV and
AIDS and environmental degradation have pushed millions back into
poverty in the past 15 years," Speth pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We have no ethical alternative but to take on this challenge
with all the seriousness it deserves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is not inevitable," he said, stressing that the rise
in poverty in recent years can be reversed if all governments
take more seriously the commitments they have already made to
reduce poverty at home and in the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> Russian Opposition Offers Way Out of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian main opposition,
including the Russian Communist Party, the Agrarians and the
People's Power faction, on Thursday approved a letter to President
Boris Yeltsin, showing a way out of the government "crisis", the
Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, the letter
stressed that "it would be important to change an attitude to the
law on the government for a final decision to be taken on a
no-confidence vote in the government."
</P>
<P>
The authors of the letter believed, the report said, it would
be inadmissible to raise rent prices as well as prices for public
utilities, and asked for guarantees that they would not be raised
in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The letter also stressed the need to reform the television and
Radio channels for covering parliamentary issues. At the same
time, observation councils should be set up on television with
participation of the opposition, Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
The letter urged to implement the idea of a round table
conference of leading political parties and organizations where
land issues, combating crime and corruption, as well as prices for
energy carriers could be discussed, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The Communist faction leader expressed determination that they
would not withdraw their proposals on a no-confidence vote in the
government, but would like to hear the answers to these questions
before Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
Russian Federation Ivan Melnikov told reporters today that their
final decision would depend on the outcome of a meeting comprising
the president, the prime minister and the speakers from both
houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
It will also depend on "a round table" conference of Russia's
political parties and organizations as well as on a decision of
the Communists' Central Committee a plenary meeting on Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Paul Hare, special envoy for
U.S. President Bill Clinton said here today that his government
believes Angolan Peace Process will be a success despite the
great difficulty it confronts.
</P>
<P>
Hare, who is currently in Angola for a four-day visit, made
the statement while summarizing his visit at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the U.S. government was sure that problems
facing the peace process will be settled with satisfactory
results.
</P>
<P>
The major problems confronting the peace process are
"psychological", mainly due to the lack of mutual trust between
the warring sides, namely the Angolan government and former rebel
movement the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
He cited the re-establishment of national authority in
UNITA-occupied areas and the total demobilization of UNITA forces
as two biggest problems during the implementation of the Lusaka
Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Hare also expressed his worries over the fact that UNITA has
not turned the radio it controlled into a commercial one.
</P>
<P>
Hare admitted that the peace process has made major progress
concerning some key issues. He urged both sides to be committed
to their obligations contained in Lusaka Peace Accord to truly
put an end to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy arrived here on October 13 to get to know
the latest developments in Angolan Peace Process.

BRUSSELS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization put up a photo exhibition to commemorate NATO
headquarters' 30 years in Brussels today.
</P>
<P>
On October 16 of 1967, the international staff and the then 15
national delegations to the North Atlantic Council, executive body
of NATO, moved to their new headquarters in the Belgian capital.
</P>
<P>
The decision to move away from France was taken by the council
in its Paris meeting in December 1966 and construction of the new
headquarters over the former runways of the old Brussels airport
started in March 1967 and completed in 29 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after France decided to withdraw from
NATO's military structure.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Belgium becoming the host nation to NATO had been
at the forefront of parliamentary debates in Belgium. The debates
concluded with a motion of support.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said: "Over the course of
the last 30 years which have seen the concentration of many
international organizations in Brussels, the Belgian authorities
have taken great pride in acting as the host nation to the
Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
"This pride is shared by a great number of Belgian citizens
who, in one way or another, have been associated with the task of
welcoming the thousands of people who have come to live in Belgium
as NATO staff, civilian or military."

<HEADLINE> Qin: Resources Availability Essential to Promote Social </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- To strengthen
international cooperation and make resources available were
essential to promote the social development, Qin Huasun, Chinese
Permanent Representative to the United Nations, stressed here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fifty-second session of the General Assembly on
the implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for Social
Development, Qin Huasun said since the 1995 Copenhagen World
Summit for Social Development, the question of social development
had drawn increasing attention from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the short, mid and long-term strategies and plans for
social development formulated by many countries and concrete
measures taken in this regard have brought about positive
progress in the implementation of the outcome of the summit at
the national level.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly,
Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Social
Development for the implementation of the outcome had also played
a positive role in promoting social development.
</P>
<P>
Qin pointed out action had been rather slow in developing
substantive international cooperation promised at the summit and
concern on this question was therefore not ill founded.
</P>
<P>
Qin said poverty was the major obstacle to social development
as well as a serious threat to peace and stability. To eradicate
poverty was an imperious mission of the international
community. It was made the first of the three core issues at the
summit. But no major improvement has been made in the social
situation of the world more than two years after the Summit.
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed developed countries should fulfill their
obligations to contribute at an early date 0.7% of the GNP to
official development aid and take more concrete measures for
developing countries in economic assistance, technological
cooperation and debt reduction and remission.
</P>
<P>
He added the United States should focus its efforts for
social development on developing countries and play a central
coordinating role in promoting the follow-up to the Summit.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Carriers Vie for Asian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The two major carriers in Canada
are vying for the lucrative routes to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada is reported to be lobbying the government for
permission to fly more often to Hong Kong and other Asian
destinations.
</P>
<P>
Its rival Canadian Airlines International has said it will
oppose any federal government move to increase Air Canada's access
to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the matter, Canadian president and Chief executive
Kevin Benson said the Calgary-based carrier is opposed to any
out-of-hand changes.
</P>
<P>
The current policy under which the government allocates routes
is working well enough, he was quoted as saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada thinks otherwise. It has been pushing for reforms to
the policy so as to obtain permission to increase its flights to
Asia.
</P>
<P>
And its president and chief executive Lamar Durret has met with
Transport Minister David Collenette to make that pitch.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal-based carrier says Canada's airlines are losing
business to Asian competitors.
</P>
<P>
To increase its competitiveness, the carrier said it is
acquiring planes in 2002 that can fly non-stop from Toronto to
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Canadian Airlines has made Vancouver its
operating hub so it can capitalize on the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Canadian government has made no commitments on new
routes other than to say that it is monitoring things.

<P>
ECOMOG jets attacked telecommunications installations Wednesday,
disrupting communications in the city.
</P>
<P>
To retaliate Wednesday's ECOMOG air raid, youths who back the junta
went out this morning attacking houses belonging to supporters of
ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Last week, junta's spokesman Aliu Kamara said if there were any
more bombing and attacks, the supporters of the ousted government will
be targeted.
</P>
<P>
The actions have brought fears into the houses of those who call
themselves as supporters of Kabbah, or indeed the supporters of
democracy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, another new dimension is that the junta is
taking up soldiers who are displaying their reluctance to fight.
</P>
<P>
Military trucks have been touring around the city today arresting
soldiers who have gone AWOL.
</P>
<P>
There seems to quite a large number of soldiers who are refusing to
be used as cannon fodder to get into fight with ECOMOG whose troops
are much better equipped.
</P>
<P>
This has led to the latest speculation in Freetown that the junta
is doing all it can to get as many as soldiers together to mount a new
attack on the ECOMOG bases at Lungi and Jui outside the capital
tonight, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The fresh exchanges of fire followed a United Nations Security
Council sanctions on Sierra Leone announced last Wednesday aimed at
reinstating the legitimate government led by President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah which was ousted in the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
The UN decision is seen as a strong support to west African
countries' economic sanctions and embargo on Sierra Leone, which is
being enforced by ECOMOG.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Stages Joint War Games with Six Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said today advanced weapons
and management are making a difference in its ongoing military
exercises jointly held with six other nations on its northern
coast and in the western desert.
</P>
<P>
"Bright Star 97," the largest war games ever staged in the
Middle East, will be participated by Britain, the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), the United States, France, Kuwait and Italy as
well as Egypt, said Coordinator of the Egyptian forces in the
exercises Ahmed Gamal said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The initial period of the three-phased maneuvers was for
preparations and light training, which was commenced a week ago,
Gamal said.
</P>
<P>
Forces of Egypt, Britain and the UAE, backed by armored
vehicles, landed from air and sea to establish a beachhead and
prevent "enemy" troops from occupying the area of El-Alamein -
scene of a famous World War II battle, according to Gamal.
</P>
<P>
From October 24-31, the exercises will enter the second phase
to mobilize the vast majority of the participating forces and
bring the exercise to its peak intensity.
</P>
<P>
Two troops, formed as friendly "green" forces and enemy
"orange" forces, will fight a fierce war along Egypt's western
border and the northern coast. Ground, air and naval forces of
both sides will attack and counterattack each other in the areas.
</P>
<P>
The final phase on November 1-2 is a training program for
Egyptian and U.S. military commanders.
</P>
<P>
Gamal said that a salient objective of the exercises is to
improve the capability of planning, management and decision-making
of Egyptian military commanders, as they will be allowed a free
hand in running the combat operations.
</P>
<P>
The exercises are also designed to train the participating
forces their efficiency in carrying out reconnaissance operations,
mounting rapid defense, confronting attacking forces, landing from
sea and air and staging combat actions.
</P>
<P>
The war games will feature sophisticated and hi-tech military
hardware including Apache helicopters and George Washington
transport aircraft, and U.S.-made Taba and Mubarak destroyers
which joined of the Egyptian navy months ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
Electronic warfare methods will be fully employed, such as
early warning, eavesdropping and jamming while the air force will
gain experience in aerial photography, raiding, aerial combat and
interception, providing support to ground forces, dropping
paratroopers and mid-air refueling, and search and rescue.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers are believed to act as a "duel military-political
deterrent" - flexing military muscle and signal possible
international alliance Egypt can draw on in case of an invasion.
</P>
<P>
The exercises, introduced in 1983, is held once every two
years by Egyptian and the U.S. troops. Some other countries began
to join in from 1993.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa to Better Cooperate in Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Leading tourism officials from
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda today reached a memorandum of mutual
understanding to promote their cooperation on wildlife protection
and eco-tourism.
</P>
<P>
The three eastern African countries should market the region
as one destination for tourists and cooperate with each other
more on personnel training and wildlife security, they agreed at
the end of the East African Wildlife Cooperation meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested the joint construction of a tourism
communication network and a surveillance unit, especially on
rhino monitoring.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to establish a common mechanism to coordinate
their efforts to improve the management of the cross-border
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
The benefits expected from the collaboration among the three
countries also include smooth cross-border movement of tourists
and security of animals during inter-country migrations.
</P>
<P>
"East Africa has a unique concentration of wildlife species
not found anywhere else in the world, if properly utilized, can
make the region highly developed," said Executive Secretary of
the East Africa Cooperation (EAC) Francis Muthaurwa at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Wildlife have no borders," he said, urging the three EAC
member states to cooperate more in the areas such as health
management of animals, infrastructural development and animals
security.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one delegates, including Executive Director of Uganda
Wildlife Authority Yakobo Moyini, Chief Preventive Officer in
Tanzanian Tourism Ministry Musa Lyimo, and Director of Kenya
Wildlife Service David Western, attended the two-day workshop.

<HEADLINE> UK Tory Warns of Future Trade Conflict with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) - Tory legal affairs spokesman
Euro-MP Bryan Cassidy urged: Europe and the USA must continue
talks if Europe wants to prevent conflict.
</P>
<P>
Cassidy, also Vice-President of Parliament's US delegation and
a strident critic of the provocative Helms-Burton, made the
remarks when he returns from the USA today.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, he commented: "EU-US relations are crucial to
global economic and political stability. US politicians are
playing with fire when they support laws like Helms-Burton that
punish foreign citizens and companies for normal overseas
trading."
</P>
<P>
Attacking the stubborn attitude of the US Congress, Cassidy
waarned: " The EU must not be lulled into a false sense of
progress as talks go on. The US mood is toughening as States like
Massachusetts complicate the issue with further extra-territorial
laws."
</P>
<P>
"The signal from Brussels must be clear: talks can continue but
only until the end of December. When EU foreign ministers meet
next week, they must send a strong signal," he added.
</P>
<P>
With a study by the European-American Business Council entitled
"Is The Price Too High? The Cost Of US Sanction Policy"
highlighting fears of many US businessmen, Cassidy pointed out:
"The irony is that this excessive US pressure is not only
distorting international trade, but hurting US firms."
</P>
<P>
"American companies complain that EU firms are now reluctant
either to enter into joint ventures, or to invest in US business,
for fear of sanction," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Euro-MPs will meet in Strasbourge next
week to debate main EU policy priorities for 1998. Given the lack
of agreement over Helms-Burton, Cassidy noted: "EU Commissioners
can expect tough questions if tackling this crisis is not a top
priority."

<HEADLINE> Four Chinese Win Prize for Women's Creativity in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Four Chinese are among 33
laureates selected this year for the annual prize for women's
creativity in rural life awarded here on Wednesday by the Women's
World Summit Foundation (WWSF).
</P>
<P>
The four Chinese laureates are Aloniuniu from Sichuan Province,
Fang Xiulan from Gansu Province, Luo Xifen from Guizhou Province,
and Miao Changlian from Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Aloniuniu, of China's Yi Minority, has succeeded in covering
155 hectares of barren hills with various kinds of bushes and
trees since 1982. She shares almost whatever she has with other
villagers. With money earned by growing trees, she helped nine
families living in poverty to pay their agricultural taxes.
</P>
<P>
Fang started a chicken farm in 1986. With the number of
chickens increasing from 1500 to 10,000, she expanded her farm to
include ducks and pigs. By 1996, her assets amounted to one
million yuan (120,000 US dollars). To help her neighbors including
the handicapped get out of poverty, she initiated an Ecological
Breeding Cooperative. Now, The town in which she lives is known
for its chickens, with each household raising more than 130
chickens on average.
</P>
<P>
Luo is of China's Buyi Minority in Guizhou Province. She opened
a pepper sauce processing factory in 1993. Hundreds of her
neighbors began to sell their peppers to her factory to earn cash.
In 1996, each family earned at least 650 yuan (78 US dollars) from
selling peppers alone to her. With 30,000 yuan (3,600 US dollars),
she set up a scholarship program for children in poor families in
her county.
</P>
<P>
Miao is the Director of the Women's Federation of Enrong
Village, Jiangxi Province. She is not only a good organizor, but
also a good rice grower. In 1996, Miao harvested two tons of
hybrid rice seeds on her 0.6 acre of land and sold them for an
income of 20,000 yuan (2400 US dollars). She always helps others
and offers loans to villagers to improve their living standard and
help them towards self-sufficiency. In 1992, supported by a loan
from Miao, a small processing factory was set up to teach women in
the village practical skills.
</P>
<P>
The WWSF is one of the three international Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) which proposed at the 4th United Nations
World Conference on Women in Beijing that a specific day each year
be designated to highlight the largely unrecognized contribution
of rural women, mainly farmers, the world over, to food security
and to the development of rural areas. The WWSF has suggested that
World Women's Day fall on October 15th.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Foreign Aid Is Dropping, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada has lost its high rank
among the world's most generous development aid donors, according
to an annual watchdog report released today.
</P>
<P>
Measured as a percentage of gross national product (GNP),
Canada's aid budget plunges "far below average" among the world's
top 21 aid donor countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Canada spent on development aid 2.6 billion dollars
(1.8 billion USD), which was 0.31 percent of its GNP. It fell to
11th place from 5th place among the donor countries.
</P>
<P>
"Canada, long seen as a leader in development aid, now has a
tarnished image," said the Canadian Council for International
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The aid program has borne a greater share of the burden of
deficit reduction than other federal programs," it said.
</P>
<P>
The council is among the 32 groups from around the world that
compile the annual watchdog report called The Reality of Aid.
</P>
<P>
The report found aid spending among the 21 donor countries of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development fell by
4.2 percent last year to 55 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
That's one quarter of one percent of the total GNP of those
countries, the lowest since statistics began being collected since
1950.
</P>
<P>
The report urges the governments to keep their promises of
making the eradication of global poverty a priority and of
reaching a target of spending 0.7 percent of GNP on aid.

<HEADLINE> Study: U.S. to Spend More on Military Electronics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military is
spending more on electronics procurement through 2007, from the
current 18.5 billion U.S. dollars to 23.8 billion dollars,
although the overall defense spending is expected to continue
declining, the Defense News said in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
Citing the 10-Year Defense and NASA Electronics Forecast
released last week, the weekly said overall spending on military
electronic components is expected to rise from 51.5 billion
dollars to 58.9 billion dollars in 2007.
</P>
<P>
A large chunk of the increased spending during the next decade
can be traced to the Pentagon's quest to win information
superiority. "The military wants U.S. forces to be virtually
unchallenged in collecting and distributing information while
denying an enemy the same capabilities," the Defense News said.
</P>
<P>
Joint service and international aircraft programs will
flourish, Cecil Black, Boeing's manager of business analysis for
government affairs, said.
</P>
<P>
Factors driving up the procurement of aircraft electronic
systems include the growing reliance on precision-strike
capabilities, surveillance and intelligence gathering, and command
and control for existing and planned aircraft, he said.
</P>
<P>
Electronics procurement for military aircraft, including
unmanned aerial vehicles, will grow from 5.7 billion dollars in
1998 to 7.7 billion dollars, or 44 percent of the aircraft
procurement budget of 17.5 billion dollars predicted in 2007, the
forecast said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army will devote
about one-third of its research, development and acquisition
budget, or 28 billion U.S. dollars, to digitization in the next
five years to place the service on the path to a future digitized
battlefield, the Defense News said in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
Digitization is a method of using information technologies to
process massive amounts of information nearly simultaneously and
is expected to give the Army a decisive battlefield advantage in
the information age.
</P>
<P>
It includes tactical radios, sensors, satellite communication,
computers, navigation systems, and missile and munition guidance
systems, among many other things.
</P>
<P>
The service has been experimenting in a series of field
maneuvers, simulation exercises and reformed acquisition processes
to see what effect advanced information technologies have on the
battlefield, the weekly said.

SANAA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni security forces today
succeeded in obtaining the release by tribesman of four French
tourists kidnapped on Wednesday, according to the Yemeni News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a source from the Interior Ministry as
saying that the tourists, three women and a man, have returned
safely to the town of Saada, 270 kilometers north of the capital
Sanaa.
</P>

</P>
<P>
He said the acts of sabotage have harmed the nation and its
reputation. Kidnapping has become a common ploy used by tribes to
demand for money and financing.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 foreigners had been abducted in the country, one
of the poorest in the Arab world, but they were later freed
unharmed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Agricultural Minister
Carlos Fernandes said here today that the government will offer
more help to farmers to help increase grain production.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Fernandes, addressing on the World Food Day, said that
Angola, a country with 60 to 70 percent of its population living
in the countryside, views it very important to increase grain
production.
</P>
<P>
Only when enough grain is produced, can every people enjoy the
adequate food producing a minimum of 2600 calorie a day, he said,
at present one Angolan can only takae 1740 calorie a day.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes said that a matter of first importance is to change
the country's over-dependance on on import and emergency food aid
into a self-sufficient grain producer.
</P>
<P>
He said that to accomplish the target, the government should
play its role to guarantee that there is stock and ample supply
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The government will soon unroll plans for promoting trade,
agriculture, animal husbandry and small-scale enterprises to help
increase grain production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fernades said that the money-rigid government also
found it hard to meet the national need for meat supply, saying
that the country has to spend 40 million U.S. Dollars on
importing meat.

<HEADLINE> Development Financing Bears on Developing Countries' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- At a time when economic
globalization was accelerating, financing of development was an
issue of prime importance, Yu Qingtai, Chinese delegate to the
Second Committee, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Development financing directly bore on whether the developing
countries could seize opportunities and achieve economic
development in the years beyond the century so as to contribute to
regional and global economic development, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Second Committee at the 52nd session of the
General Assembly on financing of development and the debt problem,
Yu said that to many developing countries, the least developed in
particular, official development assistance remained an important
source of external funding, playing an irreplaceable role.
</P>
<P>
Yu said a source of concern was that official development
assistance had kept decreasing over the years, with last year's
rate dropping to 0.25 percent, a historic new low. The developed
countries should realize that by doing so, they could only serve
their narrow and short-term interests.
</P>
<P>
Yu said official development assistance was not charity, but
rather, it was a long-term investment for developed countries'
own interests. It was also an inescapable moral responsibility. He
called on the developed countries to demonstrate political will to
honor their commitments by reversing the downward trend.
</P>
<P>
He said external debt was a question closely related to the
financing of development. Owing to the joint efforts of the
international community and the debtor countries, the debt issue
had been eased somewhat throughout the world. But there was still
a long way to go before the ultimate objective of a thorough and
comprehensive resolution could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He said debt burden, in fact, was still plaguing a considerable
number of developing countries. He hoped that the international
community, and particularly financial institutions and creditor
countries, would take a more positive approach by taking into
account the special circumstance of the relevant developing
countries in eligibility criteria and application time-frame, so
as to contribute to the full implementation of the initiative at
an early date.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaian Foreign Investment Act Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 16 (Xinhua) - A Bulgarian Foreign Investment Act
was passed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The law sets the procedure and terms of carrying out priority
investment projects in Bulgaria by Bulgarian and foreign
investors. The Council of Ministers must publish a list of regions
where investment projects are to be implemented within a month of
the Act's entry into force. The list will be updated on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
Priority investment projects must meet the following criteria:
over 5,000,000 US dollars in investment, over 100 jobs created and
investing in areas with unemployment above the country average
listed by the Cabinet. The companies implementing the projects
will have their profits tax cut by 50 per cent for ten years.
</P>
<P>
At the investor's request the Foreign Investment Agency
proposes to the competent authorities to grant limited real rights
on privately or municipally owned real property for the priority
investment project's implementation.
</P>
<P>
The law regulates the purchase of foreign exchange and its
transfer abroad by foreign nationals. This can be done after
presenting a receipt of taxes paid in the following cases:
realized return on investment, compensation for an investment
entity expropriated for state use, liquidation quota on
terminating the investment, amount received on selling the
investment entity, amount received after a compulsory winding-up.
</P>
<P>
A bank which transfers foreign exchange without the required
documents is liable to a penalty equal to the amount transferred.
Repeat offenders must pay double the transferred amount.
</P>
<P>
The law designates as foreign investment shares in commercial
partnerships, titles to buildings and limited real rights to real
property, titles to and limited real rights to movable property in
the form of fixed assets, titles to enterprises or to
self-contained parts of enterprises.
</P>

Foreign investment can also be in the form of securities,
including Treasury bills and government bonds maturing in at least
six months and issued by the state, municipalities or other
Bulgarian juristic persons; loans repayable in at least 12 months;
intellectual property; rights proceeding from concession contracts
and management contracts.
</P>
<P>
When an international agreement to which Bulgaria is a party
offers more favorable terms of business to foreign nationals,
these terms apply.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian nationals with dual citizenship who are permanently
resident abroad may choose between the status of Bulgarian or
foreign national.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry, the National Statistical Institute, the
Central Depositary and the National Bank of Bulgaria quarterly
provide data on the type and amount of foreign investment, to be
used by the Foreign Investment Agency's information system.
</P>
<P>
The law exempts from VAT, tariffs and charges imported machines

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Prices Up 0.2 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer price
increased by a small 0.2 percent in September despite the sharp
gain in energy costs, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was the third month that the U.S. consumer prices increased
at the same slow level.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that declines in vegetable and pork prices
and auto financing charges helped slow the overall increase in
consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs jumped by 1.3 percent in September after a 1.7
percent gain in August. Gasoline price rose 1.8 percent following
a 5.4 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
But food prices rose a barely detectable 0.1 percent while
vegetable prices slipped 0.9 percent and pork dropped by 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
New cars edged 0.1 percent higher and used cars 0.1 percent
lower. But lower interest rates produced a 1.3 percent drop in
auto finance charges.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, the Consumer Price Index
in the U.S. rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent comparing with a
3.3 percent increase in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy, prices rose a tame 0.2
percent last month. For the year so far, this so-called core
inflation rate is rising at a 2.2 percent annual rate compared
with a 2.6 percent advance for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department also reported earlier this week that
the wholesale prices increased by 0.5 percent last month.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Denies Friction With Albright on Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen today denied reports that he had differences with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright over whether to keep U.S.
troops in Bosnia beyond June next year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a speech to business leaders on
U.S. military spending and reform, Cohen said, "There has been no
disagreement between Secretary Albright and myself."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Cohen publicly repeated his position against
any further deployment of U.S. troops in Bosnia after its mandate
ends in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Albright favored retaining U.S. peacekeepers in Bosnia within
some larger international force after the so-called Stabilization
Force (SFOR) pulls out of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that no decision had been made on any future
deployment, Cohen today told reporters, "Reports about our battle
are greatly exaggerated. We work very closely together."
</P>
<P>
"We basically agree about the ending of SFOR's mission. We
also agree that Congress must play a role in any decision beyond
June of 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And so reports that you read about, I think, have been
spontaneously generated, but not by virtue of any friction
between the two of us," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the defense budget signed by President Bill
Clinton for fiscal 1998, Clinton is allowed to provide financial
support to further deployment of U.S. troops in Bosnia after June
1998 if he explains reasons for doing so to Congress.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Go Ahead with Maneuvers in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Ismet Sezgin said here today that Turkey's planned military
exercises in Cyprus next month will go ahead as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had no intention to change its plan, Sezgin said at a
press conference. He added that the U.S. calls for reducing
tensions on the island was "late."
</P>
<P>
Turkey plans to hold maneuvers in northern Cyprus on November
3-5 and in the Mediterranean and Aegean region on November 1-8.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin, also defense minister, told the press that he will go
to northern Cyprus, where the Turkish Cypriots declared a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by
Ankara, to monitor the Turkish maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The planned Turkish war games were apparently a response to the
three-day joint Greek and Greek Cypriots' military exercises,
code-named "Nikiforos (Victorious) '97," in the Greek
Cypriots-controlled area on October 10-13.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer
Akbel termed the Greek and Greek Cypriot exercises in Cyprus as "a
provocative action."
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent its warplanes to fly over Cyprus in the past
several days and meet Greek jets in the air, but no clashes
happened.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus accused Turkey of violating their airspace,
but Ankara denied.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Cyprus has become worse since the Cypriot
government signed a deal with Russia to purchase anti-aircraft
missiles in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military has vowed to destroy the missiles if
diplomatic efforts fail to block their deployment, which it said
is a threat to Turkish security.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke urged all
parties concerned in the Cyprus problem to avoid actions of
increasing tensions during his visit to Ankara early this week.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot south and Turkish
Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to occupy the
northern third of the island in reaction to a failed coup seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have failed to
achieve any tangible results in realizing reunification of the
eastern Mediterranean island state.

UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today called upon both sides in Cyprus to act in
accordance with recent Security Council resolutions and to avoid
any actions which might increase tension.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued this morning by the spokesman's office said
that the secretary-general was concerned by the reports of
increased tension between Greek and Turkish forces in connection
with military exercises in and around Cyprus and the Eastern
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general urged all parties to act in accordance
with recent Security Council resolutions, which specifically
expressed grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of
military forces and armaments in Cyprus and the rate at which they
were being expanded.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief called upon the parties to create a climate for
reconciliation and genuine mutual confidence on both sides.

<HEADLINE> US: Russia Expands Ties With West Despite NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia has defied
predictions by some critics of NATO enlargement by accelerating
internal reform and expanding cooperation with the West, a top
State Department official said today.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made in a speech by Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott for delivery to the World Affairs Council of Boston
and copies were made available to reporters by the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
"President Yeltsin has beefed up his government with innovators
committed to economic modernization and integration," said
Talbott.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said Russian President Boris Yeltsin also has made
dramatic progress in reconciling differences with Ukraine,
participated in a Denver summit of leaders of developed countries
and advanced Russia's effort to join the World Trade Organization
and other international bodies.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) have argued that the process would strengthen
anti-reform groups in Russia and end Moscow's cooperation with the
West.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia continues its cooperation with the West,
Talbott noted, citing the fact that 1,400 Russian troops are
participating in the NATO-led Stabilization Force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops are under the command of Gen. Anatoly
Glebovich Krivalapov who, during the Cold War, spent much of his
career pointing intercontinental ballistic missiles at American
cities, said Talbott.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Talbott admitted NATO enlargement worries many
Russians. "Many Russians still have in mind a Cold War image of
NATO," he said, stressing that these include Russian reformers,
who warn that the process threatens to strengthen these forces.
</P>
<P>
But Talbott said he believes the "risk is both exaggerated and
manageable."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and President Bill Clinton have tried to keep their
disagreement on the subject "within the bounds of an over-arching
cooperative relationship between Russia and the United States,"
Talbott said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Telecoms Satellite Sent Aloft In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XICHANG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China sent an ApStar-2R
telecommunications satellite belonging to Hong Kong's Asia-Pacific
Satellite Telecommunications into orbit on a Long-March 3b rocket
at 03:13 today.
</P>
<P>
The rocket was launched at the Xichang Satellite Launching
Center in southwestern Sichuan province. The satellite separated
after 1,473 seconds of flight.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an Satellite Monitoring Center reports that the
satellite has entered its orbit with an apogee of 47,922 km,
perigee of 201 km, and dip of 24.4 degrees.
</P>
<P>
This is the third launch of a Long-March 3b, which is a recent
development of the China Carrier Rocket Technology Institute. It
has a 5,000-kg payload and is the most powerful rocket developed
by China so far.
</P>
<P>
The maiden launch of Long-March 3b failed on February 15, 1996,
because of the changes of inertial reference in the the control
system. The second, on August 20 of this year, was a success,
thanks to technological improvement made after the first launch.
</P>
<P>
The 3,700 kg. ApStar-2R satellite, which has 28 c-band
transponders and 15 Ku-band transponders, is manufactured by the
U.S.'s Space System (Loral). With a a life span of 15 years, it
will be positioned at 76.5 degrees east longitude and over the
equator.
</P>
<P>
The Long-March 3b will be used to carry three more
telecommunications satellites in the near future.

<HEADLINE> US Social Security Gives Lowest Raise in Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The 44 million Americans
getting Social Security checks will see the payment grow by just
2.1 percent next year, the lowest cost-of-living raise in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Social Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel said today
the cost of living adjustment, or COLA, means the average monthly
check for retirees will rise by 16 dollars to 765 dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The maximum monthly payment for 6.5 million low income
individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income, known as SSI,
also will rise by 2.1 percent to 494 dollars. For a couple, the
maximum payment goes to 741 from 726 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The monthly checks for retirees, the biggest benefit program in
the U.S. federal budget spending, are adjusted annually to keep
inflation from eroding their buying power. Since 1975, the
adjustment has been automatic. It is calculated based on changes
in the Consumer Price Index from the third quarter of one year to
the corresponding quarter of the next.
</P>
<P>
Because of low inflation in the country, the yearly benefit
boosts have been below 3 percent since 1994. Next year's gain in
U.S. Social Security payment is the smallest since a record low
1.3 percent raise in 1987.
</P>
<P>
For 144 million working Americans, the maximum annual earnings
subject to Social Security payroll taxes next year will also rise
to 68,400 dollars from 65,400 dollars, though the rate at which
the earnings are taxed remains at 6.2 percent. That means a
maximum Social Security tax of 4,241 dollars in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Beer Brewing Industry Forging Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
( By Wang Jinyu )
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- With a new bottling line
commissioning here today, the Kenyan beer brewing industry has
enough capacity to meet the growing needs well into the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The new line which is believed to be the most modern bottling
line on the African continent has a capacity of 80,000 bottles
per hour, bringing the brewing capacity of the Kenya Breweries
Ltd. (KBL) to three million litres of beer a year.
</P>
<P>
The modernization of production equipment is one of a series
of initiatives taken by the KBL, the second largest brewing group
on the continent, to face the growing competition on the local
beer market.
</P>
<P>
With the gradual liberalization of Kenya's economy, the level
of protection has now been reduced substantially and local
investors have to improve their efficiency and quality if they
want to survive and prosper.
</P>
<P>
The KBL which has three breweries in the country has recently
earned the accolade of being the first brewery in Africa to
achieve the international quality standard ISO 9002 at the
Nairobi and Kisumu breweries.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 employees from both management and workers of
the company were trained in exacting quality improvement programs
during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The KBL will also carry out a re-assessment of key operational
issues which in the long run will lead to substantial cost
savings and efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
The company intends to build a more versatile workforce
through training and manpower development for all staff in a bid
to enhance competitive edge against foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, substantial business opportunities continue
to emerge in East Africa with the advent of renewed cooperation
between the governments and people of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the growing demands for its products, the company
has already invested 1.5 billion Kenyan Shillings (about 25
million U.S. Dollars) in installing one bottling line in Kenya
and the other in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The KBL Chairman Jeremiah Kiereini today announced that his
company had made a plan to raise a further 1.5 billion shillings
of new capital to be used to set up a brewery in Tanzania which
is expected to start brewing by December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The company remains committed towards self sufficiency in the
supply of raw materials and provides financial and technical help
to local barley farmers in order to guarantee a continued supply
of quality malt.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with local and international institutions, the
company has carried out continuous researches aimed at releasing
a new variety of barley, the KHBI 308-5, to replace the Bima
variety by November this year.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's beer brewing industry dates back to 1922 and as early
as in 1934 the KBL won its first Gold Medal in the Mode
Selection.
</P>
<P>
This year, at the International Monde Selection Awards held in
Brussels, the KBL won six Gold and two Silver medals for its
beers.

JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Fresh registration of voters
has begun in Lesotho for the general elections due to be held next
year, according sources reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The exercise had to begin again because the voters' roll had not

Mafisa said the voter registration is an ongoing process, which

An Independent Electoral Commission was launched last month to
oversee the entire polling process.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's last polls, held in 1993, were supervised by the
Electoral Office under a chief electoral officer appointed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties claimed that the officer was biased in the polls
because he was a civil servant.

<HEADLINE> PUK Not Target of Turkish Operations: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said today that the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) had never been a target of its
military operations in northern Iraq, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish government troops have not staged an operation
against the PUK forces," Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer
Akbel said at a news briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Reports earlier this week said that Turkish warplanes had
bombed the PUK-controlled areas and they were confirmed by Shazad
Saib, a senior official at the PUK office in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
PUK is believed to have maintained a relaxed relationship with
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK). Some PKK militants
reportedly took refuge in the PUK-controlled areas in northern
Iraq after Turkish troops swept their camps in the region.
</P>
<P>
Akbel said that Turkey's cross-border incursions were aimed at
wiping out the militants of PKK.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, some 15,000 Turkish troops stormed into
northern Iraq and killed more than 800 PKK militants, who are
fighting a 13-year-old war against the Turkish government for
independence in southeastern Turkey.

JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Namibia has clarified its
position on the United Nations protocol banning landmines, Southern
African Broadcasting Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the Namibian Defense Ministry said Namibia had

The Defense Ministry said the two government departments had the

of landmines.
</P>
<P>
The international community is to sign a global anti-personnel
landmine treaty in December in Ottawa, Canada.
</P>

Landmines have killed or maimed millions of people in areas of

<HEADLINE> US Probing Gazprom Bond Offering in Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
investigating whether the Russian natural gas firm Gazprom should
be allowed to raise money in the United Sates and other financial
markets at a time when it is planning a major natural gas
investment in Iran, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that the Wall Street firm
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Company is underwriting the Gazprom bond offering
-- a way that the Russian natural gas firm used to raise 1 billion
dollars, which the newspaper said "will go right into the firm's
coffers just as it is preparing to write the Iranians a fat
check."
</P>
<P>
"On the question of underwriting, our lawyers right now are
looking at the issue" of whether the bond offering violates the
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, State Department spokesman James Foley
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Iran-Libya Sanctions Act mandates sanctions against
companies investing more than 20 million dollars a year in Iran's
energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Underwriting is "not mentioned specifically in the ILSA
(Iran-Libya Sanctions Act) legislation but we've not made a
determination though as to whether that would be covered as among
the menu of sanctions," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is a risk of some kind" if Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
and Gazprom proceed with the bond offering before the U.S.
government decides if the offering violates the law, he added.
