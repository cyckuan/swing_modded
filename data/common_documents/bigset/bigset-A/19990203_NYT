 MONKEY STUDY DASHES HOPES FR `LIVE-VIRUS' AIDS VACCINE  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The long-held hope that n artificially disabled AIDS virus
might be turned into a powerful vaccine against the disease has
been dimmed by researchers experimenting with a monkey version of
the virus.
<P>
   Even though an international group of physicians has volunteered
to test such a live-virus human AIDS vaccine, Harvard scientists
are warning that their monkey vaccine has caused the disease in
some animals and has killed at least one.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using a weakened form of HIV, the virus that causes
human AIDS, has intrigued vaccine researchers for years, and
experiments at Harvard with a virtually identical virus that causes
disease in monkeys appeared to make at least some of the animals
immune to the simian version of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, another team of Harvard researchers has found that
a group of infant and adult monkeys vaccinated with a live but
disabled form of the simian AIDS virus developed AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruth Ruprecht, of Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
reports in the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine that
she and her colleagues vaccinated eight newborn monkeys and 16
adults with the disabled virus. Six of the infants developed AIDS
and two showed early signs that their immune systems were badly
damaged, while levels of active virus rose among four of the
adults, and one of them died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Disabled viruses have been used to make vaccines against many
diseases. Smallpox no longer threatens the world because a
live-virus smallpox vaccine has eliminated every known reservoir of
that virus throughout the world. The oral polio vaccine, also made
from a live but weakened strain of the polio virus, has practically
eliminated that paralyzing disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists can weaken a disease-causing virus either by removing
some of the proteins from its outer coat or by removing one or more
of the genes that enable it to reproduce once it has invaded the
body and taken over the genetic machinery of the immune system
cells it penetrates.
</P>
<P>
   The monkey vaccine that was tested for three years starting
eight years ago was made by removing a single gene known as the
``nef'' gene from the simian AIDS virus. It was developed by Dr.
Ronald Desrosiers and his colleagues at Harvard's New England
Regional Primate Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   But when the preliminary results from Ruprecht's team were first
circulated last year, Desrosiers and his group said they had not
given up on the concept and would try weakening a human version of
their live-virus AIDS vaccine even further by removing four of the
viral genes instead of only one.
</P>
<P>
   One of Desrosiers' colleagues, Dr. John Sullivan of the
University of Massachusetts Medical School, suggested recently that
such a vaccine might be tested on terminally ill cancer patients
who volunteered for the trial, but that idea has spawned an ethical
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our study indicates that it is not safe to conduct human tests
of AIDS vaccines made from live, weakened viruses,'' Ruprecht said.
``There is a real risk of contracting AIDS from the vaccine
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Although animal research into the live-virus vaccine concept
will continue in many centers, human trials would ultimately
require approval by the federal Food and Drug Administration, and
that is nowhere in sight.

CAN DEL HARRIS BEAT THE ODDS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Del Harris has waved goodbye to Nick Van Exel, breaking up the
NBA's funnest couple this side of Dennis and Carmen.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' old headache, Cedric Ceballos, is two teams down the
road by now, water skiing on another coach's time.
</P>
<P>
   Even Harris' radio tormentor, Joe McDonnell, is without a
full-time gig and temporarily out of the coach's hair, relegated to
fill-in work on a fading news-talk station.
</P>
<P>
   What's left to make a Los Angeles Lakers coach's life miserable?
</P>
<P>
   Only a team he calls ``the best we've had,'' his
hardest-training and most coachable roster since Sidney Moncrief
was a Milwaukee Buck, and the prospective nightmare of an
excuse-free season that happens to be the last on his Lakers
contract.
</P>
<P>
   It's a weird, lockout-shortened NBA schedule of 50 games in 90
days, but the Lakers are young and can take it, so nobody will cut
Harris any slack if they bomb out of the playoffs again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no stranger to it,'' said Harris, 61, noting he has
coached without a contractual safety net twice before. With Houston
in 1979-80, his rookie year as an NBA head coach, he took the
Rockets to the second round of the playoffs for the first time
since '77.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got rewarded with another one-year contract,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And a raise?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten thousand dollars!'' he said with mock grandeur. ``I went
from 70 to 80,000 dollars and was happy to get it. Then the next
year we went to the Finals and lost to Boston, and I got a
three-year contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris resigned before that one ran out as the Rockets fell to
earth in '82 without Moses Malone.
</P>
<P>
   The standards are higher in Los Angeles. In four seasons under
coach Del, the Lakers have improved their regular-season record
each time, a rare feat, building to last year's 61-21. And Harris'
battle is still uphill.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers don't get to the NBA Finals this year, barring
extenuating circumstances, he can forget about even a $10,000 raise
on his approximately $1.5 million-a-year contract, and break out
his old ``consultant'' shingle.
</P>
<P>
   If they get there and don't win, his return is a 50-50
proposition, worse if it ends badly. If they get there and do win,
well, how are they going to fire him?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, getting past the Western Conference finals isn't any
easier just because the Chicago Bulls are no longer contenders in
the East. So while it might be going too far to call Harris a lame
duck, he is waddling with a limp as the season opens Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Harris declines to ``negotiate in the papers,'' which is smart,
because the fans wouldn't be with him, unconvinced as they are that
he has earned the right to demand anything. He has, however, touted
his own Lakers loyalty by revealing he said no to two NBA teams
that approached him last summer about their coaching vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lakers management has declined to negotiate in the
papers or out of them either, preferring to put off Harris'
potential contract hassle until the end of the season. The official
reason is that management thinks negotiations would prove a
distraction, just what a coach on a four- to five-games-a-week
schedule doesn't need.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason is that Jerry West and Jerry Buss aren't sold on
him either.
</P>
<P>
   It's not his X's and O's that raise occasional doubts but his
way with people, which suggests the occasional locker-room
grumbling isn't just an example of players being players.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' tin-eared criticism of players' effort during an early,
unsupervised workout in the days following the labor settlement was
an example of something that didn't go over well in the front
office.
</P>
<P>
   And his sensitivity to criticism, even after 13 NBA seasons and
550 victories, is a continuing source of amazement. A photograph in
the Lakers' preseason media guide shows Harris on the team plane
with stat sheets, a calculator and a copy of the Daily News on the
table in front of him. With some imagination you could guess he
just read something negative in the paper and is devising a
statistic to refute it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the observation _ hard to refute _ by David
Claerbaut of ``The NBA Analyst'' that ``a coach has to have an
impact on the psyche of his team (and) Harris evidently had none.''
In other words, Harris hasn't taken the Lakers' assortment of large
and immature personalities and put them together as something
greater.
</P>
<P>
   He has one more chance.
</P>
<P>
   This is the season he yearned for all through the lockout. He
wanted one to dedicate to his parents, who died within weeks of
each other during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the championship he's never had, also.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can win the championship,'' Harris said of his
reason for turning down those other teams.
</P>
<P>
   He's right and then some. The Lakers SHOULD win the championship
with their talent. The roster is mostly the same, the big positive
change being the replacement of point guard Van Exel with good
soldier Derek Fisher and steady 37-year-old Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Their depth _ nine members of the new roster averaged at least
20 minutes a game last season _ should help them survive the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   One Las Vegas odds line makes them 3-1 co-favorites with Utah to
win the title for the first time since 11 years ago in the Pat
Riley era. Guess who'll get the blame if they fail.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against Harris being their coach next year are better
than 3-1. But not by much.

U.S. BORDER INSPECTORS ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Mexican drug lords paid huge bribes to U.S. border
inspectors in Nogales to help smuggle an estimated 20 tons of
cocaine into Arizona before the operation was shut down this week,
according to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Three inspectors from the Immigration and Naturalization Service
were led into the U.S. District Court here in shackles, hours after
their arrests on bribery and drug charges. Investigators also
arrested a former INS inspector, along with five people reputedly
tied to major narcotics cartels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integrity of the justice system depends on rooting out
corruption at all levels,'' said Jose de Jesus Rivera, U.S.
Attorney for Arizona. ``When people see law enforcement that's
corrupt, it affects the whole nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Fickett, district director for the INS, said there are
more than 3,000 inspectors in Arizona, ``and it is a shame that the
actions of a few will tarnish so many.''
</P>
<P>
   Fickett said Border Patrol agents and inspectors are under
tremendous pressure because of the danger inherent to their jobs,
but also because of cash temptation held out by narcotics
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ```There is constant pressure on our employees to take those
bribes,'' Fickett added. ``We will cut out the corruption. We will
cut out the rot.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the border inspectors operated independently
and apparently were unaware of each others' activities. They said
the indictments, after more than a year of investigations, prove
that drug-enforcement efforts are working, and set an example for
other law officers who may be tempted.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said he believes the case, dubbed ``Operation Ghost
Boat,'' puts a crimp in the cocaine pipeline across Arizona's
border. But officials acknowledged that although 2,500 pounds of
cocaine were impounded in a pair of seizures, an additional 37,500
pounds made it into Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   They also conceded that they have no idea whether other law
officers may be on the take.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments were handed up Jan. 27, but kept sealed until
Tuesday. All nine suspects live in the Nogales area.
</P>
<P>
   The INS inspectors who were arrested are:
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ronquillo-Rojas, 33, accused of taking more than $32,000
in bribes to allow drug-laden vehicles through a Nogales checkpoint
last year. Ronquillo, who had worked at the border 12 years, is
also charged with attempting to distribute cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Landa, 50, faces charges that he collected $30,000 for
allowing vehicles into the country with cocaine in June and
September of last year. But investigators believe his total take
was more than $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Landa, who worked on the Nogales border 21 years, also is
accused of attempting to import and distribute cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Maria de Los Angeles Alabado, 37, is accused of taking bribes in
return for issuing entry permits to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Corrella, 41, a former INS employee at the Nogales port of
entry, reputedly accepted $75,000 in return for allowing a
1,289-pound shipment of cocaine through the border in June of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although vehicle inspections are the domain of U.S. Customs
agents, law officers along the border are routinely cross-trained.
Officials said it was routine for INS inspectors to check
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   A bribery conviction carries maximum penalties of up to 15 years
in prison plus fines of $250,000. The drug charges could bring
maximum penalties of 40 years in prison and $2 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the law enforcement officials, indictments were
handed up against Jose Quiroz-Gonzalez, 48, and Fernando Suarez,
36, for conspiracy to import and possess 1,200 pounds of cocaine;
Theresa Estrada-Portillo, 35, for conspiracy to possess cocaine;
and Roberto Terrazas-Aviles, 40, and Victoria Perez Abreu
Sepulveda, 34, for conspiracy to possess marijuana and the
importation of 275 pounds of marijuana in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said those suspects have ties to the Rafael Caro
Quintero and Amado Carillo Fuentes cartels, two of Mexico's
narcotics syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities would not say how they learned of the border
corruption, nor would they describe methods used during the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   They said the anti-corruption task force involved DEA agents,
U.S. Customs Service, the Internal Revenue Service, INS, the
Arizona Department of Public Safety, and a Santa Cruz County
narcotics group.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption indictments come just three weeks after
investigators discovered tunnels linking Nogales, Sonora, with
Nogales, Ariz. Officials believe the tunnels were used for drug
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said it should come as no surprise that drugs and bribery
flow through Nogales, because it's a border town with heavy
traffic. However, he added, authorities will keep fighting the
narcotics tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption will not be tolerated,'' agreed Guadalupe Gonzalez,
FBI special agent in charge for Arizona. ``And this case is an
example of the success that cooperative law enforcement can
have.'' &QL;

DAVIS SCOLDED BY PAC-10
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA guard Baron Davis was publicly reprimanded
and placed on season-long probation by the Pacific-10 Conference on
Tuesday for criticizing referee Terry Christman after Sunday's loss
at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any subsequent public comments on officiating by Mr. Davis . .
. will result in a substantial penalty,'' Pac-10 commissioner Tom
Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Steve Lavin _ who was ejected from the game but did
not mention Christman in his postgame comments _ is expected to
receive a private letter of reprimand for his actions, according to
league sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10's master officiating schedule, designed months ago,
called for Christman to work four of the Bruins' first nine games:
Oregon State, Stanford, USC and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   However, Christman is not scheduled for any UCLA games for the
remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid immediate suspension, Davis was required to apologize
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't have said what I said,'' he said. ``I was thinking
off emotion and I didn't take the high road.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis fouled out with 4:34 remaining and threw his mouthpiece in
frustration, prompting Christman to assess a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Davis said he felt ``cheated'' _ a term that
infuriated league officials.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he still feels that way, Davis said: ``I think, I mean,
yeah, I think so. But it's just the way I feel. Did I do the right
thing? No. No, I didn't. Did I say the right thing? No. . . . I was
just acting off emotions.''

SELIG'S BIGGEST CRIME IS FAILURE TO FIX SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Never one to be intimidated by irony, Bud Selig came
to town this week and said that his history with major league
baseball in Seattle was, ahem, ``checkered.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a little like Lucy saying Charlie Brown has trouble with
his kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, now baseball commissioner, came here to slobber all over
the new ballpark, Safeco Field, site of the 2001 All-Star Game.
Almost 30 years ago here, he was also drooling.
</P>
<P>
   As the head of a group of business pirates from Milwaukee, Selig
swooped in and stole the Pilots right out of spring training after
the team's single tremulous season in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years of litigation later, Seattle regained what Selig had
stolen when the Mariners took to the new Kingdome carpet.
</P>
<P>
   While much has changed in the intervening years, there remains a
constant _ major league baseball is still wobbling in Seattle.
Selig might be around for a remarkable milestone _ watching
baseball fail in three Seattle stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Sicks' Stadium, a converted minor league park, was fingered as a
big culprit in the financial failure of the Pilots. The Kingdome,
almost from its inception, has been targeted by the Mariners as the
source of almost all of their ills short of jock itch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after the public bought the club's argument to the tune of
$372 million in tax money, word is circulating that the huge new
ballpark revenues really might not fix all of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner officials have said quietly all along that the park is
not a panacea. In fact, they knew more than two years ago, when the
park was barely in the cocktail napkin stage, that it didn't pencil
out.
</P>
<P>
   That fear was a big part of their dramatic stunt in December
1996, when John Ellis tearfully announced the club was for sale
because some local politicians said mean things.
</P>
<P>
   But after Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Nintendo) came in and laid waste
to opponents and gave the owners a sweetheart deal, they
reluctantly went ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the park is six months from opening, their reluctance
is visible. The Mariners froze their player payroll at around $53
million, while their more profligate brethren went on a spending
spree worthy of Barbara Hedges. The upshot is that the Mariner
roster, patched together with the lame and the halt from other
teams, is barely on the outskirts of contention in the smallest
division in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the ballpark will make no payroll difference in 1999.
It remains to be seen whether payroll will increase thereafter. The
only long-term vision articulated by management is the paying down
of ballpark debt.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains the colorful new marketing slogan: ``Ya Gotta
Love This Balance Sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news in the 30 years of Selig's influence over baseball
in Seattle is that the local club is no longer a real threat to
leave. The bad news is that the club is also no longer a real
threat to win a championship. The end of the millennium offers
major league ball in Seattle as mediocrity in a pretty place.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of this is Selig's fault, of course. Nor does the
current ownership group bear all the blame for the systemic failure
of America's oldest professional sport and monopoly to pull itself
together in a fashion slightly more harmonious than the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the happy-face talk from Selig about the All-Star
Game coming to Seattle in the face of continued economic travail is
so much hypocritical claptrap that it's obvious the man has no more
conscience now than when he was wearing his buccaneer's outfit 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the impending financial debacle when the Mariners
attempt to extend the contracts of Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez to keep them in Seattle _ requiring an amount of money
approximating the gross national product of Norway _ Selig said:
</P>
<P>
   ``As commissioner of baseball, I want it to be Griffey of the
Seattle Mariners and Rodriguez of the Mariners going into the Hall
of Fame, and it's my job to work on it and see that that can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   You betcha, Bud. While you're at it, you go out there and stop
the salary spiral, halt the impending move of the Expos from
Montreal, redistribute fairly the game's revenues, compel the
players union and the umpires union to think of something beyond
themselves, subsidize the new ballparks, and get the World Series
TV ratings ahead of a Martha Stewart doily derby.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 years as owner, pseudo-commissioner and now commissioner,
Selig has had exactly no influence in curbing baseball's loopy
lunge toward self-destruction. He did come up with a novel idea to
blow up the 1994 World Series, and that didn't seem to do much
good.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a Mariner ownership group with the guts and
money of Turner, Steinbrenner or Murdoch, it's hard to imagine
Selig coming up with a plan to keep Griffey and Rodriguez in
Seattle without surrounding them with a team of Furbys.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the All-Star Game, Bud. But please don't be offended
if Seattleites clutch their wallets and purses when you walk by.

USC'S BIBBY FIGURES THREE BETTER THAN TWO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After alternating seniors Elias Ayuso and Adam
Spanich at the shooting-guard position, USC coach Henry Bibby has
decided he's most comfortable with both in the lineup. The Trojans
have gone with a three-guard lineup the past two games, as Bibby
tries to find ways to improve his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably made enough lineup changes,'' Bibby said. ``I
like Adam and (Elias) starting. I like the one-two punch. When
those guys are playing well, it gives us a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves seems to be working. The pair hit 17 of 31 shots from
3-point range the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Going nowhere: Although his playing time has been curtailed
to only 11 minutes per contest in Pac-10 play, junior forward
Jarvis Turner said he has no plans to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Toughest loss: USC's season might have suffered its biggest
setback in late December when sophomore point guard Kevin Augustine
quit the team and decided to transfer. It's meant the Trojans are
down to freshman Brandon Granville and converted shooting guard
Quincy Wilder at the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hurts us is Brandon is playing like a freshman and we've
been struggling because we have no other point guards,'' Bibby
said.
</P>
<P>
   What did the loss of Augustine mean? ``It killed us,'' Bibby
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Faded memory: It's been nearly a month since USC won a
basketball game, on Spanich's miracle half-court shot that enabled
the Trojans to upset Oregon 85-84 on Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Spanich was asked what he would have said if someone told him
that would be USC's last victory for the month of January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought they were crazy,'' Spanich said. ``I
can't remember what it feels like to win.''

SONICS RELOAD WITH SEVEN NEW PLAYERS AND NEW COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fans who enjoy television talk shows as much as they
do basketball might be disappointed in the Sonics this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of wholesale changes, it is evident the Sonics have
treated their Jerry Springer symptoms _ controversy and
questionable mental health off the court _ with at least a pristine
disposition heading into the abbreviated 1999 season that tips off
Friday against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   You know it is a new era when about the only teaser before
tipoff has to do with who is going to start opposite Gary Payton.
Not exactly a spellbinding situation, but it is fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after appearing in the NBA Finals, trading an icon
and making a head coaching change, the Sonics could not be more
invigorating. Hersey Hawkins looked around the team's practice
facility recently and observed that for the first time in his four
years in Seattle, everyone was present, happy and ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Sonics' quest to win a championship is the plot,
subplot and complete story line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to recast the team,'' team president Wally Walker
said, ``and firm up our weak spots. I think we've gone a long way
toward that. We're much better off than we were a year ago on a lot
of fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   There are seven new players, but hiring Paul Westphal to replace
George Karl as head coach is Walker's boldest move yet.
</P>
<P>
   Under Karl, the Sonics won three straight Pacific Division
championships and compiled more wins over a six-year period than
any team except the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But Walker concluded that the trapping, relentless pressure
defense that Karl stressed did not work well in a seven-game
series. Since reaching the Finals in 1996, the Sonics have not made
it past the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Walker expects that to change with Westphal. He stresses more
man-to-man coverage with occasional trapping. Offensively, the
Sonics plan to use the fastbreak whenever possible and use more
players _ up to nine _ in the regular rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new era,'' said assistant coach Nate McMillan. ``We're
trying to establish our own identity. Paul's just now trying to lay
that down. It's hard when you only have two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is gone. There's no reason to compare. And now Paul has
his group. Right now, Paul is trying to get the team to believe in
his system.''
</P>
<P>
   How different is this edition of the Sonics?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the team took an aggressive approach in the draft.
Vladimir Stepania was the 27th player selected in the first round,
but already he is showing signs of becoming a star. His biggest
hurdle now is learning the difference between European basketball
and the NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   Rashard Lewis, the 19-year-old high school player taken in the
second round, is sufficiently skilled that Westphal might change
his original plan and play him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I've learned about the NBA is that you have to
be flexible,'' said Westphal, whose style stands in stark contrast
to Karl's.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Westphal stepped into a completely different situation
than Karl left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The essential cornerstones _ Payton, Hawkins, Vin Baker and
Detlef Schrempf _ remain in place. Gone are McMillan, Jim
McIlvaine, Sam Perkins, Jerome Kersey and Greg Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is the infusion of new blood that has pumped
confidence into the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Center Olden Polynice and guard/forward Billy Owens were
significant free-agent additions considering the Sonics' salary-cap
constraints. The team spent $1 million on Polynice and paid a
little more than $2 million to Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has all the makings. It has a good mix of youth and
veterans, a good mix of complementary talent and a real commitment
to winning,'' Walker said. ``On pure size, we may not be much
different, but we'll be a more physical and better rebounding
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice brings toughness and solid rebounding ability to the
starting lineup, two qualities the Sonics haven't had in the center
position in years.
</P>
<P>
   Owens gives the Sonics versatility, a 6-foot-9 player who can
perform at three positions. He's a good ball-handler who can post
up either guard, which presents match-up problems whenever he's on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That Owens also can grab offensive and defensive rebounds is
further proof that the Sonics should be as advertised: A more
versatile and better rebounding team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year things have really changed and hopefully we'll get
over the hump,'' Payton said. ``Maybe this will be it for us. This
year, we're starting out fresh. We don't have any big holes. There
won't be any excuses. It's all going to be about winning and
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, arguably, a Sonic squad that boasts more depth than
ever. It is a nice quality to have considering the
50-games-in-90-days schedule. The Sonics twice will play five games
in six nights between now and May. There also is a stretch when the
Sonics have 16 games in 23 days.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal plans to compensate by playing a combination of
different lineups and rotating starters. During weeks when the
schedule reads three games in as many days, Westphal said he will
rest players in the second or third game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to have to start it off (fast). Paul's
going to try some things the first couple weeks of the season,''
Payton said. ``But he knows me and Vin want to be in the game and
he knows how competitive we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal figures it will be hard to lose many games as long as
Payton and Baker are on his side. Having established himself as
arguably the best point guard in the league, Payton is a legitimate
candidate for the most-valuable-player award.
</P>
<P>
   Although Baker did not fare well in the playoffs last season, he
is establishing himself as a money player next to Payton. They are
as proficient a tandem as any in the league, and Westphal clearly
expects Payton and Baker to shoulder the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's worked harder or shown more leadership than Vin and
Gary,'' Westphal said. ``And I don't think you can want to win more
than Gary does. It just burns in him. If anything, sometimes he
forgets how talented he is. His competitiveness and quickness is in
another class. He's for real.''
</P>
<P>
   One still has to wonder, just how real are the Sonics?
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have been a mere blip on the preseason championship
radar, to which Walker responds, ``I'm not too concerned with what
people are saying about us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many of the Western Conference powerhouses seem too
concerned about the Sonics, either.
</P>
<P>
   But as Westphal pointed out tongue-in-cheek, each team is in the
same predicament: Each is in first place in February. And that
means absolutely nothing in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly hard to get to the Finals. Everybody's got a
story,'' Westphal said. ``In Utah, they couldn't get past Houston
for a long time. The Lakers can't seem to get past Utah. There's
always some nemesis out there.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be the year the Sonics have cleared their biggest
hurdle: themselves. Now, whenever someone mentions Shawn Kemp's
trade demand and Karl's contract squabbles, it is like hearing
about a tired, old rerun.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics clearly have switched the channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about the past,'' assistant coach Dwane
Casey said. ``Paul's brought a refreshing personality to the table.
It's a new day.''

SEIDMAN SET TO SIGN WITH UCLA TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Westlake Village tight end Mike Seidman ends
months of secrecy and speculation today when he signs a letter of
intent with UCLA, according to recruiting sources.
</P>
<P>
   Seidman had narrowed his choices to USC and UCLA, and no one _
not family, not friends, not teammates _ has uttered a public peep
about his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The school he selects will have landed the No.1 tight end in the
state and one of the best prospects, at any position, in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sylmar's George Wrighster, who wants to play either tight end or
linebacker, is expected to sign with Arizona or Oregon. UCLA is no
longer involved, a source said, because it recruited Wrighster
strictly as a linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins promised Seidman they would not recruit another tight
end, the source added.
</P>
<P>
   Slow to receive commitments in December, UCLA is fast
approaching its 21-scholarship maximum.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to commit is Kevin Brant, a 5-11 multiposition player
from Bethesda, Md. He is the son of television commentator Tim
Brant and chose UCLA over Maryland, his father's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Gardena defensive back/sprinter DeShaun McCullough committed to
UCLA last week and instantly became the Bruins' fastest recruit.
However, the scholarship will be nullified if he does not attain a
qualifying SAT score.
</P>
<P>
   Add Monrovia tailback Akil Harris, and the Bruins have 18 firm
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills lineman Blane Kezirian, son of UCLA athletic
department administrator Ed Kezirian, will receive a scholarship if
the Bruins do not reach their limit. If they do, Kezirian will
enroll next year.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Bruins are recruiting Harvard-Westlake's 300-pound
tight end, Alex Holmes, who is petitioning for college eligibility.
He could play any one of four or five positions in college.

SMOOTH OPERATOR: WESTPHAL OFFERS FLEXIBILITY, EXPECTS RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Great person. Tremendous family man. Dedicated in his
faith. Play word association with Phoenix Suns owner Jerry
Colangelo on the subject of new Sonics coach Paul Westphal, and
those values come right to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Another one, too. ``He is his own person,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the way Westphal was as a player, blending skill, smarts
and independent thinking to become a three-time All-NBA guard for
the Suns. And it's the way he was as coach in Phoenix, trusting
players to act in the best interest of the team. When Colangelo
felt that approach had stopped working, he fired Westphal midway
through the 1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's a very bright, intelligent guy, and he'll do only what
he wants to do,'' Colangelo said. ``And you have to respect the man
for doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earning the Sonics' respect is Westphal's challenge now, and he
doesn't have some of the usual tools. He's not a taskmaster,
doesn't control personnel moves and makes less money than Don
MacLean.
</P>
<P>
   But he's coaching here as he did in Phoenix _ the way (start
ital)he (end ital) wanted to be coached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a lot of personal responsibility on them to do the right
thing, because I think that's the only way they can achieve the
utmost,'' Westphal said. ``And there's a risk that goes with that,
because if you don't dictate every move they make, they might make
some mistakes. But if they have it burning inside them to win, I
don't want to stifle that.''
</P>
<P>
   In that statement, Westphal is paraphrasing a quote that's
important to him. He had it posted in his office in Phoenix, in its
Sparky Anderson incarnation: ``When you get a group that wants to
win, you've got to let them.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds almost like ``get out of the way,'' and Westphal
will, in some cases. He won't worry much about his veterans, and
they're happy with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's allowing us to be professionals, and that doesn't happen
very often in this game,'' said 38-year-old swingman Dale Ellis,
whose rookie season of 1983-84 was Westphal's last as a player.
``He's a veteran coach, he's played the game, he understands what
it takes to win. And whenever you give some of the power back to
the players, you appreciate it and respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   That worked for a while in Phoenix with Charles Barkley, who
responded to Westphal's free hand and led the Suns to the 1993
Western Conference title. But it wore off eventually, and the
freedom Westphal gave Barkley alienated teammates A.C. Green and
Kevin Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Westphal must find a way to placate star Gary Payton
without losing the rest of the team. Both are pledging peace, but
Payton retains his loyalty to former coach George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand, Coach Karl was my coach, and he put
me where I'm at right now,'' Payton said. ``So I can't compare him
to anybody right now. I'm sorry and I hate that I lost him, but
I've got a new coach now and I've got to deal with it. I'm going to
try to deal with it as best I can, and right now Paul is a great
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said he'll treat Payton the same way he treated
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treat people with respect and try to allow them to be
themselves as much as possible. That's what I did with Charles, and
that's what I'll do with Gary or any of the players,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's a straightforward person, and I think I am. I've never
thought I was going to have a problem with him, because he's a
steel-eyed competitor. If you give me a guy that wants to win, why
should I have a problem with it? We're going to be going in the
same direction.''
</P>
<P>
   After Westphal took the Sonics job last June, he met with Payton
and his agent for lunch in Oakland. They agreed not to try to
change anything about each other, and Payton told Westphal he
enjoyed the freedom Karl gave him and wished to keep it that way.
At 30, Payton said, he was too old to play for a disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, no, he wasn't like that, and that was it,'' Payton
said. ``We sat there and ate our salads and a little chicken and we
left.''
</P>
<P>
   (start ital) When you get a player who wants to win. ... (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always going to come onto the court every night and play,
so that's just one thing he knows,'' Payton said. ``I'm not going
to create problems, I'm not going to create none of that. I'm not
going to be the kind of guy where I'm always loud and always
disturbing the plane and stuff like that. I'm going to have fun
sometimes, but he is not going to have to worry about me too
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal doesn't think so, either. He's not going to dictate
Payton's life. Payton, he said, is his own man.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL SIDEBAR/BREAKOUT)
</P>
<P>
   20 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT PAUL WESTPHAL
</P>
<P>
   1 _ An active child, Westphal earned the nickname ``Perpetual
Motion'' from his parents.
</P>
<P>
   2 _ Idolized Elgin Baylor while growing up near Los Angeles: ``A
lot of people compared me, because of physical similarities, to
Jerry West, but Baylor was always the guy I patterned myself
after.''
</P>
<P>
   3 _ His junior high basketball team sometimes played games
preceding Lakers games at the L.A. Sports Arena. One of those
Lakers games turned out to be the last of Celtics legend Bob
Cousy's career.
</P>
<P>
   4 _ The son of an aircraft designer, Westphal graduated from the
coincidentally named Aviation High School in Redondo Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   5 _ Quit a job at Baskin-Robbins 31 Flavors when the ice cream
store stopped selling his favorite flavor, boysenberry sherbet. It
was Westphal's only job during high school.
</P>
<P>
   6 _ Collected complete sets of baseball cards for three years as
a Little Leaguer, but his mother threw them all out when he
graduated high school. ``It still hurts to this day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   7 _ Toughest player for him to guard: Nate Archibald. Had the
most trouble when guarded by: Norm Van Lear.
</P>
<P>
   8 _ After retirement from NBA, took the Suns to arbitration
hearings twice, charging the club cost him incentive money by
conspiring to keep him from getting playing time. Lost both cases.
</P>
<P>
   9 _ Founded basketball program at Southwestern Bible College in
Phoenix in 1985-86; team finished 21-9 and played for championship.
</P>
<P>
   10 _ Was succeeded by his brother, Bill, at Grand Canyon College
after leading the school to the 1988 NAIA title.
</P>
<P>
   11 _ Jersey No. 44 was retired by Phoenix Suns in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   12 _ Pulled a different kind of ``Chris Webber'' in the famous
Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals vs. Boston. With his Suns down by one
late in the fourth quarter, Westphal deliberately called a sixth
timeout, even though his team had none. The technical foul put
Phoenix down two, but under old rules, the Suns got the ball at
halfcourt. That put Gar Heard in position for a last-second shot
that fell, sending the game into double overtime. (Suns lost in
third OT.)
</P>
<P>
   13 _ Seventeen years later, enjoyed another fine Game 5 as Suns'
head coach. After hearing the Bulls urging fans to safely celebrate
their pending championship, Westphal strode into the Phoenix locker
room and wrote ``Save The City'' on the black board. The Suns, down
three games to one, beat Chicago to send the series back home.
</P>
<P>
   14 _ Gary Payton isn't the only Sonic who knows TV commercials.
As Suns coach, Westphal was featured in a popular ``Whataburger''
TV ad with his mother, Ruth. They argued over who makes the better
burger _ Whataburger or Mom.
</P>
<P>
   15 _ Non-basketball fantasy is to hit a home run in the major
leagues: ``Nothing feels better than a home run. It's probably the
best thing to do in sports.
</P>
<P>
   16 _ Wife Cindy and he sponsored friend Steve Jones in his first
year on the PGA Tour, ``keeping him out there until he made enough
money to keep himself out there.''
</P>
<P>
   17 _ While away from NBA coaching, wrote a book of stories he's
gathered through his years in basketball, patterned after Harvey
Pennick's ``Little Red Book of Golf.'' Book hasn't been published,
but Westphal says, ``I really like it.''
</P>
<P>
   18 _ Took a two-week family vacation to Israel in 1997, doing
color commentary on the NBA playoffs for an Israeli TV station.
</P>
<P>
   19 _ Was a volunteer assistant basketball coach for a year at
son Michael's Chaparral High School team in Scottsdale, Ariz.
Michael is a walk-on at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   20 _ Is good friends with conservative commentator Rush
Limbaugh, and wants Limbaugh's critics to give him equal time: ``He
can defend his positions, but he can't defend people calling him
names. Not that I agree with everything, either _ I don't cast
myself as a political guy _ but it's only fair to listen to what
somebody says before you call him names.''

BOSTON COLLEGE MAKES SETON HALL SECOND STRAIGHT VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-SETON HALL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Tuesday night's Big East matchup against Seton Hall,
Boston College coach Al Skinner told his young players that the
Pirates, who limped into Conte Forum looking to snap a four-game
losing streak, would likely regard the 13th-place Eagles as ``the
pill that would cure everybody's ills.''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall, however, found no such relief.
</P>
<P>
   BC pinned the Pirates with another Excedrin headache, taking an
81-66 decision before an ESPN2 audience and a crowd of 2,734. It
was the second straight win for BC (5-14, 2-9), which snapped an
eight-game skid with its first conference victory of the season
last Wednesday against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, the Eagles ``are accustomed to being
successful,'' Skinner said. ``Now they're starting to feel success,
and as Kenny Harley said in the locker room afterward, `This is the
way it's supposed to be.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that they've come to expect, and it's something
that they've been working towards.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than a week, the Eagles have gone from a team simply
hoping to win its first conference game to a confident group ``that
knows we can win our next conference game, against West Virginia
Saturday,'' said freshman forward Kenny Walls, who led four BC
players in double figures with 24 points on 7-for-12 shooting in
just his second career start.
</P>
<P>
   Harley chipped in 17 points on 6-for-9 shooting, while Michael
Cotton added 12. Jonathan Beerbohm came off the bench to score 11
points before spraining his left ankle late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence is getting there,'' Walls said. ``We know we
can win some basketball games in the Big East if we just play
defense for 40 minutes. Earlier in the season, the reason we were
0-9 was that we weren't playing 40 minutes of basketball. Tonight
we played 40 minutes of basketball, and if we continue to do that,
we'll to be successful _ no matter how young we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls knew it was going to be his night when he knocked down
back-to-back 3-pointers, sparking an early 14-2 run that gave BC a
16-6 lead. The Eagles had a sizzling start, hitting nine of their
first 10 shots, to streak to a 22-11 lead but cooled off
considerably by making only five of their last 15 shots in the half
to control a tenuous 34-33 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our drought that continues for our team and our program,
I'm very disappointed with the way our kids played defense,'' said
Seton Hall coach Tommy Amaker, whose team (11-10, 5-7) got a
career-high 24 points from Rimas Kaukenas. ``You've got to give
credit to Boston College for their (54 percent) shooting. We shot
over 40 percent (for the first time in seven games), but our
defense was lousy. Kenny was tremendous with the shots he was
making for threes.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls knocked down a trey that sparked a 10-2 run at the start
of the second half. After the Eagles thrice increased the lead to
10 (48-38, 50-40, and 52-42), Beerbohm threw down a dunk to make it
54-42. BC then went on a decisive 16-6 run _ Walls scored 8 on a
pair of 3-pointers and a jumper _ to put the game out of reach,
70-50, with 3:25 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles just might climb out of the cellar before too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not overly concerned with the place that we're in,''
Skinner said. ``We've still got a lot more to go. There's a lot
more games to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, there's not much difference between 13th,
12th, or 11th, as far as I'm concerned. But what I am concerned
about is how we compete and how we play. Right now we may be 13th,
but we're not playing like a 13th-place team.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Seton Hall and Notre Dame.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A collection of lawyers and accountants, petty owners and
petulant players, all greedy and myopic beyond belief, denied us
all the best hoops action on Earth for six unbearable months.
</P>
<P>
   They gave us posturing instead of post-ups, drivel in place of
dribbles, bickering instead of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the powers that run the NBA gave fans probably $2
billion worth of reasons why they should tune out what's left of
the season. And reason No. 2,000,000,001 came when Michael Jordan
retired.
</P>
<P>
   But the season opens Friday night, and rest assured, you will be
back anyway. In part because to be a fan is to be a born sucker. We
can't help ourselves but to return to baseball parks and basketball
arenas anymore than we can turn away from the umpteenth televised
freeway chase.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this basketball season will provide so much more. For
the fence-sitters out there, for the ones pouting over the lockout,
you have our empathy and understanding. But here's why you should,
and will, come back to the game:
</P>
<P>
   __ No MJ. As much as Jordan meant to the game, his retirement
brings back the suspense of the season. The Bulls are gone and the
void could be filled by any number of successors, from the Lakers
to the Jazz to the Pacers to the Rockets to the Knicks to the
Sonics to the Nets. That competition is good for the game.
</P>
<P>
   __ The 50-game season. Face it, 82 games is too many, and most
fans readily admit they don't really pay attention until February
anyway. The compacted schedule will be fast and furious, with teams
playing three straight nights and five games in a week. There will
be no shortage of intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   __ Larry Bird's Pacers. Want to see the good guys finally win
one? The guys who win not on talent but on hard work and dedication
and teamwork? Jump on the Indiana bandwagon and watch the only team
that had 11 players practice together throughout the lockout
steamroll over the league's slackers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Latrell Sprewell's Knicks. For pure entertainment, how can
you beat a group that includes the foot-in-mouth union president
(Patrick Ewing), the man poised to steal Ewing's role as No. 1
scoring option (Allan Houston), the guy who suffered a
profanity-laced meltdown while addressing a group of children
(Dennis Scott) and of course, the coach-choker (Sprewell)?
</P>
<P>
   __ Kobe's comeuppance. Bryant, the Lakers' young star, is poised
to become a dominant force, even if he's coming off the bench. And
by the end of the season, it might be difficult to keep him out of
the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   __ George's genius. George Karl tamed Gary Payton and made the
Sonics perennial contenders, and he's inheriting a Milwaukee Bucks
squad with enough talent to become a darkhorse favorite in the
East, with a lineup featuring Terrell Brandon, Ray Allen and Glenn
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Malone's make-up with Utah. The Jazz star renounced his team
during the lockout, then made a tearful return and might well cap
off all this soap-opera drama with a storybook ending, a
championship in June.
</P>
<P>
   __ Nice-guy Nets. Jayson Williams wasn't only one of the top
voices of reason during the lockout, he was also the only player we
know of who donated thousands of dollars to workers at Continental
Airlines Arena, a small but genuine form of apology for the havoc
the players and owners caused. Williams and fellow nice guy Keith
Van Horn also form the backbone of one of the league's
up-and-coming contenders.
</P>
<P>
   __ Top 50 reunion. Clyde Drexler retired and Scottie Pippen took
his place on the Houston roster, giving the Rockets another
three-man core of NBA-top-50 players with Hakeem Olajuwon and
Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sacramento vs. Denver. Not that anyone wants to watch the
Kings play the Nuggets, but there will be a season-long battle for
most improved status among these two perennial dogs. Each helped
itself immensely in the offseason, the Kings getting Chris Webber
and Vlade Divac, the Nuggets landing Nick Van Exel and Antonio
McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   __ And finally . . . inclement weather. A single snowstorm could
throw Shaq-sized wrenches into the NBA's rewritten, airtight,
no-room-for-error schedule, and simple karma guarantees it will
happen. Watch the folks at NBA headquarters in New York become
Weather Channel addicts, and then watch them go postal when a
mid-February blizzard snows out the Midwest.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Antoine Carr, whom the Rockets acquired to back up Hakeem Olajuwon,
will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right knee today and will
miss the next two to three weeks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Left with few alternatives, sources said Tuesday the Rockets
will pursue free-agent forward Dennis Rodman, who has played on
five NBA championship teams _ two in Detroit (1989 and 1990) and
three with the Chicago Bulls (1996-98).
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, 37, a Dallas native, has led the NBA in rebounding the
past seven years, a league record. He averaged 15 rebounds per game
last season while playing in 80 games for the Bulls, the most games
he had played since the 1991-92 season, when he was with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman has led the league in offensive rebounding six of the
past eight years, averaging 5.3 offensive boards last season. He
played 2,856 minutes last season, his highest total since 1993-94,
when he was with San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who recently fired his agent, Dwight Manley, could not
be reached for comment. He had been rumored to be heading to Miami,
but Heat coach Pat Riley said Monday night that Rodman would be
``better off in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a veteran team; Scottie (Pippen) knows him,'' Riley
said. ``(Charles) Barkley understands him. It's a very, very
experienced, veteran team.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Rockets agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would definitely help us,'' said one Rocket, preferring to
remain anonymous. ``With Dennis, Charles and Dream (Olajuwon), we'd
get two and three shots every trip downcourt. That's how many
offensive boards we'd be getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman and Stanley Roberts, who has battled weight problems his
entire career, were the only big men of note available.
</P>
<P>
   Carr's injury forced the Rockets to look elsewhere for help.
Carr, 37, who has a medial plica, a fold of tissue in the knee
similar to what Olajuwon endured last season, was supposed to give
the Rockets an experienced big body (a 6-9, 272-pound 14-year
veteran) who can play defense, hit the boards and set rock-hard
picks for the shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to play on it (at Tuesday's practice),'' said Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich of Carr. ``He was out there for a while, but
he just couldn't be himself. He couldn't make his moves without
some pain. So we feel the best thing is to go and get this thing
fixed now and have him for a portion of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it hurts us. I never really got into a real good feel
with him, because he got hurt early and he wasn't able to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he was here, I really loved the effect he had on the
team, and it will be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how long before Carr is ready to contribute,
Tomjanovich just rolled his eyes and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking the wrong guy,'' he said. ``I just do the X's
and O's.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but after all the injuries they've had over the past two
seasons, everyone assumed Tomjanovich was the basketball equivalent
of Marcus Welby. But if there's one area where Tomjanovich would
rate as an expert, it's filling the holes created by those
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Carr's is the second serious injury to hit the Rockets this
season. Second-year swingman Rodrick Rhodes tore a right pectoral
tendon while lifting weights. After undergoing surgery last month,
Rhodes does his rehabilitation work every day and is about five
weeks away from returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going great,'' Rhodes said. ``The scarring in my muscle
is healing fast. Everything's looking good. They (the doctors) like
the progress. I've been working hard just trying to stay in
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The time away is distressing to Rhodes, who would love nothing
more than to be on the court, learning from Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is killing me,'' Rhodes said. ``I have a hard time even
watching it. You feel like an outcast because you see the whole
team doing one thing and you're doing another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though you know you're injured, you still feel like an
outsider. It's the competitiveness that makes you want to do stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do little things to occupy my time _ I work out while
they practice, or I try to get iced. Yeah, it's that hard to watch.
But the addition of Scottie, that makes me want to watch because
he's one of the top 50 players. I try to watch him to see how he
goes about his business and how he handles things.''
</P>
<P>
   What Rhodes sees, in the glimpses he manages when he's up to it,
is a player he thinks will help his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt,'' Rhodes said. ``That's another thing. With Scottie,
you can't relax in practice. He brings intensity to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good work ethic, so every day he comes to practice
with a lot of energy. He's a high-energy guy, he's competitive and
he likes to practice, so that makes you have to go harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's not just the big games that get you up, it's an
every-day thing for me because I've got Scottie to go up against. I
think he'll make me a great player in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, you want to test your talent against the best.
That's when I'm at my best, when my back is against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``And also, when you have to compete against great players, they
make you compete better. You're so nervous and want to get
everything in detail that you want to play a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes said the Rockets will be all that much stronger when he
and Carr return to the active list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make my presence felt,'' Rhodes said. ``I have
to, to establish myself on the team and to get the confidence of my
teammates back. You start to get into a rhythm with the guys you're
playing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I'm not out there getting the rhythm and getting
accustomed to certain guys, I have to come back and establish
myself. Whatever they want to mold me into, I'm going to do that.''

SEND in the clowns.
</P>
<P>
   And the juggler and the fire eater and the sword swallower and
the human cannonball and the trapeze artists.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the bearded lady. The Rockets may already have one
eye on her twin sister in Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   As Friday's hurry-up season opener against the Lakers nears, the
air is filled with the sounds of a calliope. Will that be an NBA
championship contender that takes the floor at the Great Western
Forum? Or a circus?
</P>
<P>
   If necessity is indeed the mother of invention, then crisis is
most certainly the stork that delivers desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what dropped down the Rockets' chimney Tuesday when
they got the word that Antoine Carr's right knee will require
surgery and force him to miss as much as the first three weeks of
the season. In this compressed 50-games-in-90-days schedule, that
is possibly one-fourth of the season for a 37-year-old who does not
know the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Mix in the fact the remaining backup widebodies are a pair of
newcomer journeymen in Pig Miller and John Coker with the idea that
contenders are putting heavy emphasis on getting out to a healthy,
fast start _ figuring home-court advantage in the playoffs can be
won or lost in the first weeks _ and the cause for alarm is
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, tentative feelers go out to Mars or Jupiter or the
headquarters of World Championship Wrestling for the only player in
NBA history with the qualifications to appear on the covers of both
Sports Illustrated and Modern Bride.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it is still only talk. But Rodman told a
newspaper in South Florida on Tuesday that if he plays this season,
it will be for either the Rockets or the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic that after years of trying to beat the Chicago Bulls,
the Rockets may actually try to become them. First Scottie Pippen,
now Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   What will we call this Bulls-Rockets hybrid _ the Buckets? Will
orange hair become the rage in Houston? Will Mayor Lee Brown get
his tongue pierced? Or willeven the wedding-gown-,
leather-skirt-,feather-boa-, dog-collar-wearing Rodman decide the
Rockets' pajama-striped uniforms are an affront to good taste and
cast his lot in LA?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Rodman from the Lakers, where he would make a formidable
frontcourt partner for Shaquille O'Neal, is one reason to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   The other is, of course, his ability. Rodman is a voracious
rebounder, a smothering defender who moves well without the ball,
and a great passer, a talent that often goes unnoticed but would
fit well into coach Rudy Tomjanovich's half-court offense.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because of the compact, grueling schedule, Charles Barkley
has said he likely won't be at his best in every game. With a
player of Rodman's stature on hand, Barkley might feel less
pressure to push on when he's hurt or fatigued and therefore might
not break down before the playoffs. Those occasions would give
Rodman a chance to stand out, which is what the phenomenon of
``Rodzilla'' is all about, frequently to excess.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dennis is on the court, he's cool,'' Pippen said.
``Getting him there is a problem sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The question: How much of their core beliefs are the Rockets
willing to sell off for a third championship?
</P>
<P>
   Remember their motto from the 1995 campaign: ``Be hungry, stay
humble.'' Does that remotely sound like Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   This is not a blue-nosed screed against body piercing and
tattoos. It is merely a reminder that Rodman's kicking of
cameramen, goonish mugging of opponents and referee-baiting make a
mockery of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Word is Rodman ruled out signing with Miami because Heat coach
Pat Riley was going to make him toe the line, be punctual for
practice and actually show up for the start of all games. The
thinking is that Rudy T, known as more of a player's coach, would
be tolerant of a few idiosyncrasies, as long as Rodman performs.
Tomjanovich did, after all, have gun-brandishing Vernon Maxwell as
a starter on the 1994 title team.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of Leslie Alexander, it would seem to be
another case of the team owner doing whatever it takes to give the
fans a winner. But there is a line where you can cross into
Steinbrennerism, trying to buy a title.
</P>
<P>
   In matters of chemistry, homemade explosives can be dangerous,
especially in regard to the sensitivity of Hakeem Olajuwon. He did
not at all like the constant bickering between Barkley and Clyde
Drexler the past two years. So it's hard to imagine his being
comfortable as part of a carny sideshow the third, fourth and fifth
times Rodman goes bonkers.
</P>
<P>
   Hurry! Hurry! Step right up!
</P>
<P>
   But at what price the clown show?

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
HONOLULU _ Walter Payton, the NFL's all-time rushing leader and a
member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, came forward Tuesday with
the shocking news he needs a liver transplant.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Payton, 44, is suffering from a rare disease, primary sclerosing
cholangitis, that blocks the bile ducts in the liver. Patients in
his condition have a two-year survival rate without a transplant.
Payton is on a transplant list and will get no preferential
treatment over less famous patients, according to his doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm still healthy, even though I look like I've
lost a lot of weight,'' Payton said at a news conference outside
Chicago during which he broke into tears. ``To the people that
really care about me, just continue praying.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who rushed for 16,726 yards and won a Super Bowl during
a 13-year career with the Chicago Bears, called a news conference
to reveal his disease because of speculation about his health.
</P>
<P>
   When his son, Jarrett Payton, announced last week at a news
conference that he would play football at the University of Miami,
his father appeared ill, prompting the speculation about his weight
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get everything straight before things got bad,''
said the elder Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Lagattuta, one of Payton's physicians, says the
disease is so rare that only about three of every 100,000 people
suffer from it. With a transplant, Lagattuta said, the one-year
survival rate is ``88 percent'' and long-term survival is ``very
promising.'' He said most transplant patients return to a normal
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was scared, Payton snapped: ``Am I scared? Hell,
yeah, I'm scared. Wouldn't you be scared? What can you do? It's not
in my hands anymore; it's in God's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pro Bowl practices in Honolulu, players from the AFC and
NFC were stunned by Payton's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie was Payton's teammate with the
Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter's the guy who took me under his wing when I came to
Chicago,'' Flutie said. ``I threw my first NFL touchdown pass to
Walter. In a tough situation there, he was a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to him. I wish the best for him and his
family. He's a competitor. He'll come through it. I'm praying for
him and keeping my fingers crossed. Everyone's pulling for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just goes to show that no one's exempt from illness. No
matter how much money you make or how successful you are, no one
ever has the world by the tail. Walter's a fighter, and I'm sure
he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Bruce Smith, Flutie's teammate in Buffalo, is a
14-year veteran who played against Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him personally,'' Smith said of Payton. ``I think he's
a wonderful individual who meant so much to this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to God there's a way he can get this transplant and get
it in a hurry and live the rest of his life in a normal and active
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Payton's liver disease isn't caused by alcohol,
steroids, hepatitis or any kind of immunodeficiency disease.
Symptoms are chronic fatigue and a yellowing in the pigment of the
eyes and skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always respected Walter, and my thoughts and prayers are
with him,'' said Green Bay defensive end Reggie White. ``I hope his
doctors can save him. I know God is watching out for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton, Chicago's No. 1 pick out of Jackson State in 1975,
retired after the 1987 season. He was enshrined in the Pro Football
Hall of Fame in 1993 and named to the Bears' board of directors in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Payton thought he had problems with his gall bladder
and underwent a series of tests. He was diagnosed two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lagattuta said Payton has significant bile-duct blockage. To aid
his digestion and give him adequate nutrition, a plastic tube was
surgically inserted in the vessel that carries bile from the liver
to the intestines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing _ I can eat anything I want, as much as I want,
and I still can't gain any weight,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   In his final season with the Bears in 1987, the 5-11 Payton was
listed at 202 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much he weighed now, Payton wouldn't say.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he replied: ``You want to pick me up?''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Oilers running back Eddie George grew up idolizing
Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows that everybody's vulnerable, that no man is
untouchable,'' George said. ``Walter was a great player who's meant
so much to the game. He's a strong and determined man, and I'm sure
he'll get the transplant he needs and pull through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Arizona Cardinals cornerback Aeneas Williams: ``We're
praying for Walter and his family, and I know the Lord is watching
over him. Walter was such a great player and a great man. I pray
that he gets the transplant as soon as possible and everything is
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who resides in South Barrington, Ill., a wealthy Chicago
suburb, is involved in a number of businesses. He continues to
endorse products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction is a Bob Marley lyric _ `Even the biggest
man was once a baby,''' Seattle Seahawks linebacker Chad Brown
said. ``It shows that no matter how great your accomplishments are
on the field, you're not invincible.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction to hearing about Walter's illness is that we
should live our lives like it's the last day, because we never know
when our last day is going to be. I'm sure he'll be fine, but it
shows you should live your life to the fullest, because you just
never know what's going to happen.''

   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Last year he was the only nonstarting

Los Angeles Lakers, he is again slotted to come off the bench.
Eddie Jones has a lock on shooting guard. Rick Fox is entrenched at
small forward. And coach Del Harris has scrapped the idea of
rotating the three players as starters.
</P>
<P>
   So Bryant waits.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' precocious superstar-in-waiting won't pout, though.
He'll just issue warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can do. I just have to be patient, wait
until my turn, and when I get my turn, I'm going to explode,'' he
said, then laughed, then repeated, ``I just have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Bryant wasn't thrilled with the three-man rotation
idea, even though its main purpose was to get him into the starting
lineup on a semiregular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, once you throw me in there, throw me in there
(as a permanent starter),'' he said. ``I think having that rotation
kind of just threw everybody off balance. . . . You can't please
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bryant's sixth-man role has been in any way
insignificant. He was sixth on the Lakers in average minutes played
with 26, only four minutes per game fewer than starting forward
Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   And Bryant's scoring average, 15.4 points per game, was the
highest among nonstarters in the NBA. Remaining in that role offers
a familiarity of routine, but it also poses a nightly challenge as
he subs at three positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have starter status, you pretty much know what your
matchup is gonna be. You know who you're gonna guard,'' Bryant
said. ``Last year, coming off the bench I didn't know who I'm
coming into the game for, so you really have to study three
different game plans. . . . Starting is definitely more
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   He figures he'll have that chance soon enough. Bryant's due to
make $9 million next season, the first of his new six-year
contract, and it's a pretty sure bet he'll be playing the minutes
to earn it by then. But he admits disappointment over his continued
second-team status.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know me, man. I'm ready to go. That's what I worked all
summer long for,'' he said. ``But I'm always an optimistic person.
Everything happens for a reason. If it's not meant to happen this
year, all it does is give me another year to prepare. Simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So one more season on the bench won't kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Joked Bryant, ``It's a shortened season anyway.''
</P>
<P>

as the Lakers held a four-quarter intrasquad scrimmage for a
private audience Tuesday night at the Forum.

GARCIA PROVIDES KEY HIT IN PEPPERDINE VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tony Garcia insists he's American of Cuban
descent, yet his Pepperdine baseball teammates like to kid him
about his heritage.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Garcia was born in Cuba but has lived in the
United States since age 3. He hasn't returned since but feels pride
whenever a Cuban baseball player defects or succeeds in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Cuban and you don't play baseball, you're kind of
weird,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He knows all about Rey Ordonez, Livan Hernandez and Orlando
Hernandez. He would like to be the next great Cuban player, but for
now he's happy to be a freshman starting for the Waves.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth game, he helped his team remain undefeated with
the game-winning double in the eighth inning that gave Pepperdine
an 8-6 victory over UCLA Tuesday at Jackie Robinson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine is 4-0 for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Although Garcia is a freshman, he's hardly inexperienced. His
family is as baseball-mad as any other Cuban family. His
grandfather played semipro in Cuba before getting hurt, and his
father played in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The family arrived in Miami via Mexico 15 years ago with its
baseball passions intact. Garcia moved to Temecula for high school
and was good enough to be the USA captain on the under-14 team that
played in the 1996 Pan-American Games in Brazil. He also played on
the under-16 team two years later in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at Pepperdine, which he chose over USC and Arizona
State, his teammates teased him aboutbeing Cuban. To get back at
them, he listed in his bio it would be his dream to return to Cuba
and work in the sugar-cane fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be anyone's goal,'' he said. ``It's hard to be a
baseball player in Cuba. Castro, nobody likes, but he puts a guilt
trip on you. If you want to leave, you're seen as a traitor. I
encourage every Cuban to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's winning hit came in the eighth inning after UCLA (2-4)
tied the score at 6 half an inning before. Damon Katz singled and
took third on a throwing error, bringing the infield in. Garcia
doubled down the left-field line off reliever Bobby Roe (0-2) to
give the Waves a 7-6 lead. He later scored on a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Reed (1-0), Pepperdine's third pitcher, won in relief going
12/3 innings. Jay Gehrke pitched the ninth for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for 14 walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching has got to come through more,'' said UCLA right
fielder Brian Baron, a Hart graduate who transferred from
Northwestern. He started in right field and went 1 for 4 with a run
scored and a catch at the wall. ``You're not going to hit every
game, but your pitching and defense have to be consistent.''

OLOWOKANDI DELIVERS _ SORT OF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Olowokandi participated in his first
Tinseltown dress rehearsal at the Sports Arena on Tuesday and
delivered the seemingly forgettable line of 11 points and 12
rebounds in 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the message might be more important than the production
values.
</P>
<P>
   During the Clippers' free-to-the-public, split-squad scrimmage,
the 7-foot rookie demonstrated an abundance of quickness, fancy
low-post footwork and a willingness to mix it up on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too bad,'' said Olowokandi, the first pick in last
year's NBA Draft. ``Right now, I'm doing the best I can, and I'm
gradually adjusting and getting used to it. I'm just trying to help
make this team better.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't seem to be a problem, although first-year coach Chris
Ford is preaching patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot to learn,'' said Ford, ``but he's getting along
pretty well. Michael's just going to have to learn how to adjust
his game. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael will learn from his mistakes, and that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Thriving: According to franchise watchdogs, Olowokandi is
thriving and surviving, on the court and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will do well,'' said Ford in a point-blank answer to those
who already have judged the NBA's top pick to be a bust based on
low numbers and shaky circumstances during his six-game tour of
Europe. ``Allow the kid time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's starting to fit in. He's shown he's a tough guy and he's
been moving right along. He's demonstrated that he can do
everything people have been saying he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   So, after three full workouts, the reviews from coaches and
teammates are in: If you see only one rookie center this year,
check out the 7-footer from Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think he's going to be great for our team,'' said
Clippers forward Maurice Taylor, who was earning similar praise as
a rookie last season. ``It's good to have a big body out there to
watch your back.''
</P>
<P>
   __ And now, the bad news: Rookie power forward Brian Skinner
will undergo an arthroscopic examination to repair possible damage
to the lateral meniscus ligament of his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Baylor star, selected with the 22nd pick in the first
round, averaged 2 points and 6 rebounds in last weekend's
exhibition games against the Lakers.

TEKELEC GAINS FAIL TO SATISFY INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Telecommunications equipment maker Tekelec
disappointed investors Tuesday with quarterly earnings well below
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of network equipment and diagnostic tools reported
earnings of $13.8 million, or 16 cents per share, for October,
November and December. That was well above the $8.9 million earned
in the same quarter a year ago. But it was 15 percent below a mean
estimate of 19 cents per share from five analysts surveyed by First
Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not what we were expecting,'' said analyst Brian Modoff
at BT Alex Brown in San Francisco. Modoff said there had been no
indication from Tekelec officials before the report that it would
be so far off estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that lower your confidence? Yes,'' Modoff said.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts after the release of its
earnings report, Tekelec blamed the fact that several anticipated
sales did not go through for fourth-quarter performance weaker than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Though Tekelec made its report after the close of trading, its
stock still fell more than 6 percent Tuesday, despite the fact it
also announced a new contract with U.S. West worth an estimated $5
million to $6 million. Tekelec shares closed at $21.875, down
$1.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec performed better for the year, earning $39.2 million, or
59 cents per share. Analysts had expected annual earnings of 60
cents per share. Revenues for the year totaled $176.6 million,
including $49.1 million in the final three months.
</P>
<P>
   Though a supplier of telecom network equipment to small and
newcomer phone companies for much of the 1990s, Tekelec in the last
year has emerged as a growing favorite among big players, too. In
addition to the U.S. West deal, the company has recently penned
deals with Sprint and Bell Atlantic.

DAILY NEWS FILLS NEW GM POST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Daily News of Los Angeles announced Tuesday
that veteran Southern California newspaper advertising executive
Bob Gray has been appointed to the newly created post of general
manager, effective March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment was made by Ike Massey, publisher of the Daily
News and president and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles
Newspaper Group, who said, ``Bob Gray has great experience in
sales, marketing and circulation in addition to a keen grasp of
newspaper operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, 48, will handle day-to-day business functions of the Daily
News, including advertising, marketing, circulation, production and
finance. The news and editorial departments of the Daily News will
continue to report to Massey.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1998, Gray has been advertising director and
assistant to the publisher of the Long Beach Press-Telegram, which
is a member of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group. Gray previously
held a number of advertising management positions for many years at
the Riverside Press-Enterprise and at Cox Publications in Phoenix.
Earlier in his career, Gray held circulation supervisory positions
with the Riverside newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working with the employees of the Daily News
and continuing the tradition that has exemplified them as one of
the leading newspapers in the industry,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Daily News and the Press-Telegram, the Los
Angeles Newspaper Group is composed of the San Gabriel Valley
Tribune, the Whittier Daily News and the Pasadena Star-News. Last
month it was announced that the Donrey Media newspapers in Southern
California, including the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin in Ontario,
will merge with the Los Angeles Newspaper Group.
</P>
<P>
   Massey said Gray's appointment will allow him to continue to
oversee the Daily News as publisher as well as to work on the
growing Los Angeles Newspaper Group operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased to be able to have someone the caliber of Bob Gray
available for promotion within our group,'' Massey said. ``This
will give me more time and freedom to work more with our
ever-expanding cluster of newspapers in Southern California.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray and his family moved from Michigan to California 40 years
ago, when he was 8. He and his wife, Faith, have three children.

 ENTERTAINMENT SUMMARY No 419 - February 3, 1999

<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT SUMMARY -- No. 419 -- Feb. 3, 1999 We are offering
the following articles for sale. Please contact us for availability
your country. Best regards, Karl Horwitz
</P>
<P>
   1. JEREMY DAVIES : MILD AT HEART Jeremy Davies, who may get an
Oscar nomination for his role in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' is a
modest, low-key actor who takes Hollywood stardom in stride.
Interview by Jessica Kerwin. From W Magazine. 800 words + photo. 2.
LAURA DERN : BORN TO ACT Laura Dern has been in movies since
literally before she was born - her mother, actress Diane Ladd, was
pregnant with her in the biker movie ``Rebel Rousers'' (1970) - and
the former Oscar nominee is considered one of her generation's best
actresses. Her latest film, ``October Sky,'' opens soon. Dern talks
about the new film, her acting talent, why her parents (Bruce Dern
and Diane Ladd) opposed her wish to be an actress and how she got
together with her current boyfriend, actor/director Billy Bob
Thornton. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo. 3. HIP-HOP'S
TIPTOP Compared with rock 'n roll, jazz and salsa, hip-hop is a
baby, just over 20 years old. But a look at the Billboard charts
makes it clear that hip-hop reigns. On any given week, it
dominates, with at least four albums in the Top 10. It's no longer
music of the underground. Many predict 1999 will be the year that
rap and hip-hop explode, snatching the music industry's limelight,
as it expands with more artists, more producers ... and more fans.
The list of successful hip-hoppers would fill pages; this article
narrows down the most talked-about contemporaries so you know
exactly who's who. By Cindy Rodriguez. From The Boston Globe. 1,500
words + photo. 4. FOR WILLIE NELSON, ALL ROADS LEAD TO MUSIC At 65,
singer Willie Nelson is as busy as he's ever been. Besides a hot
new album - ``Theatro'' - he's also busy with charitable endeavours
on behalf of the Campaign for a Landmine Free World and his own
group, Farm Aid. And he's keeping up a tour schedule that would
wear down plenty of much-younger musicians. Nelson talks about his
new album, the roots of his music, how he balances music with
activism and why the boy who grew up on a farm is now the singer
who fights hardest to preserve family farms. By J. Poet. 1,300
words + photo. 5. THE RISING TIDE OF 'DAWSON'S CREEK' ``Dawson's
Creek'' is the hottest thing in teen television. Simon Houpt
explores why as he visits the show's North Carolina set, watches a
hot love scene being filmed and talks with stars James Van Der
Beek, Katie Holmes, Michelle Williams and Joshua Jackson about the
series, writer/executive producer Kevin Williamson, sex scenes and
why no one can kiss Van Der Beek without laughing. By Simon Houpt.
From TV Guide Canada. 1,300 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
JORDANA BREWSTER TAKES ON THE '60s It's difficult for someone born
in 1980 to understand what the turbulent 1960s were all about, but
Jordana Brewster has a better idea than most, after starring in
NBC's epic miniseries ``The 60s.'' Brewster, who also stars in the
current film ``The Faculty,'' talks about the mini-series, why she
postponed her first semester at Yale to make it, what she learned
in her three years as Nikki Munson on ``As The World Turns,'' and
how the music of Bob Dylan helped her to understand life in the
1960s. By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
THE SIXTIES ARE BACK The '60s are back. But relax - it's only on
TV. It was probably inevitable : The baby boom generation are now
running the world. They are also producing its movies and
television, and the '60s for them was the best of times. Says Lynda
Obst, producer of the four-hour TV mini-series ``The Sixties,''
``The music that gave tempo to that decade, the community that was
forged at that time, the values that were stirred up at that time
still live with us, and inside all of us.'' She's not alone. Other
'60s projects are coming up. By Ivor Davis. 1,000 words + photos.
(Not available in Great Britain and Australia.) 8. GIRL INTERRUPTED
AT HER MUSIC By the time she was a year old, Amy Marcy Cheney could
hum 40 tunes accurately in key. Finally permitted to play her
mother's piano when she was 4, Amy immediately played her favourite
tunes, aptly harmonized, picked out bass accompaniments to any
melody and also made up original pieces in her head, without
recourse to a keyboard. Simmering just below the surface of
Adrienne Fried Block's biography of America's first notable female
composer (''Passionate Victorian : The Life and Work of an American
Composer, 1867-1944,) is the profoundly disquieting question : If
this prodigiously gifted person had had the nurture and the
opportunities to explore that Mozart had, might she have
accomplished as much? By Lawson Taitte. From The New York Times
Book Review. 1,300 words. Please fax to Paris 33.1.47.42.80.44 or
33.1.47.42.18.81 I am interested in story no. ______ from summary

 &HT;    Delphi's ancestor Delco was truly born in a barn
 &HT;    By Benjamin Kline
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For all its sleek lines and curves, gleaming
paint and plush interiors, onboard computers and music systems, the
automobile is still pretty much what the motor car was 90 years ago
when Delco, the ancestor of today's Delphi, was born in a barn in
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   It's a conglomeration of parts. And some of the most important
parts were developed and made here.
</P>
<P>
   Charles F. Kettering and Edward A. Deeds incorporated the Dayton
Engineering Laboratories Co. on July 22, 1909 with capital stock of
$150,000. The company name, suggested by their colleague William A.
Chryst, soon was being shortened to D.E.L.Co. The first three
letters are preserved in the modern Delphi, which is being spun off
by General Motors Corp. this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kettering, a near-sighted young electrical engineering graduate
from Ohio State, had come to Dayton in 1904 to work in the
inventions department at National Cash Register Co. The invitation
came from Deeds, the plant superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Deeds had been tinkering with a motor to replace the crank on
cash registers. He needed someone to take over the project.
Kettering accepted the job and the two men clicked.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they were moonlighting in the hayloft of Deeds' carriage
barn, behind his house at 319 Central Ave., where he and a mechanic
had built a car they called the Suburban Sixty. The informal group
of 12 men that grew from their partnership became known as the
``Barn Gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first success was an electrical spark ignition system that
Kettering and Deeds sold to Henry M. Leland of Cadillac Motor Car
Co. for the 1910 model. The sale of 5,000 units forced them into
manufacturing, with rented space in the Beaver Power Building,
still standing at East Fourth and St. Clair streets. The slogan:
``Nothing on the dashboard but the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Kettering's next success was the electrical self starter for the
1912 Cadillac, followed almost simultaneously with electric
lighting for automobiles. Soon Delco had grown to 1,200 employees,
mostly in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The company became the first General Motors Dayton division in
1918. It has mainly descended through the years as Delco Products,
but with other historical branches on the family tree, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Delco Remy Division, Anderson Ind., founded in 1896.
</P>
<P>
   _ A.C. Spark Plug Division, Flint, Mich., 1908.
</P>
<P>
   _ Delco Appliance/Rochester Coil Co., Rochester, N.Y., 1908.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inland Division, formerly Dayton Wright Airplane Co., 1923.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sphinx Manufacturing Co., Birmingham, England, 1898.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Delphi starts out as a huge organization doing business
globally, a far cry from the ``Barn Gang.''
</P>
<P>
   In the uncertainties of a harsh and competitive world, Delphi
employees can recall what Boss Ket said about failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure is permissible,'' he said, ``just as long as it's only
temporary. The one time you don't want to fail is the last time you
try.''

 &HT;    Delphi: Company looks to Hachey for manufacturing know-how
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Guy C. Hachey, the new president of Delphi
Chassis Systems, agreed to be the subject of a newspaper profile on
one condition: no photographs of him sitting in his Kettering
office, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hardly ever in his office,'' explained Delphi spokesman
Michael McCurdy. ``More than any GM executive I've known since I've
been here, he spends an enormous amount of time on the (factory)
floor. He's trying to understand the plants.''
</P>
<P>
   He has good reason to take a close look. Those plants are key to
Delphi's future.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old native of French-speaking Quebec started with
General Motors fresh out of college as a 22-year-old foreman in
Canada's Ste. Therese assembly plant. He has been elbow-deep in
GM's manufacturing operations ever since, including managing the
Oshawa, Canada, fabrication plant and, more recently, the worldwide
manufacturing of Delphi Interior and Lighting Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Hachey holds a key position in the new Delphi corporation that
GM is expected to spin off Friday with an initial stock offering.
From his Kettering headquarters, Hachey will oversee 43 Delphi
Chassis operations in the Dayton area and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole background is in the plant,'' said Hachey (pronounced
HASH-ee). ``What I've found is that it's amazing how much you can
accomplish if you give people a chance to prove themselves. I've
met very, very few people in my career who don't want to do a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Delphi's 15,000 employees in the Dayton area are counting on
Hachey's manufacturing acumen _ and his people skills _ to steer
their newly independent operation through some rough competitive
waters. GM officials have said the spinoff will better enable
Delphi to do business with companies other than GM. But it also
will free GM to buy parts from Delphi's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As part of GM, Delphi has had its share of plant troubles here
in recent years, including a 17-day strike in 1996 among brake
plant workers and a threatened strike again this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, and remember it's been a very short period of
time, we've had very good working relations'' with Hachey, said
Gary Hill, president of United Auto Workers Local 696. ``He has
been more open with the whole work force, and he has challenged his
side of the house as well as ours to be more competitive in a
global economy. That's been the main difference from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Other union officials are more open in their praise. ``There
have been some positive changes already (in the work environment),
and we expect even more in the future,'' said Kenny Woolum,
president of the International Union of Electronic Workers Local
755, which represents 6,000 Delphi employees in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Clark, chairman of IUE Local 755, agrees. ``I think he
really wants to see the operation turn around and succeed. This is
a feeling we really didn't have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolum said Hachey made a good first impression with the union's
rank-and-file. ``When he came on board, he not only met the
officers of the local, but he also took time to come over and meet
our entire bargaining committee. He's really a very personable type
person, especially for the position that he holds.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in the small town of Charlemagne, 20 miles from
the city of Quebec, Hachey grew up speaking primarily Canadian
French, which accounts for his slightly accented English ``mostly
on longer words,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His father started out as a payroll clerk for Purina Chow in
Canada before working his way up into management. ``He was making
just $35 a week back then, and he never lets me forget that,''
Hachey said.
</P>
<P>
   Hachey was able to have his college education paid for by
gaining admission to St. Jean Military College, Canada's equivalent
of West Point. But wanting more control over his destiny following
graduation than the military would allow, he applied in his last
year and half to McGill University in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   There, on a bulletin board near the admissions office, fate
reached out: An application for GM scholarships caught his eye.
Hachey applied for and won a full ride from GM, including his
tuition and fees, his books and his first summer job.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing up the GM ladder, Hachey moved from French-speaking
Canada to upstate New York and then to Detroit _ a far bigger jolt
for Hachey and his family than his most recent move to Dayton,
where he says the people are warmer and the pace of life more
laid-back than in the Motor City.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we moved here, we must have had 15 neighbors come in with
cookies and cakes _ people who didn't know who I was or what I did.
It was just that I was a new neighbor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons of privacy, Hachey prefers not to say where he now
lives in the Dayton area with his wife, Christiane, 43, and their
two teen-age children.
</P>
<P>
   Hachey concedes that he is still in his honeymoon period with
Delphi employees, but he said there's no reason those good
relations can't continue well into the future. ``The best thing we
can do to extend the positive momentum we've got right now is to
stay ahead of the (industry) curve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hachey said there are many things both management and labor can
do to increase the company's competitiveness. They include not only
leaner, more modern plant operations ``but how we manage our
materials and our supplies . . . (and) our overhead costs,
including my salary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials declined to share that figure with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Hachey also cites the design of Delphi products as vital to the
company's success. ``You can have the best (labor-management)
relations in the world, but if you don't have a product that sells,
you're not going anywhere in today's economy.''

 &HT;    Send money along with a mentor
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One hour a week. Not much time to
educate a youngster, but when an adult spends time one-on-one
helping a child to learn, remarkable progress can occur. The
student feels valued. Learning becomes important. Someone in
authority believes he can achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush understands these dynamics. As a candidate, he visited
more than 200 schools. On Wednesday mornings, he begins his day at
Augusta Raa Middle School a few miles from the Capitol in
Tallahassee. There, in the library, before the first class of the
day, he spends an hour reviewing the homework of a 13-year-old
seventh-grader who is behind in his studies. Since the governor has
been tutoring him, the boy named Trayvon _ whom Gov. Bush describes
as ``a smart kid'' _ is already showing signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may dismiss the governor's effort as political posturing,
comparable to Gov. Chiles' walk across Florida and Gov. Graham's
workdays in varied jobs. I caution against such a response. Making
time to mentor children is a worthwhile endeavor not to be
trivialized. And, may I add, touching the lives of children with
different backgrounds is an excellent way for powerful people in
all organizations to get in touch with the reality that is Florida.
I hope other leaders in high places follow the governor's example.
</P>
<P>
   For a child at risk, a few minutes of individualized attention
can be a life-saver. Clearly, Gov. Bush, who has asked his
high-level appointees to follow his example, understands this need.
So, I wonder whether he knows many children in our public schools
never get a total of an hour per year of individualized instruction
from their teachers. Typically, such students drop further and
further behind until they drop out _ or graduate without an
education.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the monumental failure of our public schools are
many, but the main problem is that we have too many classes too
large for teachers to be effective. Class sizes, especially in
Florida's elementary and middle schools, are too large for teachers
to give students in regular classes the individualized help they
need as they struggle to master the basics. Overwhelmed by the
numbers, many teachers survive by fulfilling the requirements of
the system rather than individual needs of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Check the paper trail of written goals, progression charts and
other reports teachers must complete and file with school
administrators. (Often, this voluminous paperwork is filed away
without being read unless a school is audited.) Add to this work
lesson-plan preparation and paper correction.
</P>
<P>
   The larger a teacher's student load, the less likely the
students are to receive adequate feedback. With more students in
any given class than is reasonably possible to deal with, too many
teachers begin with hope and end in despair that children can
learn. The result is more discipline problems, more failures, more
frustration for teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to hold teachers accountable _ and we must _ they must
be given a manageable student load. That's why I urge Gov. Bush to
reconsider his tax-cut plan, though such largess is sure to have
the support of shortsighted politicians and gain favor among others
who feel no responsibility for all of our children.
</P>
<P>
   If, as Mr. Bush said during his campaign, he truly believes in
children first, he will reverse the plan announced this week to
give the biggest tax cut _ $1.2 billion _ in Florida's history.
That's twice as much in reduced taxes as the $600million increase
in the state education budget. Such a massive cut, given the needs
of our schools, is not in the best interest of our children.
</P>
<P>
   More than tax relief, we need smaller public school classes that
allow teachers adequate time to reach more than the youngsters who
automatically rise to the top of any crowd, the ones like Trayvon,
who need a guiding hand up. There are more like him than Florida
can afford to ignore.

 &HT;    The nose knows where termites lurk
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Exterminator Mark Langford says there's one
little detail you've got to remember when you use a dog to find
termites in someone's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One important thing is to walk the dog before inspections,''
said Langford, an owner of ASAP Termite Pest Control.
</P>
<P>
   Langford's termite-detecting beagle is named Woody. What else
are you going to name a termite dog? Aluminum Siding? Langford has
been using Woody for about a month to sniff out the wood-eating
bugs. He says Woody's the only termite dog in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a nose on him,'' Langford said. ``I'm going to get
him his own business cards with his picture on it that says,
'Woody, termite finder.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Woody is getting this special treatment because he's already
helped Langford land six extermination jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to keep up the pace to pay his way, though.
Langford's company has invested about $12,400 in Woody. Langford
says it cost $7,900 to have Woody trained to sniff out termites at
the Beacon Academy for dogs in Annapolis, Md. The program lasted 3
1/2 months.
</P>
<P>
   Langford also had to buy plane tickets to and from Annapolis for
himself and Woody. Langford spent a week at the school to learn how
to work as Woody's termite-finding handler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We train the handler to carry out a very thorough house
inspection,'' said Andrew ``Doc'' Solarz, vice president and
trainer at Beacon Dogs Inc. in Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the $2,400 for a full-page color advertisement in
the Austin Yellow Pages to plug his business as the ``HOME OF
WOODY! Austin's Only Beacon Trained Termite Detection Dog!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called marketing; we've got something no one else has,''
Langford said. He added that Woody really can find termites,
carpenter ants and wood-boring beetles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will alert on them by pawing at the wall,'' Langford said.
``If there's some other kind of bug around, he just passes it by.''
That's nice, because you'd hate to tear down a wall for a couple of
roaches.
</P>
<P>
   It's all done by smell, Solarz said. A properly trained termite
dog, he said, can smell the termites that are eating your house
from the inside out. Termites release methane, Langford said.
</P>
<P>
   Termite dogs ``respond to the odor that's coming out from that
termite infestation,'' said Solarz, who has trained 34 dogs to
detect termites. ``It's like if you had an onion, and that odor is
going out from that onion.''
</P>
<P>
   People can't smell termites, because we don't have the amazing
sniffers that doggies have. ``A dog's olfactory system contains
some 200 million olfactory cells,'' Solarz said. ``Man has only
about 5 million olfactory cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Langford ran the dog through his paces at a vacant apartment
Tuesday in Southeast Austin. Langford hid three small plastic
containers with a few termites in each one at various places around
the apartment. The dog found all three in short order.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the advantage of having a dog search for termites
instead of looking for them yourself? Langford said it's that the
dog can tell you they're in the wall before the damage shows up on
the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Termites are working inside walls, inside floors; termites
never come out into the light,'' Solarz said. ``So a visual
inspection isn't effective until the termites have done quite a bit
of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of cutting holes in walls, he can pick up on things that
you can't see going on,'' Langford said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's cuter to watch Woody work than some guy with
plumber's cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   Woody has one drawback. Like any dog, he is distracted by
high-priority doggie items such as, say, Fifi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be a reason to abort an inspection with him,''
Langford said. ``For instance, if they'd had a female dog around in
heat in the last 30 days.''

 &HT;    What's in a name? Probably a copyright
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Just when you think nothing is safe from the
filthy halls of commerce, you learn that, well, nothing is safe
from the filthy halls of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Take my daughter's name, for instance. A time-honored Catholic
name, I thought, even if a tad old-fashioned. My mother's name,
although everybody calls her Vera.
</P>
<P>
   Little did I know the name really belongs to Archie Comics. Yep,
that's right; the comic book company claims to own the trademark.
Lawyers had threatened legal action against the father of
22-month-old Veronica Sams unless he pulled the Web site
Veronica.org.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything in our society that somebody isn't trying to
own? Riverfront Stadium can't simply be Riverfront Stadium; it's
Cinergy Field. And now, heaven forbid, the gods of industry are
going after our kids' names.
</P>
<P>
   What can you expect in a world in which Harley-Davidson tried to
trademark the sound of its engine? The company claimed that the
roar was distinctive, describing it as ``potato'' repeated quickly
several times. (If you stammer at the dinner table _ ``Could you
pass the potatoes-potatoes-potatoes?'' _ is that a trademark
violation?)
</P>
<P>
   That's the Alice in Wonderland territory in which David Sams
found himself when he created the Veronica.org domain in honor of
his daughter's birth. Sporting a teddy bear bathrobe and chubby,
Gerber-smeared cheeks, the cyberspace Veronica laments: ``We've hit
a snag _ the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can a company own my name? It's a common first name. Since
Veronica's friend in Archie Comics is named Betty, do they own her
name, too?''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to attorneys representing Archie Comics, David Sams,
a California businessman, warned, ``Should you wish to take legal
action, it is going to have to be against a toddler and her
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Count my Veronica in. Poor deluded child, she thinks she owns
the trademark on the name. If you ask her name, and she's in the
mood to answer such an ignorant question, she'll sing-song
``Ve-RON-i-ca,'' as if it were one of those names, like Elvis or
Cher, that require no further embellishment.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Comics recently backed down, saying the company will take
no legal action unless the Web site contains offensive material.
Depending on how company execs view the Teletubbies, little
Veronica just might get to keep her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It's a compromise that still suggests ownership of the name,
and, on behalf of Veronicas everywhere, I resent that. If anybody
owns a trademark on the name Veronica, it's the Catholic church.
She's a patented saint, enshrined in cathedrals and churches all
over the world centuries before that brunette met Archie. (For
those of you who haven't perused your Picture Books of the Saints
lately, Veronica is the saint who wiped Christ's bleeding face on
the way to Calvary. Legend has it that his image appeared on her
handkerchief.)
</P>
<P>
   Hence the name means ``true image,'' according to the baby
books. What company in the world, come to think of it, wouldn't
want to put their trademark on that?
</P>
<P>
   But there are some things you just can't own.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't understand that, you're a real Jughead.

 &HT;    Attorneys not user-friendly to software that could aid clients
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Any day now I expect Texas' jackbooted
lawyer-protection police to kick in my front door and ransack my
house for my copies and upgrades of Quicken Family Lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In an touching effort to protect Texas consumers, U.S. District
Judge Barefoot Sanders has released a summary judgment to prevent
Parsons Technology Inc. from selling copies of its popular home
computer software Quicken Family Lawyer and Quicken Family Lawyer
'99 in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on the sale of self-help legal software may be a defeat
for the First Amendment and common sense, but it's a slam-dunk
triumph for the Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee, which is
fully funded by the State Bar of Texas and also an extension of the
Texas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Although Judge Sanders and the Texas lawyers who support his
decision claim they only want to protect the public, there's
nothing new about lawyers using the law to protect and enrich
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are attracted to lawmaking the way buzzards are
attracted to road kill or reporters are attracted to train wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike buzzards and reporters, lawmaking lawyers get to
manufacture business for themselves by passing more laws. More laws
beget business and more lawyers. No laws mean no lawyers. It's a
simple concept.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaking lawyers and judges, who by law must be lawyers, get to
make the laws and hand down the rulings that control the practice
of law.
</P>
<P>
   So Judge Sanders is ruling that Parsons Technology Inc. is
violating the law that prohibits the unauthorized practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons' Quicken Family Lawyer software sells for under $30 and
offers more than 100 suggested legal forms, which just might cost a
non-lawyer rube a second mortgage on his house if a lawyer filled
out and handled those same forms.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers, of course, make the reasoned argument that the laws
that make the unauthorized practice of law unlawful are on the
books only to protect non-lawyers who otherwise might be taken to
the cleaners if they follow the legal advice of anyone except a
lawyer. Follow that?
</P>
<P>
   Some versions of Quicken Family Lawyer give instructions on how
to file wills, real estate leases, employment contracts and other
legal documents.
</P>
<P>
   Generic forms for wills, real estate leases and such have been
around for years. Lawyers, due to their tender feelings for their
fellow citizens, have never liked the sale of these blank forms.
But they have never come up with a constitutional way to prevent
the publication and purchase of these forms.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers also do not like to see non-lawyers read law books and
attempt to handle their own legal affairs. Non-lawyers, after all,
might make an expensive and heartbreaking mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But even lawyers deeply concerned about self-inflicted legal
injuries have been unable to figure out how to stop citizens from
reading law books in public libraries and taking their own legal
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Computer software, however, is another matter. The software puts
generic legal forms together with the knowledge of how to file the
forms in a handy interactive package that asks questions needed to
pick the right legal form and fill it out.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, howdy. That's getting very close to stealing the butter
right off a lawyer's biscuit.
</P>
<P>
   By making the sale of self-help legal software illegal in Texas,
lawyer-protection police will have to beef up anti-smuggling
efforts along the Texas-Mexico border, the Gulf of Mexico coastline
and at every crossing coming into Texas from New Mexico, Oklahoma,
Arkansas and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer jokes surely will be probable cause to search for
anti-lawyer software.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my best friends are lawyers, but this is absurd. I hope
I don't get in legal trouble for saying that.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did it become law that you did not have to live in a
congressional district to be eligible to run for Congress from that
district?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's been the law for a rather long time, because the
requirements for running for election to the U.S. House of
Representatives are established in Article 1, Section 2 of the U.S.
Constitution. The requirements are that candidates must be 25 years
old, U.S. citizens for at least seven years, and residents of the
state from which they are chosen. When it comes to political
reality, however, most U.S. representatives live in the district
from which they are elected. What you may have in mind are laws for
some state and local elections.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an Internet site for checking up on charities?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus maintains files on hundreds of national and
international charity organizations, and publishes information on
whether an organization meets standards established by the BBB. One
such standard, for example, is whether the organization spends at
least 50 percent of its donations on the activities for which it
seeks funds. The advisory service can be reached on the Net:
http://www.bbb.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper article told of a 31-year-old man who
stabbed two people in a Social Security office in Alabama. How
would a 31-year-old be eligible for Social Security benefits in the
first place?
</P>
<P>
   A: Social Security could pay benefits to a 31-year-old who had
been judged disabled. It's also possible in limited situations that
a 31-year-old could receive survivors benefits paid on the record
of a deceased spouse. Social Security pays more than just
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Republicans say that the $1,000-a-year, long-term health
care plan for seniors proposed by President Clinton was in the
Republicans' Contract With America in 1994. Was it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Contract With America promised to give unspecified tax
breaks to seniors who purchased private long-term care insurance
and to adult children caring for elderly patients. In 1996,
legislation passed that allows taxpayers who buy long-term care
insurance to deduct a portion of the premiums if they itemize
deductions and if their medical deductions surpass 7 percent of
their gross adjusted income. Tax breaks for adult children caring
for elderly parents stalled. The legislation proposed by Clinton
allows a $1,000 annual tax credit for people who need long-term
care, including at-home care, or for the adult children who care
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the ``k'' stand for in 401(k)? And in Y2K?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``k'' in 401(k) doesn't represent a word. A 401(k) is the
employer-sponsored retirement program allowed under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code, which is written by Congress. The
code is broken up into sections, with 401 being Qualified Pension,
Profit Sharing and Stock Bonus Plans, said Anthony Burke of the
IRS. The section starts with 401(a); 401(k) is the section on cash
or deferred arrangements, he said. The ``k'' in parentheses simply
represents its order in the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   In Y2K, the ``K'' represents kilo (thousand), as in kilometer
(1,000 meters) or kilogram (1,000 grams). So ``Y'' is Year, and
``2K'' is two thousand, designating the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I still have some Breast Cancer Awareness stamps, which are
undenominated. Must I add a 1-cent stamp when I use them to mail a
letter?
</P>
<P>
   A: These stamps are priced at 40 cents each. Before the Jan. 10
rate increase, when first-class letter postage was 32 cents, the
Postal Service allotted 8 cents of that amount to breast cancer
research. On Jan. 10, when the cost of first-class letter postage
rose to 33 cents, the amount for breast cancer research dropped to
7 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the tricky part. If you're using Breast Cancer Awareness
stamps purchased before Jan. 10, you're ``honor-bound'' to add a
1-cent stamp, said Don Smeraldi of the Postal Service in
Washington. But if you bought them after Jan. 10, he added, you
don't need to use the extra 1-cent stamp, because the portion going
to research has dropped by that same amount. So it's up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With Jordan's King Hussein in the news for his relapse of
cancer, I'm reminded of his wife, Queen Noor. Can you refresh my
memory about her? How many children do she and King Hussein have?
</P>
<P>
   A: Her Majesty Queen Noor was born Lisa Najeeb Halaby on Aug.
23, 1951, in Washington. She was the oldest of the three children
of Najeeb Halaby and Doris Carlquist. Her father, who was in the
Defense Department at the time of her birth, went on to become head
of the Federal Aviation Adminstration and chief exeutive officer of
Pan American World Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Before she married Hussein Ibn Talal (King Hussein), Lisa Halaby
attended schools in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., New York and
Massachusetts before entering Princeton University in its first
coeducational class. After receiving a B.A. in architecture and
urban planning from Princeton in 1974, she participated in
international urban design projects in Australia, Iran, the United
States and Jordan. At one time she was director of planning and
design projects for Royal Jordanian Airline.
</P>
<P>
   Halaby married King Hussein on June 15, 1978, taking on the name
Noor al-Hussein (``Light of Hussein'' in Arabic). Several days
before the wedding, the nominal Protestant expressed her adherence
to Islam, which entailed her declaring before an Islamic court that
there is only one God, that God is Allah, and that the Messenger of
Allah is Muhammed the Prophet. She and her husband have four
children of their own: Prince Hamzah (born in 1980); Prince Hashim
(1981); Princess Iman (1983); and Princess Raiyah (1986). In
addition to the children of the late Queen Alia whom she has
adopted, Queen Noor is the stepmother of the five children from the
king's two other marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, Queen Noor is active in a number of projects
concerning mother and child health care, education, women's
development, environmental protection, culture and public
architecture and planning. She also is involved in various
international projects, such as the agriculture-oriented Future
Harvest and the Landmine Survivors Network.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the law regarding the photographing of U.S. currency?
I'm trying to reproduce pictures of some bills for a brochure, but
my printer says it's against the law.
</P>
<P>
   A: Federal law sharply restricts photographs or other printed
reproduction of U.S. paper currency, as well as checks, bonds,
revenue stamps and securities of both U.S. and foreign governments.
It's done, obviously, to prevent counterfeiting. However, color
illustrations are permitted by the Counterfeit Detection Act of
1992 (Public Law 102-550, in Section 411 of Title 31 of the Code of
Federal Regulations), under these conditions: (1) the illustration
is either less than three-fourths, or more than 1 1/2 times, of the
bills' actual size; (2) the illustration is only one-sided; (3) and
all negatives, plates, postives, digitized storage medium or
anything else used in the illustration are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Title 18, United States Code, Section 504, permits black and
white reproductions of currency and other obligations, so long as
the reproductions meet size requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that a huge chunk of ice, maybe 30 miles wide
and 90 miles long, had broken off Antarctica. What do scientists
say about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The world's largest reported iceberg in more than a decade
was documented Oct. 13 by National Ice Center scientist Mary
Keller. She observed in satellite imagery that a mass of ice about
the size you described had broken off the Ronne Ice Shelf in
Antarctica. Almost a year ago, it was widely reported that a
75-square-mile chunk of an ice shelf called Larsen B had crumbled
and dispersed into the sea along the Antarctic Peninsula. And there
have been other such incidents, such as in October 1987, when a
96-mile-long iceberg snapped off from the Ross Ice Shelf. The Ronne
and Larsen ice shelves both face the Weddell Sea, but aren't close
to each other. The Ross Ice Shelf is on the other side of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   While environmentalists and scientists point to such activity as
evidence of global warming, they say the near-term impact on sea
levels and climate conditions is uncertain. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, the scientists responsible for predicting
likely effects of climate change, is on record as saying the
Antarctic will have a zero net contribution to sea-level rise in
the next century. Increased snowfall, they reason, will balance out
meltwater from retreating glaciers.

   CALIF-TEACHERS (San Francisco) _ A critical shortage of
California teachers has led to the first statewide advertising
campaign to recruit a qualified crop. The need is enormous: from
260,000 to 300,000 new teachers will be needed during the next 10
years, according to various estimates. By GEORGE RAINE.

   COLLEGE-ADMISSIONS (San Francisco) _ Five civil rights groups
have filed a federal lawsuit alleging that UC-Berkeley's new
undergraduate admissions process illegally discriminates against
minority students. The suit contends that the process violates
civil rights laws and has unfairly denied entrance to more than 750
well-qualified African American, Filipino American and Latino
students. By SETH ROSENFELD.

   TV-CUPID (Undated) _ ABC lied. That shouldn't be a surprise to
any veteran TV-watcher. But the network really redefined the art

that it liked the show quite a bit and was moving forward. By TIM
GOODMAN.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did it become law that you did not have to live in a
congressional district to be eligible to run for Congress from that
district?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's been the law for a rather long time, because the
requirements for running for election to the U.S. House of
Representatives are established in Article 1, Section 2 of the U.S.
Constitution. The requirements are that candidates must be 25 years
old, U.S. citizens for at least seven years, and residents of the
state from which they are chosen. When it comes to political
reality, however, most U.S. representatives live in the district
from which they are elected. What you may have in mind are laws for
some state and local elections.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an Internet site for checking up on charities?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus maintains files on hundreds of national and
international charity organizations, and publishes information on
whether an organization meets standards established by the BBB. One
such standard, for example, is whether the organization spends at
least 50 percent of its donations on the activities for which it
seeks funds. The advisory service can be reached on the Net:
http://www.bbb.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper article told of a 31-year-old man who
stabbed two people in a Social Security office in Alabama. How
would a 31-year-old be eligible for Social Security benefits in the
first place?
</P>
<P>
   A: Social Security could pay benefits to a 31-year-old who had
been judged disabled. It's also possible in limited situations that
a 31-year-old could receive survivors benefits paid on the record
of a deceased spouse. Social Security pays more than just
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Republicans say that the $1,000-a-year, long-term health
care plan for seniors proposed by President Clinton was in the
Republicans' Contract With America in 1994. Was it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Contract With America promised to give unspecified tax
breaks to seniors who purchased private long-term care insurance
and to adult children caring for elderly patients. In 1996,
legislation passed that allows taxpayers who buy long-term care
insurance to deduct a portion of the premiums if they itemize
deductions and if their medical deductions surpass 7 percent of
their gross adjusted income. Tax breaks for adult children caring
for elderly parents stalled. The legislation proposed by Clinton
allows a $1,000 annual tax credit for people who need long-term
care, including at-home care, or for the adult children who care
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the ``k'' stand for in 401(k)? And in Y2K?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``k'' in 401(k) doesn't represent a word. A 401(k) is the
employer-sponsored retirement program allowed under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code, which is written by Congress. The
code is broken up into sections, with 401 being Qualified Pension,
Profit Sharing and Stock Bonus Plans, said Anthony Burke of the
IRS. The section starts with 401(a); 401(k) is the section on cash
or deferred arrangements, he said. The ``k'' in parentheses simply
represents its order in the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   In Y2K, the ``K'' represents kilo (thousand), as in kilometer
(1,000 meters) or kilogram (1,000 grams). So ``Y'' is Year, and
``2K'' is two thousand, designating the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I still have some Breast Cancer Awareness stamps, which are
undenominated. Must I add a 1-cent stamp when I use them to mail a
letter?
</P>
<P>
   A: These stamps are priced at 40 cents each. Before the Jan. 10
rate increase, when first-class letter postage was 32 cents, the
Postal Service allotted 8 cents of that amount to breast cancer
research. On Jan. 10, when the cost of first-class letter postage
rose to 33 cents, the amount for breast cancer research dropped to
7 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the tricky part. If you're using Breast Cancer Awareness
stamps purchased before Jan. 10, you're ``honor-bound'' to add a
1-cent stamp, said Don Smeraldi of the Postal Service in
Washington. But if you bought them after Jan. 10, he added, you
don't need to use the extra 1-cent stamp, because the portion going
to research has dropped by that same amount. So it's up to you.

of Najeeb Halaby and Doris Carlquist. Her father, who was in the

   Q: A crossword puzzle I was working on worded the answer as
``president who originally was named Leslie Lynch King Jr.'' It
turned out to be ``Ford.'' What were the circumstances leading to
Gerald R. Ford's name change?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only child of Leslie Lynch King, a western wool dealer,
and Dorothy Ayer Gardner King was born July 14, 1913, in Omaha,
Neb., and was named Leslie Lynch King Jr. About two years after his
birth, his parents were divorced and his mother moved with him to
Grand Rapids, Mich., where her parents lived. In 1916, she married
Gerald Rudolff Ford, a paint salesman, who soon afterward adopted
and renamed her son. The younger Ford later changed the spelling of
his middle name, preferring to use only its initial. He also chose
to spell his nickname Jerry rather than Gerry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I bought a Big Game Quik Pik ticket that had the number 21
twice. The numbers were 11-21-23-31-42 and then 21 again. Am I
correct in believing that it's impossible to win with the same
number twice? How common is it for this to happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: The second 21 was the Big Money Ball number, which is
separate _ and is drawn separately _ from the first five numbers.
The Big Money Ball is always the last number on the player's Big
Game play slip. It's very common, and perfectly all right, for the
Big Money Ball to be the same as one of the first five numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you confirm reports that White House attorney Cheryl
Mills, who defended President Clinton in the Senate impeachment
trial, is being investigated by the Justice Department on charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice?
</P>
<P>
   A: Last September, Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) asked the
Justice Department whether Mills obstructed a congressional
investigation into the possible misuse of a taxpayer-financed White
House database. It was alleged that in 1996, Mills located two
subpoenaed documents suggesting that the president and Hillary
Rodham Clinton sanctioned the use of the White House database for
political purposes, such as soliciting donations, but withheld them
from a Republican-led subcommittee for months, until after the 1996
election. Mills also was accused of lying to the committee about
aspects of the database.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said she didn't believe the documents were responsive to
the subpoena when she first reviewed them, and sought the advice of
her superiors, who agreed. She denied any effort to mislead
investigators. A Democrat on the Government Reform Committee wrote
the Justice Department to say he disagreed with the Republican
referral, adding that Mills may have made a mistake, but there was
no evidence of willful obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   In its Feb. 1 issue, Time says McIntosh's request for an
investigation into the matter is still being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the NBC program ``Trinity''? I enjoyed it,
but haven't heard anything about if for months.
</P>
<P>
   A: Production has been suspended and the program has been taken
off the air, said NBC publicist Joanna Giddon in New York. The
network has no plans to bring it back. The reason Giddon cited: too
few viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently told us about new commemorative coins. Can I buy
them directly from the U.S. Mint, rather than going to a dealer who
would charge more? Where can I get more information? Is there an
Internet site?
</P>
<P>
   A: Commemorative coins are available from the Mint only for a
limited time, although they may remain available from collectors
and coin dealers afterward. Mint spokesman Michael White says only
one commemorative, the Dolley Madison silver dollar, is currently
available for direct purchase from the Mint. As of Dec. 31, the
other most recent ones _ Robert F. Kennedy; Crispus Attucks Black
Revolutionary War Patriots; and National Law Enforcement Officers _
were discontinued for direct order. The Jackie Robinson gold $5 and
silver dollar, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt gold $5, also were
closed out recently. Information: 1-800-872-6468 or 202-283-2646 On
the Internet: http://www.usmint.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain how football's ``sudden death'' works? In the
Falcons-Vikings game, for example, if Minnesota had scored in its
first possession in overtime, would the Falcons have gotten the
ball back? Or would that have been the end of the game?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the game would have been over. ``Sudden death'' is an
extra 15-minute period of play to decide a game tied at the end of
regulation play in the NFL. The period begins with a kickoff
(decided by a coin toss) and ends when one team scores, or when
time runs out. If neither team is able to score in the overtime
period, 15-minute periods continue to be played, with two-minute
intermissions in between, until somebody scores. If the Vikings had
scored first in any manner, they would have won; but of course they
didn't. Morten Andersen sealed the Falcons' victory with his
history-making 38-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw where ``Dr. Laura,'' at a big party in Atlanta
recently, raised $60,000 for her foundation. What does the
foundation do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The stated purpose of the Dr. Laura Schlessinger Foundation
is ``to provide in-kind gifts and financial grants to charities
with a 501(c)3 tax-exempt status that meet the needs of families
and children.'' Its mission statement says special attention will
be given to those services that discourage abortion and teen
sexuality; promote adoption; prevent the abuse and neglect of
children; and provide support and encouragement to stay-at-home
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's board of advisers considers requests for
assistance three times a year. Such requests must be submitted in
writing to: The Dr. Laura Schlessinger Foundation, 6520 Platt Ave.,
816, West Hills, CA 91307. Groups or individuals requesting in-kind
or financial support should not expect to hear from the foundation
until the end of the quarter in which the submission is made.
Internet users can get online information at the Dr. Laura Website:
http://www.drlaura.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta organizers projected a huge
profit. Did it make as much as predicted? What was the final tally?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Atlanta Olympics broke even. Although the corporation is
not legally dissolved, and won't be until June, the books are
essentially closed. After bills were paid, less than $20 million
was left in the bank account of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games, and that sum is going to the U.S. Olympic Committee
to cover earlier debt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the end of the Robin Williams movie ``Patch Adams,'' it's
stated that a hospital is either being planned , or has been built,
in West Virginia with a thousand doctors waiting to volunteer to be
on the staff. Where in West Virginia will it be? Where can we send
donations?
</P>
<P>
   A: The would-be hospital is so far only a group of buildings,
some half-finished, on 310 acres of West Virginia's Droop Mountain.
The real-life Dr. Hunter D. ``Patch'' Adams (portrayed in the film
by Williams) founded the Gesundheit! Institute, a health care
reform movement, more than 20 years ago. The film depicts Adams as
a maverick medical student who espouses the healing power of humor
and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   There's some controversy about the institute's funding. Adams
has been raising money for it since the early '70s. Published
accounts have put the total raised so far at $1.1 million. Adams
hopes for $25 million more to complete the project, but some people
question where the money is going, and whether the movie dream will
ever become reality. One recent article reported that there are no
patients, just two staffers who answer an endless stream of calls
and letters from people suddenly enchanted with the concept of free
health care from seeing the movie. Although the institute has its
detractors, the real-life Adams insists that $25 million from now,
a hospital will stand.

   Donations can be sent to Gesundheit! Institute, P.O. Box 268,
Hillsboro, WV 24946, or for credit-card donations by calling the
toll-free number 1-877-745-5937. General information also is
available at the toll-free number or at 304-653-4338, or online at

</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), one of the House managers in the
impeachment trial who seems to be consumed by hatred for President
Clinton, ever serve in the armed forces?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about presidential pardons. What kind of crimes
may be pardoned? How does one apply for a pardon? How long does the
process take? If one actually gets a presidential pardon, does it
completely clear the crime from one's record, or is it just a
symbolic gesture?
</P>
<P>
   A: The president's pardon power extends only to ``offenses
against the United States,'' said Chris Watney of the Justice
Department. This means violations of federal law (including
military offenses), but it doesn't include state offenses, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   To apply for a presidential pardon, the applicant must file a
formal petition with the Office of the Pardon Attorney, the Justice
Department office responsible for processing pardon petitions on
behalf of the president. There's a minimum five-year waiting
period, which runs from the date of release from incarceration, or
from the date of conviction if no period of incarceration was
served, Watney said. The amount of time necessary to process a
pardon petition varies from case to case, but the process can be
lengthy and generally takes upward of a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pardon does not erase or expunge the judicial record of a
conviction, but it will remove certain disabilities imposed by
reason of the conviction for which the pardon is granted,'' Watney
added, ``and it can be helpful in obtaining licenses and other
occupational certificates. It also is a sign of forgiveness and
therefore serves to lessen the stigma associated with the
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Photos of Chief Justice William Rehnquist show stripes on the
sleeves of his robe. What's the significance?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported previously, Rehnquist is the first modern-day
Supreme Court member to depart from tradition and wear something
other than a plain black robe. His bold, gold, naval-style fashion
statement dates to 1995, when he appeared at the State of the Union
address displaying four gold stripes on each sleeve. The inch-wide
horizontal stripes were inspired, it was explained, by Rehnquist's
having seen the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera ``Iolanthe'' the
previous summer. In the operetta, the Lord Chancellor wore gold
stripes on his sleeves.

   Q: A crossword puzzle I was working on worded the answer as
``president who originally was named Leslie Lynch King Jr.'' It
turned out to be ``Ford.'' What were the circumstances leading to
Gerald R. Ford's name change?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only child of Leslie Lynch King, a western wool dealer,
and Dorothy Ayer Gardner King was born July 14, 1913, in Omaha,
Neb., and was named Leslie Lynch King Jr. About two years after his
birth, his parents were divorced and his mother moved with him to
Grand Rapids, Mich., where her parents lived. In 1916, she married
Gerald Rudolff Ford, a paint salesman, who soon afterward adopted
and renamed her son. The younger Ford later changed the spelling of
his middle name, preferring to use only its initial. He also chose
to spell his nickname Jerry rather than Gerry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I bought a Big Game Quik Pik ticket that had the number 21
twice. The numbers were 11-21-23-31-42 and then 21 again. Am I
correct in believing that it's impossible to win with the same
number twice? How common is it for this to happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: The second 21 was the Big Money Ball number, which is
separate _ and is drawn separately _ from the first five numbers.
The Big Money Ball is always the last number on the player's Big
Game play slip. It's very common, and perfectly all right, for the
Big Money Ball to be the same as one of the first five numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you confirm reports that White House attorney Cheryl
Mills, who defended President Clinton in the Senate impeachment
trial, is being investigated by the Justice Department on charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice?
</P>
<P>
   A: Last September, Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) asked the
Justice Department whether Mills obstructed a congressional
investigation into the possible misuse of a taxpayer-financed White
House database. It was alleged that in 1996, Mills located two
subpoenaed documents suggesting that the president and Hillary
Rodham Clinton sanctioned the use of the White House database for
political purposes, such as soliciting donations, but withheld them
from a Republican-led subcommittee for months, until after the 1996
election. Mills also was accused of lying to the committee about
aspects of the database.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said she didn't believe the documents were responsive to
the subpoena when she first reviewed them, and sought the advice of
her superiors, who agreed. She denied any effort to mislead
investigators. A Democrat on the Government Reform Committee wrote
the Justice Department to say he disagreed with the Republican
referral, adding that Mills may have made a mistake, but there was
no evidence of willful obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   In its Feb. 1 issue, Time says McIntosh's request for an
investigation into the matter is still being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the NBC program ``Trinity''? I enjoyed it,
but haven't heard anything about if for months.
</P>
<P>
   A: Production has been suspended and the program has been taken
off the air, said NBC publicist Joanna Giddon in New York. The
network has no plans to bring it back. The reason Giddon cited: too
few viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently told us about new commemorative coins. Can I buy
them directly from the U.S. Mint, rather than going to a dealer who
would charge more? Where can I get more information? Is there an
Internet site?
</P>
<P>
   A: Commemorative coins are available from the Mint only for a
limited time, although they may remain available from collectors
and coin dealers afterward. Mint spokesman Michael White says only
one commemorative, the Dolley Madison silver dollar, is currently
available for direct purchase from the Mint. As of Dec. 31, the
other most recent ones _ Robert F. Kennedy; Crispus Attucks Black
Revolutionary War Patriots; and National Law Enforcement Officers _
were discontinued for direct order. The Jackie Robinson gold $5 and
silver dollar, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt gold $5, also were
closed out recently. Information: 1-800-872-6468 or 202-283-2646 On
the Internet: http://www.usmint.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain how football's ``sudden death'' works? In the
Falcons-Vikings game, for example, if Minnesota had scored in its
first possession in overtime, would the Falcons have gotten the
ball back? Or would that have been the end of the game?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the game would have been over. ``Sudden death'' is an
extra 15-minute period of play to decide a game tied at the end of
regulation play in the NFL. The period begins with a kickoff
(decided by a coin toss) and ends when one team scores, or when
time runs out. If neither team is able to score in the overtime
period, 15-minute periods continue to be played, with two-minute
intermissions in between, until somebody scores. If the Vikings had
scored first in any manner, they would have won; but of course they
didn't. Morten Andersen sealed the Falcons' victory with his
history-making 38-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw where ``Dr. Laura,'' at a big party in Atlanta
recently, raised $60,000 for her foundation. What does the
foundation do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The stated purpose of the Dr. Laura Schlessinger Foundation
is ``to provide in-kind gifts and financial grants to charities
with a 501(c)3 tax-exempt status that meet the needs of families
and children.'' Its mission statement says special attention will
be given to those services that discourage abortion and teen
sexuality; promote adoption; prevent the abuse and neglect of
children; and provide support and encouragement to stay-at-home
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's board of advisers considers requests for
assistance three times a year. Such requests must be submitted in
writing to: The Dr. Laura Schlessinger Foundation, 6520 Platt Ave.,
816, West Hills, CA 91307. Groups or individuals requesting in-kind
or financial support should not expect to hear from the foundation
until the end of the quarter in which the submission is made.
Internet users can get online information at the Dr. Laura Website:

</P>
<P>
   Q: Before the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta organizers projected a huge
profit. Did it make as much as predicted? What was the final tally?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Atlanta Olympics broke even. Although the corporation is
not legally dissolved, and won't be until June, the books are
essentially closed. After bills were paid, less than $20 million
was left in the bank account of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games, and that sum is going to the U.S. Olympic Committee
to cover earlier debt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the end of the Robin Williams movie ``Patch Adams,'' it's
stated that a hospital is either being planned , or has been built,
in West Virginia with a thousand doctors waiting to volunteer to be
on the staff. Where in West Virginia will it be? Where can we send
donations?
</P>
<P>
   A: The would-be hospital is so far only a group of buildings,
some half-finished, on 310 acres of West Virginia's Droop Mountain.
The real-life Dr. Hunter D. ``Patch'' Adams (portrayed in the film
by Williams) founded the Gesundheit! Institute, a health care
reform movement, more than 20 years ago. The film depicts Adams as
a maverick medical student who espouses the healing power of humor

therefore serves to lessen the stigma associated with the
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Photos of Chief Justice William Rehnquist show stripes on the
sleeves of his robe. What's the significance?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported previously, Rehnquist is the first modern-day

   Q: I bought a Big Game Quik Pik ticket that had the number 21
twice. The numbers were 11-21-23-31-42 and then 21 again. Am I
correct in believing that it's impossible to win with the same
number twice? How common is it for this to happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: The second 21 was the Big Money Ball number, which is
separate _ and is drawn separately _ from the first five numbers.
The Big Money Ball is always the last number on the player's Big
Game play slip. It's very common, and perfectly all right, for the
Big Money Ball to be the same as one of the first five numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you confirm reports that White House attorney Cheryl
Mills, who defended President Clinton in the Senate impeachment
trial, is being investigated by the Justice Department on charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice?
</P>
<P>
   A: Last September, Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) asked the
Justice Department whether Mills obstructed a congressional
investigation into the possible misuse of a taxpayer-financed White
House database. It was alleged that in 1996, Mills located two
subpoenaed documents suggesting that the president and Hillary
Rodham Clinton sanctioned the use of the White House database for
political purposes, such as soliciting donations, but withheld them
from a Republican-led subcommittee for months, until after the 1996
election. Mills also was accused of lying to the committee about
aspects of the database.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said she didn't believe the documents were responsive to
the subpoena when she first reviewed them, and sought the advice of
her superiors, who agreed. She denied any effort to mislead
investigators. A Democrat on the Government Reform Committee wrote
the Justice Department to say he disagreed with the Republican
referral, adding that Mills may have made a mistake, but there was
no evidence of willful obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   In its Feb. 1 issue, Time says McIntosh's request for an
investigation into the matter is still being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the NBC program ``Trinity''? I enjoyed it,
but haven't heard anything about if for months.
</P>
<P>
   A: Production has been suspended and the program has been taken
off the air, said NBC publicist Joanna Giddon in New York. The
network has no plans to bring it back. The reason Giddon cited: too
few viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently told us about new commemorative coins. Can I buy
them directly from the U.S. Mint, rather than going to a dealer who
would charge more? Where can I get more information? Is there an
Internet site?
</P>
<P>
   A: Commemorative coins are available from the Mint only for a
limited time, although they may remain available from collectors
and coin dealers afterward. Mint spokesman Michael White says only
one commemorative, the Dolley Madison silver dollar, is currently
available for direct purchase from the Mint. As of Dec. 31, the
other most recent ones _ Robert F. Kennedy; Crispus Attucks Black
Revolutionary War Patriots; and National Law Enforcement Officers _
were discontinued for direct order. The Jackie Robinson gold $5 and
silver dollar, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt gold $5, also were
closed out recently. Information: 1-800-872-6468 or 202-283-2646 On
the Internet: http://www.usmint.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain how football's ``sudden death'' works? In the
Falcons-Vikings game, for example, if Minnesota had scored in its
first possession in overtime, would the Falcons have gotten the
ball back? Or would that have been the end of the game?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the game would have been over. ``Sudden death'' is an
extra 15-minute period of play to decide a game tied at the end of
regulation play in the NFL. The period begins with a kickoff
(decided by a coin toss) and ends when one team scores, or when
time runs out. If neither team is able to score in the overtime
period, 15-minute periods continue to be played, with two-minute
intermissions in between, until somebody scores. If the Vikings had
scored first in any manner, they would have won; but of course they
didn't. Morten Andersen sealed the Falcons' victory with his
history-making 38-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw where ``Dr. Laura,'' at a big party in Atlanta
recently, raised $60,000 for her foundation. What does the
foundation do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The stated purpose of the Dr. Laura Schlessinger Foundation
is ``to provide in-kind gifts and financial grants to charities
with a 501(c)3 tax-exempt status that meet the needs of families
and children.'' Its mission statement says special attention will
be given to those services that discourage abortion and teen
sexuality; promote adoption; prevent the abuse and neglect of
children; and provide support and encouragement to stay-at-home
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's board of advisers considers requests for
assistance three times a year. Such requests must be submitted in
writing to: The Dr. Laura Schlessinger Foundation, 6520 Platt Ave.,
816, West Hills, CA 91307. Groups or individuals requesting in-kind
or financial support should not expect to hear from the foundation
until the end of the quarter in which the submission is made.
Internet users can get online information at the Dr. Laura Website:

</P>
<P>
   Q: Before the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta organizers projected a huge
profit. Did it make as much as predicted? What was the final tally?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Atlanta Olympics broke even. Although the corporation is
not legally dissolved, and won't be until June, the books are
essentially closed. After bills were paid, less than $20 million
was left in the bank account of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games, and that sum is going to the U.S. Olympic Committee
to cover earlier debt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the end of the Robin Williams movie ``Patch Adams,'' it's
stated that a hospital is either being planned , or has been built,
in West Virginia with a thousand doctors waiting to volunteer to be
on the staff. Where in West Virginia will it be? Where can we send
donations?
</P>
<P>
   A: The would-be hospital is so far only a group of buildings,
some half-finished, on 310 acres of West Virginia's Droop Mountain.
The real-life Dr. Hunter D. ``Patch'' Adams (portrayed in the film
by Williams) founded the Gesundheit! Institute, a health care
reform movement, more than 20 years ago. The film depicts Adams as
a maverick medical student who espouses the healing power of humor
and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   There's some controversy about the institute's funding. Adams
has been raising money for it since the early '70s. Published
accounts have put the total raised so far at $1.1 million. Adams
hopes for $25 million more to complete the project, but some people
question where the money is going, and whether the movie dream will
ever become reality. One recent article reported that there are no
patients, just two staffers who answer an endless stream of calls
and letters from people suddenly enchanted with the concept of free
health care from seeing the movie. Although the institute has its
detractors, the real-life Adams insists that $25 million from now,
a hospital will stand.
</P>
<P>
   Donations can be sent to Gesundheit! Institute, P.O. Box 268,
Hillsboro, WV 24946, or for credit-card donations by calling the
toll-free number 1-877-745-5937. General information also is
available at the toll-free number or at 304-653-4338, or online at
the institute's Website: http://www.patchadams.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), one of the House managers in the
impeachment trial who seems to be consumed by hatred for President
Clinton, ever serve in the armed forces?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about presidential pardons. What kind of crimes
may be pardoned? How does one apply for a pardon? How long does the
process take? If one actually gets a presidential pardon, does it
completely clear the crime from one's record, or is it just a
symbolic gesture?
</P>
<P>
   A: The president's pardon power extends only to ``offenses
against the United States,'' said Chris Watney of the Justice
Department. This means violations of federal law (including
military offenses), but it doesn't include state offenses, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   To apply for a presidential pardon, the applicant must file a
formal petition with the Office of the Pardon Attorney, the Justice
Department office responsible for processing pardon petitions on
behalf of the president. There's a minimum five-year waiting
period, which runs from the date of release from incarceration, or
from the date of conviction if no period of incarceration was
served, Watney said. The amount of time necessary to process a
pardon petition varies from case to case, but the process can be
lengthy and generally takes upward of a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pardon does not erase or expunge the judicial record of a
conviction, but it will remove certain disabilities imposed by
reason of the conviction for which the pardon is granted,'' Watney
added, ``and it can be helpful in obtaining licenses and other
occupational certificates. It also is a sign of forgiveness and
therefore serves to lessen the stigma associated with the
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Photos of Chief Justice William Rehnquist show stripes on the
sleeves of his robe. What's the significance?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported previously, Rehnquist is the first modern-day
Supreme Court member to depart from tradition and wear something
other than a plain black robe. His bold, gold, naval-style fashion
statement dates to 1995, when he appeared at the State of the Union
address displaying four gold stripes on each sleeve. The inch-wide
horizontal stripes were inspired, it was explained, by Rehnquist's
having seen the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera ``Iolanthe'' the
previous summer. In the operetta, the Lord Chancellor wore gold
stripes on his sleeves.

   Q: A crossword puzzle I was working on worded the answer as
``president who originally was named Leslie Lynch King Jr.'' It
turned out to be ``Ford.'' What were the circumstances leading to
Gerald R. Ford's name change?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only child of Leslie Lynch King, a western wool dealer,
and Dorothy Ayer Gardner King was born July 14, 1913, in Omaha,
Neb., and was named Leslie Lynch King Jr. About two years after his
birth, his parents were divorced and his mother moved with him to
Grand Rapids, Mich., where her parents lived. In 1916, she married
Gerald Rudolff Ford, a paint salesman, who soon afterward adopted
and renamed her son. The younger Ford later changed the spelling of
his middle name, preferring to use only its initial. He also chose
to spell his nickname Jerry rather than Gerry.

<P>
   Q: I bought a Big Game Quik Pik ticket that had the number 21
twice. The numbers were 11-21-23-31-42 and then 21 again. Am I
correct in believing that it's impossible to win with the same
number twice? How common is it for this to happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: The second 21 was the Big Money Ball number, which is
separate _ and is drawn separately _ from the first five numbers.
The Big Money Ball is always the last number on the player's Big
Game play slip. It's very common, and perfectly all right, for the
Big Money Ball to be the same as one of the first five numbers.

 &HT;    Switch to digital means more choices for cable customers
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: Texas Editors. Three boxes at bottom of story.)
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Too lazy to go to the gym? How about flipping on
the TV and following along with a full-body workout by Jake?
</P>
<P>
   Want to win a few thousand bucks on a game show without standing
in line in Hollywood to do it?
</P>
<P>
   Couch potatoes can do those things in some parts of the country,
but not in Austin. Not yet anyway. In some cities, cable companies
offer channels with first-run British variety shows, wall-to-wall
American game shows and enough aerobic workouts and weightlifting
sessions to last a healthy lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The world of cable television is a world of choice, and as we
enter the digital age, viewers will have even more choices. The
audience decides which of the dozens of channels to watch, but the
cable providers decide which channels to offer them.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texans have a plethora of cable networks available on
Time Warner Cable, the chief provider of cable service. We can
watch news all day and all night. We can watch everything from
wrestling to independent films to museum tours to cartoons to
cooking shows. And lots more.
</P>
<P>
   So who decides which cable channels we get, and how are those
decisions made?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this business a long time, 25 years, and I've
adopted a very conservative approach to adding channels,'' said
Bill Carey, president of Time Warner. He calls the shots in Austin.
``We have a maximum capacity of 79 channels in our expanded areas,
and that makes selecting channels a challenge. It's especially hard
here because we have more access channels than any other system I'm
aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Austin has nine public access channels, and the cable
company's charter with the city allows for the possibility of five
more. The cable company also must carry all local stations, and
Austin has eight. The must-carry channels take a chunk out of the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last couple of years, Time Warner has expanded its
channel capacity through a fiber-optic upgrade and added several
new cable networks, including Animal Planet, History Channel, Golf
Channel, Home &AMP; Garden, Food Network, Travel Channel, TV Land and
the Independent Film Channel. There are currently 50 cable
networks, 10 pay-per-view movie channels and premium channels (such
as HBO and Showtime) and two preview channels.
</P>
<P>
   Carey says Time Warner's surveys in Central Texas show that
viewers here are especially fond of live programming, such as news
and sports events; movies; children's programming; and arts and
science programming.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner is testing digital service in Austin and plans to
offer the new tier of service by the end of the year. The digital
service could increase options by 50 new video channels and as many
as 30 new audio channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot out there, but a lot of them are concepts on a
drawing board,'' Carey said. ``It takes awhile for a channel to
establish itself nationally and reach critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey makes the final decisions on what to carry and what not to
carry, and he makes those decisions based on surveys of people who
already have the new networks in other Time Warner cities. Central
Texas customers are surveyed every year, too, to find out the
relative mix of programming people want. But to decide what new
services to add, the company goes outside our area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveying customers who don't have a service can be very
unreliable,'' Carey said. ``Asking their opinions based on a
description of something they haven't seen can lead to skewed
survey results. And a description of a service doesn't take into
account the execution of the programmer. What I've learned from
experience is you have to go to customers who have used the
service, the longer the better, and ask them to rate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say Austin area customers don't have plenty of
opinions. When ads ran on cable channels touting the debut of the
new nature network Animal Planet, which Time Warner wasn't carrying
at the time, hundreds of people called the company's customer
service lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took that into account,'' Carey said. ``We knew there would
be great demand for Animal Planet, and we also knew from surveys of
people who already had it that the service was very popular and
delivered on its promise. That one was a no-brainer. ... We do get
feedback and requests, and sometimes those are the most intensely
interested viewers. The Golf Channel is a good example of that. It
has a fairly narrow focus, but you're considered out of touch these
days if you don't have the Golf Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Time Warner took the entertainment news channel E! off
temporarily during its upgrade construction, customers flooded the
office with phone calls, prompting the company to send out a
reminder that the channel would return soon.
</P>
<P>
   Taking off any channel is risky business. Several years ago, the
cable company stirred up a ruckus when it took off the religious
channels Trinity Broadcasting and Odyssey. The channels eventually
were brought back. And when C-SPAN2 was taken off, angry viewers
once again complained, resulting in the return of the channel in a
shared capacity with Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every service has some viewership,'' said Sharon Radziewski,
spokeswoman for the National Cable Television Association in
Washington, D.C. ``That's what people love about cable _ all the
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey says Time Warner hasn't had to take any channels off
permanently during his 4 1/2-year tenure because the channels added
have been part of the company's expansion. Right now Carey is
trying to decide what to add to the new digital tier, which will
add about $10 to customers' cable bills. The latest edition of the
National Cable Television Association's channel directory lists 170
cable networks in operation and dozens more in development, so
there's a lot to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of channels will be allocated to pay-per-view,
and we'll add more multiplex channels'' like HBO's three-channel
service, Carey said. ``Our digital service will evolve over time.
Since we're going to be one of the very first digital systems in
the nation, we don't have the luxury of seeing what will work
elsewhere. We'll take a conservative approach, because we want to
make sure we don't add services with little appeal.''

 &HT;    Death-defying hip-hop boom survives, thrives
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. were
murdered within months of each other two years ago, many people
predicted the iconoclastic gangsta rappers would take the
popularity of hip-hop music with them to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and call it a comeback, then, that hip-hop music
dominated the Billboard charts during this past holiday season and
continues to weigh in as the most popular music of the day. Last
week, five of the 10 best-selling albums in the country were
rap-oriented, including the new No. 1 album by New Orleans rapper
Silkk the Shocker and the Grammy-ready solo debut by Fugees singer
Lauryn Hill (No. 5)
</P>
<P>
   What's most surprising about this boom is that even the
stereotypically rap-less Austin is feeling its ripples. Record
store workers have seen hip-hop albums fly off the shelves, while
radio listeners are hearing it more and more on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   A new radio station called ``The Beat'' (KQBT, 104.3 FM) emerged
last fall as the first semi-consistent hip-hop stop on the local FM
dial. According to Arbitron ratings released last week The Beat,
which also plays R&AMP;B music, is already the No. 3 station in town.
Its competitor, KHFI-FM, has also started playing more hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was definitely a void in Austin that had to be filled,''
said Beat program director Scooter Stevens, who estimated that a
little less than 50 percent of his station's songs are hip-hop.
``Clearly, we play enough to have benefited from it.''
</P>
<P>
   While increased radio play undoubtedly has helped raise the
profile of hip-hop music in Austin, the question of where the
genre's most recent boom originated is really a chicken-or-egg
issue. MTV, for instance, airs more music videos by hip-hop artists
than ever before. But that may be because record companies are most
willing to spend money on promoting and making videos for hip-hop
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are certain about the current hip-hop boom: Rap acts
have wildly overshadowed and outsold rock acts lately, to the point
where many music-industry insiders are again raising the ``rock is
dead'' mantra. And regardless of whether rock is dying, hip-hop
continues to grow in the creativity department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of really good rappers out there right now,''
is how 19-year-old Kenny Wilson, a hip-hop fan shopping at the Best
Buy store in South Austin, explained the craze. ``It seems like
there's always something new worth getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCorkle, assistant manager at the hip-hop-geared record
store Musicmania, 3909-D N. Interstate 35, described hip-hop fans
as ``the most loyal CD buyers out there.'' The store held a
midnight sale to promote the release of the Silkk the Shocker album
two weeks ago, and within a couple of days all 300 copies of the
disc were sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of hip-hop is well-marketed these days, and that
might have something to do with the artists doing it themselves,''
McCorkle said, pointing to Silkk the Shocker. His ``Made Mann'' CD
was released and promoted by his brother, rapper Master P and P's
company, No Limit Records. Another album in the Billboard Top 10,
DMX's ``Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood,'' benefited from
similar, incestuous promotion: DMX has done duets with and
otherwise been connected with popular rappers such as Mase and the
Lox.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop's marketing has changed, clearly, but so has its sound.
Gangsta rap is out, for the most part. What's in, as the Hill and
Jay-Z will attest, is the trend of combining rap with singing, so
that the street-level rhymes of rap are featured alongside age-old
soul and R&AMP;B harmonies. Many other artists have followed a less
appealing trend _ started by Puff Daddy and Wyclef Jean _ of
sampling old songs by purely Anglophile acts such as the Police,
Bruce Hornsby and even the Bee Gees.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop still isn't perfect, and one of the arenas it may have
to improve on the most to stay at the top is in live performance.
That's especially true in live-music-happy Austin, which sees only
a handful of touring hip-hop shows each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still isn't really any trust,'' said Pace Concerts
promoter Brad Roosa, who books shows at the Austin Music Hall and
the Backyard. ``The promoters don't trust the performers, and vice
versa. More important, the fans don't trust either of them because
shows often get canceled or the acts simply let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Roosa said, Austin should get more hip-hop concerts
in upcoming years, just as more hip-hop music is being played and
sold here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beat could definitely help because radio play is
essential,'' he said. ``But I think people were ready for the
floodgates to open anyway. It's been a long time coming.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: A crossword puzzle I was working on worded the answer as
``president who originally was named Leslie Lynch King Jr.'' It
turned out to be ``Ford.'' What were the circumstances leading to
Geral R. Ford's name change?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only child of Leslie Lynch King, a western wool dealer,
and Dorothy Ayer Gardner King was born July 14, 1913, in Omaha,
Neb., and was named Leslie Lynch King Jr. About two years after his
birth, his parents were divorced and his mother moved with him to
Grand Rapids, Mich., where her parents lived. In 1916, she married
Gerald Rudolff Ford, a paint salesman, who soon afterward adopted
and renamed her son. The younger Ford later changed the spelling of
his middle name, preferring to use only its initial. He also chose
to spell his nickname Jerry rather than Gerry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I bought a Big Game Quik Pik ticket that had the number 21
twice. The numbers were 11-21-23-31-42 and then 21 again. Am I
correct in believing that it's impossible to win with the same
number twice? How common is it for this to happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: The second 21 was the Big Money Ball number, which is
separate _ and is drawn separately _ from the first five numbers.
The Big Money Ball is always the last number on the player's Big
Game play slip. It's very common, and perfectly all right, for the
Big Money Ball to be the same as one of the first five numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you confirm reports that White House attorney Cheryl
Mills, who defended President Clinton in the Senate impeachment
trial, is being investigated by the Justice Department on charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice?
</P>
<P>
   A: Last September, Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) asked the
Justice Department whether Mills obstructed a congressional
investigation into the possible misuse of a taxpayer-financed White
House database. It was alleged that in 1996, Mills located two
subpoenaed documents suggesting that the president and Hillary
Rodham Clinton sanctioned the use of the White House database for
political purposes, such as soliciting donations, but withheld them
from a Republican-led subcommittee for months, until after the 1996
election. Mills also was accused of lying to the committee about
aspects of the database.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said she didn't believe the documents were responsive to
the subpoena when she first reviewed them, and sought the advice of
her superiors, who agreed. She denied any effort to mislead
investigators. A Democrat on the Government Reform Committee wrote
the Justice Department to say he disagreed with the Republican
referral, adding that Mills may have made a mistake, but there was
no evidence of willful obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   In its Feb. 1 issue, Time says McIntosh's request for an
investigation into the matter is still being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the NBC program ``Trinity''? I enjoyed it,
but haven't heard anything about if for months.
</P>
<P>
   A: Production has been suspended and the program has been taken
off the air, said NBC publicist Joanna Giddon in New York. The
network has no plans to bring it back. The reason Giddon cited: too
few viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently told us about new commemorative coins. Can I buy
them directly from the U.S. Mint, rather than going to a dealer who
would charge more? Where can I get more information? Is there an
Internet site?
</P>
<P>
   A: Commemorative coins are available from the Mint only for a
limited time, although they may remain available from collectors
and coin dealers afterward. Mint spokesman Michael White says only
one commemorative, the Dolley Madison silver dollar, is currently
available for direct purchase from the Mint. As of Dec. 31, the
other most recent ones _ Robert F. Kennedy; Crispus Attucks Black
Revolutionary War Patriots; and National Law Enforcement Officers _
were discontinued for direct order. The Jackie Robinson gold $5 and
silver dollar, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt gold $5, also were
closed out recently. Information: 1-800-872-6468 or 202-283-2646 On
the Internet: http://www.usmint.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain how football's ``sudden death'' works? In the
Falcons-Vikings game, for example, if Minnesota had scored in its
first possession in overtime, would the Falcons have gotten the
ball back? Or would that have been the end of the game?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the game would have been over. ``Sudden death'' is an
extra 15-minute period of play to decide a game tied at the end of
regulation play in the NFL. The period begins with a kickoff
(decided by a coin toss) and ends when one team scores, or when
time runs out. If neither team is able to score in the overtime
period, 15-minute periods continue to be played, with two-minute
intermissions in between, until somebody scores. If the Vikings had
scored first in any manner, they would have won; but of course they
didn't. Morten Andersen sealed the Falcons' victory with his
history-making 38-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw where ``Dr. Laura,'' at a big party in Atlanta
recently, raised $60,000 for her foundation. What does the
foundation do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The stated purpose of the Dr. Laura Schlessinger Foundation
is ``to provide in-kind gifts and financial grants to charities
with a 501(c)3 tax-exempt status that meet the needs of families
and children.'' Its mission statement says special attention will
be given to those services that discourage abortion and teen
sexuality; promote adoption; prevent the abuse and neglect of
children; and provide support and encouragement to stay-at-home
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's board of advisers considers requests for
assistance three times a year. Such requests must be submitted in
writing to: The Dr. Laura Schlessinger Foundation, 6520 Platt Ave.,
816, West Hills, CA 91307. Groups or individuals requesting in-kind
or financial support should not expect to hear from the foundation
until the end of the quarter in which the submission is made.
Internet users can get online information at the Dr. Laura Website:
http://www.drlaura.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta organizers projected a huge
profit. Did it make as much as predicted? What was the final tally?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Atlanta Olympics broke even. Although the corporation is
not legally dissolved, and won't be until June, the books are
essentially closed. After bills were paid, less than $20 million
was left in the bank account of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games, and that sum is going to the U.S. Olympic Committee
to cover earlier debt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the end of the Robin Williams movie ``Patch Adams,'' it's
stated that a hospital is either being planned , or has been built,
in West Virginia with a thousand doctors waiting to volunteer to be
on the staff. Where in West Virginia will it be? Where can we send
donations?
</P>
<P>
   A: The would-be hospital is so far only a group of buildings,
some half-finished, on 310 acres of West Virginia's Droop Mountain.
The real-life Dr. Hunter D. ``Patch'' Adams (portrayed in the film
by Williams) founded the Gesundheit! Institute, a health care
reform movement, more than 20 years ago. The film depicts Adams as
a maverick medical student who espouses the healing power of humor
and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   There's some controversy about the institute's funding. Adams
has been raising money for it since the early '70s. Published
accounts have put the total raised so far at $1.1 million. Adams
hopes for $25 million more to complete the project, but some people
question where the money is going, and whether the movie dream will
ever become reality. One recent article reported that there are no
patients, just two staffers who answer an endless stream of calls
and letters from people suddenly enchanted with the concept of free
health care from seeing the movie. Although the institute has its
detractors, the real-life Adams insists that $25 million from now,
a hospital will stand.
</P>
<P>
   Donations can be sent to Gesundheit! Institute, P.O. Box 268,
Hillsboro, WV 24946, or for credit-card donations by calling the
toll-free number 1-877-745-5937. General information also is
available at the toll-free number or at 304-653-4338, or online at
the institute's Website: http://www.patchadams.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), one of the House managers in the
impeachment trial who seems to be consumed by hatred for President
Clinton, ever serve in the armed forces?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about presidential pardons. What kind of crimes
may be pardoned? How does one apply for a pardon? How long does the
process take? If one actually gets a presidential pardon, does it
completely clear the crime from one's record, or is it just a
symbolic gesture?
</P>
<P>
   A: The president's pardon power extends only to ``offenses
against the United States,'' said Chris Watney of the Justice
Department. This means violations of federal law (including
military offenses), but it doesn't include state offenses, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   To apply for a presidential pardon, the applicant must file a
formal petition with the Office of the Pardon Attorney, the Justice
Department office responsible for processing pardon petitions on
behalf of the president. There's a minimum five-year waiting
period, which runs from the date of release from incarceration, or
from the date of conviction if no period of incarceration was
served, Watney said. The amount of time necessary to process a
pardon petition varies from case to case, but the process can be
lengthy and generally takes upward of a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pardon does not erase or expunge the judicial record of a
conviction, but it will remove certain disabilities imposed by
reason of the conviction for which the pardon is granted,'' Watney
added, ``and it can be helpful in obtaining licenses and other
occupational certificates. It also is a sign of forgiveness and
therefore serves to lessen the stigma associated with the
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Photos of Chief Justice William Rehnquist show stripes on the
sleeves of his robe. What's the significance?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported previously, Rehnquist is the first modern-day
Supreme Court member to depart from tradition and wear something
other than a plain black robe. His bold, gold, naval-style fashion
statement dates to 1995, when he appeared at the State of the Union
address displaying four gold stripes on each sleeve. The inch-wide
horizontal stripes were inspired, it was explained, by Rehnquist's
having seen the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera ``Iolanthe'' the
previous summer. In the operetta, the Lord Chancellor wore gold
stripes on his sleeves.

 &HT;    My day with the Tae-Bo master: I'd rather just have a pizza
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ Billy Blanks wants my ``will.'' And I'm
thinking I should've written one before coming here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want your will, I want your will!'' he barks into my ear as
I gasp like a guppy on hot pavement. ``I want your WILL!''
</P>
<P>
   I want my mommy.
</P>
<P>
   Blanks, 6 feet of glistening granite in size-13 Reeboks, is the
creator of Tae-Bo (rhymes with ``my woe''), a hybrid of aerobics,
boxing and martial arts that has Hollywood gushing and housewives
doing lunges in the living room. His infomercials have sold a
million video sets since August, and his L.A. gym has celebs lining
up (``they have to wait like everyone else,'' says Blanks' manager,
Jeff Greenfield).
</P>
<P>
   Today, Blanks _ who's in South Florida for the Super Bowl _ is
leading a session on the basketball court at the Eden Roc Resort &AMP;
Spa. This, my friends, is the county seat of the Land of the
Beautiful People. Fake breasts, fake nails, fake hair, perhaps, but
you can't fake being in shape. Really good shape.
</P>
<P>
   These folks are, and I'm not. It's like Baywatch here, what with
all the chiseled physiques. And I wandered in from The Drew Carey
Show.
</P>
<P>
   There's 40 minutes of Tae-Bo to go, and Blanks isn't cutting any
slack. When a gal on the front row (a skinny gal! ha!) saunters off
and sits down, he escorts her back to class.
</P>
<P>
   Blanks, mind you, isn't a militant motivator a la Susan Powter.
He's more like a concerned parent who won't let you quit no matter
how hard you beg.
</P>
<P>
   He's Cliff Huxtable with a beefcake bod and a headset
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The session begins with a deceptively gentle warmup _ easing our
heads from side to side, walking in place, squatting, then standing
up straight. But next comes gravity defiance. Knee in the air,
kicking out to each side, thighs wailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put most of your weight on your butt,'' he instructs.
</P>
<P>
   Can't you see that it's already THERE?
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing about working out is you've got to
have a purpose. You've got to focus on every move.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Erie, Pa., Blanks' purpose became karate, which he
took up to imitate his idol, martial arts legend Bruce Lee. The
fifth of 15 kids (10 boys, five girls), Blanks was a shy, clumsy
youngster who suffered from dyslexia, which wasn't diagnosed until
35.
</P>
<P>
   His dad was a foundry worker, his mom, a homemaker. The family
lived in a ghetto, and young Blanks toiled as a garbage man to pay
for karate lessons.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were both Christians, he says before class. ``They
taught me that no matter what I do, God comes first. They taught me
how to share and love.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 20, Blanks was wed to high school sweetheart
Gayle Godfrey, who had a 2-year-old daughter, Shellie, from a
previous relationship (Shellie, now 25, works as a trainer at
Blanks' gym). ``We'd only gone out for a year, so we didn't really
know each other,'' he says. ``We married out of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the couple had a son, Billy Jr. (now 22, who also works
with Dad), and four years later, Blanks was named captain of the
U.S. Olympic karate team.
</P>
<P>
   The team didn't compete, though, because the States boycotted
the Summer Games in Moscow. But Blanks, now 43, went on to rack up
seven world karate titles, including 36 gold medals in
international bouts.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Olympians today in the Eden Roc gym, just folks
leaping about in reflecting pools of their own sweat. I, meanwhile,
am using my notepad as a crutch. When my lungs feel like they're
going to burst through my heaving body like that gooey creature in
Alien, I reach for my pen to jot ``reporter thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I'm writing letters to family. Grocery lists. War &AMP;
Peace, Part II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just doin' my job!'' I holler to Blanks, who, wise to my scam,
delivers The Eye. Ashamed, I rejoin the jab sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Twist at the waist, punch left, punch left. Twist at the waist,
punch right, punch right. Blanks is big on technique _ no
limp-armed air slaps like tussling schoolgirls on a playground.
He'll pluck you from the crowd and correct you on your form.
</P>
<P>
   Kindly, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Tae-Bo's like boxing, but there are no gloves. It's also like
karate, but there are no opponents (unless you mistakenly TKO the
poor schmuck next to you).
</P>
<P>
   Slip in some hip-hop tunes, and behold! Your class roster
includes Pamela Anderson, Paula Abdul, Brooke Shields and Neve
Campbell. Even the prince of the puck, Wayne Gretzky, and hoopster
Shaquille O'Neal. And, oh, don't forget Queen Latifah, Ashley Judd
and comic Sinbad.
</P>
<P>
   Blanks, however, isn't one to drop names. He'd rather we drop
our elbows to our waists during the uppercut punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your waist,'' he yells, ``is your shock absorber.''
</P>
<P>
   My waist, kind sir, is my chocolate absorber.
</P>
<P>
   A TV cameraman trails Blanks as he weaves through the gym, and
he wheels around, gets inches from the lens and bellows, ``You GOT
it, brother, right HERE!!''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of class, though, Blanks is low-key, exhibiting the
quiet confidence of someone who gets up at 5 each morning to do 40
minutes on the Lifecycle, 20 minutes on a rowing machine, 1,000
sit-ups and then some.
</P>
<P>
   His fitness level, though, isn't the only thing that makes him
proud. So does his gold wedding band and his silver WWJD? bracelet,
which stands for What Would Jesus Do?
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Blanks left Pennsylvania _ where he worked at a
chemical plant _ for Boston. He continued training, taught karate
and toyed with boxing. Just four years later, he won a
Massachusetts Golden Gloves title in the light heavyweight class.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Blanks split for L.A., where he first worked as a
bodyguard for Catherine ``Daisy Duke'' Bach. (``She liked to
flirt,'' he recalls, smiling. ``I often had to step in. The job was
awesome.'')
</P>
<P>
   While watching over Bach on location in the Philippines, Blanks
was cast in his first flick, Bloodfist, already in production
there. In 1990 he played a crazed, gun-toting football player in
The Last Boy Scout, then moved on to a string of B-list martial
arts films (i.e., Expect No Mercy, Tough and Deadly, Balance of
Power).
</P>
<P>
   TV credits, meanwhile, include the starring role on Soldier of
Fortune and guest spots on Street Justice and Spenser For Hire. At
the same time, Blanks was refining Tae-Bo, which stands for Total
Awareness, Excellence, Body Obedience. Also, Tae is the Korean word
for leg, and bo is short for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Blanks was technical director for a kick-boxing scene
in Ally McBeal. (Ally, by the way, sports a size 2. I, you should
know, do not.) Time for true grit, literally
</P>
<P>
   Blanks had warned me that anybody could survive the first half
of class, but the second required clenched-teethed tenacity. By
now, even Eden Roc's supremely fit spa director and aerobics
coordinator are endangering their dental work.
</P>
<P>
   We're down on all fours, ``leg up so the thigh and knee are
parallel to the ground like your foot's holding a cup of coffee.''
Kick out. Again, again, again. Kick out. Again, again, again.
</P>
<P>
   I joke that the blue plastic wristbands we received upon arrival
(to verify a $45 payment for the session) look like hospital issue.
``Will make it (pant) easier (pant) when the ambulance arrives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Blanks begins our cooldown and has us ``sway as if we're being
blown by a gentle breeze.'' He doesn't add ``after being gutted by
gale-force winds.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being hooked up in Hollywood, Blanks is a man of simple
bliss. No Ferrari in the garage, just a Ford F150 pickup. No
leftover caviar for breakfast, just an O Henry bar and a Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people sacrifice to lose weight,'' he says as water
bottle-clutching refugees stagger to the door. ``That's not what
it's about. It's about doing what's good for you. If you ask, God
will give you the will and endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll settle for a pizza and an ice pack.

 &HT;    PBS chronicles 100 years of black arts
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Who produced the musical ``In Dahomey'' that
opened on Broadway in 1903? What became of sculptor Augusta
Savage's commissioned piece ``The Harp''?
</P>
<P>
   What question destroyed ballet dancer Raven Wilkerson's career
in America?
</P>
<P>
   Why did poet Gwendolyn Brooks stop using rhyme after 1967?
</P>
<P>
   These questions are answered during the six-hour PBS series
``I'll Make Me a World: A Century of African-American Arts'' that
captures the stories behind African Americans' artistic legacy in
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The series pays tribute to the legends, such as actor Paul
Robeson, writer Zora Neale Hurston and musician Dizzy Gillespie,
while telling what happened to those who may not be as well-known,
such as Wilkerson and Savage, whose career triumphs and tragedies
illustrate the bittersweetness of being an African American artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is particularly impressive is the variety of artists,''
Joni Jones, an Austin performance artist and an associate professor
at the University of Texas, said during a preview screening of the
series. ``They are not showing one art form; they are sharing the
complexity of the arts and the artists. That is a real strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hampton, who created and produced the three-night series,
died in November from bone marrow disease. He was the producer of
the Emmy-winning series ``Eyes on the Prize,'' which told the
stories of the not-so-famous names in the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton and his production team at Blackside Inc. organized
``I'll Make Me a World'' in hourlong segments against the backdrop
of American history, starting at the turn of the century with
vaudeville stars Bert Williams and George Walker. Instead of
relying only on old photographs and crude film footage, the lives
of these groundbreaking actors are movingly told through a
contemporary stage play. Actor Ben Vereen gives a wrenching
portrayal of Williams, who reveals the pain and humiliation of
racism and segregation experienced by the black performers of his
era. He tells his story while slowly removing the blackface makeup
he must wear if he wants to work.
</P>
<P>
   The next segment traces the rise of jazz and blues music and the
Harlem Renaissance, which was heavily financed by white patrons who
were fascinated with ``Negro'' entertainment. The literary giants,
such as Langston Hughes and Hurston, are given their due, but the
cultural critics offer perspective on the conflict that arose over
what African American art should do.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a progressive black person at the beginning of the
century was to consider the meaning of your success and its impact
on race,'' said Edmund Barry Gaiter, a museum director who talks on
the issue. ``Many people took the posture that our job was to lift
the race, to defend the race, to put forward the best view of it
and to make our lives the wedges that would open a larger space for
those who came behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second installment, the series examines African American
artists and their work at midcentury. It was a time when several
artists were breaking racial barriers in dance, acting and music.
Some moved to Europe, particularly to France, so they could have
the freedom to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes as a great shock to discover the country which is
your birthplace and to which you owe your life and your dignity has
not, in its whole system of reality, evolved any place for you,''
said writer James Baldwin, explaining why he moved to France in the
footsteps of writer Richard Wright and performer Josephine Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The midcentury is when Wilkerson and Savage built their careers.
The light-skinned dancer quietly joined a white ballet company
while Savage built a community-based art school that influenced
artists such as painters Jacob Lawrence and Gwendolyn Knight.
</P>
<P>
   The most vivid part of the series is its final two hours, which
examines the rise of the Black Arts Movement, the Motown sound and
the artistic forms _ spoken-word art and hip-hop music _ that
dominate today's post-Black Arts era.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to be told about the charismatic power of
poet-playwright Amiri Baraka, and it's another to see it for
yourself in film footage. The series shows Baraka reading a poem at
the Congress of African Peoples in Atlanta in 1970 and you
understand why a crowd went wild when he walked in during Gwendolyn
Brooks' poetry readings at Fisk University.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks explains that the young poets who gathered at home for
salon-style readings, such as Sonia Sanchez, Nikki Giovanni and
Haki Madhubuti, so changed her views on her work that she changed
publishing houses and even stopped straightening her hair. ``I
wanted to be natural,'' said Brooks. ``I love that word _
natural.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic events occurred among artists and museums,
particularly in New York. In 1968, the Whitney Museum of Art opened
an exhibit entitled ``The 1930s: Painting and Sculpture in
America.'' No African American artist's work was represented. Black
artists protested by picketing the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later painter Romare Bearden had a solo exhibit at
the Museum of Modern Art and playwright August Wilson saw it: ``It
was one of the very few times that I could see black life presented
in all this richness and fullness, and yet not be sentimental. And
I think this is one of the things that I valued and appreciated
most was the lack of sentimentality and this bold and affirmative
grace.''
</P>
<P>
   African American artists continued to move their work beyond the
expected in the 1980s and the 1990s. The series shows how visual
artist Kara Walker and dancer-choreographer Bill T. Jones
re-examine stereotypes in their art forms.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says he changed his perspective on his art after the death
of his partner from AIDS: ``Don't wait around to talk about the
stuff that's really big for you. And you have no reason to be
afraid of anything, since you may die. And you have as much freedom
as you will take.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kellie Jones, a curator and cultural critic says: ``There has
been the `Cosby Show' on television. Spike Lee has been making
movies for 10 years, so that's all in place. People can see these
images, so there's no need to always have this positivity and very
serious, somber images as the `real' us. There is freedom to poke
holes in these kind of stereotypes.''

 &HT;    Fashion: Buchman designs for daily grind, not Oscar glory
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Dana Buchman is her own best model.
</P>
<P>
   She slips easily between two mannequins at Bloomingdale's,
smiles calmly for a photo, then walks, impeccably postured, through
the maze that will be her $35-a-seat luncheon and fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   Tables of well-groomed ladies, waiting to dip into their Asian
pasta salad with soy vinaigrette, look at her approvingly as she
steps forward to deliver the pre-show remarks _ which, of course,
are off-the-cuff and warm.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby racks of her new spring designs are heavy in peach
and coral, but she wears winter's gray, light-wool pantsuit. She
designed that, also. Go ahead, feel it. She leans forward and
offers a sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   She even wins over the caterer, Jack Merklien, who stands
off-stage in shorts and a gray T-shirt, clutching an empty tray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some designers, their clothes are too outlandish,''
he says. ``But her, each piece is so simple and plain.'' (After
catering a similar event a year ago, he says, he went home to Coral
Springs with two of Buchman's suits for his wife.)
</P>
<P>
   Buchman, a Tennessee native, doesn't quite design in the fast
lane. During Fashion Week this month in New York, she will present
her collection in her showroom instead of on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   And she doesn't bother with the wear-my-dress-for-the-Oscars
pleading with celebrities. ``I'm not into that kind of promotion,''
she says. (Her Luxe line, however, does include gowns.)
</P>
<P>
   Buchman caters to women like her, the 35-and-older crowd, the
kind now waiting for her fashion show and pecking at their salads.
(If she doesn't find time for lunch, she'll snack on the bag of
salted peanuts in her purse.)
</P>
<P>
   Ever helpful, she includes terms _ Tones of Twilight, Graphic
Seductions _ on her price tags to help shoppers know what can mix
and match.
</P>
<P>
   Buchman's fans have enough money to shop on Worth Avenue in Palm
Beach, where she just opened her latest boutique. But they're not
above seeking out the sales rack, which for Buchman's visit has
been shrunk to a row of animal-print blouses ($59.99) and stuck
behind a pillar.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, her new spring jackets run in the mid-$300s, and
one silk scarf is $98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in Florida, spring doesn't really leave,'' Buchman
says. ``But it's so exciting when the first wave of the season
arrives _ it makes my heart pound.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't stay in town long _ just enough for the luncheon, a
stroll through Mizner Park (scouting a future boutique?) and a
visit with a local uncle.
</P>
<P>
   She came down with a single small bag. ``I travel with as little
as possible,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't pare down enough. ``The perfect way would have
been to wear these pants with a sweater set yesterday and this
jacket today,'' she muses. ``Then I wouldn't even have the hanging
bag...'

 &HT;    Good Stuff in Food
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Consumer Reports taste-tested typical frozen meals, the
magazine found most ``mediocre at best.'' It sampled lasagna,
chicken, Salisbury steak and fish meals. Top ratings in all
categories went to Marie Callender's and Stouffer's. The ``not so
hot'' category was filled with familiar names such as Healthy
Choice, Weight Watchers, Banquet, Lean Cuisine, Swanson and
Gorton's. The magazine's final conclusion: `` Stick with chicken or
lasagna. Think twice before grabbing frozen Salisbury steak. Just
say no to frozen fish.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE GOOD ALTERNATIVE
</P>
<P>
   Yes, cheese has lots of fat _ 9 grams in a 1-ounce cube. But
low-fat, no-fat cheeses simply have no taste. And, experts say, no
satiety. That means you're not satisfied and eat more and more. The
calories add up even if the fat doesn't. A better choice is to buy
the real thing and eat just a small amount. Pay attention to what
you're eating and savor it instead of tossing cheese cubes down by
the handful.
</P>
<P>
   A real corker of a keepsake
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's got a millennium gimmick and Dom Perignon is not
going to settle for champagne sales. The company is marketing a
cork-shaped silver box called the Keepsake Cork. Engraved with the
upcoming New Year's Eve date, it's a hinged box designed to hold
the cork you pop that night. The price is $65, plus shipping and
handling: call (800) 421-9705. Or wait until March when the silver
box and a bottle of the sought-after 1990 Dom will be packaged for
sale. Price: $200.

 &HT;    Mr. Sports will answer all who seek his knowledge
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Mr. Sports sees all, knows all, tells all.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sports is responsible for low interest rates, the budget
surplus and the painting of the Sistine Chapel. In a fair fight,
Mr. Sports would take out Stone Cold Steve Austin in less than five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But then you knew all that. Now let Mr. Sports do his job:
Answer mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Sports: Should I go or should I stay? _ J.E.,
Denver''
</P>
<P>
   Dear John: You saw how Michael Jordan did it. He went out on top
as fans and the media threw rose petals in his path. You could do
it that way, or you could gamble on going out like Y.A. Tittle with
blood streaming down your forehead. For a good part of last season
you couldn't roll right without pulling a groin muscle. That was
your body telling you it was time. Now let your head catch up with
your body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Sports: Should I go or should I stay? _ B.E.,
Cincinnati''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Boomer: You can't be serious. You're on the ice cream
truck, man. You do one football game a week, you never get hit and
you're paid like a neurosurgeon. If you've forgotten what Monday
morning feels like after an NFL game, c'mon back. But do yourself a
favor and don't get stuck with a lousy team that can't protect you.
Hint, hint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Sports: Michael's on the golf course. Scottie's in
Houston. As usual, I don't care 'bout nuthin'. Should I go or
should I stay? _ D.R., Parts Unknown''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dennis: Give up hoops and settle down with Carmen. I see
the two of you as the new Arthur and Guinevere in Camelot. And, oh,
one other thing, Denny. Always wear pearls with your black dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Sports: Ohio State didn't want me even though I was
only tackled like maybe eight times all season. What a bummer. _
R.B., Troy''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ryan: It's hard to argue with OSU's recruiters. They are
kings of the meat market. Plus they've got 'em lined up at tailback
into the next century, so your chances there would have been
limited. I think they did you a favor. Go to South Carolina and
thrive. As Fish says on Ally McBeal: ``Bygones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Sports: I did a bad. What's my next move? _ E.R.,
Atlanta''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Eugene: Get a good lawyer and have him claim you were doing
research for your next speech. It works every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Sports: I waited forever, and finally I got a chance.
It ain't working. Any advice? _ B.G., Chapel Hill, N.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Bill: I've got more advice than Judge Judy. But you, sir,
are trapped. I can think of no man who replaced a legend and
survived. All I can think of are Gary Cunningham, Phil Bengtson,
Earle Bruce, Joe B. Hall, Frank Leahy, Ray Perkins and a dozen
others. My advice: Keep your suitcase packed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Sports: I finally did it. I got rid of Reggie
Sanders. What's your take? _ J.B., Cincinnati''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Writer reworks novel to address bigger issues
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Like everyone who needs to write fiction, Frank
Dobson wanted more than to tell a tale. He sought to address the
big picture, to shed some light on the larger issues. He had a
story, born of a real incident back in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the premise from watching a PBS show on rational
suicide,'' he said, in which a woman with a terminal illness
planned her death. It was a premise on which could be draped all
sorts of issues; so Dobson started to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a young, gifted, black college graduate who planned
a rational suicide. His problems had to do with ghosts of the past,
a failed marriage, a failed career as a world-class sprinter and
problems with substance abuse in the family. He had high and lofty
goals that hadn't been met and felt that rather than deal with
disappointments, he'd commit suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished the book. He got an agent _ seen by many to be the
first, most difficult step toward being published. The book didn't
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson is black, and his own lofty career goals seem to have
been attained. He grew up in Buffalo, N.Y., earned a Ph.D. at
Bowling Green University and has been teaching literature at Wright
State University since 1991. So while his outward, professional
life was going nicely, his novel _ the result of countless hours of
inner work _ was stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   So he took it upon himself, removing the manuscript from the
agent's control. His efforts at selling his story to a publisher
fared no better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to rework the book after being unable to sell it
myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Dobson received awards for his poetry and short
stories, including a Culture Works grant. Finally, in late 1996,
his reworked novel sold to Sterling House, a small publishing
company in Pittsburgh. The Race Is Not Given ($11.95, paperback)
was released this month. Borders Books &AMP; Music plans an order, as
does the Barnes &AMP; Noble near the Mall at Fairfield Commons, Dobson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson thinks part of the reason his book finally sold was the
addition of a concrete reason for his main character's suicide. He
kept the failures, and added cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the cancer helped sell the book, I really do,'' he
said, adding that rational suicide is such a hot topic that the
mainstream balked at the man's decision. A terminal illness made
his action slightly more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was working on it, my dad had cancer and was fighting
it for a while. My uncle died . . . It made it much more personal.
But I see the cancer as a metaphor for the cancers we all deal
with. He's struggling with lots of issues, issues of race, of
place, his family, his failed marriage, his failed relationships
and simply not achieving those goals he's set for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobson is pleased with his book, less happy with Sterling
House's marketing ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some struggles with the title, and the rights to some
of the songs I wanted to use. But I'm comfortable with the book. It
behooves me to do what I can to get the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   So Dobson, a full-time teacher, has become a part-time marketer.
More to the point, he's started another book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as a fiction writer, so I've begun the second
novel. I'm 150 pages in.''

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Just when you think nothing is
safe from the filthy halls of commerce, you learn that, well,
nothing is safe from the filthy halls of commerce. Take my
daughter's name, for instance. A time-honored Catholic name, I
thought, even if a tad old-fashioned. My mother's name, although
everybody calls her Vera. Little did I know the name really belongs
to Archie Comics. Yep, that's right; the comic book company claims
to own the trademark. Lawyers had threatened legal action against
the father of 22-month-old Veronica Sams unless he pulled the Web
site Veronica.org. Is there anything in our society that somebody
isn't trying to own? (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Any day now I expect Texas'
jackbooted lawyer-protection police to kick in my front door and
ransack my house for my copies and upgrades of Quicken Family
Lawyer. In an touching effort to protect Texas consumers, U.S.
District Judge Barefoot Sanders has released a summary judgment to
prevent Parsons Technology Inc. from selling copies of its popular
home computer software Quicken Family Lawyer and Quicken Family
Lawyer '99 in Texas. A ban on the sale of self-help legal software
may be a defeat for the First Amendment and common sense, but it's
a slam-dunk triumph for the Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee,
which is fully funded by the State Bar of Texas and also an
extension of the Texas Supreme Court. (Nethaway, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Exterminator Mark Langford says
there's one little detail you've got to remember when you use a dog
to find termites in someone's apartment. ``One important thing is
to walk the dog before inspections,'' said Langford, an owner of
ASAP Termite Pest Control. Langford's termite-detecting beagle is
named Woody. What else are you going to name a termite dog?
Aluminum Siding? Langford has been using Woody for about a month to
sniff out the wood-eating bugs. He says Woody's the only termite
dog in Austin. ``He's got a nose on him,'' Langford said. ``I'm
going to get him his own business cards with his picture on it that
says, 'Woody, termite finder.' '' (Kelso, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One hour a week. Not
much time to educate a youngster, but when an adult spends time
one-on-one helping a child to learn, remarkable progress can occur.
The student feels valued. Learning becomes important. Someone in
authority believes he can achieve. Gov. Bush understands these
dynamics. As a candidate, he visited more than 200 schools. On
Wednesday mornings, he begins his day at Augusta Raa Middle School
a few miles from the Capitol in Tallahassee. There, in the library,
before the first class of the day, he spends an hour reviewing the
homework of a 13-year-old seventh-grader who is behind in his
studies. Since the governor has been tutoring him, the boy named
Trayvon _ whom Gov. Bush describes as ``a smart kid'' _ is already
showing signs of improvement. (Jefferson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ I was taking out a loan and trying to hedge
my bet a bit, but would you believe it? The bank balked. When the
nice lady punched in the particulars, a red band popped up across
her computer like she'd never seen before, declaring in no
uncertain terms: ``Credit Life Refused!'' (Murray, Cox News
Service) MOVED TUESDAY.

then, that hip-hop music dominated the Billboard charts during this

the country were hip-hop-oriented, including the new No. 1 album by

thought, even if a tad old-fashioned. My mother's name, although
everybody calls her Vera. Little did I know the name really belongs
to Archie Comics. Yep, that's right; the comic book company claims
to own the trademark. Lawyers had threatened legal action against

prevent Parsons Technology Inc. from selling copies of its popular

Lawyer '99 in Texas. A ban on the sale of self-help legal software

ASAP Termite Pest Control. Langford's termite-detecting beagle is
named Woody. What else are you going to name a termite dog?
Aluminum Siding? Langford has been using Woody for about a month to
sniff out the wood-eating bugs. He says Woody's the only termite
dog in Austin. ``He's got a nose on him,'' Langford said. ``I'm

   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One hour a week. Not

The student feels valued. Learning becomes important. Someone in
authority believes he can achieve. Gov. Bush understands these
dynamics. As a candidate, he visited more than 200 schools. On
Wednesday mornings, he begins his day at Augusta Raa Middle School
a few miles from the Capitol in Tallahassee. There, in the library,
before the first class of the day, he spends an hour reviewing the
homework of a 13-year-old seventh-grader who is behind in his

 Linux's Popularity Sends VA Research's Star Rising  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With large corporations like IBM, Oracle and Hewlett-Packard
embracing it, the Linux operating system now seems a sure bet to
challenge Microsoft for the hearts, minds and checkbooks of
computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, which is freely distributed across the World Wide Web,
also promises to spawn a host of successful companies providing
packaged versions of it, application software, and hardware for it
to run on.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hottest prospects is VA Research, a privately held
Mountain View, Calif., company that makes computer workstations
based on Linux. Infused last fall with financing from Sequoia
Capital, it is starting to gear up for a possible public offering
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is growing as fast as we can hire people,'' said
Larry Augustin, who started building Linux workstations in 1992
while a graduate student at Stanford University. VA currently has
about 40 employees. Augustin started the company in 1993 with a
Stanford buddy, James Vera, who today is a research staffer at the
university. Their initials constitute the VA in the company's name.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin said he was drawn to Linux for the same reasons it has
attracted millions of other users _ it's free, powerful and it can
be made to run on just about any kind of computer.
</P>
<P>
   As a graduate student, he needed a powerful computer but
couldn't afford the $7,000 price tag of a Sun Microsystems
workstation. So he cobbled together a machine and put Linux on it.
``For about $2,000, I had a system that was nearly two times as
fast as a Sun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   VA Research today makes a range of workstations, from models
selling for $1,500 to high-powered servers going for more than
$200,000. All use Intel Pentium chips.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which counts among its customers McGraw-Hill,
Bloomberg and Southwestern Bell, has been profitable since its
incorporation in 1995. Lately, however, things have really taken
off, said Augustin, noting that revenues now are growing at a rate
of 15 percent a month.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt, Augustin said, that VA Research is in the
right place at the right time. All around it, major computer and
software companies are scrambling to embrace Linux and push it into
the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, the giant database company, plans to make its software
work on Linux. IBM said recently that it will offer a Linux version
of Lotus Notes. And just yesterday, Hewlett-Packard and Silicon
Graphics announced plans to offer Intel-based computers with Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Other applications that run on Linux also are starting to
appear, spearheaded by Corel, which has released a Linux version of
its popular word processor WordPerfect. In little more than month,
500,000 copies have been purchased over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an international project coordinated by Alexandre
Julliard, a young Swiss programmer, aims to develop a way to let
Windows applications, including Microsoft software, run on Linux
computers without the need for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   If the project, named Wine, succeeds, companies that now develop
programs for Windows would enjoy a brand new market _ one that,
significantly, isn't controlled by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited that we can get applications out on an operating
system that isn't dominated by any one company,'' said Derek
Burney, executive vice president of engineering for Corel of
Ottawa, Canada. ``Linux creates a level playing field for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Further eroding Microsoft's position would be a move by
computer-makers like Dell and Compaq to introduce Intel
workstations running both Linux and Wine. They wouldn't require
Windows, thus saving the computer companies millions of dollars
they pay in licensing fees to Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Several organizations also are developing Windows-like graphical
desktop interfaces for Linux that will position it as a true
alternative to Windows for home users.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Linux clouds are starting to gather on Microsoft's
horizon _ especially overseas. The government of Mexico, for
example, plans to install Linux in 140,000 school computer labs
around the country, giving students computer access that wouldn't
be affordable if the government had to pay for Windows licenses.
</P>
<P>
   As Linux continues to pick up steam, VA Research no doubt will
face increasing competition from other computer-makers eager to
cash in by putting Linux on their systems. But Augustin feels that
his company can more than hold its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in this business for five years, and we really
understand Linux,'' he said. ``We design systems for Linux from the
ground up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not well known in the mainstream computer
industry, VA Research is well-regarded by Linux experts. ``I think
they have a very experienced management team, they've got a good
solid line of solutions, and they understand the Unix market,''
said Sandra Potter, Linux analyst with the Aberdeen Group in
Boston.

 How to Get New AOL Screen Name  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  Last year, a friend of mine became a subscriber to
America Online. He created a screen name for me and let me use his
account. This past summer, my friend died. I called AOL and asked
if I could become a subscriber with the same screen name. They said
no, I would need a new one. Because the name also was my Internet
address, it was known to all my contacts, and I don't want to lose
it. Can anything be done?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  AOL puts a six-month moratorium on the use of screen
names in accounts that are deactivated. The reason is that if the
user decides to reactivate the account during that period, he or
she can get the names back again. After six months, however, the
names go back in the pool and can be claimed by any subscriber.
That means you ought to be able to grab your name back any time
now. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF AOL: Several readers have asked if
there's any way to turn off the sound of an internal modem when
connecting to AOL. Version 4.0 of AOL's software offers a solution.
Here's what you do: Click Setup on the Sign On screen, then click
Expert Setup. (Don't worry, you don't have to be an expert to do
this.) Now, click the Devices tab, and double-click on your modem
in the list. This will display the Expert Edit Modem window. At the
right is a drop-down list labeled Speaker volume, which lets you
turn the sound off.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't know if this will work on all modems, which can be
fickle when it comes to cooperating with the rest of your system.
But it can't hurt to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, I bought a Palm III. Prior to that, I kept all my
business contacts in Outlook 97. Is there a way to transfer the
addresses from that program to the Palm? It would save a lot of
time because I wouldn't have to manually enter all the information.
</P>
<P>
   A: You've got a couple of options. The easiest is to export the
contacts from Outlook into a text file, then import them into the
Palm Desktop. (The Desktop is software that runs on your PC and
lets you transfer information to the handheld Palm III.) To export
your data, open the Outlook contact list, choose Select All from
the Edit menu, then use the ``Import and Export'' option in the
File menu. Save the file as a comma delimited text file. Then open
the Palm Desktop, choose Import and follow the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to use Outlook as the personal information manager
for your Palm III, you'll need software that lets you synchronize
the two. The leading program is Puma Technology's Intellisync 3.0
for PalmPilot, which has a street price of $50.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Windows 98 computer, and it has a ``Print Screen''
key. But when I press the key, nothing prints. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Print Screen key is a holdover from the days of DOS, the
operating system that dominated the PC industry in the days before
Windows. It still works ... but in a roundabout way. In today's
computers, Print Screen sends an image of the screen to the Windows
clipboard _ a temporary holding area for information that you copy
and then paste elsewhere. Once you've saved the screen onto the
clipboard, you can open up Word or another word processor and paste
it into a blank document. Then print the document.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently installed the beta of Internet Explorer 5, with
Outlook Express. The default type size is 10 points, which I find
too small when composing messages. Is there an easy way to increase
the size?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. Go to Options in the Tools menu of Outlook Express,
then tab to Compose, where you'll find an option for changing the
type style and size.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hey, all you iMac owners. If you're looking for something to
take the place of the floppy disk that your computer doesn't have,
consider the new Universal Serial Bus version of Iomega's popular
Zip drive. It's really fast _ in fact, in tests I conducted, it
rivaled the speed of a floppy or hard drive. And the cartridges
hold 100 megabytes of information apiece. List price for the latest
Zip is $150. And by the way, it also can be used with a Windows PC
that has a USB port.

`HOMICIDE' COPS GET HANDS-ON LESSON IN INTERNET CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT BEER   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A serial killer is mutilating young girls,
posting grisly video clips of his handiwork on the World Wide Web.
To catch the video producer, the police give chase on the Net,
diving into the arcane culture of the on-line world with its
confusion of addresses, chat rooms and fake e-mail drops.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens on the Feb. 5 episode of NBC's ``Homicide:
Life on the Street,'' the critically acclaimed police program that
airs 10 p.m. EST (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   To help the show's old-school detectives navigate through the
intricacies of an on-line crime investigation, ``Homicide'' writers
turned to Alex Wellen and Luke Reiter, two young lawyers who host
the ``CyberCrime TV'' broadcast on a computer-based television
channel in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to us with the concept of a murder that would be
broadcast live on the Internet,'' said Reiter, 28, a former
district attorney in Queens, New York. ``They wanted to know
whether or not it was technologically feasible for somebody to do
what their made-up killer could do on-line.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair's answer was enough to create a multimedia extravaganza
that should satiate even the most die-hard ``Homicide'' fan.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the ``Homicide.Com'' episode airs on NBC, the Web
site for the program _ called ``Second Shift'' (www.homicide.com) _
will begin showing a pre-TV show episode. Using New York-based
actors, ``Second Shift'' will feature the preliminary investigation
of a mysterious, shocking on-line film of a murder. The Web site
detectives investigate the authenticity of the video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Then the TV show takes over, where Lt. Al Giardello (Yaphet
Kotto), Detective John Munch (Richard Belzer) and the other
fictional gumshoes from the Baltimore homicide bureau track down
the killer. ``Second Shift'' takes over after the TV episode for
some post-investigation work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show will flow back and forth between the Web and TV,''
said Ayelet Sela, a writer/producer of the Web site. ``We're going
to be laying some new ground here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they were looking to us for was to try figure out how
detectives would go about investigating this kind of a high-tech
murder,'' said Reiter, who spent his DA days chasing New York
homicide officers. ``They wanted to show how old-school detectives
would investigate a murder on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an easy gig for Reiter and Wellen, who have been
reporting on on-line crime and other stories since the ZDTV
computer channel was launched last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we helped show them how to sustain a story that had a
lot of high-tech angles,'' said Wellen, a civil lawyer from
Manhattan. ``That's because we've been into all aspects of this
stuff for quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiter said he and Wellen, who attended Temple Law School in
Philadelphia together, were invited to Baltimore in December to
observe the ``Homicide.Com'' episode being filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that was interesting,'' said Wellen, who used the chance
to create his own segment on the experience for ZDTV. The project
was mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really helped make the show work,'' said Sara Charno, a
``Homicide'' writer and co-producer. ``For example, in a regular
mundane murder, you look for fingerprints, hair and witnesses,''
Charno said. ``In a cybercrime, we had to show what steps you take
to trace information. ... We had to show how a criminal could erase
his on-line traces.''
</P>
<P>
   Charno also used tips from Wellen and Reiter to avoid what the
television and movie industry calls ``Internet syndrome'' _ endless
scenes of a character parked in front of a computer screen, typing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Charno, ``Homicide'' producer Jay Tobias boosted
the episode's number of scenes to 80 from the usual 40 to 60. ``We
wanted the pace to be fast and furious,'' Charno said.
</P>
<P>
   The network experience has Wellen and Reiter thinking of further
moves into new venues, including a novel and a pilot for a
fictional crime TV series. ``It'll be the next wave in law
enforcement drama on TV,'' Reiter said. ``Its about time for a new
kind of crime show.''

FEVER HEATS UP FOR INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERRY ACKERMAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took nine months of negotiations, but Brookstone Inc., the
New Hampshire-based retailer of unusual tools and household
widgets, has won control of a coveted Internet address.
</P>
<P>
   The price for www.brookstone.com was an unspecified amount of
free on-line advertising, which Brookstone will provide the
golf-course management company that held rights to that address as
part of its operations at a Georgia country club.
</P>
<P>
   No value was set for the promotional messages. But whatever it
turns out to be, said Jonathan Linden, a Brookstone lawyer, ``it's
not $3.3 million.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Compaq Computer Corp. acknowledges it paid last year
for www.altavista.com, the address World Wide Web surfers type into
their browsers to gain access to Compaq's highly rated AltaVista
search engine.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet fever grips Wall Street, on-line addresses _ such as
amazon.com and etrade.com _ are taking on economic lives of their
own, fueling a subindustry whose players include companies with
expertise in brand-name development, Internet providers who see
opportunities knocking, litigators versed in trademark law _ and a
new breed of cybersavvy speculators.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, who detractors refer to as ``cybersquatters'' or
``cyberpirates,'' hoard, buy, sell, and rent Web addresses with
potential to fetch a high price as a brand name or, perhaps, be
held for ransom. Prices for these addresses _ known formally as
domain names _ usually aren't publicized, but the Internet world
buzzes frequently with reports of deals done at $10,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's buyout of altavista.com, from AltaVista Technologies of
Carlsbad, Calif., which owned it long before the search engine was
introduced, is considered a record. But others of note include the
purchase of tv.com for $15,000 by CNET and the $150,000 paid by a
trade show producer for www.business.com.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of all these undertakings are two core facts,
according to Thomas Barrett, general manager of Namestake.com, a
Boston company that researches Internet-name usage.
</P>
<P>
   One is that, while domain names aren't necessarily in short
supply _ any combination up to 22 letters or numbers is valid _
those most likely to stand up as brand names are going fast.
</P>
<P>
   And as electronic commerce grows, Barrett says, ``branding on
the Web becomes more important than branding in the analog world _
indeed, companies that normally would not have worried about
trademarks in the analog world now worry about it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The second is the cash-flow potential reflected by the more than
1.9 million domain names issued so far in the United States _ names
such as boston.com, aol.com, or lycos.com _ by Network Solutions
Inc. of Herndon, Va., whose federal contract to register domain
names is being phased out.
</P>
<P>
   Just keeping those registrations active, at $35 a year, will
generate $67 million this year _ a base business on which Network
Solutions, which is publicly traded and has seen its share price
soar recently, is building for a future that could bring major
changes in the way domain names are issued.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year old, Namestake.com operates an automated,
on-line search service that can deliver, also on line, detailed
reports about what names are already gone in a multitude of
categories _ not just .com, .net, or .org, the ``big three'' of the
hierarchy available to the public in the United States _ but 247
others designated for use abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Some Namestake searches are free, including name-by-name reports
on US site registrations. These are also available on line and
without charge at the Network Solutions's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But Namestake's strength is the reports it does for a fee on
usage of brand names and their clones, drawn from foreign
domain-name databases and from trademark data maintained by its
parent, Thomson &AMP; Thomson Inc. of Quincy, Mass., an intellectual
property research firm and a subsidiary of Thomson Financial
Services.
</P>
<P>
   A sample search for use of the name Harvard in Internet domain
names turned up 54 US registrations, including names, addresses,
and phone numbers. Only 15 were related to the university. Nineteen
others were turned up abroad, including public relations companies
in Germany and France _ but with fewer details than the US files
produced. The posted price for that search was $200.
</P>
<P>
   For no extra charge, Namestake also reported Harvard was being
used in 485 trademark registrations around the world, 239 of them
in Europe and 33 in Canada. For an added fee, it would give
details.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett says Namestake.com, which began operating last August,
records about 40,000 site visits weekly. Many come from the 72
partners Thomson &AMP; Thomson has signed up to carry Web-page links to
steer customers to Namestake. Network Solutions is one; dozens of
others are Internet service providers, or ``hosting'' companies
that maintain server computers where domain-name holders can rent
space to hold their Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not selling advertising and we don't plan to,'' Barrett
said. He declined to disclose Namestake's revenues to date,
although an on-line trademark research service Thomson &AMP; Thomson
began in 1997 took in $2.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Namestake users include corporate chief executives and small
businesses. Barrett believes many are looking not for open domain
names but trademark infringements, which Namestake software finds
by seeking out both exact matches and names that resemble key words
that users type in.
</P>
<P>
   Another sample search found dozens of plays on Yahoo, a
trademark for a popular Internet search engine _ including Ya-Hoo,
Y-a-h-o-o _ and one that Yahoo Inc. is contesting, YaHooka, which
bills itself as ``the guide to marijuana on the Internet'' but
asserts that it ``is in no way affiliated with Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the lawyers come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trademarks are valuable properties and to the extent that
domain names are another place to slap your trademark, they have
additional value,'' says Diane Thilly Cabell, a lawyer with
Fausett, Gaeta &AMP; Lund in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases in which domain names containing trademarks are
put into use, Cabell said, ``cybersquatters and name grabbers have
been kicked out whenever a trademark owner has taken them to court,
as having no reasonable right to use those names.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop speculators, who argue that unless a name
is put into use, there is no infringement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, six days before Exxon Corp. and Mobil Oil Corp.
announced merger plans last Dec. 1, and continuing for a week
afterward, five speculators _ one each from Japan, South Korea,
Singapore, Canada, and the United States, according to records _
laid claim to 11 Internet addresses that joined the names of the
two oil-industry giants. Among them: exxonmobil.com,
mobilexxon.com, exxon-mobil.net, exxon-mobil.org, and, in a subtle
variation, exxon--mobil.org _ with two hyphens.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. VanEtten, of Abbottsford, British Columbia, said Exxon and
Mobil lawyers sent letters via Federal Express demanding he give up
the four names that he registered.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, he said his reply was brief. ``If they
are interested, they can offer me a price.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Etten, a freelance computer consultant, said he holds other
domain names incorporating business names. He calls them
investments, and said he began collecting them after meeting a
Toronto speculator who claimed to have been offered $500,000 for
the domain name ElvisPresley.com _ but who refused to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Van Etten says he hasn't sold any of his names, either.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach, though, is to squirrel away domain names and
then rent out the use of them.
</P>
<P>
   MailBank.com Inc., based in Vancouver, British Columbia, but
incorporated in Nevada, says it has more than 12,000 domain names
registered in the United States with endings of .com, .net, and
.org.
</P>
<P>
   Many are family names, including Smith and Jones. Others are
related to jobs or personal traits, including economist.net,
bulldozer.com, realestatemarket.com, genealogist.net, and
oddballs.com.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Sumpton, the company's president and a cofounder, said
customers can rent e-mail addresses at domains of their choice for
$5 a year, plus monthly charges for the e-mail service. If they
want a subdomain _ www.john.smith.net is an example _ they can rent
that, too, at a higher fee. MailBank.com also designs and stores
Web pages for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   With startup costs of $1.2 million and registration renewal fees
alone of $420,000 a year, the three-year-old company is only now
starting to make money, he said. A few domains have no subscribers
at all. The largest, smith.net, has fewer than 500.
</P>
<P>
   Sumpton shrugs off charges of being a ``cybersquatter,'' and
says he has so far resisted demands by McDonald's Corp. to stop
using Web names containing TheMcDonalds, McLamb, and McMaster.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, MailBank.com did lose a suit brought by
Avery Dennison Corp., the office supplies manufacturer, over use of
avery.net. ``They had avery.com and they wanted everything,''
Sumpton said. The ruling is under appeal.

PLAYING ARCHITECT ON YOUR PC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all started in December 1994, when my wife and I decided to
spend Christmas vacation at a quaint little inn on Martha's
Vineyard. We made the mistake of picking up one of those little
real estate guides. By the following May we'd bought a little house
in Vineyard Haven that was quite picturesque, but also in desperate
need of repair. Today, nearly four years later, the renovations
still aren't finished.
</P>
<P>
   Last month my attempts at finishing the ongoing work hit a snag.
I was thinking of turning a porch into a few extra bedrooms when
the housing inspector told me that he wanted to see some
architectural drawings before anything got serious. Meanwhile, my
electrician asked me for some plans for the older part of the
house, so that we could plan where to install a number of new
circuits, light switches, and outlets.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later I was shopping in Staples when I saw a whole
category of home software: three-dimensional architectural design
tools. I had never noticed these boxes before; suddenly they were
very interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything needed to plan a new home, remolding project, deck,
and visualize new exterior landscaping,'' screamed the
advertisement on one box. ``Now anyone can easily visualize
remolding and decorating ideas in no time! said another.'' Here was
a way that I could recreate the missing plans to my 150-year-old
house, design the new addition, and do it all without hiring an
architect! And all for $59.95! What a deal!
</P>
<P>
   Now mind you, I never believed this hype for one moment. But I
did think that I might be able to use one of these programs to
create a rough set of plans and save me a few hundred dollars in
architectural fees. And indeed, after spending nearly 40 hours with
Broderbund 3D Home Deluxe, Sierra's Home Architect 2.0, and Planix
3D Home Designer, I'm still convinced that these programs are
useful to the layman. But don't think that they will make you an
architect.
</P>
<P>
   All of these programs let you create a rough set of plans, then
build a three-dimensional model of your home, view it from any
perspective, and furnish it with objects. And all of them have
special calculators and other kinds of gimmicks, like tools for
calculating the number of tiles you will need for a bathroom, or
the optimal location for a home satellite TV dish.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I found Broderbund's 3D Home Deluxe far easier to
use than its competitors. 3D Home Deluxe is like a paint program,
except that instead of painting with a brush, you paint with a tool
that puts down 2x4 stud walls. Draw four walls in a rectangle, and
you've made a room. Click on the icon of a door, then click a wall,
and you've just installed a door. Windows go up the same way. My
only complaint had to do with making changes: the program requires
that you select and change each wall one-at-a-time, rather than
allowing you to make multiple selections and change them all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   The programs by Sierra and Planix take a different approach.
Instead of starting with walls, these programs start with rooms,
each represented by a rectangle or other suitable shape. By
dragging these rooms around your screen, you create the floor plan
of your fantasy house. When you are happy with the design, you draw
the exterior walls. Although you can create some pretty creative
plans this way, you're also likely to end up was some structures
that are fairly difficult, if not impossible, to build.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra and Planix are stronger in the interior decorating
department. They have many different wall textures, interior
fixtures, pieces of furniture, and so on. The Sierra program is
heavily oriented toward three-dimensional design, with
photo-realistic rendering of furniture and walls. You can then
create your own 3-D walk-through and mini-movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra does its three-D rendering in the background, a help on
even fast machines, since rendering takes a lot of time. The
program also has cute little instructional videos that play every
time you switch into a different module. Unfortunately Sierra keeps
all of these videos, plus the modules themselves, on the CD-ROM,
which must be inserted in the drive in order for the program to
run. This may be a clever form of copy protection; unfortunately,
it also makes the program run very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   My least favorite program was Planix. Created by Autodesk, the
program is similar to the company's high-end AutoCAD program for
the kind computer aided design done by the pros. This makes the
Planix pretty alien to the users of most desktop software. Planix
menus, icons, and toolbars don't work like other PC programs that
you might be familiar with. And unlike Broderbund's program, which
tries understands that connected walls should stay connected,
Planix is very manual: if you want to resize a room, you'll need to
move several walls, one after another.
</P>
<P>
   None of the programs that I tried had any sort of architectural
smarts _ not even simple concepts, like the fact that it's a good
idea to put your second floor bathrooms over your first floor
bathrooms, or the importance of building central walls that can
support the weight of the upper floors. Nor did the programs
understand plumbing or heating systems, although they do offer
limited electrical planning capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem that I found with these programs is that they
really don't understand the way we build houses in New England.
Many of the sample plans included on the CD-ROMs put the heater on
the first floor, rather than in a full basement, where it belongs.
I think that this is because these programs were all designed in
either Northern California or Seattle, and they show their regional
biases.
</P>
<P>
   But my biggest complaint about these programs isn't their lack
of architectural intelligence, but their limitations as Windows
applications. All the programs I reviewed were created for the
older Windows 3.1. None of the programs worked properly when I
installed them in the Program Files directory; the space in the
directory name caused them to malfunction. Planix doesn't even
support long file names.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these problems, I was able to use the Broderbund's 3D
Home Deluxe to make a relatively complicated set of plans for my
house on the Vineyard. Now I finally understand why I don't have
any closet space.

WHEN FRIENDS BECOME THE SOURCE OF E-MAIL CLUTTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you have e-mail overload? Is your mailbox overflowing with
joke files, chain letters, random musings, political treatises, or
knee-jerk petitions? Do you get lost in your in box, searching
desperately for that urgent memo from your boss and all you can
find is a Dr. Seuss-style poem about Zippergate or a recycled
rumor, long since proven false, about designer Tommy Hilfiger?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you're not
alone. You're receiving what what I call spam from friends, or
fram, for short. Technically, the notion of spam from friends is an
oxymoron: Spam is netspeak for odious, unsolicited mail hawking
get-rich-quick schemes or adult entertainment. Spam is a legal
issue; fram is not. But it can become cumbersome or downright
annoying when you're bombarded with too many promises of good humor
or good karma when you're busy researching a serious topic (like
Internet jokes). It's a problem, and it's getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last week revealed that 41 percent of Americans
use the Internet, up from 14 percent in 1995. Some 35 percent of
the population uses e-mail, up from 10 percent three years ago,
according to the survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for
the People and the Press. Those numbers indicate that roughly a
quarter of the population began using e-mail in the past three
years, which means many of them are still in the early romance
stage when they create gigantic group lists to communicate with a
few hundred of their closest confidants.
</P>
<P>
   That means more jokes. More chain letters. More petitions.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? The on-line netiquette guides don't offer a
standard way to just say no. It's awkward; these are your friends,
after all. We turned to the experts for some practical advice. Mark
Leavitt, research director at International Data Corp. in
Framingham, Mass., says, ``Just can it, delete it'' without reading
it. But what about the one time a friend sends news of a death in
the family or a windfall in the lottery?
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt points out that one way to manage fram is to sign up for
one of the free e-mail services offered on Internet portals like
Hotbot and Yahoo and request that friends direct mail to that
address. And some e-mail packages, like Eudora, have built-in
filters, so you can automatically instruct the software to direct
mail from certain people to separate folders and look at it when
you have a free week or two. (I use Lotus Notes, and Leavitt
confirmed what I discovered while searching for a filter. ``Don't
even try it; it's not easy to use,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Fram, of course, is usually well intentioned, but some of it,
particularly the chain letters, can have serious repercussions.
Computer consultant Steve Baldwin remembers what he calls the Great
Chain Letter Incident of 1993 or '94. He was working at the
publishing firm Ziff-Davis, and one of those
reach-out-and-mail-someone letters circulated around the office. It
took up so much bandwidth that it threatened to paralyze the
system, and the company issued a stiff warning to stop the
insanity. ``Chain letters, however well intentioned, are a major
violation of netiquette,'' Baldwin wrote in a recent (solicited)
e-mail. (For a history of electronic chain letters, see
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Gallery/7333/. The site, run by a
University of Kentucky student named Jennette Fulda, documents 393
missives and asks, ``Want to lose friends fast?'')
</P>
<P>
   But there is an element of superstition to those letters; you
have to cross your fingers and knock wood while deleting them.
Sherry Turkle, the MIT professor and clinical psychologist who
specializes in the social impact of technology, admits that she,
too, is susceptible to their lure. ``When I received those things
as a kid, I remember being thrilled and excited,'' she says. ``You
had to retype it five times, put the stamp on, go to the post
office. Now as an adult, they push that vulnerable little button
from my childhood, that little superstitious twinge. But at a
certain point, you have to delete it and prepare for a little bad
karma.''
</P>
<P>
   Some folks like Leavitt contend that chronic e-mailers are
addicts, a concept Turkle rejects outright. People go through
phases with e-mail, she says, and often, they use it as a coping
tool. ``It gives people a constant sense of social action,'' she
contends. ``They're stirring the pot. They're part of the party.''
Some of these folks send epistles to long group lists, confirming
that they are part of large social circle.
</P>
<P>
   But that can tap into the insecurities of the recipient. ``What
about me?'' you find yourself asking. ``Where are my 40 friends?
Where are my funny stories?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a vicious circle, this e-mail mania. Turkle predicts
there's going to be a shakedown in the urge for constant
communication. ``There is a sense that there is a new hot culture,
and there is a social anxiety about not being part of the scene,''
she says. ``But people are going to start being selective about
technology. When they experience a net decline in quality of life,
that's when they stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget: Some folks like receiving fram. It keeps them
connected, it's easy, it's intimate, it's free. But for those who
are bombarded, the simplest solution has nothing to do with
technology. It has to do with tact, with having the guts to tell
your friends you simply don't have the time to read salty jokes or
cultivate your karma at work. Let your friends know this, but by
all means, don't send the message via e-mail.

NO REASON TO BE PARANOID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I haven't watched a single episode of ``The X-Files'' this
season, and it's affecting me. I'm losing my paranoid edge. Things
just don't seem as bleak and menacing as they used to. I didn't
even freak out when I heard last week about Intel Corp.'s plan to
put an electronic ID number inside its Pentium computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've talked to Intel engineers, civil liberties
advocates, and security experts. And to my surprise, I'm still not
freaked out.
</P>
<P>
   I may be the only one who isn't. Intel's getting mail from
congressmen, an Arizona state legislator has announced a plan to
outlaw the production of the chips in his state, and privacy
advocates have called for a Pentium boycott. All in response to an
idea that strikes me as mostly harmless, and actually rather
clever.
</P>
<P>
   Intel plans to release a new line of chips this year called the
Pentium III. Each will include an electronic serial number, which
can be read with the help of a piece of software.
</P>
<P>
   Say you do your banking on line. When you open your account, the
bank sends a program that reads your chip's ID. This is filed away
with other personal information and your password. The next time
you sign on, the computer can check your chip ID as proof of your
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop says the system will provide an
extra layer of security against data thieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd not only have to steal your password'' to rip off your
bank account, Waldrop said. ``They'd also have to steal your
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The chip ID would also be a blessing for corporate users who
must manage hundreds or thousands of machines over a data network.
At a glance, the manager could identify every connected machine.
</P>
<P>
   Cryptography expert Bruce Schneier tells me it should be
possible to create a program to generate fake chip IDs, but the
Intel folks say this would be so difficult that few hackers would
waste time trying. Besides, you'd still need your victim's
password.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the Intel ID system was to be switched on when the
computer starts up. But the fury of civil libertarians and
lawmakers has led Intel to a sensible change of heart. The Pentium
III chips will be sold with the ID switched off, unless the
customer chooses to switch it on. This can't be done remotely by
some evil hacker, either. It requires a complete shutdown and
restart of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the ID is switched on, it isn't broadcast
automatically to every Web site you visit, as some early press
reports implied. Only sites that request the information will get
it. And all they get is an ID number _ not your name, address, or
shoe size.
</P>
<P>
   For a site to get any personal information, you must give it to
them, or some other Web site must sell it to them. But that's your
problem, not Intel's. If you want to keep something private, don't
publish it on the Net, or give it only to Web sites that promise
not to share.
</P>
<P>
   A number of privacy advocates dropped their opposition to the
Intel system once the company agreed to let users decide whether to
activate it. Not the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which
wants Intel to remove the technology altogether. As long as it's in
the chip, says EPIC, Web sites could require their customers to use
it. And software makers could require the chip ID as a way of
preventing piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but why drive away so many customers? There are hundreds
of millions of computers that don't have chip IDs. Meanwhile,
chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor
Corp. say they won't put IDs on their Pentium-compatible chips.
What Internet merchant or software firm will refuse all this
business, just so he can read a chip code that provides far less
information than the customer's credit card number?
</P>
<P>
   The Intel plan offers a slight improvement in computer security,
and will cause hardly any loss in privacy. A little paranoia has
its uses, and there are genuine privacy threats for computer users
to worry about. This just isn't one of them.

SEARCH TOOLS MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the recording industry struggles to cope with online
music distribution, the public is finding it increasingly easy to
search for digitally retrievable songs, both licensed and
unlicensed.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos Inc., one of the most-used Internet search services, plans
to announce Monday a vast new data base of a half-million files
available for downloading in the MP3 format _ a technical standard
that makes it easy to transmit music files.
</P>
<P>
   This new data base, at mp3.lycos.com, is a highly focused search
engine that will scour the World Wide Web for sites with MP3 files,
said Robert Frasca, general manager at Lycos, which is based in
Waltham, Mass. He said a searcher need only enter a song or a band
name to get a list of links at which the music can be downloaded.
Numerous sites provide data bases of MP3 music, but Frasca said
that none of them were major search engines and that the Lycos data
base would be ``10 times'' the size of any existing MP3-specific
search tool.
</P>
<P>
   Frasca said Lycos would not initially try to distinguish pirated
MP3 files from licensed recordings. He said Lycos was no more able
to police MP3 piracy than it could the distribution of
adult-oriented material on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a search engine; all we're doing is showing people where
the material is on the Net,'' he said. ``We're not playing cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Frasca said the company decided to create the search engine
because the fastest-growing number of queries on Lycos was for MP3
files. He said that MP3 searches were ``nonexistent'' last summer
but were now among the top five types of queries on Lycos. The new
data base will be intended specifically to support comprehensive
MP3 searches.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc., the San Jose,
Calif., company that makes the Rio, a portable device for playing
MP3 files, introduced its own MP3 file data base, called Rioport,
at www.rioport.com. The company's vice president, Ken Wirt, said
the site did not search the Internet, but instead provided links to
sites that did not contain pirated music.
</P>
<P>
   Wirt took issue with the Lycos policy on MP3 searches. ``Helping
find pirated files is not a good thing,'' Wirt, whose company has
helped stir the MP3 debate, said.
</P>
<P>
   Record industry officials have expressed fears that the Rio
would increase the demand for MP3 files, whether pirated or
copyrighted. But last October, a federal judge in Los Angeles
refused a request from the recording industry to block production
of the Rio.

WATCH THE TUBE OR WATCH THE COMPUTER? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Mark Cuban, whose company sends radio and
television broadcasts over the Internet to personal computers, told
a ballroom full of television executives here that any day now
people will use their computers to watch television, buy
merchandise from their favorite shows and even send feedback to
producers or advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow panelist interrupted. ``People don't watch technology,
they watch channels,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, a prominent
media-industry analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``Who wants to watch a
PC?''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, the co-founder and president of Broadcast.com Inc. shot
back, referring to a typical cable box: ``What's a set-top box?
It's just a stupid computer. Why not watch a smart computer?'' And
Lowell Paxson, the founder and chairman of the fledgling broadcast
network Paxnet, drew applause by telling Cuban, ``I want you to
turn every PC in the world into a conduit for my television
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Will that ever really happen? Such questions arose with new
urgency last week at the largest television trade show in the
world, called NATPE and sponsored by the National Association of
Television Executives.
</P>
<P>
   Normally at NATPE, producers and syndicators of non-network
programs meet and glad-hand their customers, the United States'
television-station executives _ people far more familiar with
``Home Improvement'' than home pages.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the Internet entrepreneurs were horning in on the
party. Both as exhibitors and as experts on NATPE's informational
panels, they clamored to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, no computer company had a booth at NATPE, and
only Microsoft made a presentation. This year, more than two dozen
new-media companies bought booths, and Microsoft's
3,200-square-foot display entwined wavy glass, sleek stainless
steel and computers with big screens featuring live video and
CD-like sound.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the convention center was still dominated by
old-fashioned NATPE pursuits. Sprawling, gaudy booths stood ready
to woo customers with free food, open bars, plush carpets and
billboard-sized blowups of the studio's stars. Conventioneers could
gawk at starlets zipped into shiny dresses, queue up to shake hands
with Pamela Anderson Lee or William Shatner, or share a cocktail
with the latest exceedingly bronzed game-show host.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the world of new media began to intrude on the
old. ``It's still a big unknown, the question of how do we make
money with it,'' said Nick Trigony, NATPE's chairman and the
president of Cox Broadcasting. ``Most guys' stations now have their
own Web sites, but frankly, they aren't too exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   New-media concepts still baffle many of the 17,000 who attended
NATPE. Many think digital television means high-definition
television, and dismiss it as a gimmick. Others understand that
digital TV simply means a digitally compressed signal that can
carry voluminous amounts of extra information with the traditional
sound and picture _ but even those people have no clue what extra
information their viewers will want.
</P>
<P>
   And so the computer mavens _ distinguishable by the sporty polo
shirts they wore instead of jackets and ties _ swooped in,
preaching the gospel of digital bits and video streaming. Steve
Klein, director of new-business development for Intervu Inc., a
company that helps people expand the reach and speed of their Web
sites, said Internet knowledge among television executives was
rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, it would have been `Streaming _ what?''' he
said. ``Last year it was `Streaming _ how?' And this year it's
`Streaming _ when?' Can you do it live? Can you do video on
demand?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, three panels during the four-day convention addressed
new-media issues. This year, 11 did, out of 31 altogether. Last
year, a seminar on how to sell ads on a Web site drew 10 people who
sat around a table together; this year, it attracted almost 100,
and aides had to drag more chairs into the room.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Molly Glover, the director of interactive marketing at Granite
Broadcasting Corp., which owns 10 television stations, helped
conduct that seminar.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 Granite stations have Web sites, and three _ in San Jose,
Calif.; Buffalo, N.Y.; and Austin, Texas _ are ``streaming'' their
news broadcasts now.
</P>
<P>
   This means people with personal computers, no matter where they
are, can watch the station's local news live, or tune in to catch
the traffic report. They do so through Cuban's company,
Broadcast.com, which announced during NATPE that it had just signed
contracts with two ABC stations _ WABC, Channel 7 in New York, and
WPVI in Philadelphia _ to stream their news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had quite a few e-mails from servicemen or other people
overseas who have watched their local news,'' Ms. Glover said.
``And snowbirds in Florida like to watch the Buffalo weather.''
</P>
<P>
   In corporate offices, Cuban likes to point out, almost everyone
has a personal computer, or PC, but few have radios or television
sets. He sees that as a huge market to be exploited by television
and radio stations, and by corporations wishing to stream speeches,
seminars or announcements.
</P>
<P>
   To get good-quality sound and video, though, requires an
expensive computer with a high-speed connection to the Internet.
And television traditionalists insist that people will never use a
computer to watch ``E.R.'' or ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' or any
other hit show, movie or sports event, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   But some day people may well use the computer for some
televisionlike functions, and the television set for some
computerlike functions. As NATPE demonstrated, the two are
beginning to mingle, if not to meld.

MAKING MONEY BY PAYING COMPUTER USERS TO READ INTERNET ADS  
 ANGRY INTERNET JOUSTING OVER SIMULATED WARFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The basic premise of Cybergold, an electronic commerce company
in Berkeley, Calif., is that the best way to get consumers to read
Internet advertisements is to pay them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It finds advertisers willing to pay people who sign up at its
World Wide Web site (www.cybergold.com) and look at the ads. It
then compensates consumers who demonstrate in some way that they
have read an ad by crediting an account in the consumer's name;
amounts range from 50 cents for downloading America Online software
to $100 for referring a new paid-up subscriber to the At Home
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Once enough money accumulates in a consumer's account, it can be
put in a bank account by direct deposit, used to pay credit card
bills or sent to a favorite charity.
</P>
<P>
   Cybergold recently received its second patent covering the
concept of offering incentives to people to pay attention to ads.
But the company's patents cover two other intriguing approaches to
advertising in cyberspace. The first is a way for consumers to
store direct-marketing information about themselves on their
computers _ like their income bracket, ZIP code, hobbies and
profession _ so they can be compensated every time they decide to
release such information to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion here is that the information about you belongs to
you and doesn't belong to anybody else,'' Goldhaber said. ``And you
can decide when you release it and whether you want to be paid for
it globally or on an ad hoc basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The patents also cover a way of turning conventional
advertising-based publishing on its head. In Goldhaber's patented
Internet publishing system, which he said the company planned to
introduce in coming months, online authors or other creators of
online content would not be paid a set fee by a publisher. Instead,
they would receive a tiny commission from each new reader, who in
turn has been paid to read an accompanying advertisement. Cybergold
would act as a clearinghouse for these transactions, effectively
cutting out the role of a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you get paid to see the ads and then you use that to pay
for the content,'' he said. ``You change the flow of money. But you
don't change the basic setup, which is that advertising supports
publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldhaber contends that these are concepts that empower people
who want to self-publish or consumers who want to compensated for
their time. But he and Gary Fitts, co-founder of Cybergold, are
coming under fire for having patented these ways of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology in
Washington, said he would press Congress to conduct hearings on
Cybergold's patents as well as other so-called business-methods
patents. Love said he disagreed with the idea that Cybergold's
system was novel enough to be patented, contending that he had
written articles on a similar concept back in the 1980s. ``And I
didn't consider myself the inventor then,'' he said. ``This is
typical of the poor quality of review they give at the Patent and
Trademark Office for this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Love described as ``dangerous'' the legal monopoly that these
patents provide, arguing that politicians would likely use such
cash incentives to get potential voters to read their material on
line. ``Suppose one candidate in a given campaign were the only one
to be given a license to the patent,'' he said. ``He would be the
only one who could disseminate information this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldhaber conceded that politicians would probably use the
system, noting that while it was illegal to buy votes, it was not
illegal to pay voters to read political tracts. ``Instead of
offering a drink down at the bar for coming to a rally,'' he said,
``you can offer a buck and let them go down to the bar and buy
their own drink.''
</P>
<P>
   But he argued that Love's concerns were unfounded. ``The
Internet is not just about hackers anymore,'' he said. ``It's about
real business. If patents are valid in other arenas, they ought to
be valid on the Internet as well. People who globally criticize
patents on the Internet are just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cybergold most recently received patent 5,855,008.
</P>
<P>
   ANGRY INTERNET JOUSTING OVER SIMULATED WARFARE
</P>
<P>
   Computer programmers were busy spewing vitriol last week on
Slashdot, an Internet site (www.slashdot.org) that proclaims itself
as specializing in ``news for nerds,'' over another Internet
patent.
</P>
<P>
   The patent, assigned to Rtime, of Seattle, covers certain
aspects of playing three-dimensional games on the Internet. One
aspect is a type of real-time data filtering that insures that only
relevant data is distributed to participants. Another is a global
time base that keeps different users synchronized within
milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have two or more people distributed across the
Internet that want to act in real time, you have to resolve slow
performance issues,'' said Chip Overstreet, chief executive of
Rtime, a company with eight full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   Overstreet said the technology was developed by programmers who
helped build the U.S. military's Simnet, a virtual-reality system
used to train soldiers for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those weighing in on Slashdot wondered whether Rtime
would try to extract a licensing fee each time someone tried to
play private sessions of Doom or Quake or other three-dimensional
games over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Overstreet declined to comment specifically on the remarks made
on Slashdot.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Snoswell, a founder of Cyberterm, a software company in
Adelaide, Australia, was one of those who derided the patent on
Slashdot.
</P>
<P>
   But after reading the patent carefully, he said in a telephone
interview, he was less concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animosity over this patent arose because it was seen as
cornering the market,'' he said. ``Initially, when you read the
patent you think it covers everything. But then when you read the
fine print, it looks a lot more narrow. It's not going to become a
generic solution over time. It wouldn't surprise me that this will
fit a niche market. But eventually that niche market will get
smaller and smaller as other technologies crowd it out of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent 5,841,980 was granted to Rolland Waters and John Allred
and was assigned to Rtime.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

TRYING TO GET IN TUNE WITH THE DIGITAL AGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the music business, it was a harbinger. A Scottish rock
band, the Jesus and Mary Chain, played during last summer's Intel
New York Music Festival, and two hours later their live performance
of ``Virtually Unreal'' was on the Internet for the group's fans
worldwide to download and listen to on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Commercially speaking, it was small potatoes: a technology
demonstration by an alternative-rock band with a devoted following
but not a mass public. Yet the uploading of ``Virtually Unreal''
presaged a day when most recorded music will be available as
digital information, distributed not on discs and tapes that have
to be manufactured and shipped, but as data files that can be
zapped instantly across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Jesus and Mary Chain gained valuable publicity from their
World Wide Web demo. But just as significant, the band and its
label, Sub Pop Records, received not a dime from the thousands of
fans who grabbed the song off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the record industry is worried. It is easy to give
music away on the Internet. In fact, thousands of songs now
circulate freely in a technical format known as MP3, an easy way to
swap recordings, authorized and unauthorized, as computer files
online. The question now facing the music business is how to sell
recordings as profitable pieces of data.
</P>
<P>
   The $12-billion-a-year recording industry is trying to catch up
to the Internet era. Just before Christmas, the major companies
announced what they wanted under their trees for the 1999 holiday
season: a uniform, industrywide standard for digital distribution
of music. And this month, a task force of recording companies,
software programmers and consumer electronics makers intends to
begin work on music's version of the Star Wars missile defense
program.
</P>
<P>
   The project, named the Secure Digital Music Initiative, aims to
make recordings available as pure digital information while letting
only the copyright owners choose how the information can be
disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   It would be, in other words, an attempt by the major recording
labels to stake out retail territory in the one part of the music
business they do not control, even as their power is being
challenged on the Internet by home-recorded musicians, independent
labels and countless mouse-wielding music fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're trying to create here is the structure by which the
content would be labeled in a consistent fashion, to serve whatever
business model emerges in the future,'' said Cary Sherman, a senior
vice president and general counsel for the Recording Industry
Association of America, which represents labels that account for 90
percent of the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   European and Asian recording-industry trade groups support the
initiative, along with hardware and software companies including
Microsoft, IBM, America Online and AT&AMP;T. To avoid antitrust
problems, any standards adopted would be voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Singer, chief technical officer of A2B Music, an AT&AMP;T
unit that produces digital distribution software, acknowledges that
the pressure is mounting. ``Every day that ticks by, there's good
news and there's bad news,'' he said. ``The good news is that the
potential client base for secure digital distribution is growing.
The bad news is that they're also getting used to not paying.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the urgency, some participants predict that the process
could drag on past next Christmas. ``These are all highly charged,
very competitive companies,'' said Gerry Kearby, chief executive of
Liquid Audio, which makes its own software for encoding and playing
back music on the Internet and has already amassed a large catalog
of digitally distributed music. ``We won't be surprised if the
process takes a little longer than announced.''
</P>
<P>
   The labels, of course, are already using the Internet to sell
conventional products _ compact discs and cassettes _ through
online retailers like CD Now, N2K and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   That business is expected to exceed $280 million this year,
according to Jupiter Communications, a new-media research company.
But the Secure Digital Music Initiative is planning for an era when
many consumers will be buying music as downloaded computer files
rather than prerecorded discs and tapes.
</P>
<P>
   With a uniform standard, embodied in computer codes that all the
major recording companies would use, consumers could receive
best-selling music directly through modems and play it back using
one kind of software.
</P>
<P>
   Once the labels agreed on a standard, a fan could jump to a top
band's or a label's Web site, bill the purchase through a credit
card, and download a song or an album, saving it to the computer's
hard drive, recording it onto a CD or transferring it to a memory
chip in a portable player. (One such portable device is already on
the market.)
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the recording company would know where the music was
sent, could specify whether or how often it could be copied, and
could tabulate royalties and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Until such a standard is developed, the labels that own the
rights to recordings by everyone from Madonna to the bluesman
Robert Johnson are unlikely to make their catalogs available for
digital distribution. But while the major labels have hesitated,
many of their holdings are already traveling the Internet as files
compressed into manageable size via MP3.
</P>
<P>
   This software format _ whose name is shortened from an
engineering designation known as MPEG-1, Layer 3 _ makes it
practical to send full songs relatively quickly over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Independent labels and individual musicians have made their
music available in the MP3 format, but the major labels are alarmed
by MP3 because the files can be copied without restriction, even
sent as e-mail. The vast majority of MP3 songs circulate free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians encourage this practice. Others shrug and
tolerate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``MPEGs of my music are all over the network,'' said the rock
songwriter David Bowie. ``Things that are embarrassingly
cringe-making, things that I swore never would see the light of
day, they're completely available.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowie has founded his own Internet service (www.davidbowie.com),
whose members have online access to rare Bowie music and videos. He
said that he was now considering making some new music available
for downloading as MP3 files, but that he had a recording contract
with Virgin Records, which he said was ``ambivalent'' about the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   And Bowie is ambivalent about the industry's Secure Digital
Music Initiative. ``I'm not sure about uniform standards,'' he
said. ``They've never appealed to me. And however much they try and
move in that direction, it ain't going to work. Quirkiness and
decentralization are what define the Internet, and the idea of
trying to formalize it and police it is abhorrent. The Internet is
so volatile and idiosyncratic that whoever tries to police it will
be beaten.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seeking Control by Standardization
</P>
<P>
   The recording companies are intent on developing software coding
standards that would specify what consumers can do with the music
they download. Some songs may be available to be copied at will, or
copied once, or not at all; some may be listened to for a day, or a
week, or forever. Other codes would direct royalties to the
appropriate recipients _ a particularly tricky process when the
global Internet meets contracts that change at national borders.
</P>
<P>
   Various pieces of such technology exist, but in an unruly
assortment of incompatible systems. So-called streaming software,
offered by Real Networks (www.real.com) and others, lets music be
heard through the computer like a radio signal, but it is not
stored.
</P>
<P>
   Other software companies like Liquid Audio (www.liquidaudio.com)
and A2B Music (www.a2bmusic.com) do incorporate the kinds of
controls the recording business wants. But the two systems are
incompatible. Other companies, including Audiosoft, are adapting
MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   As they seek technological security, the recording companies
want to avoid costly battles between competing formats, like
Betamax vs. VHS videos or eight-track cartridge tapes vs.
cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anything we achieve will be better than the status
quo,'' Sherman said. ``The status quo is simply fragmentation of
the market. Different technology providers will attempt to
encourage different recording companies to make their content
available by offering different kinds of secure systems that are
incompatible. A consumer would need multiple players, or multiple
devices, in order to hear all of the different artists that they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, for example, songs by the hard-rock guitarist Billy
Squier are available for sale as direct downloads from J-Bird
Records through AT&AMP;T's A2B Music. Fishbone offers a song for sale
through Liquid Audio. Songs by Frank Black, formerly of the
alternative-rock band the Pixies, are for sale as MP3 files sold by
Goodnoise (www.goodnoise.com), which prices its MP3 files at 99
cents for a song and $8.99 for an album.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these three formats requires the listener to have
different software for playback, although Liquid Audio recently
announced it would make the next version of its player software
compatible with MP3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process for the next five or six months is not going to be
pretty,'' said Nicholas DiGiacomo, the senior vice president and
general manager for electronic markets of the consulting firm
Scient, and an adviser to the Recording Industry Association of
America, the trade group. ``But if there's going to be a big
market, they're all going to have to play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorization: Now or Never
</P>
<P>
   For now, digital distribution is still impractical for the vast
majority of consumers. Conventional home modems cannot download
information quickly enough to make the process convenient. Even
with a 56-kilobit-a-second modem, downloading a high-fidelity song
takes at least twice the playing time of the song.
</P>
<P>
   But faster computer connections that are already available,
particularly on college campuses, make it possible to send and
receive music almost instantly. And with cable modems as well as
high-speed services from some telephone companies, those faster
connections are becoming available in a growing number of
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do this now, it's a lost opportunity,'' Sherman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unauthorized copying has long worried the music business. When
cassette tapes became popular, the recording-industry association
began lobbying for a royalty on blank tape, as compensation for the
sales believed lost to unauthorized copying.
</P>
<P>
   The Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 levied a 2 percent royalty
on the wholesale price of digital recorders and a 3 percent royalty
on blank digital tapes and discs. Even with those royalties, the
recording companies refused to release prerecorded tapes in the
DAT, or digital audiotape, format, fearing the spread of
high-fidelity digital copies. As a result, DAT is used largely by
musicians and journalists, not in home audio systems.
</P>
<P>
   Labels had refused to release prerecorded DATs to protect the CD
format, which has been a boon for the music business. The CD helped
the gross sales of recorded music grow to $12.2 billion in 1997,
the most recent year for which statistics are available, from $3.8
billion in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But for those worried about copying, the CD turned out to be a
grand strategic error. That is because every CD is a digital master
copy that can be duplicated ad infinitum. Recording and technology
companies, still hammering out the specifications for the new
generation of discs, DVD audio, are hoping to limit the potential
for copying.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, much of the music circulating on the Internet
has been converted directly from CDs to MP3 files, which in turn
can be recorded on CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives predict that a public already used to this free
flow of aural bits may resist the industry's effort to clamp down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I buy into a system that give me less control than I
have now with a CD?'' said Michael Robertson, chief executive of
MP3.com, which makes MP3 songs available from independent musicians
and labels. ``You have to give people more value if you want to
charge the same price, or you have to charge a lower price. All the
talk about security is nonsense. The major labels are circling the
wagons to preserve their current business model, the CD. But
scarcity-based models do not work on the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, digital distribution will have larger implications
for the music business. Well-known musicians, with their
reputations already established, would no longer be as beholden to
the major labels and their manufacturing and distribution
capabilities. More musicians might then follow the example of the
well-traveled songwriter Todd Rundgren, who sells $25 annual
subscriptions to his music, downloadable from his Web site
(www.tr-i.com).
</P>
<P>
   Music would not have to be packaged in the conventional forms of
albums and singles, but could be in any bundle the musicians chose.
And with store shelf space no longer defining the limits of choice,
many more selections could find their way to the market at an array
of prices.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians might also choose to make their songs available free
or cheap, build fan bases, and then make their money touring or
selling merchandise. ``What should we do,'' Bowie mused, ``give the
music away, and sell the T-shirts? Maybe we'll become salarymen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the companies in the music business make their Christmas
deadline or not, the digital clock is ticking. ``The notion that
music could be free is really something we have to contend with,''
Bowie said. ``If not, like King Canute, we're just sitting by the
sea and forbidding it to roll in.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their small office is tucked away in Washington's
eclectic Eastern Market area, bordering the seedier side of Capitol
Hill. The hours are long, the pay low and the benefits modest.
</P>
<P>
   With an annual budget of just $250,000 to cover salaries for
three full-time lawyers and three half-time helpers, they don't
even have a fax line.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with just the touch of a button, employees of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center can reach more than 10,000 people, an
international audience that is educated and technologically savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why executives from Intel Corp., facing a
boycott from the privacy center over an identification feature in
Intel's new computer chip, traveled across the country on Thursday
to meet with the center's lawyers, Marc Rotenberg, Dave Banisar and
David Sobel, aggressive advocates for protecting privacy and civil
rights in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have fancy K Street offices,'' Banisar said,
referring to the Washington street that is home to many lobbyists.
``We don't have fancy K Street salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Rotenberg said, ``we know how to use the Web. And on
the Web, this stuff really spreads like wildfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just hours after the privacy center and two other
groups, Junkbusters and the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
announced their planned boycott of Intel, the world's largest
computer-chip maker, the company reversed a plan to activate an
identifying signature in its soon-to-be-released Pentium III chip.
Privacy advocates say the feature, intended to enhance the security
of electronic commerce and safeguard against software piracy, would
make it easy for online marketers, even governments, to track
people on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although questions were being raised by more groups than just
the privacy center, the boycott did play an important role in
Intel's decision to review its plans for the Pentium III, an Intel
spokesman, Tom Waldrop, said. ``I think it is safe to say that the
concerns were heightened greatly by the three privacy groups'
issuing the threat of the boycott, but those concerns were not
new,'' Waldrop said. ``We had heard them from others, just not as
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994, the Electronic Privacy Information Center is
one of several online civil liberties groups that are playing an
increasingly visible role in the shaping of policy for the digital
age. It has often focused on the government, earning a pit-bull
reputation in fights with the Clinton administration over export
controls on computer security technology, or encryption, and the
administration's refusal to pass Internet privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   But it also has no hesitation about going after the
high-technology companies that are its allies on other issues. And
the privacy center has been quite successful defending the Internet
user.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel, a 45-year-old Miami native, played an important role in
two disputes with America Online, one a successful challenge to the
company's plan to sell customer information to marketers, the other
a high-profile lawsuit over the company's release of personal
information on a gay sailor that resulted in his discharge. America
Online has since vowed to keep such personal information about its
customers private.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg, a 38-year-old Boston native, is credited by some with
starting the digital age privacy movement in 1991 with a campaign
that forced Lotus to abandon plans for releasing a CD-ROM for
marketers with personal information gathered by Equifax Inc., one
of the nation's largest credit bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Banisar, a 32-year-old native of Baltimore, has dedicated a lot
of his time recently to studying international encryption laws,
writing reports challenging the administration's claims that its
desire to control the technology is a position supported by a
majority of countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The group has used the Freedom of Information Act to monitor the
government's actions, and has been the first to disclose, among
other things, the FBI's desire to redesign the telephone system to
ease wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think EPIC right now is sort of the pre-eminent privacy
advocacy group in the United States,'' said Joel Reidenberg, a
professor at Fordham University Law School in New York and an
expert on international privacy laws. ``Marc Rotenberg has really
taken the lead on privacy issues in pushing American public policy
toward strong, fair information practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Hoffman, a computer science professor who heads the
Cyberspace Policy Institute at George Washington University in
Washington, called the group ``the closest thing to a sort of
consumer ombudsman for privacy that we have in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ira Magaziner, who as President Clinton's top Internet
adviser often drew EPIC's harshest criticisms, said the group
played an important role in tough policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that as an advocacy group it is their role to be a
kind of burr in the saddle of policy-makers,'' he said. ``And in a
sense it is not always their job to be completely reasonable. It is
their job to make noise and get press attention. And I think they
do that very effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg, Sobel and Banisar formed the privacy center after
working together in the Washington office of the Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility. Much of their financing
comes from the Fund for Constitutional Government, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to protecting civil liberties. They also
receive money from other organizations and, occasionally,
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy center has perhaps been most visible in the
encryption debate. It has also strongly opposed the
administration's continued call for self-regulation of the privacy
practices of online marketers, pushing instead for laws to protect
consumers. It has joined the American Civil Liberties Union and
other groups in their fights against online censorship, and has
worked with Congress on privacy issues involving automated health
care records, Social Security and copyright and database
protections.
</P>
<P>
   And the list keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the environmental issue of the 21st century,'' Banisar
said.

RETURN OF A DISK-DRIVE JOCKEY  
 MARKET CHAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If any companies in the personal-computer industry are prone to
painful cycles and oversupply problems, it is the makers of disk
drives, the unglamorous but critical components that store a
computer's data. And nobody knows this better than one of the
disk-drive pioneers, Finis Conner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite his travails, or perhaps because of them, Conner is
back, and with a new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Conner's new company, Conner Technology, based in San Jose,
Calif., plans to make drives for the budget end of the market,
selling $100 drives for PCs that would be priced around $600.
Mining this low-margin end of the market, Conner is trying some
profit shortcuts, including incorporating in Ireland to cut taxes
and subcontracting manufacturers in China to trim costs.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Conner is no stranger to risk in the drive business.
Twenty years ago, along with Al Shugart, Conner co-founded what
would become Seagate Technology, the disk-drive industry's biggest
survivor. In 1986, the partners had a bitter falling out, and
Conner struck out on his own, founding Conner Peripherals. Ten
years later, despite phenomenal growth, the company became buried
in debt, battered by increasingly heavy competition. Conner was
forced to sell out _ to Seagate.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1996, and shortly afterward Conner disappeared from the
scene, self-exiled by a noncompete agreement with Seagate that kept
him out of the drive market for two years. Within a few months
after the contract expired last year, Conner founded Conner
Technology. Shugart, incidentally, lost control of Seagate last
year and was forced by its board to sign a noncompete agreement
that will keep him on the disk-drive sidelines for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Conner said his goal is to sell 2 million drives the first year
and to make his new company grow at the same rate of Conner
Peripherals, which sold $113 million in 1986 and reached $2.7
billion 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
   But it is far from certain whether Conner's model for
outsourcing will work in the crowded drive business, which has had
its share of casualties the last few years. But Conner put a
positive spin on the skepticism that greeted word of his new
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any measure of success is how much your competitors don't
understand you, we're in good shape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ LAURIE J. FLYNN &QR;

<P>
   An Online Chat to Invest In
</P>
<P>
   As if it wasn't enough to stare blankly into the computer screen
all day and watch the numbers in one's stock portfolio go
roller-coastering about, here now is perhaps another reason for eye
strain: 12 hours of live online chat with market experts daily.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and Sage, a financial site already carried on the
online service, plan to introduce this new offering Monday, in an
attempt to ``replicate television business programs,'' Stephen
Cohn, a Sage co-founder, said. He cited CNBC's ``Squawk Box'' and
``Power Lunch'' as two shows from which he'd like to woo viewers.
</P>
<P>
   As with the televised shows it seeks to emulate, the chat
service, called AOL's Market Watch, plans to offer a roster of
financial experts and pundits from the likes of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist,
John Hancock and Smart Money magazine, who will interact with users
as the day unfolds. The difference is you don't have to turn down
the volume when there's a particularly bombastic guest _ since the
``chatting'' will all be done through typed text.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect category for the online medium,'' Tom
Ziemba, a spokesman for America Online, said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the personal-finance part of its service, the company
already provides about 100 million stock quotes each day, and it
contends that more than 9 million users actively manage their
portfolios through America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide everything television can and more,'' Ziemba
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like commercials. Asked what Sage gets out of the deal besides
more work and potential users of the site, Cohn said, ``This is an
opportunity to sell marketing programs, like sponsorships and
advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   Scudder Funds, T. Rowe Price, Kauffman Funds and E-Annuity have
already signed up as sponsors.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: PATENT ABSURDITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the industrial age gets creakier, the information age is
lubricating a new economy with the flow of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas are given their literal currency through patent and
copyright laws, originally intended to stimulate innovation by
protecting inventors from idea snatchers and allowing them to
profit more easily from their talents. But some experts worry that
an increasing number of individuals and companies are perverting
that original purpose with increasingly specious claims to
ownership, as well as by stockpiling patents into competitive
arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Several examples of patent absurdity have been in the news
lately. Relatively new on the scene are ``method of doing
business'' patents, otherwise known as ``soft'' patents because
they do not actually cover a physical invention. Such patents,
which also included software, were rejected by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office as a matter of course until very recently, when
courts began overturning its refusals.
</P>
<P>
   Soft patents are frowned on by many people involved with
intellectual property because they often lay claim to some of the
most mundane activities of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for example, Internet Patent News Service,
an online newsletter, bestowed its ``Worst Method of Doing Business
Patent in 1998'' award upon Patent No. 5,851,117, granted to a
company for its blindingly original idea of using an illustrated
book to teach janitors how to clean a building.
</P>
<P>
   A patent for using a book as a teaching tool? ``This claim
should never have been written, let alone allowed,'' Gregory
Aharonian, editor of Internet Patent News Service, wrote in a
recent issue of his newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   A similar patent claim is being made against MP3.com
(www.mp3.com), the Internet music seller. MP3 has the music
industry in a panic because its Web site allows visitors to
download audio files of thousands of copyrighted songs free; it
also enables musicians to sell their CDs directly to customers,
thus bypassing record labels and pocketing much more profit.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger, Sightsound.com, claimed in a letter to Michael
Robertson, president of MP3.com, that it holds patents that control
``among other things, the sale of audio or video recordings in
download fashion over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter then asked Robertson to pay its licensing fee: 1
percent of all revenue that MP3 derives from the sale of downloaded
audio files.
</P>
<P>
   Nice work if you can get it. Robertson, however, who received
the letter last week and has posted it on MP3's Web site, notes
that MP3 does not sell the music it downloads, but gives it away.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point: a patent for downloading files over the
Internet for a fee? Given the fundamental capabilities of networked
computers, this sounds remarkably like patenting the combination of
a pencil, a piece of paper and a stamp as a method for writing a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to wonder if the Patent Office has completely lost
its mind,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Such sweeping ``method of doing business'' patents are only part
of the problem. In a recent issue of the venerable high-technology
trade journal, Electronic Engineering Times, one of its executive
editors, Ron Wilson, wrote in an editorial that ``U.S. intellectual
property law is rapidly reducing itself to absurdity,'' adding that
the patent process ``has turned into a bludgeon to crush
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson cites several examples of how various technology
companies, including IBM, Intel and Hewlett-Packard, use their vast
holdings of patents as competitive weaponry in seeking to disable
each other with infringement charges.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just last week a new arms dealer opened its online
doors: a company based in Pasadena, Calif., called the Patent and
License Exchange (www.pl-x.com), promotes its site as offering an
``easy-to-search patent inventory, online bid placement, secure
chat room negotiation, closing services (escrow) and aftermarket
license administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's relaxed rules for granting patents, and the greater ease
with which arsenals can thus be amassed, gives a decided battle
advantage to industry heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big guys couldn't care less about the quality of their
patents,'' Aharonian said. ``They just want as many as possible
because they trade them like baseball cards. When you have a
thousand patents and your competition has 1,500, you don't care
what they are, you just swap them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's far easier than hauling one another into court, he said.
But small companies, even if they are defending good, solidly
researched patents, are seldom taken seriously by big companies,
Aharonian said. He added: ``If you're a small company, have you got
a million bucks to sue Microsoft over patent infringement? I don't
know if these companies realize ahead of time what the game is. A
patent is just the first step to spending a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this money would be spent without expert
counsel. Wilson recalls attending a conference a year or so ago
given by a patent lawyer who was giving instructions on how to
build competitive patent bludgeons. ``He was describing the
strategy they recommended to their clients,'' Wilson said, ``which
was basically a pyramid of patent protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Aharonian sees the wielding of patent portfolios as a form of
class warfare, where the lines are drawn between big companies and
small, with consolidation and mergers creating a constant tension
between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is always good, and change usually comes from new
people; and if those new start-ups can't get protection, you'll see
less change, less innovation, less entrepreneurialism,'' Aharonian
said. ``That's why big companies don't want the system to change _
they'd get a lot less patents.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's business environment, in which a company's market
value is measured with increasing frequency by the intellectual
property it owns, arsenals of patents _ specious or not _ make an
unfortunate kind of sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're concerned about the planking,'' Wilson said, ``you
don't want someone rocking the boat.''

   Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. charges twice as much as E-Trade Group _
$29.95 versus $14.95 _ for each online brokerage trade it
processes, so it must be twice as good, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gomez Advisors, an independent consulting firm that
compiles a widely followed quarterly report card on 55 Internet
brokers, E-Trade provides generally better online service than
Schwab and has superior research tools on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Another online broker that charges markedly less than Schwab _
DLJ Direct, at $20 per trade _ outranks Schwab in all six of the
performance measures on the Gomez report card.
</P>
<P>
   The old saw that price reflects quality _ that you get what you
pay for _ is becoming less and less reliable in the online
brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the fierce competition to lure and retain customers in this
rapidly burgeoning industry, online brokers are becoming more and
more similar to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Even bargain-basement firms such as Suretrade ($7.95 per trade)
and Ameritrade ($8) have been adding research, stock charting, news
updates, stock-screening tools and other Web site features that
compare favorably with the offerings long available from industry
leaders such as Schwab and Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade, which a year ago provided little more than a
bare-bones transaction service, now offers its customers research
reports and a stock-screening tool from Market Guide, covering
10,000 public companies. Ameritrade customers also can pull up
earnings estimates from First Call and news updates from Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time one of us comes out with something new and
interesting, the others seek to match it,'' observes Matt Sadler,
Fidelity's senior vice president for brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade, which pioneered online brokerage a scant seven years
ago, has lately embarked on a binge of service-enhancing moves.
</P>
<P>
   It has done so at a steep price, spending more than $100 million
in the past year to improve the technology and content of its Web
site. As a result, it reported losses totaling nearly $30 million
in the six months ended December 31.
</P>
<P>
   At present, E-Trade has 544,000 customers, according to Piper
Jaffray, or a bit more than one-fourth of industry leader Schwab's
online total.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month alone, E-Trade:
</P>
<P>
   COL. 1 of ONLINE02 () &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Created an online tax-preparation service, allowing customers
to prepare and file federal and state taxes through its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   _Gave its customers direct access to TheStreet.com, a leading
Internet provider of financial news and commentary.
</P>
<P>
   _Struck a deal with United Airlines to provide frequent-flier
miles to people who do business with E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade previously made a big splash by adding analyst
recommendations from BancBoston Robertson Stephens and access to
initial public offerings from that firm.
</P>
<P>
   It also maintains its own investor chat room _ evidently the
only one on a brokerage Web site _ where customers can trade rumors
and opinions about stocks and industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on creating a one-stop financial-services
center,'' says Lisa Nash, E-Trade's vice president for corporation
communications and customer management.
</P>
<P>
   Its efforts have rocketed E-Trade to the highest rating overall
among the brokers surveyed by Gomez, with an overall score of 7.32
(on a scale from 0 to 10). E-Trade is tied with DLJ Direct in the
quality of its on-site resources _ the tools that customers use to
make investment decisions _ with a score of 8.82.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez bases its ratings on customer questionnaires, its own
observations of the Web sites and interviews with the brokerage
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, despite its top-of-the-line commission, remains the
largest online broker measured both by number of customers _ 2
million _ and share of online trading volume (27.4 percent last
quarter).
</P>
<P>
   Most of those online customers have moved over to Schwab's
Internet site from conventional brokerage accounts. Schwab still
has more than 3 million customers who only trade the old-fashioned
way _ by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the majority of our business, the first point of contact
continues to be the branch'' rather than the Web, says Schwab
spokeswoman Tracey Gordon. ``People want to kick the tires.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the firm's online traders are far more active than
their conventional counterparts. Online trades now account for 61
percent of Schwab's total _ up from 41 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the $29.95 that Schwab's online customers pay for each
trade is high by online standards, it is substantially lower than
the $55 minimum Schwab charges for conventional trades.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has been able to maintain both market leadership and a
high commission because of what might be called the Tiffany factor.
People who shop at Tiffany's pay more for jewelry than they do
elsewhere because of the firm's venerable name and stately
emporiums, and the confidence they inspire.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Schwab boasts a time-honored name dating back
a quarter-century and a reassuring, tangible presence at nearly 300
branches.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 2 of ONLINE02 () &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know that they are buying quality _ a
respectable brand,'' says Alex Stein, a principal with Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwab's Tiffany-like reputation appears to be losing some
of its luster. Its customer confidence rating, as measured by
Gomez, slipped from 9.05 a year ago to 8.21 in December, ranking it
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The customer confidence rating is based on such factors as
well-trained customer service staffs, easy accessibility to a
firm's Web site and fast response time when customers try to reach
a broker by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab ranks eighth on the Gomez list in overall quality and
fifth in the quality of its on-site resources.
</P>
<P>
   Like other leading online brokers, Schwab has had trouble
maintaining its service standards lately because of the tremendous
surge in online trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   Last quarter, total industry volume surged 34 percent, according
to Credit Suisse First Boston, spurred largely by wild speculation
in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of Schwab and other firms have found themselves
waiting longer to gain access to broker Web sites, move from page
to page and execute trades. They also are finding it harder to
reach customer-service representatives by telephone when they have
questions or problems.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Felix, Schwab's vice president for electronic brokerage
marketing, acknowledges that the firm's customers have been waiting
longer lately to get their telephone queries answered.
</P>
<P>
   Felix claims that ``less than 20 seconds'' is the Schwab norm,
but that some customers have lately been forced to wait up to seven
minutes to talk to service representatives. However, some Schwab
customers say they have encountered delays as long as 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That could prove a significant setback for Schwab, because in
the past one of the firm's great selling points has been its quick
response to phone calls. If Schwab comes to be perceived as just
another online firm that keeps its phone-in customers eternally on
hold, it could have trouble keeping customers and maintaining its
fees.
</P>
<P>
   As other firms begin to look more and more like Schwab, ``savvy
consumers will take a closer look at the price differential,''
predicts John Payne, an analyst with the Cerulli Associates
consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Novice investors looking for an online broker _ or experienced
investors looking to change their brokers _ can view the complete
Gomez ratings at www.gomez.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful resource is the annual report on discount brokers
published by the American Association of Individual Investors. It
includes a section comparing 72 online firms.
</P>
<P>
   The AAII doesn't provide quality rankings. But it does give a
thumbnail listing of each broker's research resources, outlines the
commission structures, and provides other point-by-point
comparisons to help you narrow your choice.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 3 of ONLINE02 () &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can get a copy of the latest report, which was issued last
month, by writing the AAII at 625 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 1900,
Chicago, Ill. 60611-3110, or by calling (312) 280-0170.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gomez and AAII reports will help you sort the wheat
from the chaff, you also ought to explore the broker Web sites
yourself. Most of them let noncustomers take a demonstration tour
that offers a good feel for the online resources.
</P>
<P>
   Only you can decide how many and what kinds of resources you
need. Check out the brokers that offer those resources, then choose
the one that offers them for the lowest commission per trade.
</P>
<P>
   You may decide that you don't need any research help at all _
that a low price is everything. In that case, your logical choice
probably would be Brown &AMP; Co., the lowest-priced online broker at
$5 per trade, and one of the very few that still maintains only a
bare-bones site.
</P>
<P>
   Brown lets you trade securities, of course, and it will display
a history of your transactions, show your current holdings and
balance, and respond to requests for cash from your account. But
that's it.

To sharpen skills, pick proper search engine for each job 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of us spend a lifetime searching, whether it is
for the secret of life, our lost car keys or for the place you
stashed your Aunt Sally's recipe for chili.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you'd suspect, life on the Web mirrors life. As the Web
has become a tool, instead of just an amusement (when is the last
time you heard someone say they planned to ``surf'' the Web?
Nowadays we navigate it), the ability to search for needed
information has become more important.
</P>
<P>
   While it is mildly amusing to be searching for information about
wartime Germany for your child's homework project and to get
instead dozens of pages about German shepherds, German measles and
German chocolate, it isn't good use of your limited time.
</P>
<P>
   There's an art to searching the Web, and today we'll talk about
some techniques that will help make your own searches _ whether you
are using the Web for fun, school or work _ more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know is that not all search engines are the
same. Each has a personality all its own. There are way too many
search engines to cover them all, but we'll talk about a few of
them and, as we do, discuss the kind of search that each does best.
That way, you can start by tailoring the choice of a search engine
to the information you seek.
</P>
<P>
   For a search such as the one in our example, Yahoo!
(http://www.yahoo.com) is best. If your topic is general and it is
likely that a lot of resources exist, go to Yahoo!. But if your
search is very narrow and for information that is likely to be
rare, try AltaVista (http://www.altavisita.com) instead. And when
you're really at a loss, searching for needles in haystacks, try
Dogpile (http://www.dogpile.com), which in turn uses multiple
search engines. You'll get a lot of hits that way, but the downside
is there will be more information to sift through.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about ways to sharpen your search. As you
probably know, these engines seek out pages that contain the search
words you use. That's why it's important to select words precisely.
Most searches are literal. If you are looking for German shepherd
dogs and then use the word ``canine,'' with most search engines,
you'll only get pages with that specific word.
</P>
<P>
   We'll use AltaVista as an example of a way to narrow a search.
Let's say you are looking for information on wartime Germany. You
could simply type in the words ``German war WWII world war II'' and
you're likely to get a lot of hits. But, based on the way AltaVista
works, you would find pages that contained any one of those words.
So you'll also find pages about German culture, about every war
since the War of the Roses, and any page with the word ``world'' in
it.
</P>
<P>
   With AltaVista, you instruct the search engine to find pages
with a combination of words. By putting a plus sign in front of
words, you let AltaVista know the word must appear. So if you
changed your search to something like this (+Germany +world +war
+WWII), you would only get pages that had each word. You'll get few
hits, but the likelihood increases that each page will have the
information you seek. Since each search engine requires different
techniques, be sure to read the help section on those pages to get
tips for narrowing your search.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's a good idea to explore carefully when you find a
page that is on the money. Many of the pages you find will offer
links to similar sites. That way you can use the expertise of the
designers of the good pages to locate similar ones.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow today's advice, you should be able to do a better
job when you search. I cannot, however, help you with your car
keys.

 Judge Blocks Child Online Protection Act  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a victory for free-speech advocates and another blow to
anti-cyberporn lobbyists, a federal judge yesterday blocked the
government's latest attempt to shield children from pornography on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed of Philadelphia continued a
preliminary injunction against the Child Online Protection Act,
which would require U.S. commercial Web sites with sexual content
deemed ``harmful to minors'' to block access to those under 18 by
using a credit card or age-verification system.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had issued a temporary restraining order in November
against the act that expired at midnight last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if First
Amendment protections, which they will with age inherit fully, are
chipped away in the name of their protection,'' Reed said in a
strongly worded 49-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs led by the American Civil Liberties Union had pressed
Reed during a six-day hearing last month to extend the preliminary
injunction blocking the act's enforcement, paving the way for a
full trial to have the law overturned.
</P>
<P>
   A judge's clerk said the injunction would remain in place until
the ACLU case reaches trial. A court date is expected this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proves that the statute was unconstitutional and
ineffectual,'' said Alan Davidson, staff counsel of the Center for
Democracy and Technology, an online civil liberties group in
Washington that also filed a brief objecting to the act.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Justice Department, which could appeal the
decision, said government lawyers ``are reviewing the judge's
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed but not surprised,'' said Shyla Welch, a
spokeswoman for Enough Is Enough, an Internet safety organization
in Fairfax, Va. ``This bipartisan law had broad public support.
It's a perfect example of the ACLU trying to foist its agenda on
the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though passed overwhelmingly by Congress and signed into law by
President Clinton in October, the controversial law has yet to go
into into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The act is a watered-down successor to the Communications
Decency Act, which was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court on
First Amendment grounds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 1 of INTERNET () &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new law is more narrowly focused, however, because it
applies only to commercial Web sites and tries to clearly define
objectionable material. Authors of the bill identify
``objectionable sexual material'' as lacking ``serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific value'' for those under 18. Web
operators who violate the law could get up to six months in jail
and a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the law is necessary to shield children from a
myriad of graphic sexual images and obscene material readily
available on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In arguments before Reed last week, the Justice Department said
the law is merely an ``electronic brown paper bag'' for Web sites
that peddle X-rated material.
</P>
<P>
   ``COPA is concerned with what's clearly pornographic. Those who
are there to excite, entice and fill their coffers,'' Justice
attorney Karen Stewart said in the government's closing argument
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playboy and Penthouse are protected speech for adults, but not
kids,'' Welch said. ``We just want to extend those same laws to
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the law said it violates the First Amendment and
could be exploited by social conservatives to prosecute AIDS
activists, abortion groups, artists or gays who distribute
information over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be up to parents, and not the government, to decide
what children should see,'' ACLU attorney Chris Hansen said. ``This
case was about speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Others _ such as Donna Hoffman, a Vanderbilt University
professor who is an expert on e-commerce _ said the law might
inadvertently endanger mainstream commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rachelle Chong, a former Federal Communications Commission
commissioner and partner at Coudert Bros. in San Francisco, added
that the law threatened to ``stand decades of obscenity law on its
ear'' because it set a national _ rather than local _ obscenity
standard. The U.S. Supreme Court has never approved a national
standard before.
</P>
<P>
   Parents would be better off if they opted for commercially
available filtering software to protect children from online
pornography rather than accept an ``ill-conceived law that limits
the rights of adults to free speech,'' Jerry Berman, executive
director of the CDT, said.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 2 of INTERNET () &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU spearheaded a coalition of 17 businesses and
organizations _ among them, Salon, an online magazine; local poet
Lawrence Ferlinghetti; Planet Out, a gay and lesbian online service
in San Francisco; and the Internet Content Coalition, which
represents 23 Web publishers including Cnet in San Francisco.

TOP WEB SITES? DEPENDS ON THE CHOOSER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Well, we're a month into the new year, and the
computer press is winding up its look back on the top Web sites of
1998. &QL; 
In checking out some of the lists of top sites, I found it
interesting to note that being a top site in terms of the number of
visitors attracted doesn't necessarily make for a top site in terms
of quality.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the lists of top Web sites published by
``Yahoo! Internet Life'' and ``PC Magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Yahoo! Internet Life,'' which rated Web sites
based on number of visitors, the top three online news sites were
CNN.com (www.cnn.com), MSNBC.com (www.msnbc.com) and USA Today
(www.usatoday.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``PC Magazine,'' meanwhile, created its list of top sites based
on the expertise of its staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our essential bookmarks,'' Don Willmott wrote in the
Feb. 9 issue of ``PC Magazine.'' They are ``sites that we find
ourselves returning to again and again for their ease of
navigation, design, content and, most important of all, their
usefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came to online news sites, ``PC Magazine'' also listed
CNN.com and MSNBC.com among its top picks. But ``USA Today'' was
not on the list. Instead, ``PC Magazine'' mentioned ABCNEWS.com
(www.abcnews.com), the Associated Press news service, the Wire
(www.wire.ap.org), and the ``NewYork Times'' (www.nytimes.com).
</P>
<P>
   In describing the Wire, ``PC Magazine'' noted, ``No nonsense
here. The Wire is your most direct access to current news stories
and photographs coming across the Associated Press wire . . . for
some kinds of news, this is as close to the source as you can
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting top Web site category to compare was online
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo! Internet Life'' listed the top sites as Disney
(www.disney.com), Sony (www.sony.com) and the Internet Movie
Database (www.imdb.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``PC Magazine'' agreed on just one of those choices: The
Internet Movie Database. Instead of Disney and Sony, its top
entertainment sites included Broadcast.com (www.broadcast.com),
which provides live radio broadcasts, MP3.com (www.mp3.com), which
offers information and downloadable music in the new MP3 format,
Mylaunch (www.mylaunch.com), a customizable site for music lovers,
and the Onion (www.theonion.com), a bawdy adult humor site.
</P>
<P>
   Something else I noted was that ``Yahoo! Internet Life'' ranked
Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) as the top Web site based on the number of
visits it gets.
</P>
<P>
   (I know, the magazine has a licensing agreement with the Web
site of the same name. But don't worry, I've seen Yahoo! listed as
the top Web site by other sources. And the magazine claims to be
``editorially independent'' from the Web site. For the record, both
``Yahoo! Internet Life'' and ``PC Magazine'' are owned by Ziff
Davis.)
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting is how ``PC Magazine'' listed Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``PC Magazine'' listed Yahoo! as one of its top portal,
or starting, pages on the Web, it didn't include Yahoo! as a top
search engine, which is how Yahoo! got its start.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``PC Magazine'' listed top search engines as AltaVista
(www.av.com), HotBot (www.hotbot.com), MetaCrawler
(www.metacrawler.com), Google! (www.google.stanford.edu.com), and
Northern Light (www.northernlight.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``PC Magazine'' did mention Yahoo! among the tops in three other
categories: Yahoo! Chat (chat.yahoo.com), Yahoo! Finance
(www.quote.yahoo.com), and the people-finder Yahoo! People
(www.people.yahoo.com).
</P>
<P>
   Although I still use Yahoo! often to find things, I have to
agree with ``PC Magazine's'' Yahoo!-less search engine list. In my
experience, I more often find what I am looking for by using either
HotBot or AltaVista.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
What's an old PC worth?
</P>
<P>
   So, you have a PC sitting in the unused bedroom. You bought it,
say, three years ago, and you spent, say, $2,800. Now you want to
sell it, figuring it's gotta still be worth about $500, maybe
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong-o, buddy boy! You'll be lucky if that old PC is still
worth $300. More likely, it's worth closer to $200!
</P>
<P>
   That's the lesson learned by anyone who has access to an Orion
Blue Book of Computers, one of 12 price manuals produced several
times a year by Orion Research Corp. in Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to computers, Orion produces Blue Books on cameras,
audio equipment, car stereos, copiers, guitars, guns, pianos, power
tools, televisions and other categories.
</P>
<P>
   Orion owner Roger Rohrs sent me the company's latest Blue Book
of Computers, which comes on a handy CD-ROM. It was both
interesting and painful to read!
</P>
<P>
   If you look at older computers, those sold in the early 1990s,
you can find many that sold for thousands of dollars but now are
worth $10, $20 or $30.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to check out Orion's Blue Books for yourself,
usually you've got to shell out a few hundred bucks to buy the
CD-ROM or a printed book.
</P>
<P>
   But for a limited time, Orion is offering a complete set of its
Blue Books _ including the computer pricing information _ on CD-ROM
for just $25. The catch: The CD-ROM and its data expire at the end
of this month.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in obtaining such a time-limited CD, or if

COMPUTER-EVALUATED ESSAYS: LOOKING FOR THE TIDY MIND

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (The Week in Review) 
By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So it has come to this. The essay, the great literary art form
that Montaigne conceived and Virginia Woolf carried on, that the
writer Edward Hoagland likens to jazz or a butterfly's flight, has
sunk to a state where someone thinks it is a bright idea to ask a
computer if an essay is any good.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer, which is called e-rater (sort of like
In-Sink-Erator, the company that makes machines to grind up kitchen
garbage), will be used along with a trained human to grade the two
essay questions on the Graduate Management Admission Test taken by
200,000 business school applicants each year.
</P>
<P>
   E-rater's interest is not exactly that of Addison and Steele or
E.B. White. Humor is outside its jurisdiction, as are irony and
surprise. E-rater likes subordinate and complementary clauses and
words like ``however'' and ``therefore'' that some people think
suggest a tidy mind.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when essays were thought to be more than the
sum of their therefores. They were distinguished by their
originality, insight and personal voice, by their graceful style,
lack of affectation and willingness to meander. Instead of stomping
toward a conclusion, many never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   A genuine essay is ``the movement of a free mind at play,''
writes novelist and critic Cynthia Ozick; it is ``a stroll through
someone's mazy mind.'' The essayist is free ``to hop from thought
to thought, to begin with the finish and finish with the middle, or
to eschew beginning and end and keep only a middle.''
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, Samuel Johnson and other great essayists were
used as models to teach theme writing in schools. But in the
factory of freshman composition, the meaning of ``essay'' has
eroded to a point where it is almost equivalent to any old hunk of
prose. As a result, shortly after Robert Atwan started editing his
annual book series, ``The Best American Essays'' (Houghton
Mifflin), a dentist sent along an article on root canal that he had
published in a dental journal and said was the best essay he had
ever written.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale signs of a bad essay are at least as familiar as
the virtues of the great ones. There is the obligatory ``thesis
statement,'' Atwan says. Then come three paragraphs of exposition,
then a concluding paragraph summarizing the preceding three, along
with the phrase ``Thus we see that ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to forget the school essay before they can
write,'' said Ian Frazier, the writer. ``They have to forget `not
only but also' constructions. That's dead. Nobody wants to read
that, not even teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the e-rater.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse behind e-rater was not, of course, doing Max
Beerbohm one better. The idea was to cut costs, among other things.
Instead of two people grading each essay, the Graduate Management
Admission Council, which administers the test, could have one
trained human and one machine.
</P>
<P>
   And what a machine! E-rater is ``the most highly developed,
holistic electronic writing assessment application to date,'' said
Frederic McHale of the admission council. It is a computer bulked
up on a high-protein diet of high-scoring answers to past
admission-test essay questions.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Burstein, a scientist at Educational Testing Service in
Princeton, N.J., who led the team that invented e-rater, says the
computer looks for what she called syntactic variety, such as
different kinds of clauses. It also looks for words associated with
organization of ideas, such as ``first,'' ``second'' and ``third.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not trained to score Montaigne,'' she said. ``It's not
designed to score creative writing and irony and metaphor and
poems. It's designed for a specific purpose, to score the kinds of
essays we see on standardized tests.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible (therefore!) to say how Montaigne might have
fared. He never did have to analyze the annual report of Olympic
Foods or agree or disagree with a statement like, ``Nations should
cooperate to develop regulations that limit children's access to
adult material on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Much business writing seems to aspire to little more than
lowest-common-denominator order and clarity. And, with home
computers already editing for gender neutrality and pointing out
when sentences exceed 31 words, why not let e-rater be the enforcer
of corporatese?
</P>
<P>
   ``For business letters, I think it's OK,'' Ms. Ozick conceded in
an interview. ``On the other hand, this is no way to teach somebody
to think. If an essay represents thinking at its purest and most
original, this is a terrible template to put over the human mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, however, said he understands the impulse. Strangers
keep cranking out manuscripts on computers and shipping them off to
him. ``It would be great if one machine wrote it and another
machine read it,'' he said, ``and we would all be free to go about
our business.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JONATHAN SIDENER   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For decades, students have been penciling in little
circles on standardized tests so that electronic scoring machines
can grade those multiple-choice results.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a computer application called e-rater is ready to go beyond
the dots and take on the tricky task of grading essay questions.
</P>
<P>
   Educational Testing Service of Princeton, N.J., has developed a
system for the group that runs the Graduate Management Admission
Test.
</P>
<P>
   Some time this month, E-rater is scheduled to begin grading the
two essay questions on the GMAT, which is taken by applicants to
business graduate schools. Using expert-system technology, essays
will be graded on the basis of their vocabulary, syntax and logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a trial,'' said Frederic McHale of the Graduate
Management Admission Council, the Virginia group that sponsors the
GMAT. ``It's been thoroughly tested.''
</P>
<P>
   With college students and educators among the most computerized
demographic groups, it comes as little surprise that computers are
shaping the educational experience beyond the classroom. For a
growing number of students, the traditional wait in long lines at
the college bookstore has been replace by a process of surf and
click from the comfort of their dorm rooms. And for other students,
help cramming for exams is available online.
</P>
<P>
   Essay questions on past versions of the GMAT were graded by two
professors. If their answers were within one point of each other
then an average of the two becomes the final score. If their
answers are more than a point apart, then a third professor comes
in to be the deciding vote. The new system will use the e-rater in
place of one of the humans. If the human and computer scores are
within one point, then an average will be the final score, as it is
in the existing system. If they differ by more than a point, a
second professor will be brought in and the computer score will no
longer be considered.
</P>
<P>
   McHale said the system is designed to work in conjunction with
human check and balance. It is also designed to score answers to
specific questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about evaluating creative writing. We're not
planning to use the machines by themselves,'' he said. ``Some
individuals have a unique or creative way of writing that the
machine cannot understand.''
</P>
<P>
   E-rater begins with a sample of about 300 answers to each
question that have been previously graded by professors. The
questions include the full range of 1 to 6 possible points. E-rater
analyzes each answer on the basis of 57 features from three
categories, syntax, vocabulary and the logic or structure of its
argument and builds a sort of statistical profile of what makes up
each of the six possible scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks for syntactic structure, the structural information
about the sentence,'' ETS developmental scientist Jill Burstein
said. ``It looks for vocabulary. And it looks for discourse, cue
words and terms related to argument structure.''
</P>
<P>
   E-rater then runs the same analysis of the 57 features on each
essay answer and compares the profile of that essay against the six
profiles of possible scores from the sample essays.
</P>
<P>
   The computer score agreed with the human score from 87 to 94
percent of the time, which is identical to the agreement rate
between two people, McHale said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are changing another facet of college life at the
University of Arizona and dozens of other large universities across
the country. Students can sign on to the Web site VarsityBooks.com,
select their school from a list, then select their major from a
second list and then select the required books for their classes
from a third list. Texts are listed by class number and
instructor's name. In a few days, the selected books will arrive in
the mail.
</P>
<P>
   VarsityBooks.com includes the University of Arizona as one of 57
major U.S. schools where required books can be selected by
professor name and class number. Company founder Eric Kuhn says
plans call for inclusion of Arizona State University book lists by
the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   Students from schools not yet included can still shop with the
company, but will have to go through a couple of extra steps to
search for the books by title.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn, who gave up a job as a corporate attorney to found
VarsityBooks.com in December 1997, said that inefficient industries
such as the college bookstore are fertile ground for Internet
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ideal opportunity,'' he said. ``It's a $3 billion
niche market.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the attractions is that 95 percent of college students
are online, more than any other demographic group. They're
comfortable with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   When the e-marketer launched, it had only five featured schools
in the Washington, D.C., market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a week, we were selling to students in all 50 states.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn said that the reduced overhead of e-commerce allows
VarsityBooks.com to offer significant discounts over the college
book stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've operated much like a monopoly for years,'' he said.
``This has not traditionally been a competitive area.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some college bookstores have launched their own online
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their response has been interesting,'' Kuhn said. ``I think
that most view us as inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also offers several sites to help students, for a
fee.
</P>
<P>
   One such site, cram.com, offers notes, study aids called cram
sheets and cheat sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Tutor Co. announced (www.supertutor.com) offers a site
targeting high school and middle school students. The company's
final-exam prep site, the Cram Zone (www.homeworkhelp.com), was
launched in May. &QL;

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Bilingual education is one of those human interventions on
behalf of the disadvantaged that date from the 1960s. The question
is whether, like some of those other interventions _ say, special
education _ it is doing more harm than good for its intended
beneficiaries. Certainly the tide of public opinion appears to be
turning against it.
 &HT;    Last year, voters in California passed Proposition 227,
forbidding mandatory bilingual instruction. Hispanic parents in
both New York and California have filed lawsuits to get their
children released from bilingual programs where, parents allege,
they are often being held against their will.
 &HT;    Nothing so significant is happening at Intermediate School 223,
a junior high school in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.
 &HT;    The Montauk school, as it is rather incongruously known, opened
its doors in 1925, and in streamed the children of the newly
arrived Irish, Italian and Eastern European immigrants. History has
repeated itself, and the students who now swarm through the door
are Mexican, Russian, Chinese, Pakistani, Yemeni, Bengali, Polish,
Dominican _ the children of the second wave of immigration.
 &HT;    The first-wave immigrants, by and large, eagerly embraced their
New World identity, in a process of assimilation that seems brutal
in our own multicultural age. The children who attended the Montauk
school in those days learned English by sitting in class until they
got it.
 &HT;    Many of them probably never did get it _ high-school graduation
was a rare achievement in the early years of this century _ but the
schools were often more concerned with assimilating children than
with educating them.
 &HT;    Left to his own devices, Montauk's principal, a silver-haired
veteran educator named James Hayden, would be teaching children
pretty much this same way today. But Hayden is not left to his own
devices. IS 223, like schools everywhere, is obliged to offer
bilingual instruction to its nonnative speakers.
 &HT;    What makes the Montauk school unusual is that it offers
bilingual classes not only in Spanish but also in Russian and
Chinese. And so the school provides a kind of laboratory of
comparative cultural and linguistic adjustment.
 &HT;    Although in theory the program should be the same for all
students, the Russian, Chinese and Spanish bilingual classes at IS
223 vary widely. That shouldn't come as a shock. Assimilation is,
after all, an interaction between an institution and its values and
immigrants and their values.
 &HT;    Most of the Chinese kids, and even more of the Russian kids,
seem to be progressing well toward the mainstream curriculum.
Bilingual instruction seems to be hurting only the Hispanic kids _
the one group it was initially designed to help.
 &HT;    The idea of bilingual education is that students can learn a
subject in their native tongue, and then ``transfer'' their skills
to English once they have gained English proficiency. Some
bilingual theorists, such as the linguist Jim Cummins, argue that
children should not switch to English until they have attained
academic mastery in their native tongue, which takes at least five
to six years _ a staggering idea given the speed with which young
children attain verbal fluency.
 &HT;    If this is true, of course, transitional bilingual education
can't work _ which is Cummins's own position. More orthodox
advocates also draw a sharp distinction between conversational
fluency and formal language skills, although most insist that
children are ready for the transition after a shorter period.
 &HT;    It stands to reason that children could learn math or science
more easily in their own language, but it's harder to see how they
could learn English faster that way. After innumerable studies, the
empirical support for transitional bilingual education is scanty.
 &HT;    A major study commissioned by the U.S. Office of Education in
1974 found that the Bilingual Education Act ``does not appear to be
having a consistent significant impact in meeting its goals as set
forth in the legislation.''
 &HT;    Likewise, a recent review of 72 studies by two critical
scholars, Christine Rossell and Keith Baker, found ``no consistent
research support for transitional bilingual education as a superior
instructional practice for improving the English-language
achievement'' of children with limited English proficiency. They
also found no evidence that bilingual programs boosted achievement
in other subject areas.
 &HT;    The guidelines in New York stipulate that any student whose
native language is not English and who scores under 40 on a
language-assessment test has a right to special language
instruction. If there are 15 or more such speakers of any one
language in a grade, or two adjacent grades, they must be provided
an entire bilingual program.
 &HT;    Students in bilingual classes study all their subjects _ and
often English too _ in their native tongue. They also get one
period a day of instruction in ``English as a second language,'' or
ESL If there are fewer than 15 children who speak a language other
than English, or if the language they speak is so uncommon that an
instructor can't be found, the students take only one period of ESL
_ a rule that, were bilingual instruction truly indispensable,
would be condemning tens of thousands of Arabic and Czech and Urdu
speakers to academic failure.
 &HT;    Another rule, however, is that teachers can do pretty much
whatever they want once they close the door, and the differences
between the various bilingual programs inside IS 223 are startling.
 &HT;    The sixth-grade Russian class seems to spring directly from
Alfred Kazin's or Irving Howe's memoirs of Jewish immigrant life.
The students are earnest and eager. When their teacher, Nonna
Yelan, asked one morning who wanted to read from the day's story
about a billy goat, the kids shouted, ``Ooh, ooh, me, me!''
 &HT;    Yelan spoke to them only in English; they responded only in
English. They read textbooks only in English. Almost all of them
had a sufficient stock of English words to read with a fair show of
fluency. Most of the kids had come here in fourth or fifth grade;
the only English they knew when they arrived was ``hello'' or ``get
lost.'' Yet they had mastered conversational English their first
year and were making real progress in reading. How? By violating
the tenets of bilingual education.
 &HT;    They had not used their Russian proficiency to gain English
proficiency. They hadn't ''transferred'' their skills. They had
simply spoken English from the moment they arrived in school. The
fact that they had arrived in this country without English was much
less important than the fact that they came from educated,
middle-class backgrounds and had been taught early study habits
that made them good at school.
 &HT;    One boy, Yuri, said that five of his six uncles were doctors.
The mother of another boy, Ilya, had been a pediatrician back in
Tashkent. When I spoke to her, she said, ``When Ilya came to
school, I help him because he didn't know English for homework, and
I study English with him.'' She hadn't needed bilingual instruction
any more than Ilya had.
 &HT;    A recent poll by Public Agenda, a nonpartisan research
organization, found that 75 percent of recent immigrants oppose
bilingual instruction. Very few immigrants care about
multiculturalism or bilingualism. They want their children to learn
English as fast as possible in order to make it into the American
mainstream, where good jobs are available _ and they take the
common-sense position that the best way to learn English is by,
well, learning English.
 &HT;    The beneficiaries are much less attached to bilingual
instruction than its advocates, the professionals and academics who
already have the luxury of being firmly ensconced in the middle
class.
 &HT;    At IS 223, the Chinese instructor, Wang Ip, conducted the class
almost entirely in Mandarin or Cantonese. Ip is an old-fashioned
figure who taps on the kids' desks with a metal ruler and
countenances no back talk. The kids answer in short sentences,
often in unison. It is, in short, a very Chinese classroom, just as
Yelan's is a very Russian one.
 &HT;    At the same time, Ip did not practice bilingual orthodoxy.
``They want me to use Chinese books for every subject,'' he said.
``But I use English books. This is the math book I use'' _ he
pulled out an English-language text. ``If I use Chinese books, they
can never learn.''
 &HT;    Fluency was not an issue with Ip, but academic mastery was. He
used English terms for math and social studies, and then, when it
came time to take the mandatory subject tests in Chinese, gave the
students translations. ``All the students want to take the test in
the English version,'' he said. Several of his kids, in fact, were
taking advanced math in English instead of regular math in Chinese.
 &HT;    The Spanish bilingual classes presented yet another picture.
During one math class I attended, the teacher, Luisa Martinez,
asked the students to write down numbers as she recited them in
English _ this in a class for seventh and eighth graders.
 &HT;    ``Si no comprende, raise your hand,'' she said. Most of the
children raised a hand. The contrast with the Russian children, who
had probably spent less time in this country on average than the
Spanish kids, was almost unfathomable.
 &HT;    Martinez and her colleague, Jose Garcia, used slightly more
English than Ip did, but classes were nevertheless conducted
largely in Spanish. The class's science textbook had English and
Spanish on alternating pages; all the other texts were in Spanish,
and the kids did their written work in Spanish.
 &HT;    This was precisely how bilingual instruction was supposed to
operate. Indeed, Rossell says, ``The only kids getting bilingual
education by the theory are the Spanish kids.'' Bilingual
instruction was created by and for Spanish speakers; and while
others used it as an expedient, the Spanish bilingual teachers
typically follow the rules.
 &HT;    And yet the Public Agenda poll found that 56 percent of recent
Hispanic immigrants opposed bilingual education. (Thirty-seven
percent of Hispanic voters favored Proposition 227.) Even so,
virtually all the Mexican parents whose children attend the Montauk
school were poorly educated immigrants who were in no position to
challenge whatever orthodoxy the school advanced. They could
scarcely manipulate the system, or perhaps fathom it, as fully as
the Russians could.
 &HT;    There's no reason to believe that Mexican immigrants have
different values from, say, the equally rusticated Italians who
came to New York a century ago. The differences lie in the
institutions, and in our own culture. It is educators who have lost
faith in the old assimilationist ideal.
 &HT;    For many students, bilingual classes are a well-upholstered
trap. Martinez said she had three children in her combined
seventh-and-eighth- grade class who had been born in the United
States. ``There are some kids who don't want to get out of
bilingual,'' she said, ``even if they don't read Spanish.''
 &HT;    One pint-size boy, Oscar, told me in accentless English that
he'd been in his bilingual class for seven years. ``My mother wants
me to stay in bilingual,'' he said. ``She's worried that I'll lose
my Spanish.'' When I asked if he'd like to go into regular classes,
he said, ``No, I want to stay.''
 &HT;    There were no such children in either the Chinese or the Russian
classes. Anyone who had attained that level of fluency would have
left bilingual for mainstream classes, and perhaps taken ESL on the
side to help complete the transition. Whatever wish they might have
had to stay inside the comfort of their own language group was not
as strong as their ambition to escape.
 &HT;    Actually, many Spanish-speaking children don't ever have to
break out of their enclosed world: New York has high schools that
are virtually all Spanish, and even a bilingual community college.
Only when students leave school do they discover that their English
isn't up to the demands of the job market.
 &HT;    It's possible to forget, when reading learned critiques of
monolingualism, that assimilation is not one of several interesting
options for new immigrants, but a matter of survival. This is
especially true for impoverished Spanish-speaking children, who are
in far more peril of failure than less disadvantaged immigrants
from Russia or Pakistan or even Cuba.
 &HT;    The language barrier that these children face masks a deeper and
more stubborn academic problem. Like so many inner-city students,
they haven't had the exposure to the range of words and phrases
that would allow them to interpret even fairly rudimentary written
passages.
 &HT;    What these children need is a serious grounding in basic reading
and computing skills. The real problem is that so few schools are
even providing that.

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Bilingual education is one of those human interventions on
behalf of the disadvantaged that date from the 1960s. The question
is whether, like some of those other interventions _ say, special
education _ it is doing more harm than good for its intended
beneficiaries. Certainly the tide of public opinion appears to be
turning against it.
 &HT;    Last year, voters in California passed Proposition 227,
forbidding mandatory bilingual instruction. Hispanic parents in
both New York and California have filed lawsuits to get their
children released from bilingual programs where, parents allege,
they are often being held against their will.
 &HT;    Nothing so significant is happening at Intermediate School 223,
a junior high school in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.
 &HT;    The Montauk school, as it is rather incongruously known, opened
its doors in 1925, and in streamed the children of the newly
arrived Irish, Italian and Eastern European immigrants. History has
repeated itself, and the students who now swarm through the door
are Mexican, Russian, Chinese, Pakistani, Yemeni, Bengali, Polish,
Dominican _ the children of the second wave of immigration.
 &HT;    The first-wave immigrants, by and large, eagerly embraced their
New World identity, in a process of assimilation that seems brutal
in our own multicultural age. The children who attended the Montauk
school in those days learned English by sitting in class until they
got it.
 &HT;    Many of them probably never did get it _ high-school graduation
was a rare achievement in the early years of this century _ but the
schools were often more concerned with assimilating children than
with educating them.
 &HT;    Left to his own devices, Montauk's principal, a silver-haired
veteran educator named James Hayden, would be teaching children
pretty much this same way today. But Hayden is not left to his own
devices. IS 223, like schools everywhere, is obliged to offer
bilingual instruction to its nonnative speakers.
 &HT;    What makes the Montauk school unusual is that it offers
bilingual classes not only in Spanish but also in Russian and
Chinese. And so the school provides a kind of laboratory of
comparative cultural and linguistic adjustment.
 &HT;    Although in theory the program should be the same for all
students, the Russian, Chinese and Spanish bilingual classes at IS
223 vary widely. That shouldn't come as a shock. Assimilation is,
after all, an interaction between an institution and its values and
immigrants and their values.
 &HT;    Most of the Chinese kids, and even more of the Russian kids,
seem to be progressing well toward the mainstream curriculum.
Bilingual instruction seems to be hurting only the Hispanic kids _
the one group it was initially designed to help.
 &HT;    The idea of bilingual education is that students can learn a
subject in their native tongue, and then ``transfer'' their skills
to English once they have gained English proficiency. Some
bilingual theorists, such as the linguist Jim Cummins, argue that
children should not switch to English until they have attained
academic mastery in their native tongue, which takes at least five
to six years _ a staggering idea given the speed with which young
children attain verbal fluency.
 &HT;    If this is true, of course, transitional bilingual education
can't work _ which is Cummins's own position. More orthodox
advocates also draw a sharp distinction between conversational
fluency and formal language skills, although most insist that
children are ready for the transition after a shorter period.
 &HT;    It stands to reason that children could learn math or science
more easily in their own language, but it's harder to see how they
could learn English faster that way. After innumerable studies, the
empirical support for transitional bilingual education is scanty.
 &HT;    A major study commissioned by the U.S. Office of Education in
1974 found that the Bilingual Education Act ``does not appear to be
having a consistent significant impact in meeting its goals as set
forth in the legislation.''
 &HT;    Likewise, a recent review of 72 studies by two critical
scholars, Christine Rossell and Keith Baker, found ``no consistent
research support for transitional bilingual education as a superior
instructional practice for improving the English-language
achievement'' of children with limited English proficiency. They
also found no evidence that bilingual programs boosted achievement
in other subject areas.
 &HT;    The guidelines in New York stipulate that any student whose
native language is not English and who scores under 40 on a
language-assessment test has a right to special language
instruction. If there are 15 or more such speakers of any one
language in a grade, or two adjacent grades, they must be provided
an entire bilingual program.
 &HT;    Students in bilingual classes study all their subjects _ and
often English too _ in their native tongue. They also get one
period a day of instruction in ``English as a second language,'' or
ESL If there are fewer than 15 children who speak a language other
than English, or if the language they speak is so uncommon that an
instructor can't be found, the students take only one period of ESL
_ a rule that, were bilingual instruction truly indispensable,
would be condemning tens of thousands of Arabic and Czech and Urdu
speakers to academic failure.
 &HT;    Another rule, however, is that teachers can do pretty much
whatever they want once they close the door, and the differences
between the various bilingual programs inside IS 223 are startling.
 &HT;    The sixth-grade Russian class seems to spring directly from
Alfred Kazin's or Irving Howe's memoirs of Jewish immigrant life.
The students are earnest and eager. When their teacher, Nonna
Yelan, asked one morning who wanted to read from the day's story
about a billy goat, the kids shouted, ``Ooh, ooh, me, me!''
 &HT;    Yelan spoke to them only in English; they responded only in
English. They read textbooks only in English. Almost all of them
had a sufficient stock of English words to read with a fair show of
fluency. Most of the kids had come here in fourth or fifth grade;
the only English they knew when they arrived was ``hello'' or ``get
lost.'' Yet they had mastered conversational English their first
year and were making real progress in reading. How? By violating
the tenets of bilingual education.
 &HT;    They had not used their Russian proficiency to gain English
proficiency. They hadn't ''transferred'' their skills. They had
simply spoken English from the moment they arrived in school. The
fact that they had arrived in this country without English was much
less important than the fact that they came from educated,
middle-class backgrounds and had been taught early study habits
that made them good at school.
 &HT;    One boy, Yuri, said that five of his six uncles were doctors.
The mother of another boy, Ilya, had been a pediatrician back in
Tashkent. When I spoke to her, she said, ``When Ilya came to
school, I help him because he didn't know English for homework, and
I study English with him.'' She hadn't needed bilingual instruction
any more than Ilya had.
 &HT;    A recent poll by Public Agenda, a nonpartisan research
organization, found that 75 percent of recent immigrants oppose
bilingual instruction. Very few immigrants care about
multiculturalism or bilingualism. They want their children to learn
English as fast as possible in order to make it into the American
mainstream, where good jobs are available _ and they take the
common-sense position that the best way to learn English is by,
well, learning English.
 &HT;    The beneficiaries are much less attached to bilingual
instruction than its advocates, the professionals and academics who
already have the luxury of being firmly ensconced in the middle
class.
 &HT;    At IS 223, the Chinese instructor, Wang Ip, conducted the class
almost entirely in Mandarin or Cantonese. Ip is an old-fashioned
figure who taps on the kids' desks with a metal ruler and
countenances no back talk. The kids answer in short sentences,
often in unison. It is, in short, a very Chinese classroom, just as
Yelan's is a very Russian one.
 &HT;    At the same time, Ip did not practice bilingual orthodoxy.
``They want me to use Chinese books for every subject,'' he said.
``But I use English books. This is the math book I use'' _ he
pulled out an English-language text. ``If I use Chinese books, they
can never learn.''
 &HT;    Fluency was not an issue with Ip, but academic mastery was. He
used English terms for math and social studies, and then, when it
came time to take the mandatory subject tests in Chinese, gave the
students translations. ``All the students want to take the test in
the English version,'' he said. Several of his kids, in fact, were
taking advanced math in English instead of regular math in Chinese.

 By JEFFREY GOLDBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    John J. Gotti, the bloody-minded truck hijacker who led the
Gambino crime family to ruination, has a friend in Joseph
Castellano, whose father Gotti murdered.
 &HT;    The murder took place in midtown Manhattan on a December evening
in 1985, in front of Sparks Steak House, which, owing to the death
of Paul Castellano at its threshold, is now a popular tourist
destination. John Gotti did not actually shoot Joseph Castellano's
father, but he arranged the killing and handpicked the assassins _
``button men'' is the archaic term for their profession _ who did
the job. A jury found Gotti guilty in Castellano's murder, and
other murders, in 1992.
 &HT;    There is no one associated with organized crime who doesn't
believe that Gotti ordered Castellano's death. Joseph Castellano,
whose life was turned inside out by the murder, says he doesn't
believe it.
 &HT;    ``I know they say that Mr. Gotti'' _ he is careful to employ the
honorific _ ``was the one who murdered our father,'' he told me
recently. ``But I don't know. I have no proof of this. The
government says this is true, but what do you want from the
government? My father was watched by the government for 40 years,
and then on the day he gets killed, what happened? Where was the
FBI?''
 &HT;    Don't get him started.
 &HT;    ``I don't believe anything,'' he said, convincingly. ``It's like
'Star Trek,' fiction. Clinton, Nixon, Gotti, it's all the same.''
 &HT;    His doubts, he said, have led him to question the existence of
the crime family the government says his father led. ``What is a
Gambino crime family?'' he asked. ``Does this Gambino crime family
have an office? Does the office have a plaque on the door that
says, 'Gambino crime family'?''
 &HT;    Joseph Castellano is a 60-year-old pizza-maker with heart
trouble and a fierce desire to live out his days in peace, which
might explain why he defends his father's killer. We were talking
about Gotti while seated at a corner table in Big Louie's Pizzeria
on Sunrise Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    Castellano is ordinary in appearance. He was wearing a white
windbreaker and tinted glasses, which made him look very much like
the retirees who line up each afternoon in restaurants across South
Florida in search of the earliest early-bird special. Except for
his nose. The nose is extraordinary _ a giant, kingly nose. It is
his father's nose, the nose that prompted Gotti and other traitors
inside the Gambino family to refer to their boss _ behind his back,
of course _ as `Nasabeak.''
 &HT;    Like his father before him, Joseph Castellano is a wealthy man.
Along with his brother, Paul Jr., he owns the Big Louie's on
Sunrise, along with five other Big Louies in Fort Lauderdale. They
also own a chain of popular and affordable rib restaurants called
Bobby Rubino's, as well as a poultry wholesale business and a pasta
concern.
 &HT;    Like his father before him too, Joseph lives in splendor, in a
million-dollar home behind a tall gate near the ocean. The
Castellanos have always favored extravagant homes. When his father
served as boss of the Gambino crime family, he lived in a Staten
Island mansion so regal it was known as the White House. It was not
the sort of house Carlo Gambino, Castellano's cousin and
predecessor and a hater of flamboyance, would have liked.
 &HT;    ``It was a hell of a nice house,'' Castellano's cousin, Peter
Castellana, a reputed Gambino family soldier, once told me. ``Not
my idea of a home. I like a ranch-type, five, six rooms, a nice
den, end of story. But Paul liked the big houses.''
 &HT;    Despite his wealth and surname, Joseph Castellano never appears
in the Florida newspapers, and law-enforcement officials in Fort
Lauderdale have no photographs of him. He lives a life of
near-complete anonymity. But he made no attempt to hide his
identity when, after surveilling the nose, I approached his table.
 &HT;    He was initially reluctant to talk about his life, but he became
animated when I turned the subject to Paul Castellano's revenge.
``What do you mean, revenge?'' he asked.
 &HT;    I offered up a theory proposed to e by a one-time Castellano
partisan: that the woes of the Gotti family _ John Gotti's
imprisonment for life and his cancer and his son's coming trial on
racketeering charges, charges that could land him in jail for 20
years _ can be seen as a kind of payback for the grief Gotti
visited on the Castellanos.
 &HT;    To accept this theory, Castellano must accept Gotti's guilt,
which, publicly at least, he doesn't, and he must accept an
unorthodox definition of revenge.
 &HT;    ``I don't know of any revenge,'' he said, and in fact, his
father's murder was never avenged in the traditional Sicilian
manner. By rights, John Gotti should have been killed for violating
a basic tenet of mob life, which is, Never kill a boss without
permission of the other bosses.
 &HT;    It is true that the history of the Gambino family is laced with
regicide. The first boss, Vincent Mangano, was killed by the
second, Albert Anastasia, who was himself betrayed by the third,
Carlo Gambino. But traditionally, most boss hits have been
sanctioned. It is said that Vincent (Chin) Gigante, the recently
jailed boss of the Genovese family and the last great mafioso of
the century, tried to have Gotti killed for breaking the rules. But
he didn't succeed.
 &HT;    The Gambino family accepted Gotti as the new boss at virtually
the same moment John Cardinal O'Connor denied Paul Castellano, the
slain boss, a public funeral mass. Further humiliation was to
follow. The Castellano brothers, who were running their father's
food wholesale company, Dial Poultry, were soon visited by their
cousin, Tommy Gambino, a captain in the family and Carlo's son.
 &HT;    Tommy Gambino, like most everyone else in the family's ``white
collar'' faction, was frightened cold by the murderous Gotti, and
he carried a message from his new boss to the Castellanos: ``He
told them that what happened happened, let it go, and start paying
tribute to Gotti,'' says J. Bruce Mouw, who until last year ran the
FBI's Gambino squad and is the federal agent most responsible for
the Gambino family's downfall. ``This was their blood cousin
telling them this.''
 &HT;    So they did the logical thing, and fled to Florida. And in their
move was the seed of revenge, because revenge, to paraphrase _
liberally _ an old Sicilian expression, is a dish best eaten at Big
Louie's on Sunrise Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    Paul Castellano had a vision for his children: He did not want
them to be like him. He wanted them to be entirely legitimate,
upstanding members of their community. He shielded them from the
mob, and he set them up in businesses that could earn them money
legally. And it worked. The Castellano brothers are not mobsters.
 &HT;    Or to put it another way, no one has proved that they are
mobsters. When I mentioned the Castellanos to the former sheriff of
Broward County, Nick Navarro, who has arrested in Florida such
eminent persons as Carmine Galante and Meyer Lansky, he threw up
his hands: ``What can I say? They're in the restaurant business. We
don't know anything about them.'' He added: ``Have you tried their
ribs? They have very good ribs.''
 &HT;    There are whiffs and intimations of mob influence in the
Castellanos' business empire _ Bobby Rubino, the man for whom the
restaurant chain is named, was a reputed mob front man _ and the
money used to build the Castellano business empire may not have
been pristine. But the brothers have had no trouble with the law.
 &HT;    ``My family went through hell,'' Joseph Castellano said. ``But
maybe it's all been a blessing in disguise. Having this name, the
past, we lead a very clean life. We pay our taxes. For a lot of
businessmen, paying taxes is a curse. I like paying taxes.''
 &HT;    The Castellano story is not unusual. Among the hundreds of
``made men'' who make up the membership of New York's Five
Families, many among them surely hope their sons will follow them
into their peculiar profession. But many more among them don't:
More and more frequently, sons of the mob are graduating from law
school and medical school or playing by the rules in the world of
legitimate business.
 &HT;    ``Only a real gavone wants for his kids what we got,'' a former
captain in the Colombo crime family, Salvatore (Big Sal) Miciotta,
once told me. A gavone is a lowlife. Big Sal, who weighs 350 pounds
and has killed five men (''I'm feeling tremendous amounts of
remorse,'' he said), argued that the Five Families are headed for
dissolution because of what might be called a crisis of
human-resource management. ``Idiots and wannabes are who's
attracted to this life now,'' he said.
 &HT;    In other words, even if RICO, the Racketeering Influenced
Corrupt Organization statute, didn't exist; even if Rudolph
Giuliani hadn't appeared on the scene 15 years ago to lead his war
against the mob; even if the government hadn't won to its side so
many turncoats that, today, defectors _ ``rats,'' if you come from
certain neighborhoods in South Brooklyn and Queens _ could form
their own family, the mob might be in a state of collapse simply
because the smartest gangsters want nothing so much as to protect
their sons from the life they had chosen.
 &HT;    The story of the Mafia's decline, then, might be the story of
the choices fathers make for their sons.
 &HT;    Paul Castellano made the right choices for his sons, and, in
this regard, he has got his revenge. When his sons die, they will
almost certainly die as old men in their own beds, the kind of
death that eludes most mobsters. And that certainly might elude
John Gotti Jr.
 &HT;    When I suggested to Victoria Gotti that perhaps her brother,
John Jr., would have been better served by following the lead of
such men as Joseph Castellano _ that maybe he should have escaped
to a place where his name would bring him less trouble _ she grew
reflective.
 &HT;    ``You know, you have choices,'' John Gotti's daughter was
saying, in her smoked-oyster voice. ``Yeah, you can pick up and
move to, say, Albuquerque, New Mexico. ... It's like the old
'Cheers' thing, except that no one knows your name there _ and you
can become another person, step into someone else's shoes.'' She
paused for a second, and her face hardened. ``But it's the coward's
way out.''
 &HT;    Victoria, Gotti, a Nancy Sinatra song come to life, was dressed
in black velvet _ Armani _ and her thick hair, once black, now
blond, hung low down her back. She was sitting in her living room,
and under the Christmas tree was a framed portrait of her father,
looking fearsome and resolute, the type of man who credibly
threatened to ``sever'' people from their heads.
 &HT;    When I mentioned that the portrait seemed designed to
intimidate, she said: ``My dad was a people person. He loves
people.''
 &HT;    Her shelves hold the complete works of Sidney Sheldon, as well
as two copies of ``How to Help Your Man Lose Weight.'' She is a
successful writer of throat-gripping, romance-tinged mysteries, and
her talents are reported to be Sheldonian in scope. She is taken by
romance. Her mansion in Old Westbury, on Long Island, is built to
look like Tara, which it does, more or less, except for the rusty
cars parked by the side. Her husband, Carmine Agnello, has for many
years been a leading figure in the New York City auto-salvage
business.
 &HT;    Victoria is 35, a year older than her brother John, who is known
to everyone except his family and friends as Junior and who is
reputedly the acting boss of the Gambino family. It is Victoria,
though, who is generally held to be the smartest of John Gotti's
four children, the most eloquent interpreter and guardian of the
family tradition.
 &HT;    ``The way we were taught is that if you feel strongly enough to
fight for something, then you fight,'' she said. ``Rising up from
the streets under the circumstances my dad was raised in, you don't
throw in the towel and say, 'Come and get me.' How do you say to
your children: 'Yeah, gee, we ran like bats out of hell. We ran
because we were afraid.' I won't do that. My brother won't do that.
Will he ever run and hide? No.''
 &HT;    Gotti Jr., an ardent collector of Native American memorabilia,
told me two weeks ago that he looks to Indian history for strength
and for lessons about the abuse of government power.
 &HT;    ``If you look at the history of the Indians, you see that they
were oppressed by the government,'' he told me during a brief
conversation in an elevator at the White Plains Federal Courthouse
in Westchester County, where he is to stand trial. ``It's just the
same with Italian-Americans. We're oppressed just like the Indians.
It's history repeating itself.''
 &HT;    In person, without benefit of tabloid magnification, Gotti Jr.
is a reasonably sized human being. He is not tall at all, and,
after adhering religiously to the Atkins Diet _ a lot of meat, no
pasta _ he is merely bulky. He is dressed for court in a black polo
shirt buttoned to the collar and a black-and-white checked jacket.
 &HT;    He was especially keen that day to talk about the exploits of
Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce Indians, who were the target of a
particularly vicious government campaign overseen by Gen. William
Tecumseh Sherman.
 &HT;    ``Chief Joseph was an extremely dignified, intelligent leader,''
Junior said. The elevator, which was carrying us to a courtroom
where prosecutors would soon ask a judge to revoke his bail, was
stuck on the bottom floor, but Junior, lost in his reverie, didn't
notice. ``Chief Joseph was the main strategist for the Nez Perce,''
he said, the autodidact in him impossible to suppress. ``But his
brother was the field general. A lot of people don't know that.''
 &HT;    We talked for a moment longer, about a book of Nez Perce history
called ``I Will Fight No More Forever,'' and he said, his voice
full of enthusiasm, ``I'm reading a book about Crazy Horse right
now that's really _''
 &HT;    Just then the elevator door opened. Standing there were the
Ruggiero brothers, Angelo and John, sons of his father's closest
mob ally, the late Angelo (Quack-Quack) Ruggiero. The Ruggieros
were joined by several other friends, a few of whom, according to
the text on their jackets, were affiliated with auto-salvage firms
in Queens.
 &HT;    As soon as Junior saw them watching us, he turned cold and
mumbled, ``We'll talk about this later.'' He seemed to have much
more to say, and he did. The next day, Gotti Jr. wrote me a letter
in which he gives the distinct impression that he thinks of himself
as an Indian chief and of the Mafia as a vanishing tribe of
honorable men, the outer-borough equivalent of the Sioux Nation.
 &HT;    The letter came inside a greeting card whose cover featured a
drawing of a Lakota warrior raising his peace pipe to the sky.
 &HT;    ``When I think of the American Indian,'' Junior's handwritten
letter read, ``I think of their courage, strength, pride, their
respect and their loyalty toward their brothers. I honor the
reverence they share for tradition and life. These traits are
hungered for in a society that is unfortunately plagued by those
whose only values are self-centered and directed at others'
expense. A society which seems to be forced to embrace the Judas,
and liars.''
 &HT;    Given his world, which is riddled with traitors, it is not hard
to understand his interest in Judas. Inside the greeting card,
Junior wrote a saying he attributes to Chief Joseph _ and which may
reflect his vision of his own fate: ``Any man who was born a free
man should not be contented when penned up, and denied liberty to
go where he pleases.''

 By JEFFREY GOLDBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    John J. Gotti, the bloody-minded truck hijacker who led the
Gambino crime family to ruination, has a friend in Joseph
Castellano, whose father Gotti murdered.
 &HT;    The murder took place in midtown Manhattan on a December evening
in 1985, in front of Sparks Steak House, which, owing to the death
of Paul Castellano at its threshold, is now a popular tourist
destination. John Gotti did not actually shoot Joseph Castellano's
father, but he arranged the killing and handpicked the assassins _
``button men'' is the archaic term for their profession _ who did
the job. A jury found Gotti guilty in Castellano's murder, and
other murders, in 1992.
 &HT;    There is no one associated with organized crime who doesn't
believe that Gotti ordered Castellano's death. Joseph Castellano,
whose life was turned inside out by the murder, says he doesn't
believe it.
 &HT;    ``I know they say that Mr. Gotti'' _ he is careful to employ the
honorific _ ``was the one who murdered our father,'' he told me
recently. ``But I don't know. I have no proof of this. The
government says this is true, but what do you want from the
government? My father was watched by the government for 40 years,
and then on the day he gets killed, what happened? Where was the
FBI?''
 &HT;    Don't get him started.
 &HT;    ``I don't believe anything,'' he said, convincingly. ``It's like
'Star Trek,' fiction. Clinton, Nixon, Gotti, it's all the same.''
 &HT;    His doubts, he said, have led him to question the existence of
the crime family the government says his father led. ``What is a
Gambino crime family?'' he asked. ``Does this Gambino crime family
have an office? Does the office have a plaque on the door that
says, 'Gambino crime family'?''
 &HT;    Joseph Castellano is a 60-year-old pizza-maker with heart
trouble and a fierce desire to live out his days in peace, which
might explain why he defends his father's killer. We were talking
about Gotti while seated at a corner table in Big Louie's Pizzeria
on Sunrise Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    Castellano is ordinary in appearance. He was wearing a white
windbreaker and tinted glasses, which made him look very much like
the retirees who line up each afternoon in restaurants across South
Florida in search of the earliest early-bird special. Except for
his nose. The nose is extraordinary _ a giant, kingly nose. It is
his father's nose, the nose that prompted Gotti and other traitors
inside the Gambino family to refer to their boss _ behind his back,
of course _ as `Nasabeak.''
 &HT;    Like his father before him, Joseph Castellano is a wealthy man.
Along with his brother, Paul Jr., he owns the Big Louie's on
Sunrise, along with five other Big Louies in Fort Lauderdale. They
also own a chain of popular and affordable rib restaurants called
Bobby Rubino's, as well as a poultry wholesale business and a pasta
concern.
 &HT;    Like his father before him too, Joseph lives in splendor, in a
million-dollar home behind a tall gate near the ocean. The
Castellanos have always favored extravagant homes. When his father
served as boss of the Gambino crime family, he lived in a Staten
Island mansion so regal it was known as the White House. It was not
the sort of house Carlo Gambino, Castellano's cousin and
predecessor and a hater of flamboyance, would have liked.
 &HT;    ``It was a hell of a nice house,'' Castellano's cousin, Peter
Castellana, a reputed Gambino family soldier, once told me. ``Not
my idea of a home. I like a ranch-type, five, six rooms, a nice
den, end of story. But Paul liked the big houses.''
 &HT;    Despite his wealth and surname, Joseph Castellano never appears
in the Florida newspapers, and law-enforcement officials in Fort
Lauderdale have no photographs of him. He lives a life of
near-complete anonymity. But he made no attempt to hide his
identity when, after surveilling the nose, I approached his table.
 &HT;    He was initially reluctant to talk about his life, but he became
animated when I turned the subject to Paul Castellano's revenge.
``What do you mean, revenge?'' he asked.
 &HT;    I offered up a theory proposed to me by a one-time Castellano
partisan: that the woes of the Gotti family _ John Gotti's
imprisonment for life and his cancer and his son's coming trial on
racketeering charges, charges that could land him in jail for 20
years _ can be seen as a kind of payback for the grief Gotti
visited on the Castellanos.
 &HT;    To accept this theory, Castellano must accept Gotti's guilt,
which, publicly at least, he doesn't, and he must accept an
unorthodox definition of revenge.
 &HT;    ``I don't know of any revenge,'' he said, and in fact, his
father's murder was never avenged in the traditional Sicilian
manner. By rights, John Gotti should have been killed for violating
a basic tenet of mob life, which is, Never kill a boss without
permission of the other bosses.
 &HT;    It is true that the history of the Gambino family is laced with
regicide. The first boss, Vincent Mangano, was killed by the
second, Albert Anastasia, who was himself betrayed by the third,
Carlo Gambino. But traditionally, most boss hits have been
sanctioned. It is said that Vincent (Chin) Gigante, the recently
jailed boss of the Genovese family and the last great mafioso of
the century, tried to have Gotti killed for breaking the rules. But
he didn't succeed.
 &HT;    The Gambino family accepted Gotti as the new boss at virtually
the same moment John Cardinal O'Connor denied Paul Castellano, the
slain boss, a public funeral mass. Further humiliation was to
follow. The Castellano brothers, who were running their father's
food wholesale company, Dial Poultry, were soon visited by their
cousin, Tommy Gambino, a captain in the family and Carlo's son.
 &HT;    Tommy Gambino, like most everyone else in the family's ``white
collar'' faction, was frightened cold by the murderous Gotti, and
he carried a message from his new boss to the Castellanos: ``He
told them that what happened happened, let it go, and start paying
tribute to Gotti,'' says J. Bruce Mouw, who until last year ran the
FBI's Gambino squad and is the federal agent most responsible for
the Gambino family's downfall. ``This was their blood cousin
telling them this.''
 &HT;    So they did the logical thing, and fled to Florida. And in their
move was the seed of revenge, because revenge, to paraphrase _
liberally _ an old Sicilian expression, is a dish best eaten at Big
Louie's on Sunrise Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    Paul Castellano had a vision for his children: He did not want
them to be like him. He wanted them to be entirely legitimate,
upstanding members of their community. He shielded them from the
mob, and he set them up in businesses that could earn them money
legally. And it worked. The Castellano brothers are not mobsters.
 &HT;    Or to put it another way, no one has proved that they are
mobsters. When I mentioned the Castellanos to the former sheriff of
Broward County, Nick Navarro, who has arrested in Florida such
eminent persons as Carmine Galante and Meyer Lansky, he threw up
his hands: ``What can I say? They're in the restaurant business. We
don't know anything about them.'' He added: ``Have you tried their
ribs? They have very good ribs.''
 &HT;    There are whiffs and intimations of mob influence in the
Castellanos' business empire _ Bobby Rubino, the man for whom the
restaurant chain is named, was a reputed mob front man _ and the
money used to build the Castellano business empire may not have
been pristine. But the brothers have had no trouble with the law.
 &HT;    ``My family went through hell,'' Joseph Castellano said. ``But
maybe it's all been a blessing in disguise. Having this name, the
past, we lead a very clean life. We pay our taxes. For a lot of
businessmen, paying taxes is a curse. I like paying taxes.''
 &HT;    The Castellano story is not unusual. Among the hundreds of
``made men'' who make up the membership of New York's Five
Families, many among them surely hope their sons will follow them
into their peculiar profession. But many more among them don't:
More and more frequently, sons of the mob are graduating from law
school and medical school or playing by the rules in the world of
legitimate business.
 &HT;    ``Only a real gavone wants for his kids what we got,'' a former
captain in the Colombo crime family, Salvatore (Big Sal) Miciotta,
once told me. A gavone is a lowlife. Big Sal, who weighs 350 pounds
and has killed five men (''I'm feeling tremendous amounts of
remorse,'' he said), argued that the Five Families are headed for
dissolution because of what might be called a crisis of
human-resource management. ``Idiots and wannabes are who's
attracted to this life now,'' he said.
 &HT;    In other words, even if RICO, the Racketeering Influenced
Corrupt Organization statute, didn't exist; even if Rudolph
Giuliani hadn't appeared on the scene 15 years ago to lead his war
against the mob; even if the government hadn't won to its side so
many turncoats that, today, defectors _ ``rats,'' if you come from
certain neighborhoods in South Brooklyn and Queens _ could form
their own family, the mob might be in a state of collapse simply
because the smartest gangsters want nothing so much as to protect
their sons from the life they had chosen.
 &HT;    The story of the Mafia's decline, then, might be the story of
the choices fathers make for their sons.
 &HT;    Paul Castellano made the right choices for his sons, and, in
this regard, he has got his revenge. When his sons die, they will
almost certainly die as old men in their own beds, the kind of
death that eludes most mobsters. And that certainly might elude
John Gotti Jr.
 &HT;    When I suggested to Victoria Gotti that perhaps her brother,
John Jr., would have been better served by following the lead of
such men as Joseph Castellano _ that maybe he should have escaped
to a place where his name would bring him less trouble _ she grew
reflective.
 &HT;    ``You know, you have choices,'' John Gotti's daughter was
saying, in her smoked-oyster voice. ``Yeah, you can pick up and
move to, say, Albuquerque, New Mexico. ... It's like the old
'Cheers' thing, except that no one knows your name there _ and you
can become another person, step into someone else's shoes.'' She
paused for a second, and her face hardened. ``But it's the coward's
way out.''
 &HT;    Victoria, Gotti, a Nancy Sinatra song come to life, was dressed
in black velvet _ Armani _ and her thick hair, once black, now
blond, hung low down her back. She was sitting in her living room,

 &HT;    Spruced-up `Slap Shot' scores with Newman
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With football on the wane, why not check out a sports classic in
another field? Paul Newman's 1977 film ``Slap Shot'' does for
professional hockey _ albeit in a jokier, less daring way _ what
``North Dallas Forty'' does for football. Newman is the manager of
a hockey team made up mostly of has-beens and rookies. His solution
is to go for the opposition's throat _ and knees and jaws and
whatever _ which makes for some bone-crunching action sequences.
The DVD version offers little more than a spruced-up version of the
film, but the film bios remind you that Newman and director George
Roy Hill struck pay dirt with ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid'' and ``The Sting,'' and the theatrical trailer is, as usual,
of a certain time-capsule interest (the men's very-'70s hair alone
is worth a look).

 &HT;    There's something about Diaz amid `Mary's' gross-out humor
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that prevents him from making his
prom date with golden girl Mary (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, he hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt Dillon) to track her
down.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is liberating in its scatological, slapstick way; it
throws in gross-out humor but maintains a surprisingly sweet tone
(that's partly thanks to Diaz's substantial charm). If you're a dog
lover, you might have a hard time. Same goes if you're queasy about
body-function humor. But for the funniest American movie of '98,
it's a gotta-see. Grade: B+

   &QR;  ``Shooting Fish'' (PG) _ A comedy that harks back to those
it's-a-gas British '60s flicks . . . only, without the gas. Dan
Futterman (``The Birdcage'') and Stuart Townsend play con artists
who flit through '90s London fleecing rich guys, aided by their
lovely assistant, Georgie (Kate Beckinsale). They make a charming
trio, but they're left dangling by a script that's only moderately
amusing. Grade: C+

   Possibly the best film about pro football ever made. Except,
it's not exactly pro pro football. Based on Peter Gent's novel, a
thinly disguised account of his experiences playing for the Dallas
Cowboys, the movie stars Nick Nolte as an aging receiver who's
slowly being forced to realize that the real game isn't played on
the field; it's played in the corporate offices. As he tells the
team owner, ``We're not the team. You're the team. We're only the
equipment _ like the jockstraps and helmets.'' G.D. Spradlin is
chilling as Nolte's ruthless, Bible-quoting coach (read, Tom
Landry).
</P>
<P>
   Notable faces in the locker room: Singer Mac Davis as a showy
quarterback who knows how to play both games and John Matuszak from
the Oakland Raiders.

   Burt Reynolds sailed to the front of the early '70s box office
pack with this crowd pleaser about a former pro football player
expelled from the NFL for point shaving. He ends up serving a year
at the state penitentiary (played by Georgia's own state facility
at Reidsville) run by evil warden Eddie Albert. The finale is a
down-and-dirty game between the inmates and the guards. Director
Robert Aldrich was initially displeased with the football footage;
it looked too rehearsed. His solution was to capitalize on
Reynolds' own background as a college player. He told his star to
call a play in the huddle every other down, meaning one play would
be rehearsed, one not. Not so coincidentally, Reynolds also wears
his old Florida State University number _ No. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Notable faces in the locker room: Ray Nitschke of the Green Bay
Packers, Joe Kapp of the Minnesota Vikings and Ernie Wheelwright of
the Atlanta Falcons (look for other NFL imports, too.)

<P>
   &QR;  ``All the Right Moves'' (1983)
</P>
<P>
   Just like the supposedly ``dumb'' jocks who are its heroes, this
movie has a lot more on the ball than you might think. Tom Cruise
extended his ``Risky Business'' winning streak as a high school
hotshot whose only ticket out of a drab Rust Belt one-factory town
is a football scholarship. Most teen movies would be about the Big
Game, the one attended by all the college recruiters. But this one
is about the day after the Big Game. And the day after that. It's
about that terrible teen pressure that assumes that one wrong move
can erase all the right ones. No notable faces in the locker room;
this is, after all, about high school football. But look for Lea
Thompson (TV's ``Caroline in the City'') as Cruise's supportive
girlfriend and Craig T. Nelson as Cruise's ambitious coach. And the
cameraman is Jan De Bont, who later directed ``Speed.''

<P>
   &QR;  ``Paper Lion''(1968)
</P>
<P>
   A pre-Hawkeye Alan Alda made his film debut as George Plimpton,
a celebrity journalist with a career as a kind of ``professional
amateur.'' He'd fought bulls, boxed with Archie Moore, been beaten
6-love by tennis champ Pancho Gonzales. In ``Paper Lion,'' based on
Plimpton's best seller, Alda tries playing quarterback with the
Detroit Lions. Alda, who'd had polio growing up, had to work extra
hard at the part. He won over his pro-ball co-stars with his
determination and humor. Asked by one if he'd ever played football
as a kid, the actor said, ``My mother wouldn't let me, so she had
my orthodontist write a note to school saying it was bad for my
braces.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable faces in the locker room: Lots of Detroit Tigers,
including John Gordy, Roger Brown and Alex Karras.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Horse Feathers'' (1932)
</P>
<P>
   The Marx Brothers go to college. And where there's college,
there's football. Groucho plays the president of Huxley College, an
institute of higher learning that's on its last legs. Like many
college presidents, Groucho's solution is to produce a winning
football team (the film's jokes about academia cutting corners,
compromising standards and trying everything from cash to coeds to
lure top players are eerily current). The climactic game against
rival Darwin is pure Marx mania. Harpo passes a ball with a rubber
band attached to it (so it comes back to him and he can score).
Chico calls the plays: ``Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,
this time I think we go up the middle.'' Groucho cracks wise.
</P>
<P>
   Notable faces in the locker room: Zeppo.

 By IAN FISHER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Among the many useful things I learned at hostile-environment
school _ a school like no other I have ever attended _ is a
technique called ``crack and thump.''
 &HT;    For this to work, you must first stay calm enough to make an
educated guess about the bullet being fired at you. If you decide
it is, say, a 7.62 high-velocity round, you must then remember that
the bullet travels at approximately half a mile per second.
 &HT;    You listen for the ``crack,'' the sound of the bullet streaking
over your head. You then listen for the ``thump,'' the sound of the
gun being fired in the first place. (The bullets are supersonic, so
they reach you before you hear the rifle go off.) By counting the
seconds between the two sounds, you can tell how far away the
maniac with the gun is.
 &HT;    Three seconds, for example, equals one and a half miles, which
may or may not be far enough away for you to run for your life.
It's like counting the seconds between a flash of lightning and the
rumble of thunder. But it's more unsettling. Lightning doesn't want
you dead.
 &HT;    I have never been shot at. If it happens, I am sure my first
instinct will not be to do math. But as a freshly minted foreign
correspondent, I like this illusion of control in the face of
danger. And that is precisely what you get for your money _ not a
little of it _ from Centurion Risk Assessment Services Ltd.,
situated in a genteel manor house an hour outside London.
 &HT;    For four days, a team of sadistic former Royal British Marines
runs you through mud and trees, explodes things, makes lots of
noise, even kidnaps you, hooded, leading you around by your thumbs.
At the end, you are supposed to understand three truths about the
world we live in and, thus, the world that reporters cover at close
range:
 &HT;    1) The number of ways to die is unlimited.
 &HT;    2) There are many bad people and bad things ready to inflict one
of those ways on you.
 &HT;    3) You can, sometimes, with proper training, even the odds.
 &HT;    This course was designed specifically for journalists in what
Centurion defines broadly as ``hostile environments'' _ war zones,
malarial jungles, cold places, crashing helicopters. (A hint: If
your helicopter goes down in water, make extra sure the rotors have
stopped before you swim to the surface.)
 &HT;    By the time I went this fall with a colleague, Nori Onishi, some
4,000 people had been through the course, including more and more
aid workers and business travelers willing to believe the worst
about the places they go.
 &HT;    And in fact, the worst is sometimes true. According to the
Committee to Protect Journalists, more than 500 reporters have been
killed on the job since 1986. Every year they are kidnapped and
shot, go down in planes, crash on bad roads, run over land mines.
In the early '90s, top editors at the BBC noticed an increase in
the number of reporters injured on assignment. They were not about
to stop covering the news, so they decided to make sure their
people were better prepared for when things went wrong.
 &HT;    They asked Paul Rees, a Falklands war veteran with two decades
in the British marines, to help them develop a course to make
reporting safer. The business turned out to be so good that Rees
founded Centurion and ended up quitting the marines.
 &HT;    His creation is a paranoiac's delight. Nori and I began the
course on a drizzly day in October. We met with Rees and nearly two
dozen reporters from the BBC and ITN at the former estate, with its
firing range and a portrait of some venerable ancestor on the wall.
 &HT;    John Seward, who served in the marines with Rees, got things
rolling by showing off an arsenal, starting with handguns, from the
9-millimeter to the .45 (``Tad bit bigger,'' Seward said crisply,
``more thump at the end of it'') to the AK-47 (``Something like 18
million of these knocking around the world'') to rocket-propelled
grenades and artillery shells.
 &HT;    At every turn, he offered exotic advice: If you find yourself
unable to escape a grenade, lie down with the soles of your feet
pointing toward the blast. Your shoes can take the shock and
shrapnel better than your head.
 &HT;    Then it was off to the range itself, where I learned that
Starsky and Hutch most definitely would have died in the first
episode. The instructors fired weapons of increasing power into a
series of objects that someone like me might cower behind in a gun
battle: brick walls, cement blocks, car doors (no more Starsky),
tree trunks. None of those help for very long.
 &HT;    The only safe place, it seems, is behind a double row of
sandbags, sadly hard to come by. The lesson was clear: If someone
really wants to kill you, there is no way to stop it.
 &HT;    Technology isn't much help either. There was a poignant moment
on the range when a sales representative for a body-armor
manufacturer _ supposedly top-rate gear _ strapped a bulletproof
vest to  mannequin. The result, after a pounding from the rifles,
was, in industry jargon, ``100 percent failure.''
 &HT;    ``This has never happened before,'' the rep said. He was
stricken, and I felt like crying too. I have worn those things.
 &HT;    Rees, Seward and the others were instructors in the military _
where they tear recruits down to rebuild them stronger _ and I
guess that was the theory behind the centerpiece of the course.
 &HT;    Out of the blue on the first day, while we were in the back of a
Range Rover going much too fast, a red car appeared and forced our
driver to pull over. From the surrounding woods came a band of
masked men with rifles. I remember thinking, ``Ah, this is the part
where we get kidnapped.'' It seemed funny.
 &HT;    Then they pushed the guy in front of me face first into the mud.
Then me. Glasses, wedding bands, watches disappeared. Stinking
burlap bags went over our heads. I knew it wasn't real, but I still
couldn't catch my breath. They shoved us down onto the wet ground,
spread-eagled. Gunfire went off.
 &HT;    Someone mysteriously tapped the tips of my fingers. I thought:
``I only met these guys three hours ago. Will someone please tell
me why I am supposed to trust them?''
 &HT;    Twenty minutes later, inside the manor house turned corporate
training center, where students in other courses sat surreally
taking computer classes, Seward and the others asked us what we
thought about what we had been through and how we thought we had
behaved.
 &HT;    Only one person had ``died,'' which I thought was pretty good;
she was shot for ripping the bag off her head _ my first instinct
exactly. That was the bottom line: Remain calm, even when every
fluid ounce of you is screaming out in panic.
 &HT;    Then they let us in on the finer points of kidnapping etiquette.
Do not speak unless spoken to. Make enough eye contact to let your
kidnappers know you are human but not so much as to seem
threatening. Neither cower nor take charge. (Kidnappers are
apparently more likely to shoot either type.) Do whatever you are
told. If your captors start executing other hostages, kick, scream,
bite, run like hell.
 &HT;    ``Not much to lose at that point, is there?'' Seward asked.
 &HT;    This was the pattern repeated over the next three days. First,
they scare you silly. But then they tell you how to live through it
or, more realistically, how to improve your chances.
 &HT;    We saw an hours-long color video presentation of corpses shot up
and exploded, narrated in good cheer by the former military surgeon
who took the pictures. Our sex lives, we learned, could be
compromised by post-traumatic stress.
 &HT;    Not much was overlooked _ they even passed around preserved
specimens of a scorpion and a tarantula (the bites of which are not
normally fatal to healthy adults, though it is still smart to carry
a special venom-sucking syringe, which I now own).
 &HT;    The training was emphatically good to have _ most of the
reporters in the course thought so too _ even if it was not always
comforting. I kept thinking that the course was the evil twin of
the happy Lotto slogan, ``Hey, You Never Know.''
 &HT;    The truth is, though, that you can only work the margins. Life
itself is risky. Tromping around anywhere called ``rebel-held
territory,'' which I am finding out makes up an alarming percentage
of my new beat, makes it more so, and no amount of training can
erase that. When I told a colleague, Frank Clines, a longtime
foreign correspondent now based in Washington, that I was going to
take a course on avoiding dangerous situations, he gave me the only
truly sensible advice: ``Stay as far away as possible.''
 &HT;    That is the advice, I know, that many people give about the
place that makes me feel most safe: New York City. Now that I have
left it, I am somewhat soothed to know all these tricks from
Centurion. For the curious, here are a few: In crossfire, simply
lie on the ground. You are probably not the target. In mortar
attacks, again lie down. If you can, crawl into one of the holes
made by a previous shell because _ back to the thunderstorm analogy
_ lightning rarely strikes twice in the same place.
 &HT;    To see if an area is mined, look for exploded wildlife or
unusual patterns of rocks or leaves that locals might have
fashioned as a warning. (Crazy as it sounds, a
hostile-environment-school graduate actually avoided a booby trap
this way in Cambodia.) Keep your feet warm and dry.
 &HT;    Maintain good water discipline. I'm not sure what that means,
and I hope I never have to find out.

shot, go down in planes, crash on bad roads, run over land mines.
In the early '90s, top editors at the BBC noticed an increase in
the number of reporters injured on assignment. They were not about
to stop covering the news, so they decided to make sure their
people were better prepared for when things went wrong.
 &HT;    They asked Paul Rees, a Falklands war veteran with two decades
in the British marines, to help them develop a course to make
reporting safer. The business turned out to be so good that Rees
founded Centurion and ended up quitting the marines.
 &HT;    His creation is a paranoiac's delight. Nori and I began the
course on a drizzly day in October. We met with Rees and nearly two
dozen reporters from the BBC and ITN at the former estate, with its
firing range and a portrait of some venerable ancestor on the wall.
 &HT;    John Seward, who served in the marines with Rees, got things
rolling by showing off an arsenal, starting with handguns, from the
9-millimeter to the .45 (``Tad bit bigger,'' Seward said crisply,
``more thump at the end of it'') to the AK-47 (``Something like 18
million of these knocking around the world'') to rocket-propelled
grenades and artillery shells.
 &HT;    At every turn, he offered exotic advice: If you find yourself
unable to escape a grenade, lie down with the soles of your feet
pointing toward the blast. Your shoes can take the shock and
shrapnel better than your head.
 &HT;    Then it was off to the range itself, where I learned that
Starsky and Hutch most definitely would have died in the first
episode. The instructors fired weapons of increasing power into a
series of objects that someone like me might cower behind in a gun
battle: brick walls, cement blocks, car doors (no more Starsky),
tree trunks. None of those help for very long.
 &HT;    The only safe place, it seems, is behind a double row of
sandbags, sadly hard to come by. The lesson was clear: If someone
really wants to kill you, there is no way to stop it.
 &HT;    Technology isn't much help either. There was a poignant moment
on the range when a sales representative for a body-armor
manufacturer _ supposedly top-rate gear _ strapped a bulletproof
vest to a mannequin. The result, after a pounding from the rifles,
was, in industry jargon, ``100 percent failure.''
 &HT;    ``This has never happened before,'' the rep said. He was
stricken, and I felt like crying too. I have worn those things.
 &HT;    Rees, Seward and the others were instructors in the military _
where they tear recruits down to rebuild them stronger _ and I
guess that was the theory behind the centerpiece of the course.
 &HT;    Out of the blue on the first day, while we were in the back of a
Range Rover going much too fast, a red car appeared and forced our
driver to pull over. From the surrounding woods came a band of
masked men with rifles. I remember thinking, ``Ah, this is the part
where we get kidnapped.'' It seemed funny.
 &HT;    Then they pushed the guy in front of me face first into the mud.
Then me. Glasses, wedding bands, watches disappeared. Stinking
burlap bags went over our heads. I knew it wasn't real, but I still
couldn't catch my breath. They shoved us down onto the wet ground,
spread-eagled. Gunfire went off.
 &HT;    Someone mysteriously tapped the tips of my fingers. I thought:
``I only met these guys three hours ago. Will someone please tell
me why I am supposed to trust them?''
 &HT;    Twenty minutes later, inside the manor house turned corporate
training center, where students in other courses sat surreally
taking computer classes, Seward and the others asked us what we
thought about what we had been through and how we thought we had
behaved.
 &HT;    Only one person had ``died,'' which I thought was pretty good;
she was shot for ripping the bag off her head _ my first instinct
exactly. That was the bottom line: Remain calm, even when every
fluid ounce of you is screaming out in panic.
 &HT;    Then they let us in on the finer points of kidnapping etiquette.
Do not speak unless spoken to. Make enough eye contact to let your
kidnappers know you are human but not so much as to seem
threatening. Neither cower nor take charge. (Kidnappers are
apparently more likely to shoot either type.) Do whatever you are
told. If your captors start executing other hostages, kick, scream,
bite, run like hell.
 &HT;    ``Not much to lose at that point, is there?'' Seward asked.
 &HT;    This was the pattern repeated over the next three days. First,
they scare you silly. But then they tell you how to live through it
or, more realistically, how to improve your chances.
 &HT;    We saw an hours-long color video presentation of corpses shot up
and exploded, narrated in good cheer by the former military surgeon
who took the pictures. Our sex lives, we learned, could be
compromised by post-traumatic stress.
 &HT;    Not much was overlooked _ they even passed around preserved
specimens of a scorpion and a tarantula (the bites of which are not
normally fatal to healthy adults, though it is still smart to carry
a special venom-sucking syringe, which I now own).
 &HT;    The training was emphatically good to have _ most of the
reporters in the course thought so too _ even if it was not always
comforting. I kept thinking that the course was the evil twin of
the happy Lotto slogan, ``Hey, You Never Know.''
 &HT;    The truth is, though, that you can only work the margins. Life
itself is risky. Tromping around anywhere called ``rebel-held
territory,'' which I am finding out makes up an alarming percentage
of my new beat, makes it more so, and no amount of training can
erase that. When I told a colleague, Frank Clines, a longtime
foreign correspondent now based in Washington, that I was going to
take a course on avoiding dangerous situations, he gave me the only
truly sensible advice: ``Stay as far away as possible.''
 &HT;    That is the advice, I know, that many people give about the
place that makes me feel most safe: New York City. Now that I have
left it, I am somewhat soothed to know all these tricks from
Centurion. For the curious, here are a few: In crossfire, simply
lie on the ground. You are probably not the target. In mortar
attacks, again lie down. If you can, crawl into one of the holes
made by a previous shell because _ back to the thunderstorm analogy
_ lightning rarely strikes twice in the same place.
 &HT;    To see if an area is mined, look for exploded wildlife or
unusual patterns of rocks or leaves that locals might have
fashioned as a warning. (Crazy as it sounds, a
hostile-environment-school graduate actually avoided a booby trap
this way in Cambodia.) Keep your feet warm and dry.
 &HT;    Maintain good water discipline. I'm not sure what that means,
and I hope I never have to find out.

   WASHINGTON _ One thing is obvious, and another is highly
probable, about the leaked reports that Kenneth Starr may have
considered using his constitutional power to indict President
Clinton while still in office.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that Starr would be irresponsible if he did not
consider Clinton's vulnerability to the criminal process. It is
almost certain that so long as he holds office, the president
cannot be reached by criminal law, although no federal court has
ever ruled on the question.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing leaks, the rule is to ask who benefits. Starr and
the Republicans do not; they are embroiled in another tempest that
they do not need. The leaked report did not even say when he
considered the possibility of indictment.
</P>
<P>
   No one should be surprised if the independent counsel examined
the issue of indicting Clinton. Any careful prosecutor would
examine all options when he has evidence, as Starr does, that the
president committed perjury and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Jaworski, the second Watergate special prosecutor,
considered indicting Richard Nixon but rejected the idea. I would
be surprised if Archibald Cox, the first special prosecutor, did
not also consider that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, someone wrote ``constitutional problem?'' in the margins
of the memorandum outlining the case against Nixon that the U.S.
attorney's office handed over to Cox.
</P>
<P>
   The Framers' discussions assumed that a presidential impeachment
would precede any criminal trial. Article I, Section 3 _ ``the
party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to
Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law'' _
reflects that assumption.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that the president, uniquely responsible for the
affairs of the United States, should not be taken from his duties
unless shorn of them by the Senate or by the expiration of his
term.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the president's unique duties is shown by Article
II: the whole ``executive Power'' is vested in the president,
including the powers of the commander in chief, the power to
command the executive departments, the power and responsibility to
execute the laws, and the powers shared with the Senate to make
treaties, appoint ambassadors and appoint judges and Supreme Court
justices.
</P>
<P>
   The singular importance of the office is demonstrated by the
25th Amendment, which provides for a replacement when a president
becomes physically or mentally ill. There is, significantly, no
provision for replacing any other incapacitated member of any of
the branches. They may be indicted (Vice President Spiro Agnew) and
tried (Judge Otto Kerner, for example) while still in office.
</P>
<P>
   The capstone, however, is that the Framers, who provided such an
elaborate mechanism for removing a president through impeachment (a
process involving the House, Senate and chief justice), could not
have contemplated that the entire, solemn procedure could be
short-circuited by a jury of 12 citizens selected virtually at
random.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision in the Paula Jones case is not to
the contrary. The schedule of a civil action can accommodate the
president's other obligations, and testimony can be videotaped.
There is not the severely disruptive prospect of imprisonment that
a criminal trial creates.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of the evidence, therefore, supports the conclusion
that impeachment and conviction must come before indictment and
trial.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 1906; a man writes for advice. He has lied to his wife and
wonders if he should tell her the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now I never told anyone about it, but it bothers me. I
have no secrets from my wife, and I want to know whether I should
now tell her all, or not mention it. I beg you to answer me.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer: ``This secret may be withheld from his beloved wife,
since it is clear he keeps it from her out of love.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is the secret? It's not about fooling around. The man
and wife are immigrants living from paycheck to paycheck. The wife
has fallen gravely ill, and the husband must tend her. His boss
tells him that if he doesn't appear at work he will be fired. He
fears they will slowly starve to death. He opens the gas jet, gets
into bed with his wife, and waits for death for the two of them.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly his wife cries out for water. As he goes to get it, he
closes the gas jet. Two weeks later she has recovered, but he does
not know whether to tell her the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The advice comes from the arbiter of ethics and behavior for
millions of people, for dozens of years: The Jewish Daily Forward.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1881 and 1925, about 2.5 million Jewish immigrants came
to America from Eastern Europe. Few spoke English and most were
very poor. They were all eager to integrate, to become, as my
grandmother used to say ``real Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed guidance, not only in the ways of the new land but
in ways that would carry on the traditions they had left behind.
Not all of them chose to continue the Orthodox way of life, but
they did not want to throw aside the ethics of their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus arose the readership for the daily column, A Bintel Brief
(A Bundle of Letters). It was the Dear Abby and the Ann Landers of
its day, giving advice in solving weighty problems. It eased the
transition from the old world to the new. And it dispensed wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   A man who describes himself as a ``greenhorn'' from Russia
inquires: ``Shall I send my father a few dollars for Passover, or
should I keep the little money for myself? I will do what you tell
me.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bintel Brief replies: ``He should send his father the few
dollars for Passover because, as he is young, he will find it
easier to earn a living than would hi. blind father in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Concise and to the point: It is all right to lie to your loved
ones to spare them pain. Help your parents, even if it requires
personal sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   A letter on eating habits will resonate with the parents of
today who shape tofu into the form of a turkey at Thanksgiving:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two sons, 9 and 7 years old. They are healthy, well
built and are doing well in public school and Hebrew school. So you
would think everything is fine, but I have trouble with the older
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``About nine months ago he took it into his head to become a
vegetarian and stopped eating meat...As soon as he smelled meat
cooking he wouldn't come into the kitchen. ...Not only does he
refuse meat, but he doesn't even eat fish or sardines. With thanks
for your answer, The Worried Mother.
</P>
<P>
   A Bintel Brief: ``The mother is advised to find out where her
son got the idea to become a vegetarian, and then, with the help of
a specialist, she might be able to bring him back to eating
meat...A good doctor would know how to treat her 9-year-old
vegetarian.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 92 years since the following letter was written, nothing
has changed:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a girl from Galicia and in the shop where I work I sit
near a Russian Jew with whom I was always on good terms...But once,
in a short debate, he stated that all Galicians were no good, ...
and that he wished all Galician Jews dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Editor, does he really have a right to aay this7 And,
does he, the Russian, remain fine and intelligent in spite of such
expressions?''
</P>
<P>
   A Bintel Brief: ``The Galician Jews are just as good and bad as
people from other lands. If the Galicians must be ashamed of the
foolish and evil ones among them, then the Russians, too, must hide
their heads in shame because among them there is such an idiot as
the acquaintance of our letter writer.''
</P>
<P>
   For the new year I wish every reader peace, and I heartily
recommend ``A Bintel Brief: Sixty Years of Letters From the Lower
East Side to the Jewish Daily Forward,'' compiled and edited by
Isaac Metzker (Schocken Books, $12).

5 STEPS TO A DEBT-FREE NEW YEAR
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Di Gesu is cq.)
 By ABBY SCHULTZ

 World rights  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As winter rolls on, you can think back fondly to the holidays,
remembering the squeals of your children as they tore open their
gifts and the good times spent with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But those pleasant memories can vanish quickly when the credit
card bills arrive. There in stark black and white are the Brio
train table for the kids and the Palm Pilot for your spouse, as
well as the restaurant charges for all the times your family ate
out because you were too rushed to make dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Don't panic. To let spending get out of hand is only human,
especially around the holidays, when there's a good excuse to
splurge on your family. What's important is to pay off the debt now
so it doesn't add up as the year goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a step-by-step guide to getting rid of holiday debt, plus
advice on how to keep your family finances on track year-round.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Examine Your Expenses &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lay your credit card bills on the kitchen table and tallying the
cost of your spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   Then write down must-pay monthly expenses, such as the mortgage
or rent, car payments, student loans and utility bills. Next,
estimate how much your family spends on food, clothing and
entertainment every month.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't come up with a number for these ``flexible''
expenses, write down in a small notebook every dollar you spend _
whether it's on groceries, dinner out with your spouse, or art
supplies for your daughter's playgroup _ for one week. Add it up at
the end of the week multiply by four and you'll have a rough
estimate of your monthly flexible spending.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've come up with an amount make it part of your fixed
monthly expenses and start applying it to your card balances.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Dip Into Savings &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The interest rates on your credit cards probably average around
16 percent. Compare that with the interest you're earning on your
savings account (currently about 2.1 percent) or taxable
money-market fund (4.66 percent). Clearly, you'll save money if you
tap your savings to help pay off your credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Tackle the cards with the highest interest rates first (such as
department store cards, which may charge up to 22 percent).
</P>
<P>
   But don't dig too deep into your savings if you can avoid it,
particularly if you think you can get rid of your holiday debt in
three or four big monthly payments, says James Di Gesu, a certified
public accountant and senior manager in KPMG's personal
financial-planning practice in New York City. You may pay $20 to
$30 in extra finance charges, but it's worth it to keep an
emergency fund of at least three months' living expenses set aside
for bigger, unexpected obligations, he notes, such as medical
bills.
</P>
<P>
   And try not to touch long-term savings, such as retirement funds
or college accounts, because you might incur hefty withdrawal
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Use Credit Cards to Advantage &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Once you've earmarked the money to pay off your debts, the next
step is to take a hard look at your credit cards. It's easier to
shed debt if you have to make only one or two payments a month
instead of six.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the balances from all those cards that got a holiday
workout over to the lowest-rate card (then cancel and cut up the
higher-rate offenders), and you've immediately reduced your monthly
costs.
</P>
<P>
   If the interest rate is still uncomfortably high, call the card
company and try to get a better rate. Point out that you're
considering a lower-rate offer from another provider. Chances are
good that your current company will cut you a deal. Don't try this
with a department store, however. They won't play ball.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Go Back to Cash &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The best way to make sure that you don't overspend in the future
is to pay for purchases with cash, says Ginger Applegarth, a
Winchester, Mass.-based certified financial planner. Decide what
you can spend each week and take that amount out of the bank on
Monday. If the weekend rolls around and you've run out of cash,
forget about taking the kids to the movies; instead, stay home and
play games with them.
</P>
<P>
   To find out where the money goes, keep track of what you're
spending by putting receipts in a designated envelope or by writing
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider using a debit card if you don't like to carry lots of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. Start Saving for the Future &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Once your debts are under control, you can channel into savings
the money you were using to pay off your credit cards. You can do
this easily by having money automatically withdrawn from your
checking account into a savings account at your bank or into an
uninsured money market fund, which earns investors a higher
interest rate for taking on slightly more risk.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage good planning throughout the year, set up separate
savings accounts to cover specific expenses, like gifts for family
and friends. Then, when the holidays come around again, you'll have
a set sum to spend. And you'll be able to enjoy the season without
dreading the bills.

<P>
   You've probably seen the ads for Sony Minidisc, pushing the
promise of digital music mixes without the hassles of cassette
tapes. It's a good selling point. In the early '80s, I spent
endless evenings extracting my favorite songs from hours of radio
play, grouping them onto tapes called ``The Best Dance,'' ``Rock
for Amy'' and ``Decent New Wave.''
</P>
<P>
   But cassettes, like new wave, went out with the '80s. And just
because you haven't laid down the cash for the audio toy-du-jour
doesn't mean you can't have a digital mix of your own. In fact,
there are at least six services on the Internet that are banking on
the hunch that consumers will want to create personalized CD mixes
_ complete with liner notes, your own title and cover art.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of marketing custom album mixes is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   You might vaguely remember seeing a company called Personics
from your Reagan-era trips to the mall. They would make custom-made
cassette compilations for you at kiosks in record stores. Of
course, major labels weren't thrilled with the arrangement, since
customers could pick and choose hits and bypass the full-length
albums. As a result, Personics in 1990 went the way of Elvis and
Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of picking, clicking and rocking seems pretty
cool, actually doing it (like many things on the Internet) is not
as easy or fun as it could be.
</P>
<P>
   On a quest to create my own CD, I put at the top of my list of
sites a company called SuperSonic BOOM (www.supersonicboom.com).
After finding my way around, I saw that my musical choices were
somewhat limited.
</P>
<P>
   It's all too obvious that the major label pressures that plagued
Personics haven't gone away. So, while you can find tracks by
Dhaima Matthews, you won't find any Dave Matthews. Or any Madonna,
or Spice Girls, or Smashing Pumpkins, or ... you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   After spending about 45 minutes putting together a mix of music,
I went to purchase the CD, only to find out that they didn't have a
secure site for retrieving my credit card information. Most
Internet experts caution consumers against giving out any credit
card information on unsecured sites. (Looking at the little lock or
key icon at the bottom of your browser will tell you if the site is
secure.)
</P>
<P>
   Leaving that site mixless, I went to Custom Disc
(www.customdisc.com). After waiting an impossibly long time for the
pages to load in (over my 56K modem) I found out that they, too,
had an unsecured transaction page.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I found My-Disc, a site co-founded by former VH-1
president and Prodigy CEO Ed Bennett. In addition to having a
secure site, it also seemed to have the best selection.
</P>
<P>
   What I found there were lots of rock classics, like Little
Richard and Tina Turner, and good jazz and blues. Since jazz is big
in my household, I followed that path.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a meter at the bottom that displays how much time
you have left on your disc and how much you've spent. The base
price is $5.99, and the tally adds a dollar for each song you pick.
</P>
<P>
   My disc started with some smooth ``Do You Know What It Means To
Miss New Orleans'' by Louis Armstrong. Next, it glided through some
Billie Holliday, Wynton and Ellis Marsalis and Dizzy Gillespie. I
wound it down with Count Basie and Glenn Miller and their
orchestras and finished it off with ``Georgia On my Mind'' by Art
Blakey and his Jazz Messengers. I had 69 minutes of cool jazz for
$16.99.
</P>
<P>
   I titled my disc ``Digital Swingtime'' and chose cover art of a
beer mug. I entered my mailing address and credit card number and,
days later, had my made-to-order disc.
</P>
<P>
   How did it sound? Great. The songs all flowed together and there
weren't any of the awkward stops and starts that prevailed on my
homemade tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, this isn't something I would make a habit of. I
really had to look for enough songs to make a whole disc. But if
the music-on-the-Internet industry grows (and it seems likely to)
there's bound to be better selections available all the time. In
the meantime, I'll probably still be cruising to the sounds of one
of those classic mixes, like ``Rock for Amy.''

   WASHINGTON _ The integrity of our government of laws _ not men _
depends on our fidelity to the basic principle that society will
holds each of its members accountable to the rule of law.
Similarly, when the House impeached President Clinton for his
alleged perjury and obstruction of justice, Congress was
demonstrating that it would not tolerate conduct in our president
that would not be acceptable were it committed by other citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The House, in performing its constitutional accusatory function,
without regard to whether the Senate would likely convict,
reaffirmed that a president will be held accountable to the rule of
law. And it informed future presidents that obstruction of justice
and perjury may lead to removal.
</P>
<P>
   But what are the consequences for the rule of law if the Senate
proceeds to acquit the president? Some have argued that for the
rule of law to be safeguarded the Senate must come to terms in the
trial. In other words, a vote up or down on conviction must occur.
That is why some of my colleagues support a bifurcated vote: one
vote on the facts _ whether the president committed the offenses
alleged _ and the other vote on whether he should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   A bifurcated vote would allow the Senate to, in effect, condemn
Clinton by finding that he committed felonies. But there is a
downside to this procedure: It is anticipated that on the final
vote, Clinton would be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really in the best interests of the country for the Senate
to rule that perjury and obstruction are not removable offenses? I
think not.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Senate proceed to a final vote, I am prepared to vote
my conscience. Still, the Senate should seek a conclusion that
protects the integrity of the House impeachment articles by
avoiding a historic vote on the merits, which could be interpreted
as vindicating the president and tell the country and future
generations of Americans that perjury and obstruction of justice
are not impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The message the House sent to our posterity is that Clinton's
behavior is immoral and wrong. In history books, he will go down as
only the second president of the United States to be impeached. Any
vote that acquits Clinton, in essence, minimizes the importance of
the articles.
</P>
<P>
   To acquit the president may well weaken the rule of law and
would create a precedent that could very well encourage wrongful
conduct by public officials. After all, if the Senate votes to
acquit Clinton and, thereby, finds that perjury and obstruction of
justice are not removable, will future presidents, judges and other
officials be appropriately deterred from committing similar acts?
</P>
<P>
   The Senate does not have the votes to convict the president, and
more than one-third of the Senate (all but one of the 45 Democrats)
has said it never will. Since it appears that the president will
stay in office, the Senate should seek a conclusion that brings
Democrats and Republicans together and also avoids the formal
ruling that Clinton's conduct is not removable. The Senate should
vote to adjourn the trial sine die (permanently, without return) on
these grounds:
</P>
<P>
   1. President Clinton gave false and misleading testimony under
oath in federal court proceedings and has, in several ways, impeded
the justice system's search for truth.
</P>
<P>
   2. He will be subject to federal criminal jurisdiction for his
acts after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Senate acknowledges, recognizes and accedes to the
articles of impeachment passed by the House as Impeachment Without
Removal, the highest form of condemnation, other than removal.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Senate to adjourn and make these findings, it would
deny the president an acquittal _ the result he craves for his own
historic legitimacy. The Senate would also make clear that the
House-passed articles of impeachment are constitutionally
legitimate by stating that the articles themselves are the highest
form of condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   It would also allow Democrats to vote their conscience without
having to vote to acquit. This alone could avoid a prolonged
post-trial squabble over a cover-your-tail censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   It is better for the country, the rule of law and the
Constitution that the Senate not formally vote that perjury and
obstruction of justice flowing from private conduct are not
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The virtue of this approach is that no one can seriously argue
the articles are superseded or irrelevant. While the approach may
at first glance appear to be legal sophistry, the Senate will not
have crossed the Rubicon by finding that obstruction of justice and
perjury are not impeachable offenses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The adjournment solution is the most honorable way to conclude
this drama. The Senate will have done its constitutional duty by
holding and concluding a trial. It will have employed a fair
process and have done impartial justice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the trial of Andrew Johnson, the Senate adjourned the
trial without having passed final judgment on eight of the 11
impeachment articles against him. By permanently adjourning, the
Senate will not have formally acquitted the president and therefore
will not have established the precedent that obstruction of justice
and perjury are not impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   The House's vote to impeach Clinton will stand as a rebuke
forever, and the search for truth will have trumped political
expediency.

   Bill Clinton's optimistic State of the Union address and his
promise of a New Dawn for America are stirring new debate over the
likelihood of his continued presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Pegged to this debate, The New York Times Syndicate is offering
``Bill Clinton's Legacy (The First Draft),'' a five-part series
adapted from Jacob Weisberg's prescient article in The New York
Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART I: BILL CLINTON'S LEGACY: THE FIRST DRAFT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal represents
something that is truly historic _ a break in the way the American
presidency functions. He has changed the nature of the presidency,
removed its heroic mandate and downsized the office as demanded by
the historical moment.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART II: BILL CLINTON: THE GOVERNOR-PRESIDENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his concern with Social Security, welfare, health insurance,
the minimum wage and other issues generally thought of in
connection with state government, President Clinton has made the
Oval Office into a kind of extended governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART III: HOW BILL CLINTON CREATED A DEMOCRATIC COALITION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the Democratic Party, Clinton has made ``incurable''
ailments vanish, jettisoning Dukakis-era positions such as
opposition to the death penalty, putting away the idea that
Democrats are fuzzy liberals who are ``soft on crime.'' He has
created a sense of partisan pride and given party members a new
taste of power.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART IV: BILL CLINTON'S PERSONALLY FLAWED POPULISM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton will be remembered as one who played games with the
truth, but whose claim to government was based on what he could do,
not his qualities as a moral exemplar.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART V: IS A `CULTURE WAR' TO BLAME FOR CLINTON'S
DETRACTORS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives such as Bill Bennett often take the route of
becoming infuriated with the public for falling for Bill Clinton, a
man some say is a charlatan. There are three profiles of
Clinton-hating, actually; what's behind them?

   Bill Clinton's optimistic State of the Union address and his
promise of a New Dawn for America are stirring new debate over the
likelihood of his continued presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Pegged to this debate, The New York Times Syndicate is offering
``Bill Clinton's Legacy (The First Draft),'' a five-part series

<P>
   _ PART I: BILL CLINTON'S LEGACY: THE FIRST DRAFT &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Bill Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal represents
something that is truly historic _ a break in the way the American

removed its heroic mandate and downsized the office as demanded by
the historical moment.

   In his concern with Social Security, welfare, health insurance,

<P>
   Recent events have given the lie to the conventional wisdom on
civil wars: that they are private matters which great powers may
simply ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 years, America has again and again found itself
in the middle of foreign, internal conflicts, from Haiti to
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere has the focus been so acute or the consequences as
immediate as in the Balkans. The United States and its Western
allies have worked hard _ though with limited success _ to end the
wars that erupted when Yugoslavia collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Western interests were directly implicated; concern over
humanitarian abuses, the risk of war spreading to neighboring
states and the future of NATO justified American and European
intervention. The Dayton accords seemed to win a fragile peace for
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But the threat of war in Europe now looms as likely as ever, as
elections return Bosnian hard-liners to office and the uprising
tragically flares in Kosovo. The prospects of achieving a lasting
peace in the region are slim, and these problems are likely to vex
American policymakers for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The attention paid by the West to the wars in the former
Yugoslavia should come as no surprise. Only recently have
superpowers refrained from involvement in internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally the case has been just the opposite. And with good
reason: revolutions in France, Russia and China sparked profound
changes in the international system that remain with us today.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, internal conflicts in Korea and Vietnam
drew the United States into costly interventions, while domestic
strife in El Salvador and Nicaragua dominated American foreign
policy through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, for the Soviet Union, internal wars provided the
source for both one of Moscow's greatest victories (Cuba) and one
of its most costly defeats (Afghanistan).
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the USSR (brought on in part by the Afghan
disaster) and the end of the Cold War, new questions must be asked
about civil wars and American interests. Proxy fights between
Russia and America are no longer likely. The domino effect is no
longer a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Though wars within states continue to outnumber those fought
between them, many now argue that the United States should turn its
back on these internal squabbles. These civil wars, they argue, are
the domestic affairs of poor, weak countries, not important enough
to merit American involvement. Getting enmeshed in complicated
disputes and age-old hatreds will sap American resources _ and for
no good reason.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to this view. Most civil wars do not directly
threaten the United States or its allies. While recent internal
conflicts have raised humanitarian concerns, none has seriously
affected American security or economic interests. This, however,
was largely a matter of luck.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should recognize a vital and sobering truth:
that not only the former Yugoslavia, but also Russia, Mexico and
Saudi Arabia all now stand on the brink of civil war, conflicts
that would have devastating consequences for the United States.
These consequences are not the traditional dangers of
state-to-state aggression, such as outside attack or invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Though largely ignored by scholars and policymakers, who remain
fixated on the idea of international conflict, internal war has
emerged as a principal threat to security in the post-Cold War
world.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts may foment within the borders of a single state, and
yet in this day and age they send shock waves far beyond their
frontiers. To begin with, internal wars risk destroying assets the
United States needs. Were the Persian Gulf oil fields destroyed in
a Saudi civil war, the American economy (and those of the rest of
the developed world) would suffer severely.
</P>
<P>
   Internal wars can also unleash threats that stable governments
formerly held in check. As central governments weaken and fall,
weapons of mass destruction may fall into the hands of rogue
leaders or anti-American factions. More directly, internal wars
endanger American citizens living and traveling abroad. Liberia
will not be the last place America sends helicopters to rescue its
stranded citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, internal wars, when they erupt on U.S. borders,
threaten to destabilize America itself. U.S. intervention in Haiti
was spurred, in large part, by fear of the flood of refugees poised
to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All of these dangers are grave enough to warrant consideration;
what makes them even more serious is the fact that their impact on
America is largely unintended. Being unintended, the spill-off
effects of the world's civil wars are not easily deterred, which
creates unique challenges to American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, Washington must recognize that future threats
will be qualitatively different from traditional challenges. During
the Cold War, an enormous amount of military, economic and
scholarly effort went into deterring a Soviet invasion of Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   America did not then hesitate to protect itself. The prospect of
internal war erupting in key states is now just as likely as was
that of Soviet troops pouring through the Fulda Gap, and the
consequences would be just as catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the U.S. government gives internal war only a tiny
fraction of the attention it once paid to the Soviet threat. With
the Cold War over and internal wars virtually the only form of
battle being fought, scholars and policymakers need to shift gears
and recognize that not all threats to security are deliberate,
purposeful acts of a coherent enemy that can be deterred with the
right policy.
</P>
<P>
   Civil wars _ whether in Kosovo or Moscow _ could inadvertently
unleash catastrophic harms. Because these risks are so hard to
prevent, they must now get the analysis and attention they so
urgently deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Though the inadvertent side effects of internal conflicts cannot
be deterred, the outbreak of civil war itself may be discouraged.
Doing so may require unambiguous and generous American support for
a regime that finds itself under assault. Or it may require
Washington to ease out unsustainable leaders once their time has
clearly passed.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the difficulties of preventing internal war pale in
comparison to the problems of coping with its effects.

<P>
   Anyone personally appointed by the president of the United
States to a position of high trust and responsibility in foreign
and defense policy swears to uphold the Constitution and laws of
the United States, has the FBI confirm his or her patriotism, and
accepts a good-faith obligation as a public servant to serve the
interests of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not all.
</P>
<P>
   Senior appointments entail an obligation of loyalty to the
president who appointed you. That is not the same as unlimited
allegiance, much less subservient obedience or blind faith. It does
not exclude other obligations to Congress, the taxpayers or one's
department. But it is an obligation, nevertheless _ one that, once
accepted, should not be lightly abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   This charge is more than a legal obligation arising out of an
employer-employee relationship. It is even more than loyalty to an
impersonal administration or ``team,'' though that may well be part
of it. Conversely, it is more than a matter of friendship, for it
applies equally to those who have a close relationship with the
president and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   It is essentially a moral commitment to that president as
president, to respect his leadership, reciprocate his confidence
and trust, and faithfully support his final decisions, even _ or
especially _ when they are under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the meaning and limitations of loyalty to the
president were raised anew by the recent legal and political
imbroglio in Washington arising out of President Clinton's sexual
misconduct. In a futile effort at concealment, he lied not only
under oath and to the public but also to his cabinet and White
House staff.
</P>
<P>
   His secretary of state, secretary of the treasury and other top
aides were in effect dispatched to repeat his denials to the news
media, the grand jury investigating his activities, and
representatives of foreign governments. Several months later, when
the truth was out, their pain was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not one appointee resigned. Reportedly, only one mildly
rebuked the president. Several told others of their sense of
betrayal, sorrow, shame or anger over their forced grand jury
appearances _ but almost never spoke publicly to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Some appointees were deemed ``gullible'' for believing him,
``gutless'' for not leaving him, or ``foolishly loyal'' for
remaining silent. Yet former Clinton appointees who spoke
negatively to the press about his actions were labeled ``ungrateful
and disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting commentaries on loyalty to the president can be
divided into two schools. One maintains that loyalty in general is
an antiquated trait that has largely fallen into disuse. Evidence
of this proposition abounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the more cynical, materialistic 1980s and 1990s, few pay
attention to such lofty concepts as honor, steadfastness and
fidelity. A more mobile workforce has become accustomed to slipping
the bonds of devotion to former mentors, employers and friends and
finds time only for acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Children no longer grow up unshakable fans of ``hometown''
sports teams because they seldom have a ``hometown,'' and the star
players _ and even the franchises themselves _ leave to pursue
greater riches elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs betraying the secrets of former confidants, spouses or
lovers have been highly successful; unsurprisingly, books by recent
administration officials have not all been discreet, much less
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, loyalty to the chief was both taught and enforced by
big-city political organizations built on unswerving fealty to the
local leader and the patronage, promotions and perquisites that
came with it. Among federal employees in the pre-civil service
days, William Howard Taft once wrote, ``even the humblest charwoman
... felt a throb of deep personal interest in the political health
of the President.''
</P>
<P>
   But today's political organizations are too weak to provide any
meaningful reward or inspiration for the faithful, much less any
discipline for those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   The other current school of media commentary finds the principle
of loyalty to the president not so much forgotten and underutilized
as all too present and overrated. Loyalty is derided as a
Mafia-like code of silence that prevents current and former
advisers from criticizing unconscionable presidential actions _ an
instrument of ``political serfdom'' that stifles disagreement
within an administration and keeps appointees from either resigning
in protest or speaking out in public.
</P>
<P>
   Kai Bird's recent book on the Bundy brothers and Vietnam
criticizes them and other ``wise men ... so steeped in the
Establishment's culture of discretion that values loyalty over
dissent'' that they could not break with President Johnson on
Vietnam or publicly disagree with him even after leaving office.
``In short,'' Bird writes, ``the Establishment had a problem
speaking truth to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. McNamara was similarly accused of ``misguided
loyalty'' for withholding his doubts about the winnability and
morality of the Vietnam War even after he left the Department of
Defense for the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But passion over either the Clinton follies or Vietnam should
not blind us to the long-term value of loyalty. Loyalty is
indispensable to an organized society and to orderly and effective
governance. No American president can provide consistent direction
in foreign affairs if he cannot depend upon those who accept his
trust to also accept his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No president should need to spell out this obligation to his new
appointees; he has every right and reason to assume it is part of
their instinctive morality and institutional duty. Presidential
aides expect and deserve it from one another to deter leaks,
backbiting and factionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The very concept of ``public service'' requires it from all who
put their personal interests aside to serve. The framers of the
Constitution, having rejected the notion of an executive council
directing the president, assumed his subordinates would support
him.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between a loyal agent and a fanatical
zealot _ or a servile puppet. All obligations of principle have
practical conditions and limitations, and that includes the
principle of loyalty to the president. As a new appointee, you have
a duty to support, protect and defend his interests, success and
agenda even on those occasions when they are inconsistent with your
interests, success and agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not require you to ``fall on your sword,'' go to
prison, or endanger your life or that of others. You are not
expected to forswear commitments to country and conscience, to
family and faith. Your obligation to keep his secrets is not an
obligation to tell lies, especially under oath. Your commitment to
his every cause does not oblige you to conspire in any crime.
</P>
<P>
   If loyalty does not require zealotry, neither does it require
sycophancy. Neither the president nor the presidency is well served
by a toady intimidated by the atmosphere of ``fear and fawning''
surrounding the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser must be more than an uncritical admirer. Eagerness to
concur must not repress the qualities of mind and character that
caused you to be appointed in the first place. Your duty is not to
please the president but to help him _ bringing him your best
judgment even when it is harsh, the whole truth even when it hurts,
and all the choices even when they are hard.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, loyalty to the president, if it is to endure, must be
reciprocal. A president under fire who blames his appointees for
his failures or shames them in front of their peers is far more
likely to find his aides undercutting him with unattributed
comments to reporters and his former appointees distancing
themselves from his troubles than a president who has consistently
shown ``loyalty down'' by defending his aides in public, reassuring
them in private and protecting them against attacks from Congress
or the press.
</P>
<P>
   No president is required to tell any of his appointees
everything, but he cannot long retain their trust if he tells them
lies. No president is required to be right every time, but he has
no right to risk the very principles that drew his subordinates to
him. No president is required to accept any aide's advice on any
particular issue, but he risks resignation or revolt if he rejects
that advice without ample explanation of his reasons and careful
consideration of that adviser's core values.
</P>
<P>
   One's core values will ultimately test whether one's loyalty to
the president is more than kind words. The obligation to accept his
final decisions is not limited to those about which you do not care
or with which you do not disagree. Living with deep-seated
disagreement and disappointment is an inevitable part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite checks and balances, the American system entrusts
enormous decision- making authority to the presidency. That grant
of power is justified and conditioned on one fundamental fact: Its
occupant is elected by all the people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps on some critical issue, an aide is certain that the
president was wrong and the aide right. But, as the old question
goes: Who elected you? The president alone bears the final
responsibility, and he receives information, advice, options and
political considerations of which you may be unaware.
</P>
<P>
   Loyally accepting a presidential decision with which you
profoundly disagree does not require a surrender of your rights or
values. Within the limits of loyalty, you can continue to voice
your doubts and dissents privately to the president, ``speaking
truth to power'' as George Ball did on Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   You can ask that you not be assigned to defend that which you
consider indefensible _ a request that serves the president's own
interest, for you may be unable to defend it credibly and
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can swallow your disapproval, confide your disquietude
only to your diary and distant memoirs (not in leaks to the press
or in disgruntled administration cabals), and stay at your post,
remaining ever hopeful that this too will pass, that on most
important issues within your jurisdiction the president has earned
your support, and that your continuing to prod within his circle
will do more to move him in the right direction than any public
protest you might make.
</P>
<P>
   Clark M. Clifford, by carrying on as secretary of defense even
as his doubts grew about Vietnam, helped steer President Johnson
toward a negotiated exit. That is not a coward's rationale. Staying
often takes more courage than leaving.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the president's decision involves so overriding a
principle that you can no longer in good conscience continue to
believe in his leadership, much less implement that particular
decision, then it is neither dishonorable nor disloyal to quietly
submit your resignation _ not to continually threaten it, but to
simply do it.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty may induce you to postpone the effective date until
after that particular crisis or the next election. It may induce
you not to make public your discomfort for months, for years or
forever, depending on the urgency of the issue and the prospects of
changing the president's course. It cannot and should not compel
you to stay when your heart is no longer in your job.
</P>
<P>
   But abandoning a president of the United States in crisis is not
a step one takes lightly. The president's troubles, even if
self-inflicted, are the nation's troubles. It is a time not to jump
ship but to help save it.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer does not abandon a long-term client for ignoring his
advice, withholding facts from him or otherwise falling short of
his standards.
</P>
<P>
   If you leave a president's side, you increase the weight of
those who advised him differently than you, and you leave
shorthanded those in the administration who share your convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing you, the president is promising that he will hear
your advice, not that he will always heed it. He is promising you a
post full of challenge, not a post free from disappointment. He is
expecting not only your wisdom but also your loyalty. There is no
way of knowing at what point, on what issue, that loyalty will be
severely tested.
</P>
<P>
   You may then be required to balance the principle of loyalty
against some other principle you hold dear, the need to recognize
the president's democratic authority against your individual
convictions, his right to your support against your right to speak
out, your prospects for helping to alter his course if you stay
inside against your prospects for influencing that course if you
move outside.
</P>
<P>
   You will receive conflicting advice from concerned friends,
interested groups, and self-righteous columnists. If you cannot
handle that pressure, better reconsider accepting the appointment.

doing business with the city to provide the same benefits to
workers with unmarried partners as they give to married employees.
</P>
<P>
   United joined a federal lawsuit filed in May 1997 by the Air
Transport Association, the trade group for the nation's biggest
airlines, seeking exemption from the ordinance, contending that
only the federal government could force such a requirement on the
industry. The case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Board of Supervisors has not voted for a boycott,
Board President Tom Ammiano and board members Leslie Katz and Mark
Leno joined other supporters of the domestic partners ordinance in
urging people to avoid United.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he knew nothing of that request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about a United boycott, who sponsored the boycott
or any of those things,'' he said. He added that his use of United
should in no way be construed as a waning commitment to his support
of equal rights for gays.
</P>
<P>
   He said he flew United to New York and back from Washington,
D.C., last week because it was the most convenient. United is the
largest airline at San Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if the Board of Supervisors made a boycott official
city policy, he would comply. That is unlikely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot be in a position of penalizing United because we're
in litigation,'' Katz said. ``To have an actual boycott would
subject the city to legal liability for attempting to curtail an
entity's legal right to challenge an ordinance. However, the city
can call United to task for its failure to accord its employees
basic dignity and respect.''

   The creators of the new ``Winds of Mars'' recording say the
music, which overlays Bach piano pieces with sounds collected by a
spacecraft, is the ``world's first all-digital, extraterrestrial
music production.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's much competition for the honor, but we were
intrigued anyway. During the Pathfinder landing on Mars in 1997 the
craft's weather station recorded the weather on the Red Planet's
surface. A Minneapolis computer expert took the data, ran it
through a synthesizer to create recognizable sounds and manipulated
those sounds to resemble the aural equivalent of the Martian
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Pianist Roderick Kettlewell plays the 17 Bach solo piano
compositions. The recording, at about $15 for cassette and $20 for
CD, shipping included, may be ordered online at
http://www.windsofmars.com or by calling (612) 338-5461.

   POOCH PRIMPING: Origins, that body-products-and-makeup company,
has moved into the non-human market with a trio of items set for
release this spring. First up is Comb Improvements Dog Detangler, a
``miracle mixture'' that ``magically untangles, conditions and
moisturizes dogs' coats with a natural pleasant fragrance.''
</P>
<P>
   The spray blends oils, including lavender, geranium, oakmoss and
patchouli, together with wheat protein to condition, detangle and
make grooming more pleasurable. There's also a dog shampoo and
Guard Dog Spray, which sounds like doggy deodorant. It combines
citronella, tansy flower, eucalyptus and oat extract to reduce the
dog's stink and soothe its skin.
</P>
<P>
   The products, to be rolled out now through May, will be

<P>
   Oil is a magnet for conflict. The problem is simple _ everyone
needs energy, but the sources of the world's transportation fuel
are concentrated in relatively few countries.
</P>
<P>
   Well over two-thirds of the world's remaining oil reserves lie
in the Middle East, leaving the rest of the world dependent on the
region's collection of predators and vulnerable autocrats.
</P>
<P>
   This unwelcome dependence keeps U.S. military forces tied to the
Persian Gulf, forces foreign-policy compromises and sinks many
developing nations into staggering debt as they struggle to pay for
expensive dollar-denominated oil with lower-priced commodities and
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, oil causes environmental conflict. The possibility
that greenhouse gases will lead to catastrophic climate change is
substantially increased by the 40 million barrels of oil burned
every day by vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   If the hundreds of billions of dollars that now flow into a few
coffers in a few nations were to flow instead to the millions of
people who till the world's fields, most countries would see
substantial national security, economic and environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, energy is vital to a country's security and material
well-being. A state unable to provide its people with adequate
energy supplies or desiring added leverage over other people often
resorts to force.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, driven by his
desire to control more of the world's oil reserves, and the
international response to this threat. The underlying goal of the
U.N. force, which included 500,000 American troops, was to ensure
continued and unfettered access to petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Oil permeates every aspect of our lives, so even minor price
increases have devastating impacts. The most difficult challenge
for planners, policymakers and alternative-energy advocates is the
transportation sector, which accounts for more than 60 percent of
U.S. oil demand.
</P>
<P>
   The massive infrastructure developed to support gasoline-powered
cars is particularly resistant to modifications. It precludes rapid
change to alternative transportation systems and makes America
highly vulnerable to a break in oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   During a war or embargo, moving quickly to mass transit or to
fuel-cell or battery-powered automobiles would be impossible. For
most countries, excluding only those few that will be the next
century's oil suppliers, the future portends growing indebtedness,
driven by increasingly expensive oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   New demand for oil will be filled largely by the Middle East,
meaning a transfer of more than $1 trillion over the next 15 years
to the unstable states of the Persian Gulf alone _ on top of the
$90 billion they received in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dependence on the Middle East entails the risk of a repeat of
the international crises of 1973, 1979 and 1990 _ or worse. This
growing reliance on Middle Eastern oil not only adds to that
region's disproportionate leverage but provides the resources with
which rogue nations support international terrorism and develop
weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missiles to carry
them.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi VX nerve gas and Iranian medium-range missiles show how
such regimes can convert oil revenues into extensive and
sophisticated armament programs.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists about world oil reserves, such as the Department of
Energy, are getting increasingly lonely. The International Energy
Agency now says that world production outside the Middle Eastern
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will peak in
1999 and world production overall will peak between 2010 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
   This projection is supported by influential recent articles in
Science and Scientific American. Some knowledgeable academic and
industry voices put the date that world production will peak even
sooner _ within the next five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists who project large reserve quantities of over one
trillion barrels tend to base their numbers on one of three things:
inclusion of heavy oil and tar sands, the exploitation of which
will entail huge economic and environmental costs; puffery by OPEC
nations lobbying for higher production quotas within the cartel; or
assumptions about new drilling technologies that may accelerate
production but are unlikely to expand reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Once production peaks, even though exhaustion of world reserves
will still be many years away, prices will begin to rise sharply.
This trend will be exacerbated by increased demand in the
developing world. Even assuming a substantial recession, increased
Asian needs alone will add enough demand by 2010 (9 million barrels
per day) to more than equal Saudi Arabia's current daily
production.
</P>
<P>
   The nations of the Middle East will be ready to exploit the
trend of rising demand and shrinking supply. The Gulf states
control nearly two-thirds of the world's reserves; the states
bordering the Caspian Sea have another several percent. Barring
some unforeseen discoveries, the Middle East will control something
approaching three-quarters of the world's oil in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
   Recent and prospective breakthroughs in genetic engineering and
processing are radically changing the viability of ethanol as a
transportation fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And if genetically engineered biocatalysts and advanced
processing technologies can make a transition from fossil fuels to
biofuels affordable, the world's security picture could be
different in many ways. It would be impossible to form a cartel
that would control the production, manufacturing, and marketing of
ethanol fuel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomacy and policies in the Middle East could be guided
more by a respect for democracy than by a need to protect oil
supplies and accommodate oil-producing regimes. Our intrusive
military presence in the region could be reduced, both ameliorating
anti-American tensions and making U.S. involvement in a Middle
Eastern war less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Other states would also reap benefits. Ukraine, rich in fertile
land, would be less likely to be dominated over time by oil-rich
Russia. China would feel less pressure to befriend Iran and Iraq or
build a big navy to secure the oil of the South China Sea. The
ability of oil-exporting countries to shape events would be
increasingly limited.
</P>
<P>
   The recent report by the President's Committee of Advisers on
Science and Technology (PCAST) predicted that U.S. oil imports will
approximately double between 1996 and 2030, from 8.5 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $64 billion, to nearly 16 million
barrels per day, at a cost of $120 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated, however, that with concentrated efforts in
fundamental energy research and investment in renewable fuel
technologies, this could be reduced to 6 million barrels per day in
2030.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``A plausible argument can be made that
the security of the United States is at least as likely to be
imperiled in the first half of the next century by the consequences
of inadequacies in the energy options available to the world as by
inadequacies in the capabilities of U.S. weapons systems.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is striking that the federal government spends about
20 times more money for research and development of new weapons
than energy options.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the United States is not funding a vigorous program
in renewable technologies. The Department of Energy spends under
two percent of its budget on renewable fuels; its overall work on
renewable technologies is at its lowest level in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because private investment often follows federal commitment,
industrial research and development has also reached new lows.
These disturbing trends occur at a time of national economic
prosperity when America has both time and resources for investing
in biofuels.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot afford to wait for the next energy
crisis to marshal its intellectual and industrial resources. Our
growing dependence on increasingly scarce Middle Eastern oil is a
fool's game _ there is no way for the rest of the world to win. Our
losses may come suddenly through war, steadily through price
increases, agonizingly through developing-nation poverty,
relentlessly through climate change _ or through all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   It would be extremely short-sighted not to take advantage of the
scientific breakthroughs that have occurred and that are in the
offing, accelerate them and move smartly toward ameliorating the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   If we do, we will make life far less dangerous and far more
prosperous for future generations. If we do not, those generations
will look back in angry wonder at the remarkable opportunity that
we missed.

PLAYING MIND GAMES WITH THE SENATE

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the U.S. Senate was gearing up for the presidential
impeachment trial, one of the senior members of the world's
greatest deliberative body put Bill Clinton on notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, do not tamper with this jury,'' warned Sen.
Robert Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is widely considered
the Senate's resident authority on constitutional issues. Byrd
wanted the president to know that no attempt to influence senators'
votes would be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton apparently got the message. If the president or his
minions have been lobbying the Senate in pursuit of an acquittal,
the public hasn't heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most blatant attempt to tamper with the impeachment
trial jury has been perpetrated by Clinton's archenemy, independent
counsel Ken Starr _ or by people who are close enough to Starr to
know what he's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that ``several associates'' of the
independent counsel had revealed Starr's opinion that he has the
constitutional authority to indict Clinton before his term
concludes in January 2001. Some experts on constitutional law
believe that a president cannot be prosecuted in the criminal
courts until after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you're wondering, what in the world does that have to do
with jury tampering in the Senate's impeachment trial?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. Most of the Washington pols and pundits are convinced
that the Senate cannot muster the two-thirds majority _ 67 votes,
if all 100 senators vote _ that is required to convict the
president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   By letting the senators know that he feels empowered to indict
the president, Starr is sending a message to the senatorial jury:
If you fail to remove Clinton from office, be prepared to see this
mess go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the senators and much of the public desperately want the
Clinton scandal/impeachment ordeal to end. Starr has now apprised
everyone that a not-guilty verdict in the Senate may ensure that it
does not end.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: Convict the president and toss him out of the
White House _ or else.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't jury tampering, what is?
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly been interesting to hear the anti-Clinton spin on
this curiously timed leak from ``associates'' of the independent
counsel. The pro-removal crowd is saying that the revelation of
Starr's views on presidential indictment somehow benefits Clinton
and therefore must be the result of White House manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, it's hard to imagine that Clinton's No. 1
legal adversary, Starr, would be communicating his strategic
ponderings to the White House. It's also hard to imagine how it is
beneficial to Clinton to tip off the Senate that an acquittal will
likely lead to two more years of political rancor and courtroom
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that letting Clinton off the hook on the
impeachment rap could guarantee continuation of the Bill-and-Monica
debacle might tempt the most devoted Clintonite in the Senate to
think about telling the president to turn in his keys.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's defenders would like us to believe that the independent
counsel is a great public servant who has simply done his part to
uphold the rule of law by leaving no stone unturned in trying to
bring a lawbreaking president to justice. His defenders are
entitled to their opinion _ and in the beginning, perhaps, their
opinion might even have been accurate. But no more.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Starr turned into Ahab chasing the whale known as
Slick Willie. At some other point, Starr realized that he was
unlikely to win a criminal conviction against Clinton and opted to
pass the ball to Congress by means of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If he couldn't convict Clinton of a crime, Starr figured, at
least he could drive him out of office in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   But even that plan seems doomed. So the senators have now been
informed that if they fail to do Starr's bidding by banishing
Clinton from power, the independent counsel will resume the chase.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not jury tampering, what is?

MINORITY GROUPS SUE OVER BERKELEY ADMISSIONS POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Five civil rights groups have filed a federal
lawsuit alleging that the undergraduate admissions process at the
University of California at Berkeley illegally discriminates
against minority students.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, said the process violates civil rights laws and has
unfairly denied entrance to more than 750 well-qualified black,
Filipino-American and Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was brought on behalf of minority freshman
students who, according to the lawsuit, were forced to attend other
colleges around the country because of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new admissions policies and practices have a totally
unjustified disparate impact on African-American, Latino and
(Filipino-) American applicants,'' said Joseph Jaramillo, a lawyer
with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, one
group representing the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Mena, a Berkeley spokesman, declined to comment on the
lawsuit, saying university lawyers had not yet reviewed it.
However, he said campus officials had been working with the civil
rights groups ``side by side to ensure there is minority access to
higher education,'' and called it unfortunate that they had chosen
to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The university began admitting freshmen under the new policy for
its fall 1998 class. The policy was prompted by a resolution passed
by the board of regents in 1995 that barred admissions officers
from considering an applicant's race, gender or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Regent Ward Connerly was author of the resolution and is a key
force in fighting affirmative action, which he contends is a kind
of reverse discrimination. Connerly also headed the successful
campaign in 1996 to pass Proposition 209, the California ballot
inititiave that banned affirmative action throughout state and
local government.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, who is black, said he had not seen the lawsuit but
defended Berkeley's admissions policy as fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't think that the university is engaged in
discrimination towards anyone or any group, because we apply the
same standards to everybody,'' he said. ``With preferences being
outlawed now, more than ever we're applying the same standards to
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that minority students simply needed better grades
to get into the prestigious school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they need to do a little more heavy lifting academically
to me more competitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Paterson, the executive director of the the Lawyers'
Committee for Civil Rights, which helped bring the lawsuit,
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, affirmative action policies attempted to
compensate for some of the unfair components of the admissions
process,'' she said. ``In the absence of affirmative action, we are
simply left with a discriminatory system.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, in the fall of 1998, more than 750
minority applicants with grade point averages of 4.0 or better were
denied admission to the Berkeley campus. (Students who take
advanced placement courses may earn extra points and achieve a
maximum 5.0 grade point average.)
</P>
<P>
   While white students with 4.0 GPAs or better had a 48.2 percent
chance of admission, the lawsuit said, similarly qualified minority
students had less opportunity: Hispanic students had a 39.7 percent
chance; black students, a 38.5 percent chance; and
Filipino-American students, a 31.6 percent chance.

   A fireplace, a room with a view and a world-class ski resort.
What better place for a couple to spend the Valentine's Day

   Here are some of the best. All packages are double occupancy and
based on February rates.
</P>

   _ The Inn at Lost Creek (119 Lost Creek La., Telluride, Colo.
81435; 888-601-5678) is Telluride's newest luxury hotel. Located in
Mountain Village, the 32-room slopeside inn is made of native stone
and weathered timber. Fireplaces, overstuffed chairs, marble
bathrooms with steam showers and Jacuzzi, kitchenettes and mountain
views give each room a distinct character.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's two newly opened restaurants, ``9545'' and the more
casual ``10 Below,'' are part of Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant
Group, which includes such restaurants as New York's Nobu and
Tribeca Grill. Rates begin at $385 per night.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Lake Tahoe region, the Resort at Squaw Creek (400 Squaw
Creek Rd., Olympic Valley, Calif. 96146; 800-327-3353) is an
imposing glass building artfully tucked into the woods. Inside are
surprisingly warm rooms with a nouvelle Arts &AMP; Crafts feel. There

</P>
<P>

<P>
   In Buenos Aires the elegant neighborhood of Recoleta is the
fashionable place to stay, to while away hours in cafes and
museums, to walk the poodles in the park. And when it's all over,
it's the place to end up.
</P>
<P>
   Across the grassy way from the outdoor cafes, a great white
portal marks the most exclusive address of all: Cementerio de la
Recoleta, Recoleta Cemetery, burial place of Argentina's elite.
Here patricians and presidents, heroes and heroines, rest in
astonishing grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Mausoleums built side by side resemble Greek temples, Gothic
chapels, Egyptian pyramids, fairytale grottoes, postmodern
boutiques _ or just elegant little houses. They have marble steps,
wrought-iron doors, appointed interiors. There are marble Saviours
and Madonnas and sculptures of the departed and their pets.
</P>
<P>
   The city skyline gives way to palm trees and cypresses, crosses
and steeples, busts and domes, great stone angels reaching to
heaven. The mausoleums can cost the earth. And the earth they are
on, occupied by generations of the high-born departed, is the
scarcest _ and costliest _ land in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Recoleta Cemetery is one of the world's extraordinary
graveyards, a study in architecture and sculpture, a country's
history, mores and soul. A number of tombs are national historic
monuments. It is a place of spiritual beauty and extravagant taste.
And thanks to Madonna and Broadway, it is hotter than ever as a
tourist attraction. Travelers stream through the portal, cameras in
hand, and ask the custodians the way to ``Evita.'' Some even ask
for ``Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   Evita's tomb says ``Familia Duarte,'' her maiden name, and _
with a simple black facade on a narrow side street _ is nothing
special by Recoleta standards. The masses of flowers, however, the
crowds of visitors and the fact that she is there in the first
place _ surrounded by the rich she despised and who despised her _
are ironic.
</P>
<P>
   In this enclave of wealth, with tomb inscriptions from national
banks and the elite Jockey Club, the plaques to Evita are from the
Buenos Aires Taxi Drivers Union or the General Confederation of
Labor, an umbrella organization of unions. The inscription in
Spanish on the latter plaque ends with her battle cry, first used
by Spartacus in leading a slave revolt against the Romans:
</P>
<P>
   `` ... I keep the hope for glory,
</P>
<P>
   I wish only to serve
</P>
<P>
   The humble and the workers''
</P>
<P>
   I will come back and I will be millions ... !
</P>
<P>
   On a given Monday there are three huge floral arrangements at
her tomb. Carnations, roses and fuchsia are stuck in the door
wherever there's space. Fourteen people are crowded three deep,
most of them tourists, posing for photos in front of the plaques,
discussing why they are there.
</P>
<P>
   A curator from Bilbao: ``I visit cemeteries. In Paris I go to
see Oscar Wilde. Here I came to see Domingo Sarmiento, one of the
fathers of the country, and Eva Peron, who worked for the poorest
of the country. She was a myth who overshadowed Peron.''
</P>
<P>
   A tourist from Dallas: ``I saw the musical five times in Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   A British Airways flight attendant: ``Argentina's not Argentina
without Eva Peron, is it? And I thought Madonna, the actress who
portrayed her, should have won an award from the Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, on a quiet weekday morning, away from the fray, an old
woman with no teeth and holes in her shoes stops at the tomb,
touches Evita's face on a plaque, deposits a bunch of daisies and
prays.
</P>
<P>
   Evita aside, the main attractions of Recoleta are the
architecture, the grandiose aura, the sense of rubbing shoulders
with Argentine history. The cemetery, inaugurated in 1822 and
redesigned in 1881, encompasses 13.5 acres. The departed include
Argentine presidents and vice presidents, governors, generals,
admirals, industrialists, publishers, judges, doctors, professors,
writers, poets, scientists _ and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them _ Alvear, Dorrego, Pueyrredon _ are familiar from
the Buenos Aires streets and plazas that bear their names. Others,
such as Jose Estrada, are known from the Literature of Argentina
shelves in bookshops. Still others, such as Dufour, Barchiesi,
O'Shea, Zoltowska or Breitman, reflect the many facets of Argentine
society.
</P>
<P>
   The labyrinthine necropolis is laid out like a town. There is no
map and only one sign _ to Mausoleo Sarmiento, a soaring obelisk
crowned with a condor. It commemorates Argentine hero Domingo
Faustino Sarmiento, president, writer and educator, who died Sept.
11, 1888.
</P>
<P>
   A tour, given infrequently, stops at other notable tombs. But
the best plan is to wander around, most effectively on a winter day
with a drizzle. The predominant color is gray.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance is post-colonial in style with four columns, a
peristyle and tall wrought-iron gates. Just inside is the main
avenue, an address of choice lined with cypress trees, stone
benches and some 50 showpiece mausoleums. A towering bronze statue
of El Redentor, The Redeemer, is in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Along the avenue visitors admire the white marble beauty of Luz
Maria Garcia Velloso in a softly draped dress, lying asleep among
sculptured roses on a white marble sarcophagus. A bronze ship atop
a green column celebrates Adm. Guillermo Brown, who gave ``days of
glory and triumph in the year 1814.'' His neighbor, Gen. Tomas
Guido, is buried in a little stone grotto.
</P>
<P>
   To turn left at The Redeemer, or right for that matter, is to
gradually absorb the life of the cemetery. The earliest graves _
one or two predating 1822 _ are simple, unadorned sepulchers, some
with a cross. After 1822 there are changing architectural styles.
Nineteenth-century neoclassical tombs favor angels and urns, Doric,
Ionic and Corinthian columns.
</P>
<P>
   The fin-de-siecle and early 20th-century porteno taste for
things European extended from the streets of the city to the plots
of the cemetery. Materials and architects were imported from Europe
to create increasingly sumptuous monuments.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920 Herlitzka tomb, for example, features Murano glass,
gold leaf and an altar of Italian marble. There were crazes for Art
Nouveau, Art Deco, the neo-Gothic.
</P>
<P>
   Personal tastes and predilections were also expressed. The 1903
Rufina Cambaceres tomb features giant sculptured Art Nouveau
orchids and a soulful statue of the young woman. The Herrera-Noble
mausoleum, a brown tinted-glass block, is a study in modern design.
The tomb of Adolfo Casal has a stone coffin on top of its roof.
</P>
<P>
   The family pantheon of Dorrego-Ortiz Basualdo (1849-1920) is
possibly the graveyard's most priceless structure. Rich in stained
glass, Italian sculpture and symbolism, it features a virgin
lighting a tall seven-branched candelabrum, symbol of spiritual
light and salvation.
</P>
<P>
   A dolorosa by the Milanese sculptor Antonio Tantardini, whose
work is also in the Buenos Aires Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes,
adorns the tomb of Juan Facundo Quiroga (1788-1835), the
assassinated gaucho caudillo or war chief known as the Tiger of the
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   And the words of a heartbroken father, engraved on the tomb of
his daughter, speak of the sadness of untimely death. Beneath a
green bronze statue of Liliana Crociati de Szaszak (1944-1970), her
hand on the head of her dog Sabu, there is a poem in Italian. It
begins:
</P>
<P>
   To My Daughter
</P>
<P>
   Alone I ask myself, why
</P>
<P>
   You are gone and my heart
</P>
<P>
   Which only wanted you
</P>
<P>
   Is destroyed, why?
</P>
<P>
   Why? Only destiny knows,
</P>
<P>
   Why, I ask myself, why?
</P>
<P>
   It is signed ``Your papa.''
</P>
<P>
   In every graveyard there is a story behind every grave. In
Recoleta the stories are those of a nation, and there are some good
ones. In 1828 Gen. Juan Lavalle ordered the execution of Gen.
Manuel Dorrego, now his neighbor in death.
</P>
<P>
   In the biography of Juan Facundo Quiroga by Sarmiento,
``Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism,'' the author portrayed
Quiroga as a barbarian. Now they, too, are posthumous neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The most astonishing story is the attempted Aramburu-Evita
cadaver exchange. When Eva Peron died, at age 33 in 1952, her body
was embalmed and kept in the General Confederation of Labor
headquarters. Gen. Pedro E. Aramburu, a political enemy of the
Perons who was de facto president of the junta that ruled
Argentina, ordered the kidnapping of her corpse, which was sent in
secret to a cemetery in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Montoneros, a guerrilla group of Peronist loyalists,
abducted and executed Aramburu, then kept his remains as ransom for
the return of ``Companera'' Evita's. The police recovered
Aramburu's body. But when Evita's body didn't show up, the
Montoneros later robbed Aramburu's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Evita's mummy was eventually sent to Juan Peron in exile in
Madrid and later returned to Buenos Aires, restored, and nearly 25
years after her death, in 1976, buried a few blocks from Aramburu.
Juan Peron is buried in Cementerio de la Chacarita, a more populist
cemetery in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Recoleta is not only a story of past power and glory. It is
a place that is part of Buenos Aires everyday life. Cemetery
custodians polish marble, cradle cats, chat on tomb steps and may
open tomb doors for travelers who want to see an interior. (A tip
is always welcome, but not mandatory.)
</P>
<P>
   Many tombs are lovingly personal, with interiors _ visible
through windows or doors _ adorned with symbolic objects and
mementoes: exquisite lace cloths over a coffin, a cross encrusted
with gems. Behind one wrought-iron door there is a broken chair of
carved wood and cane. Inside another there is a black-and-white
photograph of a beautiful woman in a white feather boa.
</P>
<P>
   Family, friends, admirers, patriots, visit faithfully. There's
usually someone around, and the cemetery is especially busy on
weekends. Visitors replenish flowers in vases, polish silver
handles on coffins, leave messages, sit and reflect.
</P>
<P>
   On a winter Sunday, a woman with short gray hair wearing
sunglasses and a mink coat sits, hands clasped, before the opened
door of a doctor's tomb. A very old man with white hair, in a
waterproof jacket and brown woolen scarf, trudges slowly through
the streets with a bunch of white carnations and violets. He stops
at a white marble tomb, unwraps the flowers, arranges them one by
one on the tomb, folds the paper and crosses himself.
</P>
<P>
   And there are funerals _ often near-state occasions _ when a
tomb is opened to reveal subterranean steps and layers of coffins.
Twelve years ago during a first, uninitiated, visit to Recoleta, I
saw a procession of people filing in. Thinking it was a tour, I had
the idea of joining in until it became clear that it was a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the newspaper reported: ``The remains of
58-year-old Radical Party leader Jorge Roulet, who died from a
heart attack on Friday while at his country residence at Villa
Elisa, were interred yesterday at the Recoleta cemetery ... ''
</P>
<P>
   There was a front-page photograph of President Raul Alfonsin
conveying condolences to the widow, Elba Barreiro Roulet, the vice
governor of the province of Buenos Aires. I had a sense of having
come close to the Recoleta elite.
</P>
<P>
   Recoleta Cemetery, on the Calle Junin across from the Plaza del
Pilar, is open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Guided free tours are on the last Sunday of each month, from
March to November only; groups meet at 2:30 p.m. at the peristyle.
</P>
<P>
   To find Eva Peron's tomb, turn left at the Riccheri tomb on the
main avenue, walk past the de Yturriaca tomb, turn right at the
Yturraspe tomb, walk three blocks and turn left; it's about halfway
down the block.

<P>
   In Buenos Aires the elegant neighborhood of Recoleta is the
fashionable place to stay, to while away hours in cafes and
museums, to walk the poodles in the park. And when it's all over,
it's the place to end up.
</P>
<P>
   Across the grassy way from the outdoor cafes, a great white
portal marks the most exclusive address of all: Cementerio de la
Recoleta, Recoleta Cemetery, burial place of Argentina's elite.
Here patricians and presidents, heroes and heroines, rest in
astonishing grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Mausoleums built side by side resemble Greek temples, Gothic
chapels, Egyptian pyramids, fairytale grottoes, postmodern
boutiques _ or just elegant little houses. They have marble steps,
wrought-iron doors, appointed interiors. There are marble Saviours
and Madonnas and sculptures of the departed and their pets.
</P>
<P>
   The city skyline gives way to palm trees and cypresses, crosses
and steeples, busts and domes, great stone angels reaching to
heaven. The mausoleums can cost the earth. And the earth they are
on, occupied by generations of the high-born departed, is the
scarcest _ and costliest _ land in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Recoleta Cemetery is one of the world's extraordinary
graveyards, a study in architecture and sculpture, a country's
history, mores and soul. A number of tombs are national historic

   In the early morning light the monzogranite rock outcrops in
Joshua Tree National Park look like enormous dollops of meringue
browning in the desert sunshine. I'm driving to Turtle Rock, in
late November, for the first day of a weekend rock-climbing course
for beginners, and with great anticipation I realize that by day's
end I will be climbing these seemingly smooth, soft-edged outcrops.
</P>
<P>
   In my imagination I have a natural affinity for rock climbing;
I'll ascend agile as a monkey but still take time to notice the
subtle colorations and the way wind and water have shaped the
granite. A two-day meditation on the nature of rock is the way I
see it.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Tree National Park, situated three hours east of Los
Angeles, encompasses parts of both the Mojave Desert, higher in
altitude, and the lower, hotter Colorado Desert. It is in the
Mojave section of the park that, over 100 million years ago, these
jumbled piles of bedrock cooled and hardened many miles beneath the
surface of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Millenniums of erosion by ground water weathered the granite,
often into fantastic shapes, while flash floods washed away the
protective ground surface to reveal them.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gerberding from the Joshua Tree Rock Climbing School is
our instructor. He's an easygoing man who's been climbing for 21
years and has done 84 ascents of El Capitan in Yosemite, a fact
that draws a stunned look of admiration from 19-year-old Jake, the
youngest in our group of four beginners. The rest of us, myself and
a couple from San Francisco, are in our mid '30s to early '40s.
</P>
<P>
   After fitting us with smooth rubber-soled climbing shoes, Steve
leads us to a boulder-strewn area where we will learn about balance
and practice footwork, all vital to building confidence for the
bigger climbs. No ropes, no pitons, just us and our shoes (Steve
tells us they're designed to ``stick'' to rock) moving across the
boulders like human flies. Initially I keep slipping, but after an
hour of working to keep my weight over my hips and keep my heels
down, I have moments when I feel as though I have suction cups on
my feet.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the morning we learn how to tie into our
climbing harnesses and how to use the climber's safety system
called belaying.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of us climb, we will tie onto a long rope that loops
up through the top anchor point and then back down. Tied onto the
other end of the rope is our belayer, who is attached to a ground
anchor, a rock or a tree, and who will gather in the rope's slack
as we ascend. If we lose our footing our belayer will be able to
hold the rope taut with relative ease, thus braking the fall. The
belayer will also lower us down the rock for the descent.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch Steve leads us to a lumpy outcrop of rock where a
brightly colored rope disappears over a ledge 30 feet above. I
nervously tie in first and begin to climb. The shoes are sticking
great and I move cautiously over the bumps and curves in the gray
granite. It's like climbing a colossal sleeping elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Forty feet up I hoist myself over another large ledge and,
feeling as though I've conquered Everest, I touch the anchor point.
Then comes the moment of faith. I call for tension, and once my
belayer has taken in all the slack, I lean back, giving my weight
to the rope. As my belayer feeds the rope back out I walk backward
down the rock face.
</P>
<P>
   Rock climbing is a breeze, I think, until the next climb up a
gritty, gnarled section of rock. We're learning a technique called
lay backing, a way of taking advantage of any long vertical cracks
in the rock. In essence you grip one side of the crack and pull
with your hands while pushing with your feet, creating a tension
that enables you to seemingly defy gravity and ascend sideways up
the crack.
</P>
<P>
   When I attempt it I realize how little upper-body strength I
have. The granite is rough and whenever I jam my hand into the
crack, I feel as though I'm being bitten by the rock. Cheered on by
my fellow climbers, I finally claw my way to the top, where I
manage to somehow wedge my legs into the fissure to prevent myself
from falling.
</P>
<P>
   I'm bone weary when, at day's end, I drive back to my motel in
the nearby town of Twentynine Palms. There's an eerie twilight
beauty to the landscape; the pale sand glowing, the granite
outcrops like pieces of the moon fallen to earth. After Day 1 of
Basic Rock the only thing I've learned about the nature of rock is
that it is hard _ rock hard.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible I have no affinity for rock climbing, I
think while driving back into the park early on Sunday morning.
Then the beauty of those bizarre granite outcrops distracts me from
my nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Today they look fleshy, thickly contoured like the massive
bodies in Lucien Freud paintings. We're climbing in beautiful Echo
Cove, and Steve sets up four routes: two hard ones for Jake and two
easier ones that are confidence builders for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty feet up the easiest route, I decide that the words ``rock
climbing'' do not adequately describe the activity I've been
engaged in since late the previous afternoon. Rock scaling and
clutching and grasping, rock balancing and wrestling and groping
seem more appropriate. Now, panting more from stress than fatigue,
I'm on the verge of rock surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest up,'' Steve shouts. ``Enjoy the view.'' With wobbly legs
I perch on a small ledge. The sandy floor of Echo Cove is dotted
with Joshua trees. Legend has it that these trees, which are
members of the Yucca family and only grow above 3,000 feet in
altitude, were named by the Mormons when they crossed the Mojave
Desert in the 1850s, the outstretched branches reminding them of
the prophet Joshua who would guide them westward.
</P>
<P>
   Sufficiently calmed, I get back to the business at hand. This is
a friction climb, meaning there are no obvious hand or foot holds _
rather, I'm searching the rock face for ``smearable surfaces,''
shallow depressions in which to place my feet. With small,
concentrated moves I cover 20 more feet. But now the angle of the
rock face is growing steeper, it feels like it's almost 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Rock paralysis kicks in. Surely if I move another inch I will
fall; in fact I start to wonder how I'm even managing to stay put.
Fear mounts and I break the cardinal rule of friction climbing. I
lean in and try to cling to the smooth expanse of rock, shifting
all my weight off my heels. Sure enough I fall _ all of 12 inches.
My belayer has me on a short rope and I dangle for a moment,
searching for the next smearable surface. Which I eventually find,
and, trusting my feet, I make it to the top. Another Everest
conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you like rock climbing so much?'' I ask Steve when I'm
back on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' he replies, a slightly incredulous look on his
face, as if he can't fathom why I would ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean by `fun'?'' I demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puzzle solving,'' he says, explaining how creative and
satisfying it is to find the sometimes elusive path up a rock face.
</P>
<P>
   Gently he coaxes me onto the next route, another friction climb.
It is steeper and more challenging than the first and yet I ascend
with more confidence. I'm starting to see a pattern _ each climb
has had moments of panic and doubt, followed by a huge sense of
accomplishment when I reach the top.
</P>
<P>
   But fun? I'm still not convinced until the climb before lunch.
Mark from San Francisco goes up first and returns with a big smile
on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrific,'' he says. ``Great hand and foot holds.'' But I
don't know whether to believe a man who has almost scraped his
fingertips raw. I make it 15 feet up the craggy 50-foot route
before my puzzle-solving skills vanish. I have no idea where to
move.
</P>
<P>
   Steve shouts that there's a good foot hold about four feet to my
left and I reach for a carbuncle of rock no larger than a new
potato. I climb on and in an odd way I begin to feel like I'm doing
a dance on this granite outcrop. It's an utterly graceless affair
on my part; sometimes I stretch like a starfish, other times I
dangle from narrow ledges. I wrap my body around rock and use every
bump and crevice to help me reach the top.
</P>
<P>
   During my descent I pay attention to the curves and contours and
coloration of the granite I've been so intimate with. A dark
reddish smear catches my eye, and I look closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bloodstain up here,'' I yell. It must be mine I
think, taking a quick look at my bloodied knuckles. I, too, have
left my mark on this rock. It's a mad, giddy moment of triumph and
I'm laughing wildly. Don't ask me why, but suddenly rock climbing
feels like fun.

   In the early morning light the monzogranite rock outcrops in
Joshua Tree National Park look like enormous dollops of meringue
browning in the desert sunshine. I'm driving to Turtle Rock, in
late November, for the first day of a weekend rock-climbing course
for beginners, and with great anticipation I realize that by day's
end I will be climbing these seemingly smooth, soft-edged outcrops.
</P>
<P>
   In my imagination I have a natural affinity for rock climbing;
I'll ascend agile as a monkey but still take time to notice the
subtle colorations and the way wind and water have shaped the
granite. A two-day meditation on the nature of rock is the way I
see it.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Tree National Park, situated three hours east of Los
Angeles, encompasses parts of both the Mojave Desert, higher in
altitude, and the lower, hotter Colorado Desert. It is in the
Mojave section of the park that, over 100 million years ago, these
jumbled piles of bedrock cooled and hardened many miles beneath the
surface of the earth.

`CUPID' NEEDS AN ANGEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC lied. That shouldn't be a surprise to any veteran television
viewer. But the network really redefined the art when it canceled
``Cupid.''
</P>
<P>
   First, ABC said that it liked the show quite a bit and was
moving forward. Yes, the less-than-ringing endorsement from
entertainment president Jamie Tarses and entertainment chairman Stu
Bloomberg should have set off bells, but then there was the matter
of the ABC slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, great. ``Cupid'' was a highly acclaimed romantic comedy
and there aren't many of those around. Everything about the show
reeked of success _ except the ratings. ``Cupid'' just had that
feel, that look, that sense that it could not only be a hit but,
more importantly, be one of the few really good shows on network
television. Now that doesn't always guarantee a Top 20 finish in
the Nielsens, but if your motto is ``We Love TV,'' then ``Cupid''
is a show you keep.
</P>
<P>
   What ABC really should have said was, ``We Love Ratings.''
Because, like many modern networks, it didn't have a clue how to
take a great show and make it work. In the TV business, where bland
is the norm, when you get something of quality, it's first and
foremost a shock, then a gift. What are you going to do with it?
ABC decided to put it on Saturday nights at 10.
</P>
<P>
   That makes a lot of sense. A romantic comedy for lovers or
would-be lovers on a night when most of the target audience is out
trying to live the premise of the show. Brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that ABC was the same network that put David Kelley's
``The Practice'' on Saturday nights as well, which led to Mr. Can't
Miss TV telling critics he thought the move was dumb _ which
everybody but ABC knew anyway. Finally, Tarses and company tripped
or something, hit their collective heads and moved ``The Practice''
to a better time slot and not long after it got an Emmy for best
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Building on its luck _ and forced to create new shows because
everything else it had was miserable _ ABC developed a fairly
impressive schedule for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Along with ``Sports Night,'' ``The Hughleys,'' ``Whose Line Is
It Anyway?'' and some fluff on Fridays, ``Cupid'' gave the network
a lot of options. Despite critical acclaim and an Emmy-deserving
performance from Jeremy Piven, ratings for the show on Saturday
were in the tank. The network moved it to Thursdays and put it up
against ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, not exactly brilliant. It seems that ABC, suddenly flush
with some decent shows, has become cocky, like one of its best
shows can just be shunted away or given up for dead because the
scheduling pooh-bahs couldn't find a place for it. That's pretty
bold for a third-place network.
</P>
<P>
   ABC couldn't find a place for ``Cupid,'' but it has no trouble
giving up hour slots to the news division for more ``20/20''
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ABC's second idea of moving it to Thursday because of
a perceived weakening at NBC wasn't too far-fetched. But if you
want to topple the giant, then it takes patience and programming.
Surely ABC has more good shows in the works and with a couple of
quality new shows in the fall _ Kelley's upcoming ``Snoops'' might
be one _ there could be a takeover. But it won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ABC fumbled. And here's what it said about the cancellation:
```Cupid' has been a labor of love for everyone at ABC from the
very start. The writing was phenomenal, the production first-rate,
and the tremendous talent of its stars, Jeremy Piven and Paula
Marshall, really gave the show life. Unfortunately, despite
everyone's efforts, the audience just didn't respond.''
</P>
<P>
   What a complete cop-out. And if you're going to rave so
effusively about a show, you look stupid doing it at the funeral.
If ABC really believed in ``Cupid,'' really believed in its own
``We Love TV'' slogan, it would save the show. It would admit the
patently obvious scheduling blunders of its programmers and
restart.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Somebody ought to save ``Cupid.'' No network _ including ABC _
has so many good shows that it doesn't need a little more depth.
Unfortunately, lack of patience, lack of vision and the continued
pervasiveness of ``newsmagazines'' all diminish the possibility of
saving ``Cupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the show are understandably outraged. They're seeing red
_ not ABC's ubiquitous yellow. They feel cheated and upset. And
they have a right to. But TV burns everyone at some point, because
it's a numbers game and emotions get tossed in the cruncher when
the numbers don't add up. Quality doesn't always _ in fact very
rarely _ equal ratings success.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no mistaking this: ``Cupid'' didn't die because
``the audience didn't respond,'' as ABC says. It's dead because ABC
let it happen.

IN HONG KONG, HARVARD ALUMS LAMENT A BREACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In the clubby world of Hong Kong power brokers,
where money and contacts are everything and a Harvard pedigree has
more cachet than in Cambridge, Mass., Stephen Wai-wan Chik was not
just any Harvard graduate. He was the president of the Harvard
Alumni Club.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of the dynamic young financier, the club
began to attract big money for the university from a distant locale
brimming with rich and influential graduates. But something went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Chik, a 1986 economics graduate whom former friends describe as
an ambitious comer from a modest background, allegedly abused his
position as club president by siphoning half a million dollars into
his own accounts, according to a newly released club investigation
report and an independent audit.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday (Feb. 4), a year after Harvard informed club officers
that a donation of $333,333 had never reached Cambridge and that
Chik was ignoring phone calls, members of the 300-person club will
vote whether to sue him, pursue criminal charges, or do nothing.
Chik has returned almost 80 percent of the missing funds.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has rocked the Hong Kong club, sparking accusations
that an old-boy network shielded Chik during a prolonged and
secretive investigation, and that lax oversight and cozy ties among
club leaders allowed the transgression to occur. The disgrace also
comes at an inopportune time for Harvard, just as its business
school is establishing a center here and as the university is
expanding its programs and fund-raising efforts in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the sad tale of one promising man's fall from grace are
the larger questions of how clubs based on trust can police
themselves, and how Harvard can oversee far-flung groups or stop
alumni from misusing benefits and donations that a prestige college
attracts.
</P>
<P>
   The club ``had become very much an organization that (Chik)
operated for his own advantage. At the same time, it became larger
and more effective under Steve's leadership,'' said Robert Neer, a
1986 history graduate who headed the committee that traced missing
money. ``But people have many reasons for belonging to alumni
clubs, and not all of them are altruistic.''
</P>
<P>
   For a university that doggedly raises more money than any other
in the world, the scandal damages credibilty in a rare place in
recession-hit Asia where alumni still have cash to give. Harvard is
by far the most famous and respected university in China, and
locals worry that a drop in donations _ to some extent the unspoken
quid pro quo for Harvard's expansion here _ could knock Hong Kong
and China off Harvard's priority list.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni and university officials play down that fear, saying that
one person cannot destroy Harvard's reputation. But they caution
that Hong Kong's club, like Harvard's 160 alumni clubs worldwide,
needs to install checks and balances and avoid the perception that
it coddles members who have done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   All clubs should probably consider new standards, said John P.
Reardon Jr., executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association.
The richest clubs, in New York and Boston, have audits and business
managers. But ``you can set up a lot of structures, and what if
people set out to be dishonest?''
</P>
<P>
   Reardon said he knows of no similar incidents in other clubs,
but he added that most clubs ``are not in a situation where they
have much money anyone could walk away with. . . . Hong Kong's club
_ in Steve Chik times _ had started to bring in real money.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether to sue Chik for $107,810 of
still-missing funds is also linked to concern about his ability to
pay up. Chik's company, Pacific Asia Group, is facing liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts to reach Chik were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Some alumni complain that club officers fast learned that Chik
had taken sole control of bank accounts and removed money, but the
investigation dragged on and meeting minutes were kept secret.
Officers say they were treating Chik as innocent until proven
guilty and needed to collect facts. They also wanted to save the
university and club from bad publicity or a defamation suit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a delicate matter _ whether to go after a fellow alumnus.
Besides Chik had wowed people with his energy and he had formed
friendships with Hong Kong's movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang and Home Affairs
Secretary Shelley Lau, both Kennedy School of Government alumni,
were godparents for Chik and his fiancee at their joint baptism,
though Lau says she is godmother to a lot of people. Futures
Exchange Commission chief Geoffrey Yeh, a member of an alumni
committee that advised on the Chik affair, spoke at Chik's
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Tan, a Graduate School of Design alumnus who was elected
president after Chik was deposed, was a junior college classmate of
Chik's in Singapore and best man at his wedding. Tan says they
``were never close,'' and he denies any conflict in his presiding
over the club while Chik was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Former treasurer Yun Ed Wong, a 1989 graduate with a doctorate
in geophysics, was an employee of Chik's when Chik asked him to
cosign a blank transfer note from club accounts. Wong says he
``trusted him too much. But it was a club, and I thought we were
supposed to trust each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of mainland Chinese parents, Chik is described by other
alumni as well-dressed, personable, and well-spoken, ``the jewel of
his family,'' and a man ``with executive polish.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina Fang, a 1988 graduate who was briefly club secretary
last year, complains that ``people who have been friends with Steve
for years'' are partly responsible for not checking bank statements
and for letting him hold the only key to the postal box. ``Everyone
is too concerned about protecting everyone else instead of being
concerned with the members' right to know,'' Fang said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers insist they were not protecting Chik, but rather were
trying to recover as much money as possible through the influence
of senior alumni with whom Chik considered himself close, such as
Trade Development Council chairman Victor Fung.
</P>
<P>
   Roderick MacFarqhuar, a government professor who knew Chik as
the energetic student president of the Hong Kong Club at Harvard,
acknowledges Chik may have later capitalized on Harvard's name in a
place where ``guanxi'' _ Chinese for ``connections'' _ is king. But
``the old-boy network and `guanxi' are hardly the invention of the
Harvard Club of Hong Kong,'' MacFarquhar said.
</P>
<P>
   Neer contends that the Asian ``recession will probably hurt Hong
Kong's fund-raising efforts here more than Steve Chik's
activities,'' adding that the upside is that it ``energized people
to get things done and make sure it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Popular as Chik once was, only one of the many alumni
interviewed said he still considers himself Chik's friend. ``I
would not give up on him,'' said Reuben Mondejar, a 1988 graduate
who specialized in international studies and who was club vice
president under Chik.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man has a lot of raw talent,'' Mondejar said. ``I think he
can be resurrected. But I think it would be very difficult for him
to be resurrected here in Hong Kong. Everyone knows him already. He
was very visible.''

DOLE'S RED CROSS DUTY ELICITS PRAISE, CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every year, Dr. Edward Scott struggles to collect
enough blood to serve the patients and hospitals around Memphis. He
never finds enough. The nonprofit blood bank he leads, which
provides better than 99 percent of the local supply, is always
forced to buy blood from other regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
   So Scott and other officials at Lifeblood/Mid-South Regional
Blood Center were surprised three years ago when a big new
competitor won the exclusive right to draw blood at the city's
largest employer _ Federal Express Corp. _ and began shipping most
of the blood out of town.
</P>
<P>
   That fearsome rival was also the nation's most beloved charity,
the American Red Cross, led by the popular Elizabeth Hanford Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Dole considers whether to run for president of the
United States, she is using the apple-pie image of the
disaster-relief agency, and her record as its top manager, to boost
her political fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But while soothing victims of disasters, critics say, the Red
Cross under Dole tarnished its own charitable tradition by starting
a business war in what is actually its largest activity: blood
banking. Critics say Dole was a leading agent in turning blood from
a social service into a fiercely competitive business, to the
possible detriment of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's activity in the blood industry, as well as her management
of other Red Cross services, would become central if she sought the
Republican nomination for president. At 62, she has never held
elective office and would be likely to highlight the leadership
skills she displayed at the giant charity and as US transportation
secretary under President Reagan and labor secretary under
President Bush. Her seven-year tenure at the Red Cross ended on
Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not an area of the Red Cross that Elizabeth Dole
didn't improve _ disaster services, biomedical services,
fund-raising,'' said John William Thomas, former senior vice
president for fund-raising at the Red Cross. ``The strength of this
woman is her ability to identify core problems and then figure out
how to solve them, and to lend the weight of her office to
intervene to make sure it's successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Several critics, however, say Dole brought a political tenor to
the charity and to its business activities, hiring consultants who
also worked for the 1996 presidential campaign of her husband,
former senator Bob Dole. The Red Cross also took millions of
dollars in donations from companies that were simultaneously giving
to the former Republican senator or seeking his aid in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express, for example, gave money to Bob Dole's 1996
campaign at about the same time it granted the Red Cross exclusive
rights to draw blood from employees at its Memphis headquarters for
one year. The company says the two events were unrelated, but the
independent blood center in Memphis still complains about Red Cross
access to Federal Express workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous blood need here locally that we are
struggling to meet, and the Red Cross is taking blood from here
that benefits their national organization, but not our local
community,'' said Scott, the Lifeblood chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Dole declined requests for an interview, but her aides rejected
Scott's charge, saying the changes in the Red Cross blood business
have resulted in more blood being collected and improved health
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 31,000 employees, 1.3 million volunteers and an annual
budget of $2.2 billion, the Red Cross is almost large enough to
join the list of Fortune 500 companies. Each year, it offers
housing and food to victims of 60,000 disasters. It teaches 12
million people lifesaving and safety skills. It delivers 1.4
million emergency messages between US military personnel and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   But more than half of the agency's costs and revenues come from
collecting and distributing blood. And when Dole arrived in 1991,
the Red Cross blood operations faced serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the blood supply has been managed as a series of
regional monopolies. Boston, for example, is a Red Cross city. In
New York, Kansas City, and many other places, blood is collected
and sold by small, independent agencies, most of them nonprofits.
The Red Cross supervises about half of the blood supply, and
independents control almost all of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement started to come under pressure in the 1980s, as
AIDS and hepatitis forced blood banks to run expensive tests to
make sure blood was safe. At the same time, blood agencies were
squeezed by hospitals that wanted to cut costs and pay lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross had an additional challenge: poor management.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, the Red Cross released blood that had not been
properly tested, alarming Congress and the Food and Drug
Administration. By 1993, two years after Dole's arrival, the FDA
became so worried that it went to court and forced the Red Cross to
sign a consent decree that mandates closer federal supervision of
its blood banks.
</P>
<P>
   Improving blood operations became one of Dole's top priorities.
Today, many people say she succeeded. The Red Cross has spent $287
million to consolidate a hodge-podge of computer systems into one,
and to streamline 53 blood-testing centers into eight. It is better
able to track blood from donor to testing lab to patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give Elizabeth Dole very high marks for improving the
blood operations,'' said Representative John Dingell, a Michigan
Democrat who held hearings on the Red Cross blood problems in the
early 1990s. The Red Cross says it recently fulfilled the last
requirements of the consent decree and expects to be free of it
soon.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole also created a large group of critics among the
independent blood centers. To recoup the millions it spent on
improvements, they say, the Red Cross has begun ``poaching''
hospital customers and blood donors from the independent blood
centers _ donors at places like Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, patients from across the state often find themselves
at the large cluster of hospitals in Indianapolis, which is served
by an independent blood bank. When patients came from around Fort
Wayne or Louisville, Ky., the Red Cross blood centers in those
areas used to send blood to Indianapolis to make sure the hospitals
had enough.

TOO MANY BLACK ATHLETES LACK A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spiked dog collar Ray Buchanan wore around his neck early
last week before the Super Bowl was meant as a cartoon joke to
symbolize the underdog status of his Atlanta Falcons against the
Denver Broncos. In the overdog's camp, Shannon Sharpe boasted that
he so thoroughly destroyed opposing teams that ``I've got a guy
suspended. I got a guy cut. One coach resigned. Another thought
about resigning. I'm pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the barking, up to the level of hiring and firing in the
National Football League, there is one subject that makes the fangs
of these and a host of African-American players drop from their
gums and clatter to the ground in a useless heap: The failure to
hire black head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   New York Times columnist Bill Rhoden brought this up at the big
game. The NFL has had 24 straight head coaching changes with no new
African-American faces. The NFL is 72 percent African-American in
players, but 90 percent white in head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   That question reduced these warriors who risk ruptured disks
into snivels and spineless sweats. Buchanan said, ``I don't want to
talk about that right now. It's too controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the players don't want to upset the coaches or the
owners because they are playing for them,'' said Ray Crockett of
the Broncos. ``If we put ourselves out there, our names on the
line, and there's still a bunch of white coaches out there, of
course you're intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to keep our comments to a minimum because _ not that
we're scared _ there's nothing we can do,'' said Cornelius Bennett
of the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the dog collar is no longer a joke. The spikes take
on the weight of the iron that bound the necks of Buchanan's
ancestors. The fear strips them naked of their championships and
their millions of dollars. As incongruous is the thought of a
millionaire slave, they are here before us, so powerful, so
flamboyant, so rich, yet so docile, so scared and so easily prone
to ``yessum, boss'' as to make one wretch.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no lack of African-American coaches if the
players threatened to walk off the field. No other group of
African-Americans is in such a position to strike for fairness.
African-American athletes in team sports earn at least $2 billion a
year, revenues that would place them near the Fortune 500. Yet,
they are a collective shame.
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of people of color with no clout risk their life
savings suing for job discrimination, black athletes so fear
offending white fans that Michael Jordan would not campaign openly
for Harvey Gantt against one of the most racist of US senators,
Jesse Helms. Jordan, also a sellout on sweatshop labor for Nike,
said he couldn't campaign because Republicans buy shoes, too.
</P>
<P>
   The cowardice is hardly new. In 1992, I watched the teeth fall
from the gums when I asked the same question of the Chicago Bulls
and Portland Trail Blazers before their National Basketball
Association finals. Several players would not comment, with one
saying he did not want to be seen as ``inciting something.''
</P>
<P>
   The only player who would speak was Craig Hodges of the Bulls.
Within weeks after uttering these remarks, Hodges was mysteriously
cut by the Bulls:
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine the instant impact we could have had if, say,
we had walked off the court and said, `We want justice for Rodney
King?' Somebody asked M.J. (Jordan) what he thought about Rodney
King. Mike said, `I need to know more about it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on. Maybe you do not have to comment on the specifics,
but at least you can say something in general about injustice to
black people. It's war out there. The owners understand only one
thing _ money. They will only change if they know we are willing to
make a sacrifice. If we did not play, the owners would raise hell,
finding black folks to hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of raising hell, black athletes are content on the
plantation, living proof of the observation of slavery historian
Kenneth Stampp that the mark of a broken slave was one who was
lowered to a condition of ``raw fear,'' ``unconditional
submission,'' and ``perfect dependence.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rhoden asked John Mobley of the Broncos if star players
such as Sharpe (who has a three-year, $7.5 million contract) or
Terrell Davis ($56.1 million, 9 years) would come to a meeting to
discuss the lack of African-American head coaches, Mobley said,
``They probably wouldn't even want to sit down and discuss it if
they knew what the topic was about. They'd think it was really
something silly. It probably wouldn't even get touched.''
</P>
<P>
   The ignorance of Davis was as frightful as the raw fear.
Offering no clue why black coaches were ignored, he said, ``So what
should I do, say `where are the black coaches?' without having any
earthly idea about what I'm talking about?
</P>
<P>
   With such comments, today's black athletes are millionaires as
bereft of consciousness as were their ancestors of freedom. They
are so vacant, Buchanan never knew the true meaning of his collar.
It was not a joke. It was a symbol of his enslaved mind.

PLAYING, AND LOSING AT AGEMANSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently suffered a birthday, my 45th. I'm fine, thanks. God
tricked me by sending me good health (knock on wood) and much
happiness. It wasn't what I thought I wanted, but considering the
alternatives, I'm quite content.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to my birthday, I conducted a modest
research project. While scanning the newspapers, I picked out the
names of men and women my age to see where I stood relative to my
chronological peers. I enlisted my children's help, and it was with
no small amount of glee that my 12-year-old recently announced that
Oprah Winfrey, arguably the best-known journalist in the
English-speaking world, was my age.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what of it? I have no beef with Oprah, who's done even
more for literate writers in America than the Clinton-Lewinsky Walt
Whitman revival. And I maintain a stiff upper lip when reading that
my contemporary Condoleezza Rice is retiring from the third of
three successful careers, first as a Soviet expert, then a National
Security Council aide, and now as the provost at Stanford
University. (Dennis Eckersley just retired from one successful
career at 44.) Comparing lives with Rice, who is also a
concert-quality pianist, prompts me to paraphrase Tom Lehrer's
wistful observation that by the time Mozart was my age, he had been
dead for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a man thing, reading an article about some newly
minted Internet trillionaire and praying that he or she is as old
as . . . 32. Not bloody likely. Hartford talk show host Colin
McEnroe, 44, admits he reads newspapers the same way. Pundit
Michael Kinsley, 47, wrote a funny essay a few years ago upon
realizing that a man roughly his age had become president. This
wasn't a problem for me; I was only 38 when Bill Clinton took
office.
</P>
<P>
   So, on to the 44-year-olds. There's writer Jon Krakauer and
actress Kirstie Alley. The arithmetic mean of the many ages
proclaimed by actress Melanie Griffith seems to be about 44. Dennis
Quaid is 44, as is Kevin Costner. Actress Kim Zimmer and rock
musician Michael Schenker of the Scorpions are also 44, whoever and
wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Wall Street Journal profiled a 44-year-old rock
musician named Jack Kidney, who, unlike Mr. Schenker, does not get
his name included in celebrity birthday lists. Jack and his older
brother Robert have been playing in their Numbers Band for nigh on
30 years, hoping to break through into the big time. Numbers was
hot in the 1970s; their bass player even made it into Devo.
(Remember Devo?) But, while dedicated, the Kent, Ohio-based Kidneys
are not hot. ``Kids want to buy the records of artists they
perceive as their peers,'' an industry mogul told the Journal. ``My
advice to (the Kidneys) is to get a day job.''
</P>
<P>
   I have a day job. Maybe I should stop complaining. But look at
the new chief financial officer of Boeing., Deborah Hopkins. She is
44, and Boeing's youngest senior executive. Likewise the vice
chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble, Stephen Riggio, is 44. In Boston, the
famously press-shy husband and wife real estate developers Frank
and Jamie McCourt are 44. As is America's Internet investing
champion, David Wetherell, the chief executive of the conglomerate
CMG of Andover, Mass. An early investor in such hypergrowth
companies as Lycos and GeoCities, Wetherell and his company are
worth a great deal of money. But neither he nor the McCourts nor I
approach the net worth of Microsoft's Bill Gates, a mere stripling
at 43.
</P>
<P>
   Did you see the Atlanta Falcons' backup quarterback Steve DeBerg
prowling the sidelines at the Super Bowl? He just turned 45, and he
looked decrepit! Thirty-eight-year-old John Elway, who's thinking
of retiring, called DeBerg ``ancient.'' Do I look like that? No
doubt I look considerably worse.
</P>
<P>
   Does life begin at 45? I don't know. Happily it rarely ends at
45. I kept a weather eye on the obituary notices while preparing
this column, but spotted no contemporaries. Where's that hill they
keep talking about? Am I over it yet? Oh, never mind . . .

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When payday rolls around, a glimpse at the pay stub
can be a painful reminder that Social Security takes a big bite out
of wages. About 145 million Americans pay the retirement tax, which
cuts 6.2 percent from most salaries, and 12.4 percent from people
who are self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   But a tiny minority of about 5 million workers pays no Social
Security taxes. Most are police officers, firefighters, teachers
and other government employees. While the rest of America takes
shelter under the broad Social Security tent, which is now sagging
from financial strains, these public employees are camped out in
retirement systems of their own, many of which are stable and
financially healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as lawmakers try to shore up Social Security, a political
battle is brewing to force all new public employees out of their
own plans and into the national retirement system. The move would
raise some much-needed cash, at least in the short term. But
neither the workers, nor their government employers, want them to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has more at stake in the debate than any state but
Ohio. At least 86 percent of Massachusetts public employees are
covered by retirement plans other than Social Security. That
amounts to more than 400,000 workers, retirees and other
beneficiaries, who belong to 106 separate public employee
retirement systems in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   Four bills before Congress would force all new public employees
into Social Security. In each bill, the change is part of a broader
proposal to delay financial problems in Social Security, which has
promised trillions of dollars more in benefits than it can raise in
tax revenues. By one calculation, from economists Henry Aaron and
Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.,
moving new public employees into the system would make up 12
percent of the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The change is a matter of fairness, Aaron and Reischauer
contend. Public employees have had a good deal at the expense of
everyone else, they say, and the nation can no longer afford that
to continue.
</P>
<P>
   But public employees and their allies argue that the change
would cut their benefits dramatically while raising costs for local
government. Given the tight budgets in place under Proposition 2
1/2 in Massachusetts, for instance, cities and towns would have to
cut essential police and fire services to pay the higher retirement
costs, say advocates for public employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a matter of public safety,'' says Thomas
Lussier, executive director of the Massachusetts Teachers'
Retirement Board, which oversees the state's second-largest public
employee retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how a tiny portion of the work force formed its own
retirement niche started early in the century. Long before Congress
made retirement security a priority, several states took up the
idea. The Massachusetts Legislature created the system for teachers
in 1914, 21 years before President Franklin Roosevelt signed Social
Security into law.
</P>
<P>
   Public employers continued to create separate retirement plans,
as Social Security at first specifically excluded state and local
government workers. At the time, legal specialists questioned
whether the federal government could compel states to pay a federal
tax, though the presumption today is that it can.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, a series of legal changes allowed more public workers
into Social Security, but many opted to remain separate.
</P>
<P>
   The law for many years allowed public employees to draw from
both retirement systems, a feature that holds political
implications. A teacher might work 25 years and then start a new
career, or a state office worker might take a second job just to
become eligible for Social Security. On retirement, they could draw
benefits from Social Security and from their public employee
system.
</P>
<P>
   And in many cases, Aaron says, the Social Security benefit would
be far greater than the taxes the worker paid in. ``This is one
reason why we have problems today,'' he said. While the rules
tightened up on these windfalls about two decades ago, ``some of
the unfunded liablity in Social Security is directly traceable to
the employees of states who are outside of the Social Security
system,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fairness, Aaron believes, public employees should
help make up the shortfall caused by their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he notes, a key feature of Social Security is that it
redistributes money from wealthier workers to low-income earners.
Public employees tend to earn more than the average worker, he
argues, but they do not fulfill their ``responsibility'' for
covering the nation's commitment to low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be universal participation in Social Security,''
echoes Bradley Belt of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies which sponsored a panel that studied the retirement
program. ``It's a slippery slope: If you make the case for some
employees to be out of the system, why not make the case for a
broader group?''
</P>
<P>
   To many public employees, however, these arguments are far
removed from the real world of work.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, public employees pay between 5 percent and
more than 9 percent of earnings into their retirement system,
depending on when they were hired and other factors. That means
many workers pay more than the 6.2 percent Social Security tax.
</P>
<P>
   But they generally don't mind, claims Kenneth Donnelly,
secretary-treasurer of the Professional Firefighters of
Massachusetts, an organization of 185 unions. In most cases, the
benefits are far better in the public employees' systems than in
Social Security, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is on the employers' side. Local and state
governments pay between 2 percent and 4 percent of payroll into the
employees' retirement systems. That is far below the 6.2 percent
employers must pay under Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   If required to pay 6.2 percent for each worker, Massachusetts
cities, towns and public employers would have to come up with an
additional $210 million to $500 million each year, one state
retirement agency estimates. And that money would go to a system
that offers fewer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Donnelly says, firefighters, police officers and other
public safety workers would demand that cities and towns buy them
supplemental insurance to cover features that Social Security does
not.
</P>
<P>
   Police and firefighters in Massachusetts can retire at age 55,
partly because of their shorter life expectancies and partly due to
the physical demands of their jobs. Social Security does not pay
even partial benefits until age 62.
</P>
<P>
   Morever, disability and survivor benefits are better in many
public employee systems than in Social Security. If those benefits
were reduced, employers might have a harder time filling jobs that
put a worker in harm's way, say public employees' advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lieutenant in the Lexington Fire Department,'' Donnelly
says. ``I have a wife and three children. We go into burning
buildings and on the highways and expose ourselves to risk, but we
don't have to worry that our families will be provided for. That
shouldn't be taken away.'' Finally, say Donnelly and Lussier,
public retirement systems are counting on payments from future
workers to cover benefits for people already in the system.
Stripping out new workers would cripple the finances of these
retirement plans, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Public employees have begun a lobbying campaign to block the
proposed changes. They fear that the pressure to repair Social
Security is so great that their concerns will be traded away during
the search to find a political compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Early lobbying targets have included Senator John Breaux,
Democrat of Louisiana, and Representative Charles Stenholm,
Democrat of Texas. Both have sponsored bills to move new public
employees into Social Security, but they are also from states where
many public workers belong to their own retirement systems.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Kerry has sponsored briefings on Capitol Hill for
Massachusetts public workers and employers to make their case to
congressional aides. Through a spokesman, Kerry said that any
changes to Social Security law must ensure that ``the benefits of
retired and current Massachusetts public employees are fully
safeguarded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I hope they notice is that we have management and
labor together on this issue,'' says Donnelly. ``It's a funny kind
of alliance.''

THIS JUVENILE WON'T BE THE ANSWER IN THE DERBY, EITHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the Breeders' Cup began in 1984, no winner of the $1
million Juvenile has captured the Kentucky Derby the following
year. After the way Juvenile champion Answer Lively ran Saturday,
it is highly unlikely the jinx will be broken this year.
</P>
<P>
   A son of Lively One, out of Twosies Answer, a sprinter who ran
in New England, Answer Lively won four of his seven starts as a
2-year-old. Naturally gifted with speed, Answer Lively came into
the Juvenile at Churchill Downs last Nov. 7 off a narrow loss to
Cat Thief in the Breeders' Futurity at Keeneland, in which Cat
Thief caught him in the last jump. Churchill was playing to speed
at the time, and Answer Lively became the darling of the figure
players. He was bet down to the 5-2 favorite under Robby Albarado
and did not disappoint his backers, holding on gamely to tally by a
head over Aly's Alley, with Cat Thief third.
</P>
<P>
   The Breeders' Cup Juvenile is run at 1 1/16 miles, and those who
had seen Towsie's Answer race 5 furlongs on the grass at Suffolk
Downs knew it was doubtful that Answer Lively would be successful
at the 1 1/4-mile distance of the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Answer Lively made his 3-year-old debut in the
$100,000 Lecomte Handicap at Fair Grounds, where he is based for
owner John Franks and trainer Bobby Barnett. Answer Lively was the
highweight at 122 pounds, giving away 4-11 pounds to the rest of
the field, but the Lecomte is only a mile, a distance perfectly
suited for him.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that Answer Lively frightens no one, a full field of
14 went in the Lecomte. Even though he was stuck out in post No.
11, Answer Lively was made the 1-2 favorite. When the gates opened,
he was outrun for the lead by a group of horses inside him, and it
was basically over. He tried to rally from the outside turning for
home but had no late kick and finished seventh. The winner, Some
Actor, was 42-1, and he was followed under the wire by a 22-1 shot
and a 10-1 shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little wide, but that was no concern,'' said Albarado.
``At the three-eighths pole, I called on him for a little response
and he lacked it. He wasn't there for me. I wish I could come up
with a better excuse. He pulled up super. He hit the ground fine
and was nice and smooth the whole way. There was just nothing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Eclipse Awards dinner Feb. 16, Answer Lively will be
named best 2-year-old colt of 1998, but you can bet he's not going
to win the Kentucky Derby.

   The Massachusetts Handicap was helped when Puerto Madero and
Behrens finished ahead of 4-5 favorite Silver Charm in the $500,000
Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park Saturday. Trainer Richard
Mandella, who has Puerto Madero, and trainer Jim Bond, who has
Behrens, have supported the MassCap in the past. Puerto Madero ran
second to Skip Away in last year's edition, and Bond sent up Will's
Way to run third to Skip Away in 1997. Bond would have entered
Behrens last year, but the horse was not doing well at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very happy with the outcome of the race,'' said
Suffolk vice president Lou Raffetto. ``A lot of local people were
rooting for Puerto Madero because of his performance behind Skip
Away last year. Puerto Madero could easily become the next `Suffolk
horse,' popular here, as were Cigar and Skip Away. Both Richard and
Jim want a reason to come back. I'm very encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffetto is preparing to make recruiting stops in Florida and
California. He'll be in Florida for the Eclipse dinner, which is in
Coral Gables, and he'll visit Gulfstream and Payson Park, where
several of the top trainers are stabled. Then he'll head to Santa
Anita for the $1 million Big 'Cap March 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a good spot,'' said Raffetto. ``Now we just have to
work hard and hope to get lucky.''

 WASHINGTON: ... had enough.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No longer. ``I'm pretty much shut off from Red Cross blood,''
said Byron Buhner, chief of the Central Indiana Regional Blood
Center in Indianapolis. He now buys more blood from other
independent centers and, in a retaliatory move, has opened
blood-donation centers in several Red Cross territories.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Red Cross workers for years helped gather donors
for the independent blood bank. But now they work only for the new
Red Cross blood center, said Bill Coenen, chief operating officer
of the independent Community Blood Center of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   While the independent centers say competition will turn off
donors, confusing them with multiple appeals for blood, the Red
Cross says competition prompts more people to give blood. It also
says that it was hospitals, not the Red Cross, that changed the
blood industry into a competitive business by forming large chains
and looking nationwide for cheap blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals have gone out and asked for bids to provide blood,
and the Red Cross responds to them,'' said Red Cross spokesman
Michael Fulwider. ``So do the independent blood centers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jim MacPherson, director of America's Blood Centers, the
independents' trade group, says the Red Cross has weakened all
blood banks by forcing them to open new offices and take on new
costs as they compete with one another. The Red Cross biomedical
division lost money in four of the last five years, for a total
loss in that period of $191 million, and that division is carrying
$295 million in debt. The agency says the losses and much of the
debt come from the cost of revamping its blood division, ensuring
safety, and of developing new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Cross certainly hasn't improved anything,'' MacPherson
said. ``And we've lost the collegiality that used to make us strong
and cooperative, to help make blood safer and more available.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blood banking was only one of Dole's challenges. With the United
Way cutting back contributions, Dole led a fund-raising campaign
that has steadied Red Cross finances, the agency says. She donated
thousands of dollars in her own speaking fees to the Red Cross and
did not accept a salary, set at $200,000, in her first year as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Dole also overhauled the agency's disaster-relief efforts and
boosted the number of disaster workers. During her tenure, the Red
Cross created two telephone call centers to improve the process of
passing emergency messages between military personnel and their
families, one of its most valued services. A 1996 survey by KPMG
Peat Marwick, an independent auditor commissioned by the Red Cross,
was sharply critical of the agency's accounting and planning
procedures. But the Red Cross says it addressed many of those
criticisms, and that others were based on wrong information.
</P>
<P>
   In managing the Red Cross, Dole drew on her political contacts
and aides who worked with her in government. The Red Cross, for
example, bought the services of public policy consultant Mari
Maseng Will, who held high positions in Bob Dole's various
presidential campaigns and is the wife of conservative columnist
George Will.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross also bought consulting services from two other
members of the Bob Dole campaign: lawyer Robert Davis and Melinda
Farris, a consultant known for coaching the wives of Republican
candidates on their public appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those consultants joined what became known as Elizabeth
Dole's ``special team.'' In addition to Will, the team included
Jennifer Dorn and John Heubusch, who had worked for Dole when she
was a Cabinet secretary and took senior jobs at the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Some Red Cross volunteers said Dole relied too heavily on these
advisers at the expense of longtime volunteers and staff. Commonly,
Will or Dorn would screen requests from people who wanted to see
Dole, and Dole would hold only meetings ``that were fully scripted
in advance,'' said Manning Warren III, a Louisville, Ky., law
professor and former member of the charity's international services
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dole took over, the Red Cross was an incredibly intense
volunteer organization with new ideas bubbling forth constantly,''
said Warren, who quit two senior volunteer positions in 1994 in a
dispute with Dole. ``With Elizabeth Dole, the vitality seemed to
seep out. I thought it was due to the political risks she carried
as the wife of a candidate, or being a potential candidate
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Buzz Braley, a Portland, Ore., auto dealer and former chairman
of the Red Cross senior blood-banking committee, offered a
different view of the special team. ``Some people at the Red Cross
felt it was more politically motivated than professionally
motivated,'' he said. ``To me, they were more of a sounding board,
and I did not feel there was anything wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some former Red Cross staff members and consultants are
helping Dole assess her chances for a presidential campaign. They
include Stewart McLaurin, Dole's chief of staff at the Red Cross,
and Kathryn Wilson, her scheduler. Several media reports have said
that Heubusch, Davis, and Mari Maseng Will are also now political
advisers to Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's prolific fund-raising for the Red Cross _ she raised $3.4
billion during her time at the charity _ drew from companies that
have long had ties to her husband. For example, Bob Dole was a
stalwart defender of tax breaks for ethanol, saving millions of
dollars for the Archer Daniels Midland Co. and its former chairman,
Dwayne O. Andreas. ADM and the Andreas family have given thousands
of dollars to Bob Dole's campaigns and foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ADM has also been generous to the Red Cross. One year after
Elizabeth Dole became president, Andreas's wife, Inez, joined the
Red Cross board, and ADM donated at least $1 million to the
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Federal Express gave $5,000 to Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign at about the same time it formed a
``philanthropic alliance'' with the Red Cross to ship disaster
supplies for free and give the charity the exclusive right for one
year to hold blood drives among its Memphis employees.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing illegal in the donations, and many US companies
want to affiliate themselves with the Red Cross, one of the world's
best-known charities. ``As a good corporate citizen, Federal
Express wants to have a good relation with the American Red Cross,
and that will not change regardless of who is its president,'' said
Patrick Melancon, manager of community relations for Federal
Express.
</P>
<P>
   But others say Elizabeth Dole risked turning the Red Cross into
an avenue for corporations to influence her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to curry favor with a presidential candidate or a
member of Congress, and his wife is in a position to receive funds,
corporations will give that way, too,'' said Ellen Miller of Public
Campaign, a watchdog group. ``There is no question that these
corporations were attempting to curry more favor with the Dole
family.''

EARLIER TREATMENT NEEDED FOR WOMEN, AIDS PANEL TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ American women infected with the AIDS virus are not
getting antiviral drugs early enough, a leading specialist on women
and AIDS said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Women have 20 percent less AIDS virus in their blood than men at
any given stage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and
the immune-system damage it causes, Dr. Katherine Anastos of
Catholic Medical Centers in New York City reported at the Sixth
Conference on Retroviruses.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of virus in patients' blood is the main signal for
doctors to begin treatment. Thus, official treatment guidelines,
which were based on the course of the disease in men, are causing
women to begin treatment later than they should, Anastos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treatment guidelines may need to be adjusted,'' she told
colleagues, ``to lower the treatment threshold by 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Anastos' conclusion is based on the largest study thus far on
gender differences in HIV disease, based on 1,268 women and 1,604
men. Previous studies, such as one published last year, had
suggested as much as a 50 percent male-female disparity _ that is,
women showed severe immune damage at half the blood virus levels
seen in men with similar damage.
</P>
<P>
   Anastos' proposed revision would expand the numbers of women
needing antiviral treatments by only 2 to 5 percent. Even though
that's not a large fraction, she said, ``it's an important issue''
for individual women whose treatment is delayed.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 52,000 American women with diagnosed AIDS and
another 150,000 or so who are thought to carry HIV without having
progressed to AIDS. Federal estimates place the total number of
infected Americans at 650,000 to 900,000.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   One day in November, 1989, a teenager and three men ranging in
age from their 50s to their 70s got infected with the AIDS virus at
a dermatology clinic in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The virus came not from a health care worker, as in the
notorious case of a Florida dentist who apparently infected six
patients in the late 1980s, but from another patient at the clinic.
The apparent cause was a failure to sterilize equipment used in the
five surgical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, an Australian researcher presented conclusive evidence
here that all four patients got the virus from the same patient on
the same day. Nitin Saksena of the University of Sydney said the
proof came from the virus's distinctive genetic ``signature'' in
three of its genes.
</P>
<P>
   Because HIV evolves so rapidly, there was no way the four
patients' virus could have matched unless they had all become
infected on the same day, Saksena said in an interview. For legal
reasons, he said, no sample was available from the patient who
began the chain of infection, a homosexual man who subsequently
died of AIDS. One of the four accidentally infected patients has
died of AIDS and the other three remain well.
</P>
<P>
   Saksena said he knew of no other documented case of
patient-to-patient HIV infection through contaminated medical
equipment. Neither did Dr. Harold Jaffe, director of the AIDS/HIV
laboratory at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe said patients' risk of being infected this way is
apparently tiny, ``but there's always the possibility our
surveillance could miss rare cases.'' The Australian episode, he
added, underscores the critical importance of good
infection-control techniques.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive new drug treatments against HIV often reduce the
virus in patients' blood to undetectable levels, so public health
officials have hoped that the risk of sexual transmission would be
eliminated too. But evidence is mounting that individuals whose HIV
is successfully repressed still harbor the virus in genital
secretions.
</P>
<P>
   Of 70 Brazilian patients under antiviral treatment, one-quarter
still had HIV in their semen after six months of treatment, even
when none could be detected in their blood, Dr. Paulo Barroso of
the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Pomerantz of Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia reported on Monday that he has found HIV in genital
secretions of both men and women despite apparent viral clearance
from the bloodstream. The message is, treated patients and their
sexual partners should not assume they can't pass the virus on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The US blood supply is increasingly safe, with the risk of HIV
contamination now no larger than one unit of blood in every
half-million. But a new study of first-time blood donors, who make
up about 20 percent of all donors, shows their blood is 2.5 times
more likely to contain HIV than repeat donors.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing problem is that infected individuals may donate
blood before their immune systems have begun to generate
antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael P. Busch of the Blood Center of the Pacific in San
Francisco said the study found 427 HIV-infected blood donors among
1.8 million individuals giving blood for the first time. US blood
banks will soon begin using a new genetic screening test, primarily
to detect blood containing the hepatitis C virus, a leading cause
of liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the new screening tests will prevent blood
transmission (of HIV) completely,'' Busch said.

DSS DESERVES CELLUCCI'S REPLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Change the date, and the letter to Paul Cellucci could have been
written Tuesday, not nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Child welfare and human service groups and organizations are
busy making recommendations to you about key candidates for
Commissioner of the Department of Social Services,'' Jetta Bernier,
the executive director of the Massachusetts Committee for Children
and Youth, wrote to the lieutenant governor-elect on Dec. 13, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We write to urge you to defer filling the position at this
early phase and to set a more critical priority _ that of
developing a process to define how Massachusetts will take on the
challenge to reform its child welfare and social services system.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cellucci never replied.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a decade later, Cellucci is governor and the state's
child protection agency is as adrift as ever. Once again, a
``nationwide search'' is under way for someone to lead a department
whose mission is no better defined than it was when he and Governor
William Weld took office in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It is past time to stop and take stock of DSS.
</P>
<P>
   The department has sometimes seemed like a bottomless well of
scandal and mismanagement. The so-called House of Horrors in
Everett, where five children were found living in squalor last
week, is only the most recent example.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's response to revelations that DSS had ignored repeated
reports from teachers and others about the neglect the children in
Everett were suffering is typical of the crisis-driven management
that has characterized his approach to child protection. He
suspended the social worker on the case and her supervisor, without
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Is a reactive policy of assigning blame and moving on supposed
to calm an outraged public or comfort the vulnerable families who
rely on DSS to protect children from abuse and neglect?
</P>
<P>
   Is hanging a couple of overworked social workers out to dry
supposed to exonerate the Cellucci administration for failing to
develop a substantive, coherent approach to child protection?
</P>
<P>
   Is it only those on the front lines _ caseworkers earning
starting salaries of $23,900 _ who are to be held accountable for
the failures of DSS?
</P>
<P>
   When DSS Commissioner Linda Carlisle recently announced that she
would be leaving the post she has held for six years, she actually
claimed to be resigning because she had accomplished all she had
set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   Only days later, the Committee for Children and Youth, a
private, nonprofit group that has advocated for vulnerable children
for 40 years, issued its findings that fewer than one in four
families reported for abuse or neglect are even offered support
services by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers are expected to function as one-person
interdisciplinary teams. They are not psychiatric nurses, but they
are expected to understand psychotropic drugs. They are not
substance abuse counselors, but they are expected to cope with
alcoholism. They are not experts in sexual abuse or domestic
violence but they are expected to protect children who suffer both
plagues.
</P>
<P>
   This is DSS at its peak performance?
</P>
<P>
   Social workers for the agency, long at odds with the
Weld-Cellucci administrations about the size of caseloads, the lack
of training and the need for more integrated services for children
and their families, resorted to gallows humor this week to endure
the scapegoating that, more and more, has become part of their job
description.
</P>
<P>
   In a mock employment advertisement, one social worker described
the qualities DSS looks for in a valued employee. ``Extraordinary
stamina, emotional and physical,'' she wrote. ``Ability to
withstand verbal abuse, threats of physical abuse and occasional
physical abuse, as well as disdain from the public in general, the
press, the politicians and occasionally other helping
professionals, including the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, she wrote, applicants for
jobs with the state's child protection agency should have ``no
expectation of loyalty from bureaucratic and political systems.''
</P>
<P>
   She got that right.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nine years since members of the child advocacy
community reached out to Paul Cellucci. It is long past time he
answered their letter.

THE ART OF THE POLITICIAN: BOSTON STILLS BUYS BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending; moved on last night's am cycle)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When it comes to rendering fecklessness endearing, no
other scribbler is in the same league as P.G. Wodehouse of
Jeeves-and-Bertie-Wooster fame.
</P>
<P>
   I give you a minor classic, ``The Mating Season,'' where this
pithy portrayal awaits, as fine a definition of woebegone-ness as
there is extant, describing Bertie in the dumps:
</P>
<P>
   ``Few, seeing him, would have recognized in this limp and
shivering chunk of human flotsam the suave, dapper boulevardier of
happier years.''
</P>
<P>
   I cite this as partial explanation for why the Republicans so
hate Bill Clinton. They think he is Bertie Wooster, a charming fool
whose luck has somehow carried him this far, and if only they rough
him up a little more, he'll cave.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The Bill Clinton on display Tuesday in Boston, the
grinning, cheerful, yes, even cocky Bill Clinton, is probably the
most artful politician in the trade today. And it drives his
enemies batty.
</P>
<P>
   The political event that brought Clinton to the Hub was a
love-bombing for Steve Grossman, the Massachusetts Envelope Co.
executive who's wrapping up a much-lauded stint as Democratic
national chairman. The Park Plaza ballroom was stuffed with
long-lunching contributors. And the reception for Clinton was
noticably warmer than the polite but notably restrained greeting he
got last fall when he was in the same room, before largely the same
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Monica's grilling by Republican inquisitors (the
23rd official, sworn, watch-your-step-girl interrogation about what
she and Clinton got up to), with official First Buddy Vernon Jordan
undergoing his own ordeal-by-inquisition in DC, the president
ambled on stage in the company of the wall-to-wall Democratic Party
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   They may want to fry him in Utah, in the Bible Belt, in
precincts far from Friendly Fenway. But Boston still buys Bill,
that was plain. Hand in trouser pockets, text ignored in front of
him, Clinton unrolled an artful political speech, never once
alluding to what the nightly news would undoubtedly lead with.
Monica monopolizes the media.
</P>
<P>
   So Bill trolled his ``save Social Security first'' theme,
keystone of his seventh federal budget, and cornerstone of his plan
to beat the congressional Republicans back into minority. The White
House press corps, on hairtrigger alert for any Monica morsel, had
to be content with a meager crumb, when a pre-recorded Clinton, in
the lavish video tribute to Grossman, noted archly that not since
1822 had the party of a sitting president actually picked up House
seats in the sixth year of his reign.
</P>
<P>
   After that 1822 election, said Bill, ``the other party
disappeared.'' Sly pause. ``We should be so lucky.'' Laughs all
around. Clinton knows he does better in Boston and the Land of the
Bean and the Cod than he does anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have listened to this go on forever,'' he cooed of the
banquet of verbal bouquets tossed from the stage, a surfeit of
political flattery by any standard.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton usually has one good joke in his repertoire, thrown
early, like a seasoned pugilist's first left jab, just to find the
range and tune up the muscles. Tuesday's was his allusion to the
absent and much-wondered about Hillary, an extremely popular figure
with Massachusetts Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   What's on your schedule today, dear? related the president. ``
`Oh, I'm going up there to canonize Steve Grossman.' She said,
`Bill, don't say that _ that's the wrong religion!' ''
</P>
<P>
   He segued skillfully into standard riffs: why the Democrats are
the better party for America (they stand for more ``community''
values than the other guys) and his second-term legislative agenda
(Social Security, Medicaid, spreading the economic boom to the
left-behind, spiffing up the schools). ``This is the best economy
in a decade _ maybe ever,'' he said. ``We will never have a better
opportunity to bring the American Dream to poor people who work
hard. If we don't do it now, we never will.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks would not use that stuff, but it's what draws a lot
of the Democrats' to a rainy-day lunch with a politician that a lot
of America left for dead. Clinton knows which buttons to push, when
and how to push them, and he is simply better at playing music on
the political synthesizer than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, like a lot of the talking heads of D.C., just
don't get it. Just one more jibe, one more smear, one more attack,
and this guy will fold like Bertie Wooster, they figure. He's a
draft-dodging, skirt-chasing, oath-bending wimp, they tell each
other. They reinforce each other's mis-reading of the Clinton
phenomenon. So they wind up punching fog.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what they hurl at Clinton, he never acts like dogmeat.
He never curls up and moans. Somehow he keeps coming back, in the
polls, on your TV screen, in the manner in which he's welcomed, if
not in morals. Bill just keeps slugging away. The majority of
Americans like that part about him. And his enemies hate him for
it. It's been said by many; he's lucky in his choice of enemies.
Then again, maybe it isn't just luck; maybe he plans it that way.

THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL AND GOOD: HORSERADISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since my grosspa taught me how to dig up the gnarled roots
and grate them till we laughed and cried _ he laughed while I cried
_ I suspected there was some earthy magic in horseradish.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the strange plants in my great-grandfather's garden, the
Meerrettich _ ``sea radish,'' which must be a cryptic Germanic
reference to sea of tears _ was the only one we dared not filch.
(Now there's a word that has atrophied into dictionary dust ...
means mini-misdemeanor level theft, such as filching an apple from
Mr. Carter's tree. I saw a man only last week take a shelled nut
from a bulk barrel in the local Safeway produce department and pop
it into his mouth. Legally, that's probably theft. But it's really
filching, which is basically what the neighborhood beat cop was
doing when he took an apple from the Grocerland's sidewalk
display.)
</P>
<P>
   Which strays somewhat from Grosspa's garden, a goodly part of
which was given over to this strange root, which resembled a
parsnip on steroids and tasted like ... well, like something you
wouldn't on a double-dog dare filch and try to nibble.
</P>
<P>
   Which no doubt has something to do with a report that
horseradish can protect you from E. coli, listeria, Staphylococcus
aureus and other nasty food pathogens. Scientists at Oklahoma State
University and the federal Agricultural Research Service discovered
what my great-grandfather already knew:
</P>
<P>
   Something in horseradish can kill bad microbes and germs. Which
seems, by extrapolation, to make sense, since any substantial
helping of horseradish is likely to kill whoever eats it. Or, at
very least, make them wish they had died suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   No telling from the news reports just how the scientists
researched this, but if they're alive to tell about it, we have to
assume they worked with samples no larger than what the average guy
puts on his corned beef sandwich or prime rib or grilled bratwurst.
Apparently, both horseradish and mustard oil contain the pungent
oil allyl isothiocyanate (which is worth italics just so's you know
I'm not simply drawing my finger across the keyboard).
</P>
<P>
   This chemical _ about 93 percent concentration in mustard oil
and 60 percent in horseradish _ helps kill, injure, maim or
otherwise render impotent those nasty germs and viruses that hide
out in our food with premeditated deadly intent to send us directly
to the bathroom or the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, as I noted, too much horseradish can do the same
thing. My father introduced me to Industrial Strength Horseradish
in a place called Slowik's, a workingman's restaurant and bar with
reception halls. The Bohemian joint at the angular junction of
Belmont and Milwaukee avenues was known for its weekday
workingman's lunch, and I followed my dad to the bar, where we each
ordered a beer and a smoked pork butt sandwich on rye.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the draft Michelob came in thick glass schooners known as
``goldfish bowls,'' which, in truth, were large enough for a great
white shark. And the smoked pork butt sandwiches were truly tasty
and huge. ``You want some of our horseradish wit dat?'' the
bartender asked me, all the while smiling at my father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure!'' says The Kid, bellying up to the bar and wanting more
than anything to eat and drink elbow-to-elbow with my dad. So the
bartender sticks a wooden paddlelike thing in the horseradish jar
and slides it down the bar so it stops about ]-inch from my
sandwich. ``You might wanna go li'l easy on dat stuff ... it's
sorta strong,'' he says, turning away as if to wash some glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``H---! I grew up eating horseradish!'' I said confidently,
filling the wooden paddle with about a teaspoon of the white stuff
and spreading it across my sandwich. I took a big bite and began
chewing.
</P>
<P>
   In the big back-bar mirror, I could see my father watching me.
And about the same time molten steel went down my throat and fire
belched out like an old Bessemer blast furnace, my dad put his arm
around me so I wouldn't collapse backward off the bar stool.
</P>
<P>
   My eyes were tearing. I couldn't breathe in, because that made
the fire go deeper into my chest and through my nose like a red-hot
rebar. If you've ever been Maced or tear-gassed, you have some idea
what Slowik's horseradish can do. ``Take some beer ... quick, but
not too much!'' said the smiling bartender.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my boy!'' my father said, almost proudly, smiling back.
The bartender wiped his hands on his white apron and extended a
beefy paw over the bar. ``Name's Matt Slowik,'' he said, crushing
my hand as I continued to gasp for air. ``Drink up and I'll buy you
a fresh one, on the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The Slowiks already knew _ 40 some years ago _ and my
great-grandfather years before that, what the Oklahoma State U. and
federal scientists just learned: This horseradish stuff is good for
what ails you, if it don't kill you first.

WHO PUT ZEAL IN JOHNSON'S IMPEACHMENT? BUTLER DID IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One was elected governor of Massachusetts and
ran for president. Three went to the Senate. One almost became vice
president. Another would become Treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the 13 impeachment managers pursuing William Jefferson
Clinton face uncertain political futures. In 1868, the seven
managers of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson prospered at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   History's verdict does not always validate the decisions of the
ballot box. ``Altogether the impeachment of Johnson was one of the
most disgraceful and vulgar episodes in the history of the federal
government,'' Henry Steele Commager and Samuel Eliot Morison wrote
in ``The Growth of the American Republic.'' The historians called
the impeachment managers ``unscrupulous parliamentarians who
exhausted every device, appealed to every prejudice and passion,
and rode roughshod over every legal obstacle in their ruthless
attempt to punish the president for his opposition to their
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachers thrived because editorial and emotional opinion
in the nation was proimpeachment, but most scholars today call the
major impeachment article against Johnson unconstitutional. After
Congress passed a law forbidding the president from dismissing a
Cabinet officer, Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.
Congress did not wait for Supreme Court clarification but impeached
Johnson, who had become president after the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost from the time when the blood of Lincoln was warm on the
floor of Ford's Theatre, Andrew Johnson was contemplating
treason,'' John A. Logan of Illinois said on the House floor. Logan
later went to the Senate and was the Republican VP candidate in
1884.
</P>
<P>
   Even more extreme was Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania. In his
dying months, Stevens pursued Johnson on the House floor, calling
him a ``wretched man'' and ``pettifogging political trickster.''
After the president's acquittal, he said, ``The only recourse from
intolerable tyranny is Brutus's dagger.'' In 1864, Stevens had
called Lincoln too soft on the South, rejecting ``malice toward
none'' in favor of punishing the defeated Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   In one of history's twists, in 1977, Jimmy Carter of Georgia,
the first Southern politician elected president since the Civil
War, fulfilled a campaign promise by enrolling his 9-year-old
daughter in the District of Columbia schools. Amy Carter attended
Thaddeus Stevens Elementary School, named after a man who once
demanded, ``Some proper pain must be inflicted on the people who
constituted the Confederate States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Franklin Butler of Massachusetts had a pinball career
in politics, beginning as a Jackson Democrat, bouncing across
parties and eventually becoming the Greenback presidential
candidate in 1884. In 1860 he nominated Jefferson Davis for US
president, but a few years later Davis denounced him as a felon and
an outlaw because of Butler's actions as military governor of New
Orleans. Any woman insulting a Union soldier, he ordered, was
``liable to be treated as a woman of the town plying her
avocation.'' To Southerners, he was ``Spoons'' Butler, alleging
that he swiped cutlery. They called him ``a cross-eyed beast'' to

   After declining Lincoln's offer of the vice presidency in 1864,
Butler brought zeal to the impeachment proceedings, hiring private
detectives and violating other rules of fair play. After several
attempts, Butler was elected governor of Massachusetts, and when he
died in 1893, mourners filled the streets of his home town, Lowell.
The kindest thing historians have called him is ``a political
general,'' but his legacy lives on in the Bay State. When an
outgoing governor hands over the symbols of office to a successor,
the trinkets include John Hancock's keys to the State House and the
Bible Ben Butler carried during the Civil War.

THE POWERS THAT BEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question from the '60s: who put the bomp in the
bomp-da-bomp-da-bomp? Question for the '90s: who puts the beep in
the cell phones?
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just the beeps. It's the chirps, the bings, and the
bongs. It's the bells and the whistles. It's the whole cacophony of
electronic burps that are imbedded in microchips inside the likes
of automobiles, cash machines, stereo gear, answering machines,
wristwatches, toys, cameras, computer hardware, fax machines,
copiers, and coffee makers. Not so long ago the alarm clock and the
telephone were pretty much the only buzzes in our lives. Now we're
surrounded by dozens of cheap trills.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid we had very few of these sounds, because we
didn't have things like microwave ovens and cell phones and ATMs,''
says 41-year-old Mark Barasch, once a jazz guitarist in Boston and
now a sound designer in New York. ``I mean, these devices didn't
replace anything. They're relatively new, and so are the sounds
they make. And there may be room for millions more.''
</P>
<P>
   Beeps and bongs are perhaps no more ubiquitous than in cars,
where sound designers have decreed that noise means status. Drivers
of upscale models tend to get audio warnings of, say, near-empty
gas tanks or unlatched trunks, while owners of more plebeian models
do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chimes in particular tend to be used more often in expensive
cars,'' says Charles Richlie, a design engineer for Visteon
Automotive Systems in Detroit, which is part of Ford Motor Co.
``Somebody here obviously decided that chimes sound expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Richlie creates hardware that alerts drivers via tones (``Those
are the beeps,'' he explains) and chimes (``Those are the bongs'').
He points out that chimes usually bong at speeds of 60, 120, or 240
times per minute, and that the fastest rate is intended to create a
sense of urgency _ warning you, for instance, that, yipes, you've
left your your key in the ignition. Richlie's current project: a
beep that will inform you that you've left your turn signal on too
long.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of our beeps and bongs vary. Many are turned out by
engineers who simply borrow them from libraries that are available
on CDs and CD-ROMS, as well as on line. But others are the
creations of specialists who often work in ``human factors''
laboratories, who expound on the importance of ``interface sound
design,'' and who sometimes speak not of bells and whistles but of
``earcons'' (as in icons for the ears).
</P>
<P>
   At Timex Corp., in Middlebury, Conn., where one particular
wristwatch is so beepy it's called Beepwear, shifting demographics
are literally changing the tune. Explains Ron Lizzi, a Timex senior
software engineer: ``As people age, they become less sensitive to
higher frequencies. That means we're now tending to favor lower
frequency tones in our watches.'' Meanwhile, Timex has discovered a
beep gender gap. ``Women don't like beeps as much as men do,'' says
Lizzi.
</P>
<P>
   Timex watches emit all sorts of small noises: alarms, hourly
chimes, timers, and so forth. The sounds are made by tiny
piezoelectric crystals that vibrate in response to current sent
from a microchip. They're not particularly sophisticated noises,
nor is the method for testing them. Their engineers most often rely
on advice from Timex marketing specialists. ``Or we might try them
out on whoever happens to be in the hallway at the time,'' Lizzi
says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at Bell Labs, the New Jersey-based research arm of Lucent
Technologies, the testing is considerably less casual. Bell's
Integrated User Experience Group might, for example, invite a wide
range of outsiders into a conference room in order to have them
listen to and rate a gaggle of sounds given off by an assortment of
cellular telephones. Are the sounds loud enough? Are they pleasant?
Are they annoying? Are they distinct?
</P>
<P>
   The sounds a product emits can roughly be divided into two main
types _ ``confirmation'' and ``error'' _ and it's important that
the user not get these messages mixed. ``As a rule, a confirmation
tone is a higher tone that curves upward,'' explains Joanne Walsh,
a technical manager at Bell Labs. ``Error tones are lower, and they
curve down.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we've become a culture that learns early in life when an
electronic sound is trying to tell us we've done good or done bad.
``My 5-year-old can't read, but he already knows the difference
between a `good' tone and a `bad' tone,'' says Veronica Frischman,
who tests Lucent products against competitors' units. ``And my kids
have always said `beep-beep' when they wanted their bottles,
because the oven beeped when the bottles were ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Barasch, the Hub former Hub guitarist turned New York sound
designer, considers the creation of consumer-product sounds an art
form. He thinks they should be able to elicit emotional responses
ranging from gladness to sadness. Barasch Music &AMP; Sound has
produced sounds for Bell Labs, and Barasch remembers the test he
was given first: ``A guy from Bell came in and asked me to create
the sound of a phone ringing. And the sound of the ringing had to
tell a person, before he answered it, that a baby had been born. So
I created it. It was the sound of a celeste, which is a
glockenspiel-like instrument, playing a short melody twice.'' P.S.:
Barasch got the job.
</P>
<P>
   What do folks want in their bells and whistles? Barasch thinks
they want music: ``Every message that Bell Labs has wanted me to
convey _ whether it was an urgent sound, or an error sound, or
whatever _ was created in three ways. There was a musical version,
a real-world sound-effects version, and a speech-prompt version.
And when these got tested in focus groups, they found over and over
again that the musical sounds always won in terms of preference.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Negoescu, a sound designer at Frog Design in Austin,
Texas, has created sounds for the likes of ATM machines, stereo
gear, and personal computers. He uses a computer to cut, chop, and
meld sounds that are either generated by a synthesizer or recorded
in the real world. He thinks the electronic noises that surround us
should be, as much as possible, audio versions of the messages
they're trying to convey. His favorite personal symphony is a sound
he created for Compaq Computers, which accompanied an on-screen
image of an opening control panel. ``I combined the sound of a car
door shutting with the sharp click of a Zippo lighter,'' Negoescu
says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   (There are at least two major rumors circulating in the world of
bells and whistles. The first is that popmeister Brian Eno created
the orchestral sound that bursts forth as Microsoft's Windows
operating system boots up. That's false, says Microsoft. The second
is that the sound that warns Honda drivers of a door ajar is Morse
Code for the letter H. That's true _ four beeps, or ``dots'' _ but
it's purely a coincidence, says Honda.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of us, of course, can do without all the noise. Even men.
But if electronic sounds are impossible to avoid, maybe it's at
least possible to alter them to suit our individual tastes. Indeed,
Timex produces a high-tech watch called a Data Link, which allows
users to customize its tones. ``That's something we certainly
expect to see more of in the future,'' predicts Lizzi.
</P>
<P>
   So if you don't like your beep, you can always change it to a
bong.

EBONY LOVE; WHITE GUYS WHO ROCK; SAVAGED IN OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Black History Month _ all 28 days of it _ so many magazines
are giving their annual nod to the lives and contributions of
African-Americans. Ebony, which is all black, all the time,
regardless of calendar markings, does its part for the cause with
an issue focusing on ``Black Love.'' Now, anyone who has ever spent
time flipping through Ebony's glossy pages at the beauty parlor or
barber shop can pretty much guess how one of the nation's oldest
black magazines would celebrate black love _ by featuring
photographs and breathless copy about bank-breaking celebrity
weddings. Among the brides and grooms are South African President
Nelson Mandela; Erinn Cosby, daughter of Bill and Camille Cosby;
and Portland Trailblazer Rasheed Abdul Wallace. For Wallace's
marriage to Fatima Labretta Sanders, Joy Bennett Kinnon writes,
``After Wallace placed a 10-karat diamond on his bride's finger,
lovebirds took flight, confetti was sprinkled, and flower petals
dropped from the ceiling.'' Such detail! Wallace also gave his
bride a Lexus as a proposal gift. Long before celebrities regularly
hawked their lavish nuptials in InStyle and People magazines, there
was Ebony to remind us of all things we could never afford in our
ordinary little lives.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't stop there. Also submitted for our
approval are the ``10 Hottest Couples.'' By far the most intriguing
of the lot are Terry McMillan and Jonathan Plummer. Why, you ask?
Well, the 20-something Plummer was the inspiration for the Winston
Shakespeare character in ``How Stella Got her Groove Back.'' As in
the book (and the film adaptation starring Angela Bassett),
McMillan, 46, met Plummer while vacationing in Jamaica and,
shunning the advice of friends, began a relationship with him. Just
before marrying Plummer in September, McMillan, never known for
holding her tongue, said, ``Our attitude is `Yeah, we're going to
get married; however long it lasts, it lasts.' '' Ain't love grand?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whither Spin?
</P>
<P>
   Now that editor-in-chief Michael Hirschorn and executive editor
Craig Marks have been kicked to the curb by their bottom-line
owners, Miller Publishing, there's more than a little hand-wringing
concerning what will become of American's best music monthly. The
mag founded by Bob Guccione Jr. has never taken itself, or most of
the world around it, too seriously even as it has offered stellar,
in-depth reporting on a variety of subjects from AIDS to militant
animal-rights activists to the fine art of body decoration. At
Spin, cocky irreverence and social relevance have always made for a
tasty cocktail, shaken and stirred.
</P>
<P>
   What has made Spin so good is evident in the February issue,
perhaps the last with Hirschorn and Marks at the top of the
masthead. Chris Norris hangs with Offspring, the Orange County
hard-core vets who breezed into the mainstream during that neo-punk
minute of the mid-1990s, disappeared quicker than you could say
``You gotta keep 'em separated,'' and came roaring back with the
quirky, annoying dis of gangsta-trippin' wannabes, ``Pretty Fly
(For a White Guy).'' At a time when rock stalwarts from Smashing
Pumpkins to Hole have had a tough time making a dent in a world
dominated by frothy pop and hip-hop, they are, in Norris's words,
``four 30-ish guys in bowling shirts with their fingers on the
pulse of young America.'' With their songs about bad love, loony
girlfriends, lousy roommates, and the trailer-trash culture of
Jerry Springer, the Offspring voice ``the cry of the alienated
white dude and _ to a sizable demographic _ it rocks.'' Just like
the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, great. Michelangelo Signorile is gone from the pages of Out,
but here comes Dan Savage to rant, rave, and save our gay souls.
He's on the warpath about those he tags as ``ACCs'' _ adult closet
cases _ in his essay, ``Too Chicken to Come Out.'' He takes to task
those who still aren't out to their friends, families, workers, and
have the audacity to whine about their predicament. Know this:
Savage does not feel their pain. ``If you don't have the guts to
come out, well, that's your right, cupcake. But if you're going to
be closeted and live a life devoid of integrity, shut up about how
miserable you are. Your wounds are self-inflicted, and your excuses
_ such as they are _ underwhelm.'' Ouch. A bit shrill, perhaps, but
Savage's savaging of closeted gays and lesbians does make some
salient points.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out is, of course, a gay issue, although this month's
cover girl, the inexplicably popular indie doll Parker Posey, is
not a gay actress. But she makes the obligatory ``some of my best
friends are gay'' comment to quell those who wonder why Out insists
on featuring straight folks on their covers. Says Posey, ``I just
find a lot of strength in gay people because they've had to deal
with something.'' Yeah, like not being able to get on the covers of
gay magazines.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Peter Lynch was shooting Fidelity Investments' new
advertising campaign last August, a bout of back pain threatened to
wreck a scene requiring the legendary stockpicker to jog on a
treadmill. Anxious executives on a tight filming schedule wondered
if a double could be used. But replicating Lynch's trademark
cumulus of snow-white hair proved impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closest match found was from a yak,'' a person involved in
the episode says in dead seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   In pain, the mutual fund icon soldiered on.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch's uniqueness, of course, extends far beyond his Warholian
mop and avuncular investment advice, both on full display to
investors in television and print ads. In 13 years as skipper of
Fidelity's Magellan fund, Lynch racked up singularly spectacular
returns and earned a place among the capitalist gods. Now Fidelity,
the nation's largest fund firm, wants that Midas touch again, this
time to lure back fickle investors.
</P>
<P>
   As he dispenses homespun adages and puts a human face on a
byzantine institution, Lynch has become the poster boy for a
democracy of investors, the pied piper of the personal portfolio.
He is equally significant to Boston-based Fidelity, which he never
really left after quitting Magellan in 1990 at the height of his
success. Now Fidelity has embraced its favorite son as the ultimate
emblem of the firm. In the shift from star stock picker to media
star, is Fidelity remaking Lynch, or is Lynch reshaping Fidelity?
</P>
<P>
   Fifty five-year-old Lynch, of course, has long since ceased
managing mutual funds. These days, as vice chairman of Fidelity, he
functions as sage in residence to whom future fund managers can
turn for advice. Every two months, he meets individually with 10 or
so rookie research analysts and discusses matters such as how to
explain a good idea to a busy portfolio manager. He has no fund
managers under his tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an important sounding board for me,'' says Fidelity
investment chief Robert C. Pozen, who sought out Lynch when he
reorganized the company's research team two years ago and drew up
new fund performance standards. Pozen says he talks to Lynch
several times a month.
</P>
<P>
   Operating out of his office at Fidelity, a semi-retired Lynch
spends as much time fundraising for 16 nonprofit organizations,
including the Archdiocese of Boston, as he does on Fidelity
business. ``Basically, I'm a beggar,'' he says. He also sits on
nine investment committees, including the Museum of Fine Arts and
Boston College, his alma mater, helping to plan their financial
futures.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch is also helping Fidelity mind its own coffers. Following a
period of spotty performance in the mid-1990s, Fidelity has
struggled to expand its market share. Sales last year slowed
considerably, due to a lingering tarnished image and the rise of
the Lynch antithesis, the no-brainer index fund. The $5.3 trillion
fund industry, pioneered in Boston in the 1920s, will only grow
more competitive, and Fidelity cannot rest on old laurels if it is
to thrive and grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign is an opportunity for Peter to espouse all the
ideas he has had over these years,'' explains Bruce Johnstone, a
managing director at Fidelity Investments and longtime Lynch
friend. ``Peter is the company in those ads.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a wintry day, Lynch is nestled in his cluttered office at 27
State Street, in a Fidelity building in Boston dubbed The Tower _ a
reference to the medieval edifice in London where the fallen from
grace were sent before exile or worse. The symbolism is ironic, of
course: Lynch, hardly out of favor, holds around 6 percent of
Fidelity, a stake worth up to $1 billion, according to insiders.
</P>
<P>
   He is, by most accounts, ignorant of corporate statecraft, a
``completely apolitical person who couldn't give a hoot about
company politics and is nothing like a bureaucrat,'' one close
associate says.
</P>
<P>
   In his cramped space, which resembles a professor's den, a black
toy cow wearing beads bestrides a bookcase. A giant yellow wooden
pencil stands in one corner. Under his desk, a white tote bag with
green piping bespeaks staid Boston, not flashy New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dark suit and brown shoes, Lynch had stuck yellow
notes on shelves reminding himself to get vaccinations for an
African safari. Scores of pictures of Caroline, his wife of 30
years, and three grown daughters (Elizabeth bears the middle name
Peter) line the walls. A note from Pope John Paul II thanks Lynch,
a devout Roman Catholic who has been known to carry rosary beads in
his pocket, for his substantial charity work.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch doesn't like to talk about the advertising campaign, whose
artistic merits have been panned since its launch in September. But
he admits the message of the pitch, which centers on his populist
investing wisdom, was his idea. (Casting co-stars Don Rickles and
Lily Tomlin was not.) The two comedians have not struck a chord
with viewers, some of whom saw little humor when the ads aired
during last year's market meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to use Fidelity's best-known asset as spokesman _ a
radical shift for a firm that long eschewed a personality cult _
came from the company's marketing guru, Stephen Cone. While the
company credits the campaign for boosting visits to its Web site,
direct sales of mutual funds to investors have not yet taken off.
Sales via brokerages, however, have grown, Cone says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Lynch embodies Fidelity's external persona, does he occupy
center stage inside the firm, too?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he is in the inner circle, joining chairman and chief
executive Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson 3rd and Pozen as an in-house
trustee, and sitting on Fidelity's powerful policy-setting
investment committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Lynch is not a stage director at the fund behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of overall corporate strategy,'' Pozen says, ``I
don't think Peter has played any real role in this.'' As the
family-run firm prepares eventually to pass the reins of control to
Johnson's 37-year-old daughter Abigail, Lynch is unlikely to rise.

 UNDATED: ... to rise.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That suits him just fine. Asked if he would ever have a more
senior position at Fidelity, Lynch says, ``Doubt it, doubt it,
doubt it. I think this is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch is neither a lieutenant-in-waiting to Abigail, who
overseas Fidelity's analysts (a position Lynch held earlier this
decade), nor the power behind the throne. A minister without
portfolio, Lynch says he talks to Ned Johnson ``as much as I did
when I ran Magellan, which is not very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Others echo that degree of separation. ``You don't want Peter
Lynch trying to run Fidelity,'' one top Fidelity executive says.
``He never ran anything but funds. And that is where his magic
is.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Lynch's investing record is held in awe _ in his
hands, Magellan grew a stunning average 29.2 percent a year and
attracted a flood of new cash _ not everybody at Fidelity likes the
long shadow of the Magellan yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   Some even suggest that Lynch has become something of a dinosaur
in a dynamic industry. ``Once you stop managing money, it flips
into the world of wisdom, not application,'' says a source close to
Fidelity fund managers. ``But the money managers want application,
not wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   With his swing-for-the-fences investment bets, workaholic Lynch
helped create a risk-taking culture at Fidelity during the 1980s
that scored big for investors. His love was growth stocks, or
mostly small to mid-size companies likely to boost earnings
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine years since Lynch quit Fidelity's flagship fund, the
company and the markets have changed, with both now favoring large,
mainstream stocks, not the quirky, overlooked companies Lynch so
loved. With gigantic funds, Fidelity no longer makes huge, wild
wagers on individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is irony in Fidelity using the world's most
celebrated stock picker as its pitchman. ``Peter was a cowboy
investor, so in that sense, Fidelity has really remade themselves
from that old Peter Lynch mold,'' says Russell J. Kinnel, equity
funds editor at Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With $753 billion in total assets, the Fidelity of today no
longer relies on a single investment genius like Lynch to set the
tone. After fund manager defections and sinking returns in the
mid-1990s, Pozen shook up part of the Lynch legacy by better
organizing and evaluating managers and then leaving them alone to
do their own thing. Since then, Fidelity's returns have improved.
Last year, they were among the best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Sitll, Lynch is ``disgusted with the whole market trend,'' said
one Boston investor who knows him, referring to Wall Street's focus
on only the biggest of the blue chips that fill up index funds.
``He likes adventurism and people who do creative stock picking.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lynch's modus operandi _ rigorous, bottoms-up
analysis of companies, rather than top-down assessment of
macroeconomic trends _ remains deeply ingrained in Fidelity's
culture. When Pozen beefed up the research unit to intensify
company and sector analysis, he was expanding Lynch's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch won't discuss his own portfolio, his stockpicking ideas
haven't changed. ``I like the stocks that have been beaten down and
then turn. Just buying big stocks doesn't work. You have to buy big
stocks where the fundamentals are better'' than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Would he join in Internet mania, paying sky-high prices for
shares in as yet unprofitable companies? Lynch didn't buy many
technology shares in his Magellan days. The reason, colleagues say,
is that he doesn't like to buy a stock in a company whose products
he doesn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Despite working for a firm that spends billions on technology,
Lynch is a bit of a techno-klutz, associates and friends say. Early
in his marriage, he couldn't work the microwave. Later, he was
shocked to see Fidelity staffers fax, rather than hand deliver,
materials from 82 Devonshire, the main office, to 100 Summer
Street, a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter Simon Lynch was born in 1944 in Boston and raised in
nearby suburb Newton. His father died when he was 10 and he grew up
in modest circumstances, making pocket money caddying a top
Fidelity executive's golf clubs at West Newton's Braeburn Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Boston College on a caddying scholarship, graduating
in 1965 and working at Fidelity for the summer before entering the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, where in
1968 he finished near the top of his class. Then he was called to
serve in the US Army as a lieutenant, lucking out by landing in
South Korea, not Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He formally joined Fidelity as a research analyst in 1969. He
has never worked anywhere but Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Amiable but cool, Lynch can be impatient. He famously entered
analysts' meetings in the 1970s with an egg timer, giving young
staffers exactly three minutes to pitch a stock. In Korea, he
played pick-up basketball in stiff leather boots so as not to waste
time changing shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Family is important to Lynch, who quit Magellan to spend more
time with his own. Now he lives in the seaside community of
Marblehead in a Bauhaus-style residence filled with antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his vacation time (he took 98 days last year) is spent
at his 18th-century Georgian country manor in Ireland, his
ancestral land. After buying the farmhouse, Lynch suggested to the
sellers that they live in the guest quarters. At a recent gathering
of investment-world friends at the estate, Lynch invited the
previous owners to the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   While seemingly down-to-earth, Lynch is not simple.
</P>
<P>
   He is known as the world's greatest stock picker, yet his ads
(and the three books he has authored) create the impression almost
anyone could do it. A market animal who holds reams of numbers in
his head, he was a market heretic when he preached the virtues of
the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He is guarded in public but adores the limelight. Friends
describe him as a creative thinker, yet he often recites trademark
sayings (``I always say, if we didn't have the 10 Commandments,
you'd have to get the U.N. to invent them'' is one).
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is phasing out the Rickles and Tomlin ads in favor of
unscripted spots of Lynch discussing his stock-picking philosophy
with Fidelity staffers. The company says it will use the Lynch
campaign at least until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Lynch's next act?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done it all,'' he says. ``I've done all I want to do.''

UNITED EUROPE VIEWED BY SOME BRITONS AS NOT QUITE THE THING  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sitting in the bar of the venerable Oxford &AMP; Cambridge
Club on Pall Mall, surrounded by dark wood and old money, Sir Roy
Denman would appear to be the kind of Englishman who still mourns
the loss of empire.
</P>
<P>
   But Sir Roy is a rare breed: a knighted Briton who is an
unabashed, enthusiastic European.
</P>
<P>
   As the European Commission's former representative to
Washington, he has been embarrassed by the dismissive attitude
toward Europe held by many of his compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude is, `We won the war for this? What the Germans
couldn't win in the war, we're going to give away to them in the
name of European integration?' Europe is a concept that,
unfortunately, escapes most British people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The British have long been the most reluctant of Europeans.
Their opposition to monetary union is but the most recent example
of this reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   The smooth launch of the euro, the single currency used in 11 of
the European Union's 15 nations, has softened resistance to it in
Sweden and Denmark, two of the three countries that chose not to
join. (Greece wanted to join but did not qualify.) The new
willingness of Sweden and Denmark to reconsider participating in
the single currency underscores just how isolated the British are.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the euro has actually fallen in Britain, where a
skeptical public has been bombarded by relentless anti-European
rhetoric from politicians and media commentators. They warn of
massive unemployment and the inability of Britain to make economic
adjustments should it join the other 11 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Recent speeches by the Danish and Swedish prime ministers
suggesting they would join the single currency as soon as possible
were well received in those countries. But British Prime Minister
Tony Blair's attempts to do the same are often met by derision
here, especially in the newspapers and television stations owned by
media baron Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show strong support for the euro among British business
people. But fervent opposition to it and nearly every other aspect
of European integration in many of the newspapers owned by Murdoch,
who controls 40 percent of the British media market, blunts Blair's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest establishment newspapers, the Daily Mail, the
largest ``serious'' tabloid, and the Daily Telegraph, the largest
broadsheet, also oppose the euro and make no effort to keep their
editorial position from influencing news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But historians say it is simplistic to attribute most of the
current opposition to the euro to Murdoch and others who
legitimately fear it will hurt their business interests. Instead,
historians maintain that this bout of Europhobia is the latest
example of the cultural and political ambivalence among the British
about the very idea of a united Europe and their participation in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Some try to portray anti-Europeanism here along a
liberal-conservative divide. But Hugo Young, author of the recently
published book, ``This Blessed Plot: Britain and Europe from
Churchill to Blair,'' says both the Conservatives and Labor Party
have been stridently anti-Europe when it suits them.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century ago, Winston Churchill articulated the idea of a
united Europe. Today, Blair says he too wants to bring Britain
further into Europe. Both Churchill and Blair, Young contends,
``were spectators rather than actors in a continental drama from
which Britain, the island nation, chose to exclude herself.''
</P>
<P>
   The venerable island-nation theory holds that the British view
themselves apart from the continent, physically and
psychologically. As Young puts it, ``The island people were not
only different but, mercifully, separate, housed behind their moat.
They were also inestimably superior.''
</P>
<P>
   This sense of superiority was encapsulated in a British
government memorandum, published in 1949, that argued against
building a channel tunnel linking Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   ``An important element in the character of our national life
would be altered by the creation of a land connection,'' the memo
concluded. ``One effect might for example be the weakening of that
unquestioning sense of superiority over the peoples of the
Continent which forms an essential element of British
self-confidence and which has proved its value in recent times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph recently reproduced that memo as part of its
steady diet of anti-European stories.
</P>
<P>
   Young argues that this sense of superiority remains largely
undiminished by time or the fact that Britain lags behind many
European countries in standard of living and educational
achievement levels. Young believes Britain has been unable to come
to terms with losing its empire. As he observes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging on to the past, in the form of the post-imperial
Commonwealth, seemed for a time to be the answer. Remaining
constant to the Anglo-American relationship . . . was apparently
another necessity, which would be fatally compromised by the lure
of something called the European Community.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the rest of Europe enthusiastically endorsed the
union concept, Young says that the idea was regarded as a blow to
the British national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Denman added that it is understandable why the British are less
prepared to sacrifice national sovereignty than the French,
Germans, Belgians and others in the name of a united Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just because Britain is an island,'' he said.
``Indeed, Ireland is an island and the Irish are the most
enthusiastic of Europeans. The difference is we've never had a
revolution. We've never experienced occupation. We've been bombed.
But we haven't been conquered, and that's a critical difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Xenophobia also explains part of British anti-Europeanism. The
Sun, a Murdoch tabloid, recently ran a front-page picture of Oskar
Lafontaine, the German finance minister, with a headline
proclaiming him ``The Most Dangerous Man in Europe.'' Ostensibly,
the headline impugned Lafontaine's socialist agenda. But it also
articulated a subtle prejudice held by many here: that inside every
German lurks a potential extremist.
</P>
<P>
   That such animosities exist within generations that endured Nazi
bombs and lost so many people in two World Wars prosecuted by the
Germans is not unusual. But it is striking how many people who were
born after World War II hold the same views. Such dated prejudices
are less pervasive on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Other EU partners, especially the Germans and the French, who
have been the driving forces behind integration, are becoming
increasingly impatient with the British position. As the German
newspaper, Bild Zeitung, observed recently, ``While we were toiling
away on making the euro, the British in their fine pinstripes did
not want to get their hands dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Brussels, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the European
commissioner in charge of monetary policy, said Britain is deluding
itself if it thinks that refusing to join the single currency will
protect its monetary independence.
</P>
<P>
   Denman agreed, adding that British foreign policy since World
War II has been built on two illusions: that Britain could be an
influential leader in Europe by remaining outside it, and that
Britain's interest is always best served by adopting the position
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Denman said that Blair could increase British influence by
bringing Britain further into the European Union. In doing so, he
would become the linchpin securing Washington to continental
Europe. ``Right now, Britain is seen in the rest of Europe as
America's poodle,'' said Denman. ``It's not a flattering image.''

FEARS FACTOR MAY SERVE GLENN WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Some dream of a white Christmas. Ivan Fears
dreams of an Antonio Freeman-Terry Glenn 1-2 punch.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad dream to have. A lofty one for the Patriots' new
receivers coach? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman is the prize receiver in free agency, but it doesn't
appear that the Patriots would lay out the $6 million or so per
year it would take to get him.
</P>
<P>
   So Fears's biggest job is to find a way to keep Glenn on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   While Fears didn't mention it at his press briefing Tuesday, the
Patriots plan to restrict Glenn's in-season practice time _ mostly
his post routes _ in an effort to preserve his hamstrings, which
Glenn has injured in each of his three years in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate concern is Glenn's recovery from a broken
right ankle. He is due in town soon for a reexamination and will be
in a cast until late this month. Then he'll need some time to
recuperate. The good part is Glenn will spend a lot of time in
Foxborough to rehabilitate the ankle and therefore will take part
in the team's offseason conditioning program and likely will be
around for more than the 25 (of 40) workouts he attended last
season.
</P>
<P>
   That number is deceiving, because Glenn worked out on his own in
Columbus, Ohio, and also attended Cris Carter's receivers camp in
Orlando last spring. He came to training camp in superb shape. And
still got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to have our thumb on him the whole year long,'' said
Fears. ``But maybe it's better for him to get away for a while as
long as he's ready to come here and play and make things happen
that he makes happen. I think he's done a good job of getting that
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury thing is something that's going to happen. I don't
think there's any indication that Terry is too old or too whatever
or wore out, whatever it may be. There are things that happen to
guys. Curtis Conway has had a lot of injuries. Isaac Bruce, he's
missed a lot of playing time. Jerry Rice. It happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The most refreshing thing Fears said is that offseason
conditioning programs don't prevent players from breaking ankles.
He doesn't think they prevent recurring hamstring pulls, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many speed guys do you know that don't have hamstring
pulls?'' he said. ``You're talking about fast guys. It's one of the
things that come with being a fast guy. Terry is not just fast,
he's strong. He's 5-11, 200 pounds, and he has exceptional speed.
And those guys, when they're turning on that speed, occasionally
will have problems with their hamstrings.''
</P>
<P>
   So why does Glenn have so many problems and Shawn Jefferson,
also a fast guy, doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' said Fears. ``You look at the play
between Shawn Jefferson and Terry Glenn . . . I'll let you answer
that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn is a sudden player. When you're making those sudden
moves, those things happen. I'm not going to tell him to slow down
and not make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears hasn't met Glenn yet. He plans to sit down with him and
ask specific questions about his goals. And then Fears will tell
him what he thinks. He's not shy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the reason the Patriots hired Fears is that he's very
direct and tough. Fears calls himself demanding. He understands
that Glenn is a special talent and calls him his No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go all the way to the Super Bowl with Terry,'' said
Fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put him in a bubble and keep him there until
Sunday. We're going to be smart about it. We're not going to lose
him in practice, though, but we're going to make sure he's prepared
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there are things Fears can't say because he hasn't
talked to Glenn yet. But he was brought in as a motivator. He has
been known to instill, well, fear, into some players. And just how
he does that and how Glenn responds might make for the best
entertainment of next season.

IF MERCER ISN'T WALKING, THEN CELTICS WON'T RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The first thing you have to do is see the man walk.
This is important stuff. You will never understand how incredibly
hip Ron Mercer is until you study his gait.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not actually a gait. It's a strut. It's a smooth
stroll that gives you a sudden hiccup, just to see if you're paying
attention. It almost reminds you of Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder
in ``Stir Crazy.'' But those were exaggerated cool steps. Mercer
does not overindulge in the reservoir of cool. He's a natural.
Nothing forced. Maybe years ago in Nashville, his hometown, he
stole that walk from his father, uncle, or cousin because he
thought it looked good. That's OK. It now appears to be an
original. As you know by now, the way Mercer walks is already a
conversation piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a normal walk for me, but people look at me all the time
and ask me if something is wrong with my foot or if something is
wrong with my ankle,'' he said Tuesday. ``It's just the way I
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you happened to see Mercer walking into New England
Baptist Hospital, you witnessed the tremendously cool
trot-in-slow-motion of which we speak.
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, (Monday) was a limp,'' he said. ``It was just a big
limp.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who wonder what exactly is up with the 22-year-old
Celtics guard's walk would have had an argument Monday. Something
wrong with a foot? No. Something wrong with an ankle? No. Something
wrong with the right knee? Very. Something wrong with the Celtics?
Certainly.
</P>
<P>
   When Mercer fell on teammate Bruce Bowen during Monday's
practice at Brandeis University in Waltham and sprained his medial
collateral ligament, he changed his day and the day of, oh, several
thousand people. As twisted as it sounds, you know you've arrived
as a beloved New England athlete when strangers fret about your
sore feet (Larry Bird), fractured finger (Drew Bledsoe), and ailing
hip (Cam Neely). And you know they like you when they notice your
walk and wonder about your sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of walking toward his car to go home Monday, Mercer
limped toward another car that would take him to the hospital for
an MRI. We can't confirm this, but during that time, we believe
that Rick Pitino was in an intense prayer session, pleading for a
sprain rather than a tear (``When I found out it was a strain, I
was very happy,'' Pitino said). The coach tried to remain calm when
initially talking about the injury, but you know he was a wreck
when all the cameras were turned off and all the people with
notepads had gone away.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget the fans. A man from Albany, N.Y., called
me at 11 p.m. Monday saying he wouldn't be able to sleep until I
told him Mercer was OK. (My first thought: Yo, man. Who do you
think I am, Trapper John, M.D.? Second thought: Keep this guy on
the line as long as possible, withholding information until he
falls asleep. Third thought: Try Nyquil. Final thought, an imagined
dialogue with spouse/girlfriend: ``Sweetheart, I'm just really
distracted right now. I can't stop thinking about Ron Mercer . . .
'')
</P>
<P>
   The fan from Albany may be more passionate than most, but at
least he understands something that should be clear to everyone: No
Mercer for a month translates to no fun for the Celtics. Pitino
said Tuesday that the 6-foot-7-inch Mercer could be missing
anywhere from two games to a month. Mercer was more optimistic. He
said he will test his knee Thursday and then determine his status
for Friday's opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of time between now and Friday,'' he said.
``I'm going to try and shoot for Friday and Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   It also shouldn't surprise you that Mercer said he will not
force anything. If he's ready, he'll play. If not? ``I'd rather
miss two games than the whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are predicting 25, 26, or even 30 wins for the Celtics in
this 50-game season, you had better hope you see Mercer on the
parquet wearing shorts that have a Celtics logo rather than pants
that have a fashion designer's logo. As much as this team needs
Antoine Walker, Kenny Anderson, and Paul Pierce, it cannot survive
without Mercer. That is not a criticism of the men who will sub for
him when, or if, he can't play. Fact is, not many pro shooting
guards do what Mercer does. And in a few years, you may not be able
to find five guys like him.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan (a mean walker himself) is officially retired. So
take a look at the remaining top shooting guards in the NBA.
There's Mitch Richmond, who will be 34 in June. There's Reggie
Miller, who will be 34 in August. After them? You could include
Eddie Jones, Latrell Sprewell on his best days, Michael Finley, and
Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Players like Mercer are rare. That's why the Celtics will sit
down this summer and sign him to a long contract extension. That's
why the Denver Nuggets sat down last summer and popped themselves
upside the head for not drafting Mercer in 1997. That's why the
Celtics had Mercer at Brandeis at 10:30 Tuesday morning, icing and
massaging his knee, hoping that will be enough to get him back on
the court in time to face the Raptors Friday. Or, at least, in time
for their games in Florida Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics don't want him to rush back. Seeing The Walk will be
convincing enough.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Has David D'Alessandro gone too far this time?
</P>
<P>
   Not far enough, if you listen for long to the guy who won't let
up on the International Olympic Committee and ``the code of
secrecy'' that surrounds it. ``There are a lot of guys trying to
preserve their jobs right now,'' says the president of John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The always-quotable D'Alessandro has been everywhere as the
pay-to-play scandal has built into the greatest embarrassment in
Olympic history. He's been all over the TV networks, in The Wall
Street Journal and The New York Times, and on and on. Always, he's
been the noisy and insistent voice for full disclosure of the IOC's
modus operandi.
</P>
<P>
   It only looks like a campaign, D'Alessandro tells me. He's
turned down 200 interview requests in the last few weeks, including
one from ``60 Minutes.'' ``I am not interested in a campaign. I am
interested in sending a clear message through some media that the
sponsors do have leverage here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the sponsors _ Hancock is one of 11 worldwide _ have
appreciated the messenger. Two weeks ago, for instance, anyone who
is anyone among Olympic sponsors was at the Reebok Club in
Manhattan for the premiere of a film on the Nagano Games. In
conversations with Hancock executives, McDonald's director of
global sports, Jackie Woodward, made it perfectly clear that she
didn't appreciate D'Alessandro's very public approach to the
problems. What was he trying to accomplish? she wanted to know.
Didn't he know he was making problems for the other sponsors? An
executive with United Parcel Service made similar remarks.
</P>
<P>
   A McDonald's spokeswoman, Bridget Coffing, says she was unaware
of what was said that day, but adds the company is pleased the IOC
is ``acting swiftly'' to address the problems. On Hancock's
position she adds: ``No sponsor represents the sponsor group.
Nobody represents us but McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   The only surprise here is that anyone should be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC in Lausanne, Switzerland, with its marbled walls and
fresco-lined rooms, is the ultimate club. Sponsors now pay $40
million every four years just to belong to The Club _ event
tickets, hotels rooms, media time, etc. are extra.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro was hardly born to The Club. He came to Boston and
Hancock 15 years ago as an ambitious PR man who didn't know how to
dress. He put himself on the map by rescuing the Boston Marathon
with Hancock's dough, and then put himself in position to run one
of the nation's largest insurers by slashing costs and improving
profits in one division after another.
</P>
<P>
   Shock of shocks, he has ruffled feathers getting there. He's
hardly loved among Hancock's career agents. In 1993 D'Alessandro
and his spokesman, Hancock chairman Stephen Brown, made more than a
few enemies in this town when they said making a bid to bring the
Olympics to Boston was a stupid idea. In 1996 D'Alessandro
criticized how Atlanta had commercialized the Games, and last year
he created a stir in Australia when he suggested sponsors should
sue the pants off Olympic organizers if they tried to play games
with the contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Running through all of his recent comments, D'Alessandro says,
is one goal: protecting the value of the five Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   There's evidence that he is getting results. He was the first to
publicly call for expanding the investigation beyond Salt Lake
City. His proposal for an ethics commission to oversee the process
is likely to happen. He wants a ``morals clause'' to give sponsors
an out, and financial disclosure for IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock is clearly trying to provide the leverage that
reform-minded Olympic executives like Dick Pound need to create
change. The betting here is that D'Alessandro has said nothing that
surprised these people or nothing _ almost nothing, anyway _ that
they have had a problem seeing in print.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro, after all, has bet a bundle on the Olympic rings,
in terms of Hancock's budget and his own career. He and the boys in
Lausanne are natural allies, not enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point he is hedging his bets, too: He's ordered the
rings off Hancock's annual report, which comes out in April.

GOING SHOPPING FOR HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the jobless rate lower than it has been in years and
skilled applicants hard to find, one recruiter has come up with a
novel idea: computerized ``Job Shop'' kiosks placed inside shopping
malls.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks, much like ATM machines, link job hunters to work
currently offered by clients of Adecco, a Swiss temporary
employment agency with US headquarters in Redwood City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Adecco is hoping its kiosks, now located in malls around the
country, will provide another source of skilled labor at a time
when national unemployment rates have remained at or below 5
percent, forcing US employers to devise more innovative ways to
attract job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the current tight labor market, we had to make an effort to
be creative and attract more people,'' said Adecco spokeswoman
Bonnie Olmsted. ``We put the kiosks in high traffic areas such as
malls, junior colleges, and universities. People can step up to it,
put in the information and, within five minutes, they can find out
if there is a job for them in their region.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four months, 500,000 people have activated 50
Adecco Job Shop computers by touching the screens. Of those, 30,000
have used the kiosk's computerized touch system to tap in their
resumes and apply for work. The company has placed about 2,000
people. The names of remaining applicants are kept in a national
job bank.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the tight labor market, US companies are either
scrambling for employees or keeping their own workers on the job
for longer hours to meet production goals and demands, say experts.
One Massachusetts economist, Barry Bluestone, believes the current
economy has led to a ``field of dreams'' labor market. In other
words, he says, employers who make their needs known shouldn't
worry because workers will come.
</P>
<P>
   But some employers say they cannot afford to wait. Faced with
vacancies they cannot fill, these companies are turning to
interactive computer, telephone, or Internet systems to attract,
prescreen, or select qualified applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In Waltham, Mass., for example, MTS Boston uses resumes gleaned
from Internet and non-Internet sources to match companies to
hard-to-find computer professionals. The company, which represents
about 200 Boston-area firms, has a spinoff called HotChili
Technology Inc. that manages resume databases for employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers receive these resumes from all kinds of sources,''
said Ian Grant, cofounder and principal at MTS Boston and HotChili.
``Some employers take an ad out in the newspaper and receive
resumes, others collect them at career fairs, or they receive
through direct mail or at open houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies pay between $6,000 to $8,500 per year to select an
unlimited number of applicants from MTS Boston over the course of a
year. ``If a company went to a headhunter, it would have to pay
between 20 or 30 percent of the first year's salary of a software
engineer,'' he said. ``That means the company would spend $10,000
to $15,000 just for that one person. If they hire a second person,
it would mean another $10,000 to $15,000. With us, they can hire an
unlimited number of people for up to $8,500.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Adecco, food service and retail firms are relying on
PC-based recruiting systems, computerized stations similar to the
new kiosks, or voice-activated telephone screening tools to capture
new applicants and slash hiring costs. Macy's, Wendy's, McDonald's,
Burger King, and Chili's Grill &AMP; Bar are all using these new hiring
and screening tools.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms have developed interactive employment centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than direct applicants to the personnel office, the
companies are sending applicants to personal computers,'' noted
Bill Parness, a spokeswoman for HREasy Inc., a North Carolina
company that designs telephone screening systems for retail
companies.
</P>
<P>
   One interactive screening program relies on timed answers to
analyze job applicants' responses to a series of questions designed
to gauge honesty, reliability, punctuality, and state of mind. The
new system screens out job applicants who respond too quickly or
too slowly to such questions as, ``I sometimes borrowed pencils,
paper, and other supplies from my prior boss,'' or ``Taking money
from the cash register is okay as long as you pay it back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this depends on the industry,'' said David Beck,
publisher of Recruiting Trends Newsletter in Fitzwilliam, N.H., a
division of Kennedy Information. ``Within the high-tech industry,
for example, there is a real scarcity of professionals and there is
greater use of the Internet as a hiring tool. Obviously, that is
becoming very big. Many of the human resources executives are on
line.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Beck said: ``These methods really supplement
traditional forms of recruiting and interviewing. They are not
replacements. On Long Island, for example, one recruiter was using
billboards because it was competing for scarce talent.
Traditionally, however, nothing replaces face-to-face contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Adecco's Olmsted agrees. ``For us, this is just one way to
attract people,'' she said. ``We also use Internet recruiting,
classified news, job fairs, and we see people face-to-face.''
</P>
<P>
   The company places 2.5 million people in jobs annually. Thus
far, its kiosks have been installed in part of the US and Europe,
and plans are under way to expand the kiosks' reach to include
Spain, Britain, Canada, and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Kiosks are in malls in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
California, Ohio, and several other states. Adecco franchises in
Rhode Island and New Hampshire are expected to install the machines
within the next three or four months. Kiosks will be installed in
Massachusetts some time this year.

JACOBS HAS HER EYE ON A RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last July Fourth, Regina Jacobs set an American record for 5,000
meters (14 minutes, 52.49 seconds) at the Maine Distance Festival
in Brunswick. The 35-year-old Californian must think New England
agrees with her: on Sunday, she'll be back, this time in search of
the US record indoors at 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I heard, it just rocks,'' said Jacobs of the oval at
the Reggie Lewis Track &AMP; Athletic Center, site of the New Balance
Invitational. ``I'm not discounting the record. It's definitely
strong. But it's also achievable, and I'm in the shape to break it
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The US record (8:40.45) is held by another woman who is fond of
New England: Lynn Jennings of Newmarket, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, a three-time Olympian at 1,500 meters, has had an
up-and-down career since graduating from Stanford in 1985, but the
last few years have certainly been more ``up'' than ``down,'' and
she is finally getting some of the recognition that had eluded her
for most of her career. After finishing a disappointing 10th in the
1,500-meter final in Atlanta, Jacobs ran well on the European track
circuit for the rest of that season before winning a silver medal
in the 1,500 at the 1997 World Outdoor Championships. She picked up
another another silver last summer in the mile at the Goodwill
Games in a personal best of 4:20.93, besides the 5,000 record.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a busy weekend for Jacobs, who like many of the other
athletes coming here will compete Friday in the Millrose Games in
New York City. ``My primary focus is Boston,'' said Jacobs. ``But
that certainly doesn't mean I won't be racing hard and strong'' in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   At Millrose, Jacobs will compete in the mile against longtime
rival Suzy Hamilton. It is no secret in the world of track and
field that the two women are not friends, and Jacobs' strategy
won't be made any easier by Hamilton's presence. ``When we get on
the line I want to beat her as much as she wants to beat me,'' said
Jacobs. ``It's not friends, kiss kiss, let's go out and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows we don't really like each other,'' said
Hamilton, who will run the 800 in Boston against, ironically, her
good friend and former Harvard star Meredith Rainey Valmon, who
finished second to Hamilton at the NCAA championships in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Hamilton in another race, there will be plenty at
stake for Jacobs in Boston: besides prestige, the US record will
bring a meet bonus of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. ``Tom could use a
car,'' Jacobs quipped of her husband and coach, Tom Craig. ``If you
see him yelling, like really screaming, you know he's thinking more
about the car than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's still more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm feeling really good,'' Jacobs said last week, ``I'm
going to go for the world record (8:33.82). I'll put that on the
line right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The meet begins at 2:30. Tickets are available by calling Global

   When USA Hockey announced its roster Tuesday for the 1999 US
Women's National Team that will compete in the 1999 World
Championships next month in Finland, there weren't many surprises.
But there certainly were two: Boston's Stephanie O'Sullivan, who
blasted US coach Ben Smith after he included her among the final
cuts for the 1998 Olympic roster, is among 12 forwards named to the
squad, which will again be coached by Smith. And one of the
goaltenders will be Erin Whitten, also one of Smith's last cuts.
Both have extensive international experience: this will be
Whitten's fourth world championships and O'Sullivan's third.
</P>
<P>
   Also named to the 20-player roster Tuesday were 11 Olympians:
defensemen Chris Bailey, Sue Merz, Tara Mounsey and Angela
Ruggiero, and forwards Alana Blahoski, Karyn Bye, Tricia Dunn,
Cammi Granato, Katie King, Shelley Looney and Jenny Schmidgall.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the squad are seven newcomers to the world
championships, including Laurie Belliveau of Manchester, Mass. and
Amy Coelho of North Truro, Mass., as well as Brandy Fisher, Sarah
Hood, Catherine Hanson, Natalie Darwitz and Krissy Wendell.

THE DEPARTMENT STORE THAT COULDN'T FIT A NEW BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The surprise is not so much that Simpson of Piccadilly,
the most traditional of London department stores, closed for good
Saturday (Jan. 30). The real surprise is that it lasted this long.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson's, as every Londoner calls it, is known to many
Americans because it was the inspiration for the 1970s British
sitcom ``Are You Being Served?,'' which has had an inexplicably
popular run on US public television over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from its place in TV trivia, Simpson's was a place
where tweedy men and horsey women bought traditional British
clothing since it opened in 1936. While kings and queens, princes
and princesses, dukes and earls and baronesses bought cashmere
scarves and tweed jackets there for more than 60 years, Simpson's
became a casualty to Cool Britannia and modern retailing.
</P>
<P>
   The store's parent company, DAKS Simpson, said it plans to sell
its products in smaller boutique shops. As the company put it when
announcing the store's closure, Simpson's was ``economically and
logistically unsuitable to use solely for the very focused retail
style and format that has been developed.''
</P>
<P>
   In plain English, that means the store was too big, and its
customers were dying off.
</P>
<P>
   Waterstone's, the book seller, is taking over the gorgeous,
seven-story building that graces Piccadilly. Londoners are still
voracious readers, but fewer of them dress like Princess Margaret
these days. While Simpson's billed itself as the biggest menswear
store in the world when it opened, Waterstone's says its new
flagship outlet will be the biggest bookstore in the world.
</P>
<P>
   By English standards, 63 years is not a long time. But by any
standard, Simpson's was an institution in London, a store whose
mere mention conjures images that one finds either warm and fuzzy
or ludicrously outdated.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a curious lack of sentimentality attached to its
closing, a deliberate marketing strategy by DAKS. The way the
company sees it, it is merely consolidating retail space. Aside
from the sale signs that cheekily suggest a ``Good Bye'' to be had
inside, there is a remarkable absence of emotion as yet one more
institution gives way to the steamroller that is Tony Blair's New
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Londoners ventured into the store last week as some
might to a wake, giving the dearly departed one last look over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember coming here as a child, at Christmastime, and it
was magic,'' said Shirley Evans, a retired teacher. ``We'd watch
`Are You Being Served?' and compare the characters to the sales
ladies and men there. It was good fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps explaining Simpson's demise better than any flow
chart, Evans left the store the other day empty handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are You Being Served?'' is still shown regularly on British
television. One of its creators, Jeremy Lloyd, worked as a salesman
at Simpson's some 50 years ago. By today's standards, the show's
characters are politically incorrect: a pompous World War II
veteran who insists on being called by his army rank of captain, a
lecherous manager and his bosomy secretary, a blousy loud-mouthed,
middle-aged saleslady who changes her hair color every day, a
limp-wristed lisping gay salesman.
</P>
<P>
   But Lloyd says the store and the characters it inspired were a
metaphor for Britain's quirky class system, where people are born
into social strata, where identity was formed by the harsh years of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   If the characters on ``Are You Being Served?'' are outrageous,
the real salespeople at Simpson's are polite and discreet. A
saleslady who sold an American visitor a scarf the other day talked
wistfully about the store, but politely declined to give her name,
saying, ``That wouldn't be right.''
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese company bought the store in 1991 and introduced
contemporary designer labels such as Armani in an attempt to lure a
new generation of shoppers. But like Kennedy's, the menswear shop
that died a retail death in downtown Boston years ago, Simpson's
was so inextricably linked with an older, tweedy generation that
the marketing strategy was doomed. People who can afford to shop at
Simpson's go to Harrods or Harvey Nichols instead.
</P>
<P>
   What killed Simpson's was not a lack of quality clothing. On the
contrary, its wares are among the finest in London. What killed
Simpson's is an adage older than the store itself: you don't shop
where your grandfather does.

CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FACE TOUGH LESSON: A TEACHER SHORTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: California, Massachusetts)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A critical shortage of teachers in California
has led to the first statewide advertising campaign to recruit
qualified applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 10 years, from 260,000 to 300,000 new teachers will
be needed, according to various estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a certain age to get my meaning, but we need to
treat the teacher shortage the same way we treated the need for
math and science education in the wake of Sputnik,'' said Mary
Burgan, president of the Oakland-based California Federation of
Teachers, representing about 50,000 teachers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The tag line for the $2 million ad campaign is, ``Change their
lives. Change yours. Teach.'' Targeted at high school and college
students entering the work force, as well as professionals
considering changing careers, the campaign hopes to fill positions
created by a burst of population, teacher retirement and the
mandate for smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   According to California Superintendent of Schools Delaine
Eastin, 37 percent of the current 250,000 public schoolteachers are
over 50 _ hired in the 1960s and early 1970s when there was another
bubble of population growth _ and are expected to retire in the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, within six years, California public schools will be
educating 6.5 million students _ 1 million more than today _ said
Nancy Brownell, interim director of the Institute for Education
Reform at the California State University system.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach-based institute administers the California Center
for Teaching Careers (CalTeach). CalTeach, which is sponsoring the
ad, is a one-stop teaching information, recruitment and referral
center.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot began airing last week and will be shown for
13 weeks on cable channels in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San
Diego, Sacramento, Fresno and Bakersfield. The state is paying for
the advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The ad features a young, energetic teacher who travels to school
by bicycle and leads a culturally diverse group of students in a
classroom science experiment. ``There's a place in California where
you can do something important with your life every day,'' a voice
says. ``The place is the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Early indications are the ad is working: Prior to its launch
last week, CalTeach was getting about 7,500 monthly visits on its
Web site (www.calteach.com) and now receives 43,000 per week,
Brownell said.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, particularly in expensive areas such as the
Silicon Valley, the rub for teachers has always been starting
salary _ $27,000 to $28,000 on average.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Pope, a former newspaper reporter and now a sixth-grade
teacher at Cabrillo Middle School in Santa Clara, said it was
difficult for schools to compete with electronics companies that
offer starting salaries greater than a 30-year veteran teacher
earns.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who opt for teaching, said Pope, do so for other
reasons. ``There are huge frustrations teaching,'' she said, ``but
huge rewards, too. You can see a lot of potential in kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is so acute that about 18,000 teachers lack the
credentials required but are working under emergency permits issued
by school districts _ particularly in Los Angeles and scattered
rural districts _ that do not have enough qualified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the state and the economy are requiring far higher
standards be met, said Bill Hauck, president of the
Sacramento-based California Business Roundtable, which advocates
education reform in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we have a technological society today, not
tomorrow,'' Hauck said. ``We are falling short of giving people
education to a level that is required for the work force they are
in today, much less tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states have teacher shortages as well, and California
increasingly must compete with them. This year, Massachusetts
officials are visiting 48 campuses across the country _ including
the University of California campuses at San Diego and Berkeley,
and Stanford University _ to interview prospective teachers. In
March, 50 will be selected and will get $20,000 signing bonuses
paid over four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the 50 best people we can get,'' said Mieka Freund,
who manages the recruiting program at the Massachusetts Department
of Education. ``We want people excited about teaching and about
teaching in Massachusetts.''

 &HT;    BUDGET PROPOSES DEMOLISHING HATED TOWER AT GETTYSBURG
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's proposed federal budget
provides funding to tear down a tower for tourists that has
outraged Civil War buffs since it was built one score and seven
years ago near the very spot where Abraham Lincoln delivered his
Gettysburg Address in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   The privately owned, 310-foot tower looms over the historic
battlefield and can be seen for miles around. Preservationists have
regarded the structure as an anachronistic eyesore since it was
erected in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better symbol for the need to preserve the
Gettysburg battlefield than taking down this tower,'' said Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt. ``Until this initiative, the park has not
had the funding.''
</P>
<P>
   In the budget submitted to Congress this week, a $1 billion
Lands Legacy Initiative contains $5.7 million for the Gettysburg
National Military Park to purchase the tower from its private
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The tower was built as a tourist attraction next to the
federally protected parkland. However, in 1990 the federal
boundaries were expanded to include more of the actual battlefield.
Since then, removal of the tower has been a high priority for both
the National Park Service and private preservationists, who have
often differed on other issues regarding the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one thing that there's been the most agreement
on,'' said Katie Lawhon, a spokeswoman for the National Park
Service in Gettysburg. ``The tower has been controversial since its
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It never should have been built in the first place,'' agreed
Jerry Russell, chairman of the Civil War Roundtable Associates,
based in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress must approve the budget before the tower can
be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to sit tight,'' said Lawhon. ``We are interested
in negotiating with the owners'' even before congressional approval
of the funding, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations may prove ``problematic,'' said Irwin
Aronson, the attorney for the tower's owner, Baltimore businessman
Thomas Ottenstein.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Park Service authorized an appraisal that valued
the tower at $6.6 million, Aronson recalled. By now budgeting $5.7
million to buy the tower for demolition, he said, the Park Service
appears to be ``trying to manipulate the outcome'' of any
subsequent appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a garish piece of tourist-trap junk,'' Aronson
said. ``It happens to be tall. It is a tower'' that provides ``an
educational experience'' to legions of tourists who visit it for an
overall view of the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service _ in a controversial public-private partnership
with a commercial developer _ aims to build a new, $40 million
visitor center near the land where the tower is located, Aronson
noted. That should increase the value of his client's property, not
decrease it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawhon said only that a new appraisal would have to be completed
for the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the proposed new visitor center continues to divide
the historic preservation community. Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, has
called a hearing of the House subcommittee on national parks that
he chairs for Feb. 11 to question witnesses about his concerns with
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are against commercialization inside the boundaries of the
battlefield,'' said Russell, who is a leader in the opposition
movement.

THE RULE OF LAW VS. THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 7)   Commentary  
 (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a particularly frustrating juncture in the
Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton, chief House
prosecutor Henry Hyde exclaimed that ``despite all the polls and
all the hostile editorials, America is hungry for people who
believe in something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may disagree with us,'' the Illinois Republican told the
assembled senators, ``but we believe in something.''
</P>
<P>
   With those pungent words, the eloquent congressman from the
Chicago area cut to the heart of the dilemma that is so perplexing
to millions of Americans as well as those 13 Republican prosecutors
who have laid out the evidence that they believe should result in
the conviction of Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The ``rule of law,'' Hyde and his colleagues keep repeating,
should be the deciding factor in the case and they, of course,
believe the rule of law is on their side.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's defenders also have a potent argument. While
Clinton's behavior has been despicable, they contend, his crimes do
not constitute impeachable offenses because they have not posed a
threat to the government as did Richard Nixon's attempt to use the
CIA and FBI to cover up the Watergate break-in.
</P>
<P>
   This is a most unusual time in the life of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Should a charismatic leader who advocates popular programs and
presides over rollicking good times be ousted from office because
he has led a scandalous private life and sought through lies to
withhold details from the public?
</P>
<P>
   That is a question that ultimately must be answered by the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   We have had in this century several examples of great countries
being led to disaster by leaders who, despite their evil ways, held
the people in their thrall. Such was the case with Adolf Hitler in
Germany and Benito Mussolini in Italy, and more recently Saddam
Hussein in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, we have had presidents who lied publicly
about their activities and decisions while enjoying public
approval. Among them, in addition to Nixon, were Dwight Eisenhower,
when the Soviets shot down an American spy plane; John F. Kennedy,
when Cuban dissidents invaded the Bay of Pigs with U.S. approval;
Lyndon B. Johnson, when he committed ground troops to Vietnam; and
Ronald Reagan and George Bush in regard to the Iran-contra
shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   That some of his predecessors also lied to the people does not,
however, exonerate Clinton, who could have saved the government
millions of dollars and the country months of turmoil had he
admitted in January 1998 the true nature of his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told the senators: ``We're not delegates who are sent here
to weigh our mail every day and then to vote accordingly. Our work
here is not an ongoing plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are elected to bring our judgment, our experiences and our
consciences with us here. I have always believed that there are
issues of transcendent importance that you have to be willing to
lose your office over.''
</P>
<P>
   Among such issues, Hyde said, are abortion, which he flatly
opposes, a strong national defense, which he supports, and equal
justice under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, news reports last week from Hyde's
heavily-Republican Illinois district indicate that some of his
constituents have grown weary of the inquiry into Clinton's actions
and the attempt by Hyde and his GOP colleagues to remove the
president from office.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Chicago Tribune, Hyde is blamed by voters in
his district for prolonging the inquiry. That does not mean that
the congressman, who will be 75 in April, faces defeat if he seeks
a 14th term in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But it does mean that even many conservatives who don't support
Clinton personally are opposed to his removal from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde was right in contending that an elected official should be
prepared to sacrifice public office for issues of transcendent
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people were willing to sacrifice their lives in the
wars of the 20th century for such an issue: the preservation and
protection of this magnificent nation. And many did lose their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the rule of law should govern the conduct of the man
in the White House as it governs that of every other person. But
removing a president from office through the impeachment process is
an almost revolutionary undertaking that has not happened in the
210 years since the birth of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   If the polls are to be believed, the majority of Americans do
not consider Clinton's misdeeds serious enough to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde believes strongly in something and so do those who
want Clinton to be censured or reprimanded but not driven from
office. That is the strange dichotomy that bestrides the nation at
the end of the 20th century.

 &HT;    Fresh not always best: For authentic sauces, San Marzano is
primo
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At downtown's chic Mumbo Jumbo Cafe, chef Shaun Doty
proudly touts on the menu the San Marzano tomatoes he uses in a
pasta dish that also includes fresh sheep's-milk ricotta flown in
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that these tony tomatoes come out of a can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canned is not necessarily a bad thing,'' Doty says. ``A really
nice tuna in olive oil or a tin of foie gras can be wonderful.
Sometimes things resting in a jar can improve in flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of San Marzanos, then, as the foie gras of canned
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain flavor in the San Marzanos that says,
`That's a true tomato sauce,' '' Doty says of the unique, deep red,
pear-shaped plum tomato grown for hundreds of years in the
lava-rich soil near Mount Vesuvius south of Naples, Italy. ``It'll
take you to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   When cooking sauces, Italian cooks have never been ashamed to
use tomatoes from a can, which frequently yield a superior product
to fresh ones that are often of less than optimal ripeness. In her
glitzy coffee-table cookbook ``Lorenza's Antipasti,'' author
Lorenza De'Medici recommends using canned tomatoes year-round when
making basic red sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, which canned tomato.
</P>
<P>
   The experts aren't the only ones who recognize there are
differences. Home cooks, too, have gotten pickier.
</P>
<P>
   Every day at E. 48th Street Market in Dunwoody (Ga.), manager
Mark Fowler knows he'll get at least three callers desperately
seeking just one thing: those canned tomatoes from San Marzano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly popular,'' Fowler says. ``We've always had
people aware of it, but in the last year it's had a sudden rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Whole, peeled San Marzano tomatoes _ most often under brand
labels like La Bella San Marzano, La Valle and Bel Aria _ now
outsell all other canned brands at Fowler's Italian food market.
Nationally, sales of canned Bel Aria San Marzano tomatoes, packaged
for New Jersey's BelCanto Fancy Foods Ltd., jumped 60 percent in
1998, according to BelCanto sales associate Ari Ariel.
</P>
<P>
   Credit that surge to the burgeoning popularity of the
Mediterranean diet and the flood of Italian cookbooks and media
reports that have touted the virtues of Italy's various plum
tomatoes _ essential, the experts say, to replicating authentic
marinara sauce and other classic Italian fare.
</P>
<P>
   An article last year in Saveur magazine extolled the virtues of
San Marzanos in particular. Less sweet and less acidic than other
tomatoes, they have a near-perfect balance. The pulp is dense,
there are fewer seed pockets and less natural water than in
America-grown round tomatoes and its skin is easily removable.
</P>
<P>
   And famed cookbook author Marcella Hazan adds that because a San
Marzano has less liquid to boil down, it cooks faster, ``yielding
that fresh, clear flavor characteristic of so many Italian
sauces.''
</P>
<P>
   While San Marzano tomatoes can be found so far only in a few
specialty markets in larger U.S. cities, getting other first-rate,
canned Italian plum tomatoes half a world away here in America is
easier than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Atlanta in the '70s, I could find only one
store in Toco Hills that carried import products,'' says Camille
Sotis, owner of the Italian restaurants Camille's and San Gennaro
in Atlanta. ``That's all changed now.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite high tariffs that have doubled and even tripled the
costs of some imported Italian plum tomatoes, large supermarket
chains and outlets such as the DeKalb Farmers Market have been
selling a few brands of the canned products.
</P>
<P>
   Publix, for instance, carries whole, peeled canned Italian
tomatoes under the Cento label. Though still small, it's a brand
growing in popularity in America with more than $4.8 million in
sales in 1998 out of $468 million spent, mostly on U.S. supermarket
private labels and brands such as Hunt's and Del Monte.
</P>
<P>
   Cans aren't the only way to preserve those fresh tomato flavors.
Parmalat's imported Pomi, chopped tomatoes that are packaged in
aseptic boxes, is frequently found on shelves at A&AMP;P, Harris Teeter
and other chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting the purest taste of an Italian tomato you're
going to get,'' says author Carol Field, who touts Pomi tomatoes in
her cookbook ``In Nonna's Kitchen.'' ``They're just tomatoes in a
box. They also don't have the taste of the can.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you can't find imported tomatoes, some experts suggest
you try an organic domestic variety. Homestyle Italian food guru
Nancy Harmon Jenkins, author of 1998's ``Flavors of Tuscany''
cookbook, swears great Italian delicacies can be made with Muir
Glen, an organic, whole tomato grown and processed in California _
although the taste may not be exactly the same.
</P>
<P>
   Hazan advises cooks to buy whole, peeled plum tomatoes one can
at a time until they find a brand that suits their taste _ and
adheres to a few strict rules. ``There should be no pieces, no
sauce in the can, nothing but whole, firm-fleshed tomatoes, with a
little of their juice,'' she says. ``When cooked, there should be
depth to their flavor, a satisfying fruity quality that is not too
cloyingly sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   The lore of the trendy San Marzano tomato certainly fits Hazan's
description.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: It's a can-do tomato.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy canned San Marzano tomatoes at E. 48th Street
Market, 2462 Jett Ferry Road, Dunwoody , Ga.(770-392-1499) or by
mail order at Agata &AMP; Valentina, 1505 First Ave., New York, NY
10021 (212-452-0690) with a minimum order of six cans plus shipping
costs. A prepared sauce _ Rao's Homemade, from New York's renowned
Italian restaurant _ made with San Marzano tomatoes is available in
jars at Eatzi's Market &AMP; Bakery, 3221 Peachtree Road N.E., Atlanta
(404-237-2266). Both the puttanesca sauce and marinara sauce sell
for $9.99 for a 24-ounce jar.

 &HT;    Canned tomatoes are not only acceptable, they're preferable to
fresh
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these recipes, canned tomatoes are not only acceptable,
they're preferable to fresh. Use Italian plum tomatoes if you can;
organic American tomatoes are a nice substitute, but realize they
tend to be more watery and have more seeds, which you may wish to
remove first.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Spareribs With Tomatoes and Vegetables for Polenta
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 2 1/4 hours
</P>
<P>
   Marcella Hazan's substantial concoction from her ``Essentials of
Classic Italian Cooking'' (Knopf, $30) can also be made with mashed
potatoes in lieu of polenta. But, she says, ``the juices (the
spareribs) produce are exactly the kind that yearn for a plump
dollop of soft, hot polenta to sink into.''
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 pound rack of spareribs, cut in pieces
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup chopped carrot
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups chopped canned Italian plum tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Polenta or pasta, optional
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add spareribs and
brown on all sides, about 10 minutes, then drain on paper towels
and reserve. Remove all but 1 tablespoon oil from pan. Add onions,
carrots and celery and cook, stirring, until nearly tender, about 3
minutes. Add tomatoes and return spareribs to pan. Bring to a boil
and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook ribs about 2 hours
until meat is tender and begins to fall off bone. Watch the cooking
liquid; when it is low, add water during cook time. Serve with
polenta or pasta if desired.

   Veal Scaloppine With Eggplant and Tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 25
minutes
</P>
<P>
   In her cookbook ``The Mediterranean Kitchen'' (Morrow; $16),
Joyce Goldstein offers this Sicilian recipe with a sauce made of
canned tomatoes. She says you could serve this with rigatoni for a
very inauthentic but satisfying dish (Italians eat pasta as a
course in itself and usually do not pair an entree with pasta).
</P>
<P>
   2 medium eggplants, peeled and cut in 1/2-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil, divided, plus more if needed
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless veal loin, cut in 1/2-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup veal, beef or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons finely minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups tomato sauce (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   20 Nicoise or Kalamata olives, pitted and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup slivered fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Position oven rack 6 inches below heating element and preheat
broiler to 550 degrees. Place eggplant slices on cookie sheet and
brush both sides with about 4 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle with
salt and pepper. Broil for 5 minutes, then remove from oven and
keep warm. Place veal slices between sheets of plastic wrap and
pound to 1/4-inch thickness. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat
remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in large skillet over medium-high
heat. Add veal slices and brown on all sides, about 6 minutes,
working in batches and adding more oil if needed. Drain meat on
paper towels. Add stock to pan and scrape up any bits. Add garlic
and cook 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, olives and basil. Season
to taste with salt and pepper. Cook until heated through. Alternate
slices of veal and eggplant on dinner plates and drizzle with
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If serving pasta on the side, increase tomato sauce to
about 3 1/2 cups to have enough to cover pasta.

   Fillet of Halibut With a Savory Tomato Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Lidia Matticchio Bastianich's ``Lidia's Italian Table'' (Morrow,
$26) includes this scrumptious fish dish. While she says halibut is
not found in the Mediterranean, its Italian cousin _ the rombo
(which the French call turbot) _ is. They are in the same family of
flatfish.
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 celery ribs, diced
</P>
<P>
   6 garlic cloves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   1 28-ounce can peeled Italian plum tomatoes, crushed lightly and
passed through a food mill or coarse sieve
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup loosely packed minced fresh Italian parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds fresh spinach, tough stems removed, thoroughly
washed and drained
</P>
<P>
   Pinch crushed red pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 5-to-6-ounce pieces halibut, grouper or salmon fillet
</P>
<P>
   In a medium-size skillet, heat 5 tablespoons of the oil over
medium heat. Add the celery and 4 of the garlic cloves and cook,
stirring, until celery is wilted, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and
parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until sauce is lightly
thickened, about 10 minutes. Keep warm. Meanwhile, in a large
skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil over medium heat.
Add the remaining 2 garlic cloves and cook, stirring, until golden
brown, about 3 minutes. Add about half the spinach and the red
pepper and cook, tossing, until the spinach is wilted.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining spinach a handful at a time, adding more as
each handful in the skillet wilts. Cover the skillet and cook,
stirring occasionally, until the spinach is tender but still bright
green. The whole process should take about 5 minutes. Cover, set
aside and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Pat the fillets dry with paper towels. Season generously with
salt and pepper and coat with the remaining 1/4 cup oil.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high
heat. Add the fillets and cook, turning once, until well-browned on
both sides and barely opaque in the center, about 8 minutes. Drain
any oil from the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Drain any liquid from the spinach and divide the spinach among
six serving plates. Top with fillets. Remove the garlic cloves from
the tomato sauce and spoon the sauce over and around the fish.
Serve immediately.

   Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Stir in
onions, leeks, parsley and thyme. Lower heat and saute for about 5
minutes or until onions begin to brown. Add potatoes, carrots,
celery, zucchini, fava beans and peas _ one at a time _ sauteing
each for about 3 minutes. When all the vegetables are sauteed, stir
in tomatoes, broth and salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Lower heat
and simmer for about 1 hour, until soup is thick. Add cooked beans,
mashing some against the side of the stockpot with the back of a
spoon as you stir them in. Cook an additional 5 minutes. Remove
from heat and stir in basil. Serve sprinkled with Pecorino Romano
cheese.

   Using canned San Marzano tomatoes, we adapted our own marinara
recipe into a vibrant red sauce perfect for bow-tie pasta. The
proof came after the meal: We caught our kids in the kitchen
dunking big chunks of bread into the leftover sauce and happily
devouring it.
</P>
<P>
   5 to 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, diced
</P>
<P>
   1 medium white onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 35- or 36-ounce can whole Italian peeled plum tomatoes with
juice
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces concentrated tomatoes (paste)
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces water
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pinch granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   5 or 6 big sprigs fresh basil, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried farfalle pasta
</P>
<P>
   Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   Put 2 tablespoons olive oil in large saucepan and turn heat to
medium-high. Add garlic and saute. As garlic begins to turn pale
gold and garlic aroma starts to rise, put in chopped onion and
continue cooking until onion turns translucent.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-squeeze canned whole tomatoes into the saucepan or break up
tomatoes into meaty chunks with wooden spoon. Add concentrated
tomatoes and water. Stir until fully incorporated. After a minute
or so, salt and pepper to taste, then add pinch of sugar and stir
again. Then add chopped basil, at least 2 more tablespoons olive
oil and stir again until oil is fully incorporated. Reduce heat to
low and cook for at least 2 and up to 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Cook pasta in large pan according to package directions. When
pasta is al dente, drain and return to pan. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons
olive oil and toss. Add tomato sauce and stir until pasta is

 &HT;    Heavenly sites abound for `food of the gods'
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mmmmmmmmmm Choooooooc-laaaaate!!!, swoons Homer Simpson _ and
everybody on the planet can relate.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteenth-century Swedish naturalist Carolus Linneaus, who
created the modern system of naming all living things on Earth,
definitely made the connection when he named the tree from which
chocolate comes ``Cacao theobroma'' _ no less than ``food of the
gods.'' Indeed, the world has had an enduring passion for this
sweet confection for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   This is the season, of course, for chocolate lovers to openly
indulge their passion, and the Internet increases the pleasure by
offering total immersion to anyone surfing the thousands of
chocolate-related sites.
</P>
<P>
   There are chat rooms, histories, scholarly treatises and
chemical analyses, Q&AMP;A's and reviews. There are companies that will
duplicate anything (and we mean anything) in chocolate, there are
ongoing chocolate soap operas, chocolate poetry, and, naturally,
most all the sites contain an abundance of luscious recipes from
brownies to bombes.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a rundown of some chocolate addresses to get you
started.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start at the beginning with one of the best histories of
chocolate we ran across. ``This delightful tale ... draws upon
botany, archaeology, socioeconomics and culinary history to clear
up the ambiguities and misconceptions, presenting ... a complete
and accurate history of chocolate.'' See
http://www.wwnorton.com/thames/501693.htm.
</P>

   &QR;  Americans eat about 10 pounds of chocolate a year per capita,
the Swiss about 22.

<P>
   &QR;  Chocolate in a blue wrapper won't sell in Shanghai or Hong

 &HT;    Eggplant `crepes' a rare delicacy
 &HT;    By Marica Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because no one sent in a recipe, we flipped through some
cookbooks looking for eggplant pancakes with tomato-basil sauce, as
requested by R.J. Wholehan of Roswell (Ga.). Luckily, we found the
similar-sounding Eggplant ``Crepes'' Sorrento: slices of eggplant
wrapped around cheese filling and smothered with a tomato-basil
sauce. We hope it's the right idea.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Eggplant ``Crepes'' Sorrento
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings Preparation time: 1 hour Standing time:
overnight plus 30 minutes Cooking time: about 1 hour, 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 medium eggplants, cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick ovals
(about 6 to 7 slices per eggplant) Salt
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Mushroom-Cheese Filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup (about) dried mushrooms (preferably cepes), soaked in
1/2 cup warm water for 30 minutes (do not drain)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   12 or more ounces ricotta cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup each freshly grated Parmesan and Romano cheeses,
preferably imported (about 2 1/2 ounces each)
</P>
<P>
   3 green onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves or 3/4 teaspoon dried,
crumbled basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano or 1/8 teaspoon dried,
crumbled oregano
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon fresh mint leaves or 1/8 teaspoon dried, crumbled
mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   Tomato-Basil Sauce:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 large garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil leaves or generous 1/2
teaspoon dried, crumbled basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Generous pinch of dried oregano, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   3 cups (29-ounce can) tomato puree
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
</P>
<P>
   Place eggplant in a colander and sprinkle lightly with salt. Set
aside 30 minutes to drain. Rinse under running water; pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Brush large baking sheet with olive
oil. Lightly brush one side of eggplant slices with oil. Arrange
about one-fourth of the eggplant slices, oiled side down, on the
prepared baking sheet. Bake in batches until softened, about 5
minutes. (This can also be done on a baking sheet lined with oiled
aluminum foil; while one batch is baking, the next can be arranged
on another piece of foil.) If time allows, spread baked slices on
paper towels. Top with more paper towels, then weight with a heavy
chopping board. Let stand overnight to drain thoroughly and flatten
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mushroom-Cheese Filling: Heat olive oil in a large,
heavy, non-aluminum skillet over very low heat. Add onion, cover
and cook slowly to mellow flavor, about 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Increase heat to high, add fresh mushrooms and saute
until lightly browned. Add dried mushrooms with liquid and cook
until moisture has evaporated. Let cool. Season to taste with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine ricotta, Parmesan and Romano cheeses,
green onions, egg, basil, oregano and mint and beat well. Blend in
the cooled mushroom mixture. (Filling can be prepared one day ahead
and refrigerated.)
</P>
<P>
   For the Tomato-Basil Sauce: Heat olive oil in a large, heavy,
non-aluminum skillet over very low heat. Add onion, cover and cook
slowly to mellow flavor, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Uncover, increase heat to medium, add garlic, basil and oregano and
stir 30 seconds. Blend in tomato puree and tomato paste with salt
and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil. Let boil until thickened
slightly, about 5 minutes. (Sauce can be prepared up to two months
ahead and frozen.)
</P>
<P>
   Grease a shallow 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Spread about 1
tablespoon filling over each piece of eggplant, leaving a 1-inch
border at the wider end. Starting at the narrower end, roll
eggplant up, jellyroll style. Transfer to prepared baking dish.
(Can be prepared up to one day ahead to this point. Cover tightly
with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spread sauce over rolls. Sprinkle
with shredded cheese. Bake until sauce is bubbling and cheese
begins to color, about 30-45 minutes. Serve immediately. _ From
``More of the Best of Bon Appetit'' (Knapp, 1984)

   Requests
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Julie Driggers of Lawrenceville (Ga.) has two requests: ``I am
looking for a coconut layer cake that has coconut milk and sour
cream in the dough. It makes a real moist cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also there is a recipe for white icing I use to have ... that
tasted like whipped cream.'' It had whipped cream in it, along with
other ingredients, she said. ``I used to use it with a four-layer
blueberry cake I made with canned blueberries. I hope you can help
me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Elizabeth Ann Wright of Savannah (Ga.) asks for the recipe for
a sweet potato bread pudding with walnuts, old-fashioned bread and
cinnamon covered raisins. She'd also like information about
cookbooks featuring bread puddings.

 &HT;    How to choose cream of the crop
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The experts have sage advice on ways to ensure your canned
tomato is the best tomato it can be:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Why whole tomatoes over crushed or pureed ones? Whole tomatoes
guarantee higher quality, says Ari Ariel, sales associate of
BelCanto Fancy Foods Ltd. of New York. ``Chopped (and pureed) is
sometimes whatever is left over.'' Cookbook author Julia Della
Croce agrees that the quality of crushed tomatoes is sometimes
unreliable. But, she says, ``if you find a brand that is
consistently thick and chunky instead of watery and thin, with
good, sweet flavor and no sugar or other additives, stock up on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What about ``Italian Style''? Italian food maven Marcella
Hazan warns that the word ``style'' on can labels often means
Italian spices such as basil and oregano have been added to
non-Italian tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How significant is the single basil leaf added in some cans of
authentic Italian plum tomatoes? ``It's for the trash,'' Hazan
says. One basil leaf, she says, doesn't add a thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How do I judge quality in a canned tomato? ``It must, of
course, look red and healthy,'' Atlanta restaurateur Camille Sotis
says. ``If you open it up and see all this orange and yellow, the
tomatoes are less ripe.''
</P>
<P>
   Della Croce advises that the labels ``should list no additives
or sugar. Tomatoes should be meaty and whole, not flabby and
disintegrated. Fleshier tomatoes produce thicker sauces, with more
body than thin, watery ones. Nor should they be excessively seedy.
Their flavor should be full-bodied and sweet, not overly acidic.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Does price matter? ``You get what you pay for,'' says Mumbo
Jumbo chef Shaun Doty. ``I've seen people buy really cheap stuff
and get stems and unripe tomatoes in return.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How long can I keep an opened can of tomatoes? Tomatoes
oxidize rapidly and lose mineral value once exposed to air, Della
Croce says. So canned tomatoes should be used very soon after
opening the can.

Thursday, Feb. 4:
</P>
<P>
   NY-GUEST-ROOM (New York) _ Two- and three-bedroom apartments are
as hard to find in the Village as imperfections in a leading lady.
But three years ago, with the can-do spirit of someone who wielded
the green eyeliner in ``Aliens IV'' and made Daniel Day Lewis look
haggard _ well, almost _ in ``The Crucible,'' Naomi Donne, sank
$200,000 into a one-bedroom wreck with ceilings that reached nearly
14 feet, because she had a vision that there might be just enough
space up there to create room for guests. ``It was inevitable that
people were going to visit,'' she said nonchalantly. ``I just
wanted them out of the way.'' By Julie Iovine.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   SWEENEY-HOUSE (Undated) _ Julia Sweeney's parents, Bob and Jeri,
have moved out of the bedroom. Her boyfriend no longer has to crash
in the office out back. The guest room is empty, save for a few
artifacts left behind when her brother Mike died. The pull-out bed
in the living room remains safely tucked under its corduroy
cushions. In other words, the comedian and ``Saturday Night Live''
veteran has her Hollywood dream bungalow back to herself. For those
who saw her one-woman show or read her book, ``God Said, `Ha!'''
(Bantam, 1997), a bittersweet memoir about living with cancer in a
reconstituted nuclear family Sweeney's parents and her brother are
familiar characters. By James Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   PALMBEACH-ANTIQUES-FAIR (Palm Beach, Fla.) _ Kristy French, a
young collector from Dallas, was at the International Art and
Antique Fair here _ which runs through Sunday _ trying to expand
her collection of 20th-century works of art. Take the Picasso.
``It's just a little picture,'' she explained. ``Cubist, from 1922.
But I just bought a Lichtenstein _ 1992 _ and it's very similar in
style. That's something I like to do: weave a thread between
them.'' Ms. French, 35, and her interior designer friend, Barry
Williams, were among the hundreds of antique lovers who gathered
here last Thursday night for the ``Vernissage'' _ Euro-speak for
``opening''_ of the city's three-year-old antiques fair. By Tracie
Rozhon.

   METALLIC-PLASTIC (New York) _ The Accent on Design exhibition at
this week's New York gift show, where manufacturers show off
products for the coming year, was awash with items for the home in
metallic plastic. These are not plastic glasses and garbage cans
spray-painted copper or silver, understand, but objects molded of a
polypropylene or vinyl where the metal color is part of the
material. Their flowing shapes, loose and liquid as some special
effect from ``Terminator 2,'' flaunt their plasticity. They seem to
inhabit some alchemical middle state between plastic and metal. By
Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE-PLANTS (New York) _ Colman Rutkin and Sage Reynolds were
not about to rush around straightening up their rambling, 12-room
house on Staten Island just because a photographer was coming.
Thank goodness. In the bleak mid-winter, I was looking for people
who didn't need spring to have green, living things keeping them
company. And I didn't want them tidying up seedlings on the kitchen
sink. ``We have plants in the bathroom,'' Rutman said, ``plants in
the attic, plants in the cellar.'' I went right over. By Anne
Raver.

   GERMANY-FURNITURE-FAIR (Cologne, Germany) _ Material was the
message at the International Furniture Fair, where retailers find
the broadest range of contemporary furniture available. Exhibitors
_ some 1,600 from 46 countries _ were out of new ideas about form,
stuck as they were in the minimal, spare look of the 1970s. So they
turned to substances for inspiration. The materials of the moment
are neither cutting edge nor high tech. Instead, designers
experimented with the tried and true _ wood, glass, stainless steel
and porcelain _ with surprising results. Here's a preview of the
designs likely to cause the biggest ripples when they arrive in
America this spring and summer. By Arlene Hirst.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A builder working on the expansion of the San
Francisco International Airport says he can construct a stadium for
the 49ers football team for as much as half as the current
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan for replacing Candlestick Park was estimated
at $325 million, and later grew to more than $500 million, putting
the proposal in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Willie Brown said Tuesday that Ronald Tutor, the
chairman of Tutor-Saliba Corp., said his company could do the job
for $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tutor-Saliba tells me that, in a period of between 24 to 30
months, they can build a stadium for the city and county of San
Francisco ... and they can do it for $250 million,'' Brown said.
``That is exactly what Ron Tutor represented here in City Hall, and
that information has been passed on to the 49ers for them to take
the appropriate look.''
</P>
<P>
   The outside estimate could be one of the few pieces of good news
in a year for a project that Brown invested so much political
capital in and voters approved narrowly in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The city-backed plan called for a stadium and adjacent shopping
mall at Candlestick Point to be partly financed by taxpayers
through a $100 million bond issue.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been on hold not only because of costs, but
because the team's co-owner, Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., was indicted
in a Louisiana government corruption investigation.
</P>
<P>
   John Wasson, the 49ers stadium project director, said Tuesday
the team's owners welcomed Tutor's input and have reviewed his
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Wasson said the $250 million price tag didn't take into
account everything involved in building a stadium, including design
work, environmental review and other costs beyond construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these things, like in any budget, you have to look at what
pieces are being counted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tutor could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The team's original plans called for a 72,000-seat stadium with
the Mills Corp. of Arlington, Va., building a
1.4-million-square-foot shopping and entertainment complex next
door for an additional $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tutor's Los Angeles-area company is familiar with stadium
construction. Tutor-Saliba, through a joint venture, built Bank One
Ballpark in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Also known as ``The BOB,'' the stadium opened in April as the
home of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. Wasson managed that
project, which was completed, he said, at a cost of $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tutor-Saliba also is involved in the expansion of the Oakland
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Serious questions about the 49ers stadium project were first
raised after DeBartolo, facing indictment, relinquished his title
of chairman of the 49ers and handed over operations to his sister,
Denise DeBartolo York.
</P>
<P>
   She heads the team's parent company, the Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp., of Youngstown, Ohio. Since then, DeBartolo has agreed to
cooperate in the case against former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards
and pleaded guilty in October to concealing a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, York issued a statement saying estimated
stadium costs had ballooned to $525 million and suggested the team
might abandon the project.
</P>
<P>
   The window of opportunity is shrinking if the stadium is to be
built in time for the 2003 Super Bowl, which was promised by the
National Football League as an inducement to voters to support the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The financing deal has been tied up in litigation alleging
irregularities in the June 1997 election in which the city bonds
were approved for the stadium.

LOOKING FOR BIRDS IN CATTLE COUNTRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSVILLE, Texas _ Spreading over 825,000 acres and larger than
the state of Rhode Island, the 146-year-old King Ranch is renowned
for developing two major breeds of cattle and producing the first
registered American quarter horse.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't come to admire the Santa Gertrudis or King Ranch
Santa Cruz cattle or the 29,000 white-tailed deer that roam this
vast land. Neither is the main focus the King Ranch Museum or King
Ranch Saddle Shop, both popular attractions in downtown Kingsville.
</P>
<P>
   I have another priority. The search for ``butter butt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we call the myrtle warbler, or yellow-rump
warbler,'' says Tom Langschied, who conceived and directs nature
tours at the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I need to fess up. I'm not a birder. Or wasn't. Truth is,
I'd always been rather intimidated by men and women dedicated to
recording every new species they spy. I remember how Miss Jane
Hathaway was so devoted she almost stopped chasing Jethro on ``The
Beverly Hillbillies.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd never keep a birding checklist. Would I?
</P>
<P>
   This new-found interest had begun _ and almost ended _ two days
earlier at the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge near Port
Isabel. We stood for the better part of an hour in what is known as
a ``photography blind,'' a camouflage of sorts devised so that
humans can watch wildlife without disturbing it.
</P>
<P>
   Real birders probably would call this cheating. I didn't care. I
was mesmerized by the bright red cardinals and long-billed
thrashers and green jays. Especially the green jays, unique to this
part of the world. Two strikingly beautiful green jays. No, four.
Now 10 green jays. Each busily devouring oranges placed on a tree
trunk to attract them. More cheating, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Thrilled by this discovery, we turned to leave when a man
approached carrying a sheet of paper and enormous binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where I can go to see the aplomado falcon?,'' he
stammered. ``I understand they've just been released here. It's so
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I said with all sincerity _ and naivete _ ``but there
are some beautiful green jays a few steps away.''
</P>
<P>
   He scowled, obviously irritated. ``Green jays? That's nothing.
There are thousands around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Deflated, my first reaction was to return to the hotel and watch
television. I couldn't distinguish a rare sighting from a common
occurrence. But, then, I thought, ``So what?'' I look at a painting
and don't know if it's worth $100 or $1 million. But I relish
sauntering through an art museum and marvel at the creativity of
even an amateur artist. I sip a glass of red wine and can't tell if
it's from Australia or California. But I know what tickles my taste
buds.
</P>
<P>
   So, undeterred, we drove for two hours on an unpaved loop within
the refuge, stopping now and then to watch the brown and white
pelicans (Brown pelicans dive awkwardly; white pelicans are more
graceful. See, I'm learning.) frolic along the Laguna Madre Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, we ventured to Sabal Palm Audubon Center and Sanctuary
in Brownsville and the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge west of
Harlingen, where we saw the bright orange Altamira oriole and the
yellow-and-brown great kiskadee. And an enormous great blue heron
perched high atop a post.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I didn't bother keeping a list of sightings. Until today.
At the King Ranch I check off each bird that appears: the belted
kingfisher, red-tailed hawk, solitary sandpiper, golden-fronted
woodpecker. ``Wow, look, there's an olive sparrow; we're fortunate
today,'' Tom Langschied says, his enthusiasm encouraging our
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, see the bright red on the vermillion flycatcher,'' he
says. ``And over there, the ruby-crowned kinglet.''
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, Langschied steps out of the van he drives
during these nature tours and calls to the birds, luring them
closer. ``Let's see if we can coax out the eastern screech owl,''
he says, then lets out a piercing shrill.
</P>
<P>
   But what's this? ``It's the myrtle warbler,'' Tom says. ``It's
butter butt.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 3 1/2-hour tour, we record 63 species. ``Not bad,''
Langschied says. ``We have more than 300 species on the King Ranch.
But we've got 1,300 square miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Nature tours here date only to 1994, reflecting the growing
interest in birding. Participants also are likely to see deer and
javalina, maybe even bobcats, but the emphasis is aviary.
</P>
<P>
   Beginners are welcomed. ``Birding can be whatever you want it to
be,'' Langschied says. ``There is a beauty that everyone can
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Little, ornithologist for whooping crane excursions aboard
the Wharf Cat boat from Rockport and Port Aransas, echoes those
sentiments. ``I teach a five-day class at Elderhostels,'' he says.
``Some folks think that when you get to be 55 years old, you're not
supposed to learn anything new. But you should see how eagerly
people get into bird-watching. By the end of the class, they're
asking me what kind of binoculars and scopes to buy and the best
places to see different birds. Some of them write me with
descriptions of what they've seen, and I identify it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'll add to our list. Maybe not. Maybe some day we'll
look for that aplomado falcon. Or just go back to that photography
blind and watch the green jays eat oranges.
</P>
<P>
   With no apologies.
</P>
<P>

RELAXED ATMOSPHERE IS CORPUS CHRISTI VIRTUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Unwind with a leisurely jog along one of
America's loveliest urban seawalls.
</P>
<P>
   Buy shrimp fresh off a rustic trawler in the shadow of
glittering skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   Admire passing sailboats _ their designs reflecting a rainbow of
colors _ from an open-air pavilion overlooking the tranquil water
in a downtown marina. Better yet, rent a kayak and paddle away your
cares among the pleasure yachts and sightseeing boats.
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully situated along Corpus Christi Bay _ and less than an
hour's drive from the Gulf beaches on Padre and Mustang islands _
this thriving city of 350,000 residents maintains the same low-key
ambience of much smaller neighboring towns.
</P>
<P>
   Its heart is at the waterfront, where restaurants tempt with the
mouth-watering catch of the day and old-style seafood shops market
a bounty of riches.
</P>
<P>
   Romantics gravitate to the shade and solitude of the Miradores
del Mar, gazebolike pavilions where on a crystal-clear day vistas
extend seemingly forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirador de la Flor, on Shoreline Drive at the base of
Peoples Street downtown, includes a statue dedicated to Selena, the
late Tejano singer who lived here.
</P>
<P>
   The seawall, 2.5 miles long and 14 feet high with a sidewalk up
to 20 feet in width, was designed prior to World War II by sculptor
Gutzon Borglum of Mount Rushmore fame. It's ideal for running,
walking and roller skating, spying on shorebirds or watching the
traditional Wednesday-night sailboat regattas.
</P>
<P>
   Extending to the southeast, as Shoreline Boulevard becomes Ocean
Drive, a seven-mile scenic drive is lined with parks, walking
trails and the city's stateliest homes.
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi, which hosts 5 million tourists annually, also
boasts high-quality attractions that appeal to those with interest
in science and history.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Texas State Aquarium, located across Harbor Bridge from
the center of town. A new jellyfish exhibit is drawing acclaim. Up
to 12 educational programs are presented daily. Phone:
800-477-4853.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Lexington Museum on the Bay, a World War II aircraft
carrier adjacent to the aquarium. Its flight deck includes more
than 20 historical airplanes. Phone: 800-523-9539.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History, at 1900 N.
Chaparral about half-a-minute from the center of town. This
facility is home to the Pinta and Santa Maria, two of three ships
in the ``Columbus fleet'' _ reproductions commissioned by Spain to
celebrate the 500th anniversary of the explorer's voyages to the
New World. Phone: 512-883-2862. (The area code changes to 361 in
mid-February.)
</P>
<P>
   A Corpus Christi ``Fun Pass'' costs $21 and allows admission to
all three attractions. It's available at each location.
</P>
<P>
   Other lures include the Corpus Christi Botanical Gardens; the
Asian Cultures Museum; Heritage Park, which features nine restored
historical homes; and the Art Museum of South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about these and other enticements or about
upcoming special events, lodging and dining alternatives, golfing,
fishing excursions and other recreation, call 800-766-2322. Access
www.cctexas. org on the Internet. Or make your first stop the new
visitor center at 1823 N. Chaparral (near the Museum of Science and
History, Asian Cultures Museum and Heritage Park).

   NY-GUEST-ROOM (New York) _ Two- and three-bedroom apartments are
as hard to find in the Village as imperfections in a leading lady.
But three years ago, with the can-do spirit of someone who wielded
the green eyeliner in ``Aliens IV'' and made Daniel Day Lewis look
haggard _ well, almost _ in ``The Crucible,'' Naomi Donne, sank
$200,000 into a one-bedroom wreck with ceilings that reached nearly
14 feet, because she had a vision that there might be just enough
space up there to create room for guests. ``It was inevitable that
people were going to visit,'' she said nonchalantly. ``I just
wanted them out of the way.'' By Julie Iovine.

   SWEENEY-HOUSE (Undated) _ Julia Sweeney's parents, Bob and Jeri,

artifacts left behind when her brother Mike died. The pull-out bed
in the living room remains safely tucked under its corduroy
cushions. In other words, the comedian and ``Saturday Night Live''
veteran has her Hollywood dream bungalow back to herself. For those
who saw her one-woman show or read her book, ``God Said, `Ha!'''
(Bantam, 1997), a bittersweet memoir about living with cancer in a

   PALMBEACH-ANTIQUES-FAIR (Palm Beach, Fla.) _ Kristy French, a
young collector from Dallas, was at the International Art and
Antique Fair here _ which runs through Sunday _ trying to expand
her collection of 20th-century works of art. Take the Picasso.
``It's just a little picture,'' she explained. ``Cubist, from 1922.
But I just bought a Lichtenstein _ 1992 _ and it's very similar in
style. That's something I like to do: weave a thread between
them.'' Ms. French, 35, and her interior designer friend, Barry
Williams, were among the hundreds of antique lovers who gathered
here last Thursday night for the ``Vernissage'' _ Euro-speak for
``opening''_ of the city's three-year-old antiques fair. By Tracie
Rozhon.

   METALLIC-PLASTIC (New York) _ The Accent on Design exhibition at
this week's New York gift show, where manufacturers show off
products for the coming year, was awash with items for the home in
metallic plastic. These are not plastic glasses and garbage cans
spray-painted copper or silver, understand, but objects molded of a
polypropylene or vinyl where the metal color is part of the
material. Their flowing shapes, loose and liquid as some special
effect from ``Terminator 2,'' flaunt their plasticity. They seem to
inhabit some alchemical middle state between plastic and metal. By
Phil Patton.

<P>
   HOUSE-PLANTS (New York) _ Colman Rutkin and Sage Reynolds were
not about to rush around straightening up their rambling, 12-room
house on Staten Island just because a photographer was coming.
Thank goodness. In the bleak mid-winter, I was looking for people
who didn't need spring to have green, living things keeping them
company. And I didn't want them tidying up seedlings on the kitchen
sink. ``We have plants in the bathroom,'' Rutman said, ``plants in

_ some 1,600 from 46 countries _ were out of new ideas about form,
stuck as they were in the minimal, spare look of the 1970s. So they
turned to substances for inspiration. The materials of the moment
are neither cutting edge nor high tech. Instead, designers
experimented with the tried and true _ wood, glass, stainless steel
and porcelain _ with surprising results. Here's a preview of the

<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T'S announcement last week that it would offer long-distance
and wireless service at a single rate of 10 cents a minute was yet
another sign of how enmeshed wireless service is becoming in the
fabric of our daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a cellular phone is just another household phone
number. Sometimes it's the only telephone. Of course, rate cuts are
nothing new; competition among the wireless service providers
constantly forces them to offer better deals.
</P>
<P>
   But now carriers like AT&AMP;T are selling not only long distance
and cellular service, but Internet connections, too, all presented
in one monthly bill. The result is that customers have new
opportunities, and a whole new set of decisions to make.
</P>
<P>
   What's a telecommunicator to do? In the most competitive
markets, like Boston, Seattle, New York and Los Angeles, five or
six carriers offer up to a hundred service plans. How to sort
through them? The new world without wires may seem daunting, but it
needn't be.
</P>
<P>
   If you are thinking of buying a cellular phone, or if you
already have one and are thinking of switching carriers or moving
up from analog to digital cellular, ask yourself a few fundamental
questions before setting foot in one of the growing number of
stores selling wireless phones and service plans, places where
salespeople will often sell first and educate later.
</P>
<P>
   Start off with these: Do you travel a lot? Do you make more
local calls than long distance ones? Will you use the phone just
occasionally or is it likely to become an extension of your ear?
Are you looking for a phone to keep in the car for emergencies? You
might think you are interested in spiffy features like voice mail
and e-mail retrieval, but will you really use them?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are carriers and plans to satisfy most every need out
there,'' said Mark Lowenstein, a senior vice president at the
Yankee Group, a technology research company in Boston. He said the
single most important thing consumers could do was to take the time
to write down their needs and research their options.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than ever, consumers need to go through this process,''
he said. ``It's easy to get under the wrong plan and get turned off
to wireless.''
</P>
<P>
   The two most recent developments in cellular phones have been
the all-you-can-eat calling plans and the rise of the digital
phone.
</P>
<P>
   New digital networks are being touted by companies like Sprint,
Omnipoint and others as a great improvement over the analog network
that has been in place since the early 1980s. That is because the
newer networks transmit information via digital signals. That gives
digital cellular phones many advantages, like greater security,
compared with analog phones.
</P>
<P>
   They are smaller and lighter, their batteries yield longer
standby and talking times, and they offer added features like
three-way calling, Caller ID and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Digital cellular service can also cost less. In fact, calls can
be 25 percent cheaper per minute than analog calls, and sometimes
even cheaper than that.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is a catch: Digital service seldom comes with a free
phone, as most analog plans still do. Although some carriers sell
discounted phones for $50, count on paying at least $100 for a
good-quality digital phone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, digital phones outsold analog phones in the United
States for the first time, according to preliminary figures from
Dataquest, a market research company.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean you should follow the pack. Though digital
phones are billed as having clearer sound, not everyone who uses
them finds that to be true. Many people complain that receiving a
call from someone using a digital phone is like getting a call from
the bottom of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Weak signal strength, caused by spotty network coverage, is also
a problem. Experts say that the quality of the calls depend heavily
on the quality of their underlying networks and that analog calls
have long had their own sound-quality problems.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Digital service is now available in about 70 percent of the
United States, compared with coverage of more than 90 percent for
analog service.
</P>
<P>
   A very important way to find out if a digital phone will work
for you is to ask your neighbors about their experiences. If they
report that their digital phone works fine in the kitchen but not
upstairs in the bedroom, think twice about buying one.
</P>
<P>
   You have probably heard a lot about PCS in the last couple of
years. PCS, which stands for personal communication services, is
just digital cellular service that operates at a higher frequency.
The difference is mostly in the marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Digital networks use three different and incompatible standards.
As a result, many digital phone owners cannot use their phones
freely outside their home service areas. To solve that problem,
carriers have introduced dual-mode phones that can operate as
digital cellular or analog phones.
</P>
<P>
   If the phone is unable to detect a digital signal, it defaults
to analog and, theoretically, the call continues seamlessly. In
reality, the experts say, how well this function works can depend
where you happen to be calling from when it happens.
</P>
<P>
   The tradeoff for this feature is shortened battery life, said
Matt Hoffman, a senior analyst at Dataquest, because once the phone
defaults to an analog network, it needs more battery power.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line on digital phones is this: If you travel a lot,
especially to rural areas where digital service is not likely to be
available, then buy an analog phone and wait for the digital
networks to improve.
</P>
<P>
   As for service plans, the consumer never had it better. AT&AMP;T's
One Rate cellular service, introduced just last May, eliminates
extra charges for using its phones on other companies' networks,
known as ``roaming,'' and gives customers 600 to 1,400 minutes of
calls per month for a flat monthly rate of $90 to $150.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes AT&AMP;T's Personal Network plan, which will cost about
$30 a month plus 10 cents a minute for air time. For the first
time, the rates for calling someone across the country on a
wireless phone will cost the same as calling from a home telephone
or phone booth. Other companies have similar plans in the works.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to roll over your service from an existing contract
to a new plan, you will have to ask your carrier to do so. Most
carriers are willing to do allow that, as long as you are sticking
with them, of course.
</P>
<P>
   There are several wireless shopping sites on the Web, in
addition to the ones each carrier has. One independent Web site,
Wireless Dimension has impartial and comprehensive information
about cellular service, although it does sell service plans
directly on its site (www.wirelessdimension.com).
</P>
<P>
   Wireless Dimension helps you choose a plan by looking at your
preferences and matching a service to your needs. It includes
coverage maps, provided by the carriers, but it is working to
refine those to be more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our intention to show consumers what the real coverage
is,'' said Leigh Barer, a spokeswoman for Wireless Dimension. ``Not
that the maps are dishonest, but they don't show every nook and
cranny on your commute.''

<P>
   When Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Novell, joined the company
nearly two years ago, he would meet a smart employee and wonder why
the person still worked there. Not only had Novell, the world's
fifth-largest software maker, missed the Internet phenomenon and
been hampered by product delays, but it also had some of the
ugliest offices in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, where many corporate ``campuses'' resemble
destination resorts, Novell looked like an hourly motel. It was
hampering Schmidt's ability to attract and retain the brightest
programmers. Salespeople were embarrassed to bring customers to the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt made the decision to go ahead with a new $130 million
campus in San Jose, Calif., with tennis, volleyball and basketball
courts, a restaurant, a gym and an espresso bar. ``To compete in an
extremely tight labor market, our campus had to have at least the
quality of our competitors,'' Schmidt said recently as he admired
his complex, which opened in December.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly proud of the look of the campus, which was
inspired by a trip to Venice. Many of the buildings are made of
Olympia cream limestone, a light-colored stone imported from
Tunisia because Schmidt was awed by the colors of St. Mark's
Square.
</P>
<P>
   To lure talent in an industry desperate for it, Schmidt and
other Silicon Valley chief executives have become part-time
architects, restaurateurs, fitness gurus and concert promoters.
Companies are trying to out-perk one another. Some of the best gyms
and restaurants here are not open to the public. As the saying
goes: Want a good meal? Go to work.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, surly servers in hairnets do not dish out
mushy mystery meat. The best meals are served at corporate
cafeterias where technology workers choose their own pieces of fish
or meat and have the chefs grill them to order. Like hoteliers,
chief executives brag to other chief executives about their chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks like Lucent Technology's executive chef, Robert Sullivan,
can write their own meal ticket. ``I come in early, I leave early,
and I don't work weekends,'' Sullivan said, taking a break from
preparing a basmati rice salad with currants and mixed nuts, to be
sold at the highly subsidized price of $4.35, for employees at
Lucent's Coyote Creek Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Why are technology companies, especially large ones, so
enraptured with creating fine eateries and other perks?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in an economy that is driven by skills, and the
skills bucket is close to empty,'' said Thornton May, vice
president for research and education at Cambridge Technology
Partners, a consulting firm. ``Companies are desperate for skilled
workers. They'll do anything to recruit and keep you.''
</P>
<P>
   This flies in the face of Silicon Valley's tradition of
frugality. After all, this is the business that popularized the
cubicle, stock options in lieu of salary, casual Fridays and
tilt-ups (a Valley term for cheap office buildings).
</P>
<P>
   But as the industry has grown, a quiet revolution has taken
place. Companies flush with money are investing not only in
in-house restaurants but also in gyms with tae kwan do; spinning
and yoga classes; pool and Ping-Pong tables; free soda, juice and
fresh popcorn; massage therapists; dry-cleaning drop-off services;
car detailers; dog walkers, and roving ergonomics experts who try
to keep nerds pain-free.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't hurt to present Bob Dylan and his son Jakob _
both Grammy winners. Applied Materials paid $500,000 so the Dylans
would help the company celebrate its 30th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dylan had never played a public show with Jakob Dylan, who
headlines the Wallflowers, which meant that the 12,000 people
attending the Applied Materials private celebration had a ``once in
a lifetime experience,'' said Richard Garwacki, vice president of
Bill Graham Special Events, which organized 60 shows last year for
companies, most of them in Silicon Valley. He said that ``there's a
lot of ego involved'' as companies tried to outdo one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley companies have sophisticated, young
employees,'' Garwacki said. Presenting corporate-party regulars
like the Temptations, Chicago or the Beach Boys just won't cut it.
Young, hip and perhaps spoiled, geeks want bands with current hits.
``We get more requests for new bands like the Barenaked Ladies,
Matchbox 20, Smashmouth, No Doubt and the Smashing Pumpkins,''
Garwacki added.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Valley's largest growth industries is perk
subcontractors. Bay Sport, a manager of corporate fitness centers,
was co-founded by Linda and Doug Emery in 1984. Today they have 200
employees and 100 corporate clients. Although it costs $940,000 to
build an average 7,500-square-foot club and $200,000 to stock it
with the latest exercise gadgetry, Emery said he could barely keep
up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   On Sand Hill Road, a thoroughfare famous for its collection of
venture capitalists, Fedele R. Bauccio runs Bon Appetit Management
Co., one of the largest catering companies in Silicon Valley.
Starting in 1986 with a single executive dining room, Bauccio now
has 140 locations, 50 in the Bay Area. Last year his company
generated $200 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not use the term cafeteria at this company,'' Bauccio
said. ``Green beans do not sit in water for hours at one of our
restaurants. We provide fresh food rivaling any fine restaurant.''
Every in-company restaurant worth its paprika prepares food
reflecting the work force's ethnic diversity, he said, with Indian,
Japanese and Chinese foods as musts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The Oracle Corp., based in Redwood Shores, is a Bon Appetit
client that is known to have one of the Valley's best Japanese
noodle bars, complete with a baby grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   It is not likely that a genius programmer will go to a company
just because of its tasty crab cakes, step-class guru or cool
hip-hop concerts, but if a company does not provide the standard
perks, it will not get on the brightest recruits' short lists.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at Sun Microsystems' stately Menlo Park campus, the
4,000 workers can eat at several restaurants, including the upscale
Java Java, where you can have a generous portion of porcini
mushroom and cheese ravioli for $8.25. Sun's fitness center,
Fit(AT)Sun, has the latest crazes in fitness classes, including
kick-box aerobics. And to keep employees in good humor, Sun brought
in the comedian Dana Carvey to perform at a state-of-the-company
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   To set itself apart in the perks war, however, Sun has an
on-call lactation consultant. Furthermore, it actively helps people
interested in adoption. With a $2,500 adoption stipend, Vicky Yee,
Sun's corporate diversity manager, went to Guangzhou, China, to
adopt her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Visit Autodesk's headquarters in San Rafael and you will find
dogs _ lots of dogs. Kathy Tom-Engle, a spokeswoman, estimated that
100 people had their pooches sleeping in their cubicles. ``On
occasion you'll hear a growl when you walk around here, but for the
most part, the dogs are lazy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular, and unusual, perk at Autodesk is prepared
dinners. An employee can call Rick Gernetti, a chef lured from the
film director George Lucas, and he will prepare a gourmet meal that
employees can take home and reheat.
</P>
<P>
   The company encourages the practice because it keeps employees
at work. A recent dinner selection: blackened salmon with mango
salsa, wild rice and vegetables for $6.25 per person. Gernetti and
his staff bake cookies every day, too.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these inducements, established companies are still at a
recruitment disadvantage. Since the biggest perk in Silicon Valley
continues to be stock options, start-ups have the hiring edge.
Having a steady but anonymous job at a stable company is not as
valued as getting in on the ground floor of a startup where a
person has the chance to become a multimillionaire, even the next
Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest difficulties faced by larger companies include a
perceived, and often real, lack of willingness to offer equity
options or profit sharing,'' said Michael R. Forrest, president of
Job Options, an online recruiting company. ``As the employment
market continues to tighten, they are faced with having to offer
salaries and perks to new hires that exceed what the existing work
force receives.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said Novell's new 536,000-square-foot campus had already
bolstered morale and given him confidence that he would be able to
hire hot recruits. Almost every employee has an office because
``programmers hate cubicles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt encouraged his architect, Hellmuth, Obata &AMP; Kassabaum,
to create spaces throughout the building where people could gather
and talk _ while not creating so much space that people would never
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The density of space in relationship to people is very
important in creating a buzz,'' said Schmidt, 43, who was an
architecture student in college before realizing that he was
``truly terrible'' at it.
</P>
<P>
   During the building of Novell's campus, Schmidt was known to
say, ``Make it so no one has a reason to leave.'' That mantra seems
to be fulfilled. Eat a plate of pasta with salmon, pesto cream and
fresh tomatoes ($4.95) at Novell's (AT)cafe.com, ride a stationary
bike, sit in one of the Herman Miller Aeron chairs and have a latte
at Java City, Novell's coffee bar, and Schmidt's intended effect
seems plausible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind if they were working 24 hours a day, seven
days a week,'' Schmidt said, half-joking.

TO KEEP TRACK, PREPAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ark., Mass., Fla., Ohio, Texas, Minn.)   (af)  
 By ROY FURCHGOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About three years ago, Mike Norris, a home remodeler and single
parent of three in Little Rock, Ark., decided that owning a
wireless phone was a great idea. Then his bill came.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about three times the size it should have been,'' he
said. Some of the promotions and rules were confusing and he didn't
get all the breaks he expected. ``We had the weekends free, and it
didn't happen,'' he said of the calling plan he bought.
</P>
<P>
   But Norris found a way to control his bills. He dropped his
contract service and now pays for a block of time in advance. When
that is used up, he buys more. The phone industry calls this
pay-as-you-go plan its ``prepaid service,'' and Norris says it
helps him keep track of his spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to worry about a bill,'' he says. ``I don't get
anything in the mail about it.'' His cell phone, he said, ``tells
me when it needs money.''
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid phone services nearly doubled, to 1.8 million, in 1998
from their 1997 level of 533,000, according to the Yankee Group,
Boston-based telecommunications analysts. Prepaid services are
currently the fastest growing segment of the wireless phone market,
perhaps because wireless service can start up for under $100 _ and
sometimes well under.
</P>
<P>
   For many of those people, paying in advance was the only way
they could get a wireless phone. About 30 percent of the
million-plus people a month who apply for wireless service get
turned down, usually because they have no credit record or a bad
credit record, said Richard Siber of Andersen Consulting in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are turned down have a choice _ put down a deposit of
up to $1,000 for service that is billed monthly, or buy prepaid
cards. About 5,000 a month will pay the deposit, Siber said. And
the rest? ``Suffice it to say, the preponderance of those people
are accepting service through prepay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But more and more people are using this service to control
spending than to get around credit problems.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Silverman, 27, a recruiter in Fort Lauderdale, says he uses
prepaid cards because they help him control his phone spending.
Silverman said that going out of pocket for phone time makes him
more aware of the time he spends on the wireless.
</P>
<P>
   When an announcement comes on his phone saying he is low on
minutes, Silverman heads to his neighborhood convenience store, and
usually hands over $25 for a plastic card good for 30 minutes of
local calls. He dials an access code written on the card and then
makes his call.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid customers can use the same phone handsets as the
contract services, but they often pay more for them. Providers
often subsidize the cost of a handset for people who sign a
long-term contract.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a Motorola StarTac analog phone packaged with 10
minutes of prepaid time from Topp Telecom costs $299. To buy the
StarTac analog handset without service from Bell Atlantic Mobile
would cost $279.99. The StarTac analog phone with any one year
agreement from Bell Atlantic Mobile is $149.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases the prepaid phone services offer fewer features
than contract services. Even though the companies offering prepaid
and contract services are the same _ AirTouch, OmniPoint, Sprint
and many of the Bells are among the big players in both products _
some offer service only on analog handsets, which have connections
in more parts of the country than digital handsets, but are also
more vulnerable to eavesdroppers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, these phones have experienced problems with ``cloning,''
which allows third parties to make calls on the original phone's
bill. Contract services often offer ``dual band'' phones that
automatically switch to analog where digital is not available.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid phone service generally costs more per minute than
contract service. The contracts lock the consumer into a year or
multi-year deal, selling a specific number of minutes each month at
a specific price, often as little as 10 cents a minute, even for
some long distance calls. The consumer pays a premium for using
more minutes than the contract allows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   According to Boston Communications Group, which runs prepaid
programs for companies like Southwest Bell and Airtouch, prepaid
calls range from 42 cents a minute to 80 cents a minute, depending
on who's selling the service and the area of the country. Some
prepaid services also charge for long distance, roaming and
directory assistance. Most have an activation charge of about $50.
</P>
<P>
   But rates have gotten progressively lower since prepaid service
was introduced in late 1996. The national average prepaid cost in
October 1998 was 58 cents per minute, down from an average of 67
cents per minute in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many carriers are finding out prepaid card buyers are not just
the credit-challenged,'' said Kevin Thigpen, Vice President and
General Manager of Boston Communications Prepaid Services Division.
``People who would like to control their budget, or who want to use
it for gift giving, or people who just want to avoid a contract buy
them too.''
</P>
<P>
   The providers haven't done much to promote prepaid service, but
that is changing. Companies are learning that having their cards in
gas stations and convenience stores helps to build brand
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Companies hope to use that visibility to graduate prepaid users
into contract users. For example, take Jody Arrowood, 22, a server
at a Middletown, Ohio, Cracker Barrel restaurant who recently
returned to her job at after having her fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Josh, decided she needed a wireless phone
to be instantly available to her babysitter. But the couple needed
to know how much they would use a wireless phone before they could
pick the most economical plan. So they are testing their use by
using a prepaid service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually we think we might go to the contract, but this is
like a trial and error,'' said Mrs. Arrowood. So far, in the first
month, each of them has used about 20 minutes of time.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arrowood pointed out that with a contract plan, unused
minutes are forfeited at the end of a month, but the prepaid cards
typically allow 60 days to use the time, then allow consumers to
keep their leftover time if they buy another card good for another
60 days. So they may stick with prepaid.
</P>
<P>
   Parents sometimes give prepaid phones to their kids, and not
just to assure that the youngsters won't spend too much time
chatting with friends. ``As a gift you don't want to saddle the
recipient with the monthly bill,'' said Rick Borinstein, senior
vice president of merchandising for Radio Shack in Ft. Worth,
Texas, which says it is the largest retailer of wireless phones in
the country ``That's really the gift that keeps on giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids who want to buy their own phone usually have no choice but
to prepay. Jessica Nadeau, a 16-year student in Champlain, Minn.,
bought her phone from a convenience store in the strip mall where
she worked part time in a pizza restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of an impulse buy,'' she said. ``It just seemed
like a good deal kind of cheap. It was about $80 and there was no
monthly bill.'' She said she uses the phone sparingly, but was able
to call a friend when she was stranded at a mall.
</P>
<P>
   Because the cards can be bought with cash, people who treasure
anonymity like the prepaid system, and that group includes
criminals. Although both analog and digital phones can be tapped,
some criminals use scores of cards in a way to confound electronic
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem for law enforcement,'' conceded Edward
Allen, who is in charge of investigative technologies at the FBI in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest downside to the prepaid cards may be to the industry
itself. Once the pool of new consumers diminishes, expect a prepaid
price war, said Siber, the telecom analyst. ``It is a commodity
service at that point. Do you go to the same gas station each time,
or when you are on the highway and running low, do you stop for
gas? You go for the carrier with the most convenience or lowest
cost.''

LIGHTS, SOUND, DVD: THE TEMPTATION BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In last week's thrilling episode, our hero escaped from the dank
dungeons of Divx and, accompanied by a swelling musical score
delivered in multichannel Dolby Digital surround sound, arrived in
front of a secret cave that the jini (the one in his magic
television set) said was full of sparkling cinematic treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open DVD!'' he shouted. And the cave opened to reveal ... a
confusing array of DVD video players.
</P>
<P>
   Cut! This was not in the script.
</P>
<P>
   DVD is the next step up on the evolutionary ladder from its
physical twin the CD, or compact disk. DVD players have been on the
market here for about two years, and already they have reached
critical mass confusion.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of different DVD video players to choose from,
and more are expected to arrive this spring. Prices are coming
down, and typically range from a low of $299 to well over $1,000,
depending on features.
</P>
<P>
   The disks themselves typically cost anywhere from $10 to $40 and
rentals are in the same range as videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up a DVD player to almost any TV set will result in a
better picture when playing back pre-recorded movies. The
horizontal resolution of a DVD image can be as high as 500 lines,
which is twice the resolution or sharpness of VHS video tape.
People with fancy video monitors, as high-end TV sets are called
today, get the best picture quality.
</P>
<P>
   Video is not the only advantage of DVD. All DVD players use an
audio format called Dolby Digital (also known as AC-3) and some of
the newer models can also send out a rival format called Digital
Theater Sound, or DTS. Both formats support six discrete channels
of audio: center, front right, front left, surround right, surround
left, and subwoofer.
</P>
<P>
   The poor subwoofer is not given credit for being a full channel,
so Dolby Digital is usually said to have 5.1 channels. (Not all DVD
disks carry 5.1 channels, however.) Obviously, DVD audio sounds
best when pumped through a six-speaker home theater sound system,
but it also sounds great through any stereo speaker system.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where it gets dangerous. You don't need a fancy home
theater system to take advantage of the basic features of a DVD
player, but there's no question that the most appealing features of
DVD cry out for a big video screen, a separate receiver capable of
decoding multichannel Dolby Digital and DTS audio signals, and a
six-speaker audio system. In other words, they cry out, ``This
could cost you a lot of money!''
</P>
<P>
   With a really good system, you can hear your money flying around
the room, behind you, over your head, and out the window.
</P>
<P>
   The system I used to test DVD players consisted of a 35-inch
Mitsubishi television (about $1,500), a Yamaha RX-V995 home theater
A/V amplifier and receiver (list price $999), and a set of six Bose
Lifestyle 15 Acoustimass speakers (list price $1,299).
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that even a garbage disposal could keep me entertained
if it was attached to such an impressive home theater system. Even
so, I did find a few DVD players that stood out from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   As happens all too frequently, the DVD player I liked best was
also the one that cost the most.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was the Sony DVD-S7700, based on features, quality
and performance. My friendly local high-end audio and video store
sells it for $1,199 plus $100 local sales tax, while the
impersonal, arrogant and occasionally rude online store halfway
across the country sells it for $999 with no taxes, plus $40
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was just to use the Sony S7700 as a ``reference
standard'' against which to measure other DVD players. The S7700
sets a pretty high standard, both for DVD video disks and for CD
and DVD audio, which are processed separately.
</P>
<P>
   Searching a disk for a particular scene was smooth and quick,
even in reverse, which is usually difficult for DVD players. Sony
uses many different technical tricks to give the S7700 the best
possible picture quality. Set-up and operation were relatively
painless, and the glow-in-the-dark remote control is a nice
feature.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But I could also live happily ever after, or at least until the
next product generation, with the less-expensive Pioneer DVD-414
(which lists for $525 but with a street price of about $330.). The
DVD-414 was the best bargain I found, and it comes with many of the
high-end features of Sony's top machine.
</P>
<P>
   These include component-video and S-video output, both of which
yield better picture quality than the more common composite video
output. But you have to have a TV monitor that has either component
video or S-video jacks.
</P>
<P>
   While I prefer the Pioneer at about the same price, there were
quite a few write-in votes for the Panasonic DVD-A110 (about $450),
(about $400), a low-end machine that was cited positively more
often than any other player by readers who wrote in response to
last week's column on the choice between ``open'' DVD and Divx _ in
which Divx finished a distant second.
</P>
<P>
   Several letters recommended ``anything made by Toshiba'' or
``anything made by Sony.'' The advice is solid.
</P>
<P>
   The overall message from the digital mailbag was that people
seem pretty happy with their DVD players, regardless of make and
model.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some people might not want to buy a DVD player, at
least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   First, a DVD player is not a replacement for a video cassette
recorder (VCR). Today's DVD video players cannot record anything.
Given the complexity of compressing video signals on the fly _ and
there is no way to fit a movie onto a DVD disk without serious
compression _ it is likely to be years, if ever, before affordable
DVD video recorders reach the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a small risk that DVD could flop, going down the
same dead-end path as the Sony Betamax or the 8-track stereo.
However, almost all of the major motion picture, consumer
electronics and computer companies have endorsed DVD, and more than
a million DVD players have been sold so far, so it would be a
surprising flop.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how DVD will evolve to support High
Definition Television (HDTV) standards. Most likely, today's DVD
players will work with HDTV sets, but they may not be able to play
HDTV-quality disks.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, DVD holds the potential to surpass CD audio disks
with higher-quality, multichannel sound, but not until DVD audio
standards are nailed down. Today's players may or may not be able
to play the new DVD audio disks.
</P>
<P>
   Not scared yet? Then go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   First, look for a model with 10-bit digital-to-analogue
converter (D/A converter). This is an indication of video signal
processing power. With the slower converters, movies sometimes
hiccup or exhibit the digital equivalent of dandruff. For audio, it
should say ``24 bit/96 khz.''
</P>
<P>
   If movie sound is really important to you, get a DVD player that
handles DTS sound, even though there are very few DTS-coded disks
available so far.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the salesperson to show you how easy it is to call up the
movie's menu to select video chapters and soundtracks, and then
compare how quickly each machine responds to your commands. Some
players take longer than others.
</P>
<P>
   Take plenty of time to test the remote control, because that
will be your user interface for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Use the remote to scan forward at various speeds _ some players
can creep ahead frame by frame _ and watch how solid the picture is
when it is paused. An even bigger test is how well the player scans
in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Movies are compressed to fit on a single DVD disk by means of a
technique called MPEG-2, which works by recording only the visual
information that changes from one frame to the next. This is swell
for people who speed through movies, but it makes it much more
difficult to go backward smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they did it that way to keep your money from flying back
into the room.

TEXAS TREASURES: THE LOWER GULF COAST

By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKPORT, Texas _ The whooping crane glides gracefully above the
rippling waters, its snowy white grandeur and the black-feathered
tips of its majestic 6-foot wing span silhouetted against the soft
gray clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The hauntingly beautiful crane is one of only about 365 existing
in the world _ all in North America _ and among 182 to make the
familiar journey this winter from western Canada to the Aransas
National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Searching amid the marshes for the elusive blue crab and
oblivious to the stares of two dozen intruders aboard an excursion
boat, the whooping crane represents a symbol of peace and
contentment.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, it also represents the essence of life along the
Texas Gulf coast, from the sleepy fishing villages of the Coastal
Bend to the idyllic beaches on South Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome Winter Texans,'' billboards proclaim along highways
and side roads.
</P>
<P>
   The greetings are aimed at tens of thousands of humans who
congregate here each year to escape the bitter cold _ and the
hubbub _ surrounding their homes to the north.
</P>
<P>
   But the welcome mat is out, too, for the whooping cranes and
dozens more migratory bird species. And for the brown pelicans and
green jays and chachalacas and other species that live year-round
in a region avid birdwaters cherish as their mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, this is a slice of Americana where people _
visitors and residents alike _ take the time to savor these wonders
of Mother Nature just as they linger for hours over coffee and
conversation as a breakfast ritual or appreciate the solitude of a
walk along the beach at sunrise or sunset.
</P>
<P>
   So exit the fast lane for a spell. First, the lay of the land:
Unlike much of Florida or California or Oregon, we don't merely
``drive'' the lower Texas coast. Except in dune buggies or
4-wheel-drive vehicles, that is. No roads deface the sand buildups
from just south of Corpus Christi almost to the town of South Padre
Island _ 80 miles of which is designated as the Padre Island
National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   Most travelers congregate in one of two areas: the
Rockport-Fulton-Port Aransas-Corpus Christi corridor to the north;
or from South Padre Island and neighbor Port Isabel to Brownsville
at the Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   The inland path along U.S. Highway 77 connecting these clusters?
``Next services 50 miles,'' one sign cautions. ``Boring,'' some
would argue.
</P>
<P>
   Not if you pause at legendary Joe Cotten's barbecue
establishment in Robstown (``Here's your brisket and ribs, served
on our finest china,'' a waiter says as he spreads lunch atop a
sheet of butcher paper just as his predecessors did for former
President Lyndon Johnson, singer Willie Nelson and former pro
football player Roger Staubach.); explore the immense King Ranch
outside Kingsville; and shop for the freshest oranges and
grapefruits in Sebastian and Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Slow down, lest we violate the spirit of this Texas
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`HEAVEN IS JUST LIKE ROCKPORT' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A friend in Houston tells a true story about a child who,
distraught about her elderly grandmother's death, asked, ``Where
has Grandma gone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma is in heaven,'' the child's father replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is heaven like?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven,'' the father said, ``is just like Rockport.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Rockport _ or Fulton, Aransas Pass, Port Aransas, Port
Isabel and any number of other towns along the Texas coast _ would
readily agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this paradise,'' says Dori Sloat, a former urbanite
who moved to Rockport in 1984 and with her late husband founded a
tour boat company that offers birding and fishing excursions aboard
the 95-passenger Wharf Cat and other vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just friendlier here,'' Sloat says, ``and the pace
of life is slow. And you can get anywhere in five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost.
</P>
<P>
   Only a half-hour north of Corpus Christi, Rockport is noted for
its intimate art galleries (with more than 150 artists in
residence) and the Texas Maritime Museum beside the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent Fulton is home to the ornate 125-year-old Fulton
Mansion and a shiny new 40-pound granite-and-silver Lombardi
Trophy, awarded each year by the Houston Rotary Club to the best
lineman in college football. It's showcased proudly within the
unpretentious Hu-Dat restaurant (serving ``Oriental and Cajun''
cuisine) owned and operated by Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen's
parents and other relatives, all-stars themselves at preparing
sesame shrimp, orange chicken and fresh redfish with noodles.
</P>
<P>
   From November through March, one of this area's biggest lures is
being a departure point for whooping crane tours to the Aransas
National Wildlife Refuge, about a 45-minute boat ride to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Little, ornithologist aboard the Wharf Cat, has guided
birders for more than 50 years. ``Amazing, isn't it, considering
I'm only 25 years old,'' Little says. ``I like that number 25 so
much I'm on the third go-round with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Little knows precisely where to look for cranes, the world's
tallest bird at 5 feet and one of the most endangered species,
because, he explains, ``They're very territorial. Each `family'
returns to the same area of the refuge every year, and there is
never more than a male, female and one chick. Except for the
`subadults.' They tend to fly and gather in larger groups. Kind of
like human teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This territorial nature also makes it easier to count their
numbers,'' Little continues. ``That's why we know 182 are here now.
That includes 18 chicks.'' Those are encouraging numbers, too,
considering the whooping crane was on the brink of extinction half
a century ago when fewer than 30 were alive.
</P>
<P>
   Wharf Cat first mate Jay Porter's main expertise is fishing, not
birding. But he, too, is captivated by the cranes' migration.
``They're just like winter Texans,'' Porter says. ``The whooping
cranes are on vacation so they take two months to get down here,
stopping several places along the way. Then, going back they make
the trip in two or three weeks because they've got things to do at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter Texans'' is now the operative phrasing, having replaced
``snowbirds.'' Couples arrive by the thousands in vans and
recreational vehicles, their license plates revealing that they
hail from Michigan, Maine, Ontario, indeed almost every state and
province in North America.
</P>
<P>
   From Rockport to Brownsville, RV parks abound near the water and
miles inland. High-rise condominiums line the beaches, many
offering lodging by the month, week or night. Other visitors _
especially those from Houston and elsewhere in Texas on short-term
vacations _ choose among a plethora of chain motels and quaint
bed-and-breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty percent of our guests are here for one of three reasons:
birding, fishing or antiquing, and another 10 percent are
honeymooners,'' says Jill Jenkins, innkeeper at the exquisite
eight-room Hoopes' House overlooking Rockport Harbor and a short
walk from the Wharf Cat's dock.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour removed _ a tad longer if the lineup is long for the
free ferry that connects Aransas Pass, acclaimed as Texas'
shrimping capital, with Mustang Island _ Port Aransas offers many
of the same enticements. These include once-a-week Wharf Cat tours;
a birding center with a pier ideal for close-up viewing of
shorebirds; and an ambience that helps even a first-time visitor
feel immediately at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you blink, you might miss Port A,'' says Vickie, a waitress
at popular Pelican's Landing restaurant. ``Everyone in town goes at
a slow pace _ except us, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulars here are addicted to blue crab corn cake with jalapeo
sauce or Aransas barbecue shrimp with sausage, corn and potatoes,
described on the menu as ``finger-lickin' messy.'' Or the standing
offer is to ``bring your own fish; whether you catch it or buy it
fresh from us, we fix it your way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, people have taken to bringing in their own duck, and we
put together an appetizer,'' Vickie says. ``Before long, they'll be
bringing in shrimp and chickens and asking us to cook them.''
</P>
<P>
   Names on storefronts _ Beach Bum, Fish Tales, Moby Dick's, Salty
Dog Saloon _ attest to the character within. And for a real treat,
step inside the appropriately named Island Pepper Shack and say
hello to Fred Franklin and Pat Marsh, otherwise known as Uncle Fred
and Aunt Pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the kind of person my dog thinks I am,'' a sign
at the counter reads. And Uncle Fred and Aunt Pat have done the
pooch, ``Little Boy,'' proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been making barbecue sauce for about 10 years, and in '94,
a friend said, `If you'd put it in a bottle, I'd buy it,'''
Franklin says. Meanwhile, Marsh was a whiz at homemade jellies.
Now, they are reigning champions at the Texas Fiery Food
competition for Uncle Fred's BBQ 'N Dippin' Sauce, South Texas
Salza, and Hot 'n Sweet Mustard, among about 15 foods they prepare
and bottle from scratch.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not pushing it; I'm no salesman,'' Uncle Fred says (but
you may want to check out www.unclfred.com on the Internet before
believing him). We just make enough so that we can enjoy life and
pay for our property. We're not looking to get rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Pat affirms. ``We were going to make a batch of habanero
sauce today, but neither of us felt like it. That's the nice thing
about life here. There's no hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nothing feels rushed or crowded _ save perhaps a
waterfront seafood restaurant in early evening or a boat jammed
with fishermen all chasing the same frisky red snapper.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever you do, leave that fancy dress and necktie at home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A RELAXING ATMOSPHERE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As former director of the Cameron County parks system,
transplanted Californian Ken Conway says he felt compelled to wear
a tie to important meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I did, the mayor had the police chief come after
me,'' says Conway, who now operates the Brown Pelican Inn B&AMP;B with
wife Vicky in the resort community of South Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wear a tie and a police officer sees you, he'll stop
you, give you a T-shirt and cite an ordinance that bans ties,''
Conway says. ``It's the same with socks; they're banned, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Get the idea that everyday life here is relaxed?
</P>
<P>
   Too relaxed, some contend, for a few weeks each spring when as
many as 125,000 students invade a town of 2,100 permanent residents
for what tourism officials tout as the ``Texas-size party of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   On summer weekends, too, the competition is intense for a prime
spot on the beach, in a fishing boat, on the golf course, or for a
table at Scampi's, Louie's Backyard, the Sea Ranch and other
popular eateries.
</P>
<P>
   But the true personality of South Padre Island _ tucked between
the Gulf of Mexico and the Laguna Madre Bay on a strip of land so
thin that only three north-south streets will fit _ runs deeper
than its 5,500 hotel rooms and condominiums, its bungee tower,
lively nightspots and Peggy's Tattoo Studio (``From mild to wild,
we do it all!!!!'').
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best place we've ever lived,'' Ken Conway says.
``It's safe; we don't have drive-by shootings here. It's soothing;
the beaches are clean and wonderful to walk, and the sunsets _
moonsets, too _ over the bay are spectacular. We have an
outstanding selection of good-quality restaurants. And there is a
warmth and hospitality in our Hispanic culture that is so
genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   This part of the lower Texas coast is a haven for winter Texans.
``A lot of people stay in RVs for two or three years, then decide
they like it so much they come back and spend the winter in a
condo,'' Conway says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some winter Texans are so happy they stay until June,'' echoes
Manuel Barroso, proprietor of Manuel's Restaurant, renowned along
with Rovans _ a larger and more eclectic eatery situated a few
blocks up Padre Boulevard _ for scrumptious breakfasts served all
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of our customers order breakfast, even in the
afternoon,'' Manuel says.
</P>
<P>
   Barroso, his sons and other family members have operated the
restaurant for 14 years. And wearing a hat as broad as his smile,
Manuel greets most customers by name. Acknowledging a visitor from
the big city, he points proudly to the Houston Rockets memorabilia
_ and countless other sports-related artifacts _ on the restaurant
walls and initiates a discussion of the team's potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say you like your chilaquiles spicy? Here, try this,''
Manuel says, a twinkle in his eye as he places on the table a
bottle of Dave's Insanity Hot Sauce whose label cautions, ``Shake
well and good luck. Use this product one drop at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooooh, Dad usually only gives this sauce to the customers he
doesn't like,'' jokes one son. (It was a joke, wasn't it?)
</P>
<P>
   Just as innovative cuisine is a trademark of South Padre Island
_ and don't pass up Scampi's peanut butter shrimp with garlic,
ginger, soy sauce, sugar, peanut butter and a touch of jalapeno _
this part of the Texas coast, and extending well inland, beckons
birders and other naturalists from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caution when flashing. Slow to 45 mph. Pelicans on road,'' a
huge sign greets motorists as they start across the Queen Isabella
Causeway _ at 2.5 miles, the longest bridge in Texas _ from Port
Isabel to South Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   Heed the warning, Ken Conway advises. Brown pelicans often
become exhausted in flight and pause to rest on the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500-foot Laguna Madre Nature Walk near the South Padre
Island Convention Center affords viewing of brown and white
pelicans, egrets, herons and other shorebirds. Or check into the
Conways' eight-room Brown Pelican Inn and admire the pelicans from
an armchair on a porch overlooking the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour away by car is the 45,000-acre Laguna Atascosa
National Wildlife Refuge where more than 300 bird species have been
recorded. Alligators swim in ponds and white-tail deer roam
throughout. Negotiating a 16-mile driving loop (mostly unpaved, and
take it slow or risk damaging your car) can introduce a wide range
of wildlife. Or choose among several walking trails. A visitor
center provides a good introduction.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-minute drive southwest from South Padre Island leads to
Sabal Palm Audubon Center and Sanctuary in Brownsville. Another 45
minutes westward is Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge. Beyond is
Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park. Each has its unique
attributes, and serious birders know them well.
</P>
<P>
   South Padre Island has long been home, too, to its ``Turtle
Lady,'' Ila Loetscher who founded Sea Turtle Inc. in 1977 to
provide education about _ and help save _ the five species of sea
turtles found in the Gulf of Mexico, all threatened or endangered.
Loetscher is now retired, but associates maintain her legacy by
conducting educational presentations on Saturday and Tuesday
mornings, with special emphasis on protection of the Kemp's ridley
turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Another focus is on the dolphins that swim in the bay and ocean,
and several companies offer boat tours to watch them frolic in
their natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the high-rise hotels and condominiums _ and, yes, soon the
spring breakers _ this concentration on nature seems especially
remarkable. But Vicky Conway says, ``There has always been an
appreciation for the beach and the bay, and now there is an
appreciation for the birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Husband Ken elaborates, ``There has been an evolution since I've
been here. People who said, `Don't get in the way of my
bulldozers,' have started realizing the economic value of
eco-tourism. More important, they recognize it as being ethically
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CORPUS CHRISTI: A PROUD CITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All along the lower Texas coast _ even in Corpus Christi, among
the most laid-back of modern cities _ these defining
characteristics remain constant: a love of nature and the sea, of
fine food and good conversation and a relaxed lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   And pride. Pride in a hometown, a beach, a fishing boat, an
avocation, a son or daughter, an ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside a museum _ perhaps the new and lovingly arranged
Port Isabel Historical Museum or Rockport's Texas Maritime Museum
or the Museum of Science and History in Corpus Christi _ and gain
rich insight into how this part of our state derived its
personality and appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a question of a ranger at a wildlife refuge and chances are
he or she will chat for as long as time allows about whatever
beautiful birds have captivated us that day.
</P>
<P>
   Pause at Gonzalez Fruit Market in Sebastian _ among about two
dozen family-run stands along Highway 77 _ and owner Jesus Gonzalez
will point eagerly to the freshest and prettiest Texas grapefruit
and oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Every town has its fascinating characters _ a Manuel Barroso, an
Uncle Fred and Aunt Pat, a Ray Little.
</P>
<P>
   Its typically tall Texas tales, some even true: ``People say we
serve just about the biggest chicken fried steak in the world,''
says a waitress at the Barn Door in Riviera as she delivers a
portion so heaping _ and costing only $7.25 _ that it barely fits
on a plate.`` (A letter from President George Bush framed on a wall
attests to his satisfaction.)
</P>
<P>
   And its keen sense of humor: ``A Dilly of a Deli; Eat Like a
Pig, Look Like a Fox,`` reads a sign outside Simon's on historic
Jackson Street in downtown Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of all this is an overwhelming sense of
contentment. We feel it during a quiet walk along a sandy South
Padre Island beach at daybreak. Savoring sunset over the marsh in
Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge. Reflecting within a
mirador, or open-air turret, along the seawall overlooking Corpus
Christi Bay. Munching on a fortune cookie and chatting with Dat
Nguyen's cousin beside the Lombardi Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Admiring the whooping crane in its graceful flight.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE LAND    
 c. 1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Spring Bulbs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The weather has been crazy lately _ cold one day, then warm
the next. Yesterday I noticed that many of my spring bulbs were
starting to break the surface of the dirt. I am very scared that
these new leaves are going to freeze and not be productive. Is
there anything I can do to save my spring flowers?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, there's nothing you can do, so you'll be relieved to know
there's nothing you need to do, either. Those leaves are tough,
able to withstand many freezes and thaws without suffering lasting
damage. And even if the leaves do succumb, fear not; they are just
advance scouts, not the blooming army. The flower buds for your
daffodils, tulips and hyacinths were formed last year (fed by last
year's leaves) and are now safely tucked inside the bulbs, waiting
for their predetermined rest time to pass. It takes more than a few
warm days to trick them into premature growth, and although they
are a bit more delicate than the leaves, they, too, can stand quite
a bit of cold.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Peppers Indoors &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our habanero pepper plants were productive all season, and we
decided to winter them over in our home here in White Plains. The
plants seem healthy and have lots of flowers, but only three
peppers. The flowers drop off too easily. What do I do to get more
peppers? Do I need to pollinate the flowers by hand?  &QL; 
A. Your peppers should be able to pollinate themselves with no help
from you, though you could compensate for absent breezes by shaking
the plants gently every other day. It certainly wouldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not likely to help, either, because the problem is most
likely poor fruiting conditions. While a healthy pepper plant will
keep right on making flowers for quite a while after it has been
brought indoors, it's making them with energy stored up from its
season in the sun. That's enough for flowers, but not for fruit,
and it's bound to run out as the plant adjusts to indoor
conditions. Peppers are perennials that can indeed flower and fruit
all year if conditions are right, but that's a big ``if,'' unless
you have a heated greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Small-fruited peppers like habaneros do better indoors than the
large-fruited bell types. Naturally small plants, like Firecracker,
a very hot-fruited ornamental that is well suited to pot culture,
do even better. Regardless of size, however, all of them grow and
fruit best when they get lots and lots of sun and day temperatures
between 68 and 78 degrees. Nights can be a bit cooler, as long as
they don't go below 60. It sounds easy, but in most homes there's a
built-in problem: peppers tend to drop their flowers if stressed by
wide swings in temperature, and such wide swings are common near
the sunny south windows, which are most likely to provide enough
light.
</P>
<P>
   Indoor life presents other stresses that can cause flower drop.
Peppers prefer consistent moisture, but potted plants often
alternate between the desert of neglect and the overwatered swamp
of remorse. Aphids are likely to be a problem as well; peppers are
among their favorite plants.
</P>
<P>
   What all this means is that most Northern gardeners are content
to see their peppers simply live through the winter. Having a
mature plant ready to put outside in early summer will give you a
much longer season than if you had started from scratch, and it is
reason enough to keep your habanero growing, even without winter
fruits.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like a few backups, just in case, habanero plants are
sold by Burpee, 300 Park Avenue, Warminster, Pa. 18991-0001; (800)
888-1447; free catalog. Habanero and Firecracker seeds are sold by
Thompson &AMP; Morgan, P.O. Box 1308, Jackson, N.J. 08527; (800)
274-7333; free catalog.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fertilizing Houseplants &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you address the question of fertilizing houseplants?
Should I fertilize year round? If so, how often? Should I use an
all-purpose chemical fertilizer or the liquid fish kind?
</P>
<P>
   A. Your phrasing implies there is a single answer to this
question, instead of several million. But fertilizing houseplants
is like watering houseplants: there is no general rule except that
the average houseplant is more in danger of getting too much than
of getting too little.
</P>
<P>
   The best course is to watch each plant for changes that will
signal its needs. Is it trying to put out new leaves? Do you see a
suggestion of flower buds? Or is it just sitting there looking
green? Plants are hungrier when they are in active growth or
preparing to bloom than they are when resting, and unlike people,
they won't automatically get bigger just because you feed them.
</P>
<P>
   Most foliage houseplants do keep slowly making leaves and
getting larger as long as they stay alive, but very little
fertilizer is required to maintain this status quo. Feeding time
comes when the plant is engaged in the sort of vigorous new growth
that is usually set in motion by brighter light and lengthening
days.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all this, many indoor gardeners do successfully
simplify life by using a very small amount of fertilizer each time
they water. If you want to try it, use the fish emulsion, diluted
to one-eighth the recommended strength. Fish emulsion isn't as
strong as the chemical formulations, so it's less likely to burn
roots or to lead to a damaging buildup of mineral salts in the
soil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Address questions to Garden Q&AMP;A, The New York Times, 229 West 43d
Street, New York 10036, or by e-mail to gardening(AT)nytimes.com.
Those of general interest will be published. Unpublished questions

 &HT;    OLYMPICS OFFICIALS BALK AT GIVING UP RIGHT TO VOTE ON HOST
CITIES
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (s) Sports categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Threatened with the loss of their
cherished right to vote on Olympic host cities, International
Olympic Committee members on Wednesday expressed deep resistance to
sweeping reforms to the bidding process proposed by IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   During a hastily organized private breakfast attended by 41 IOC
members, here for a world summit on drugs and sports, many
complained to top Olympics officials that the reforms sought by
Samaranch were indiscriminate and unnecessarily harsh.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of emotional and sometimes bitter exchanges between
IOC members and the committee's executive board, the members argued
that innocent members were being unfairly punished for the abuses
of their colleagues, said IOC members who attended the closed-door
breakfast at the Lausanne Palace hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have some bad apples, they should be thrown out, but
don't tell us the whole general assembly is corrupt,'' said Italian
IOC member Mario Pescante. ``If 20 members are guilty, then 20
members should be expelled, but we can't change the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming majority of the members said they opposed the
proposal, he added. ``For the first time in the history of the
Olympic movement, the voice of the members is very, very loud,''
Pescante said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Easton, a U.S. member, said he was surprised by the tone of
the meeting. ``There were some hurt feelings that we were being
classed in that group of guilty IOC members,'' Easton said.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members are fiercely protective of their right to pick host
cities, perhaps the most important function they perform.
</P>
<P>
   However, Samaranch and other top IOC officials are equally
determined to make changes in response to the Salt Lake City
bidding scandal. Fourteen members have been implicated in the
scandal. Four resigned; one was issued a warning, and the executive
board has recommended that five be expelled. The cases of three
members are still under investigation. One of those implicated died
before the allegations came to light.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to act decisively late last month, the embattled
president called for sweeping changes in the bidding process to
minimize the opportunities for corruption. The plan, endorsed by
the IOC's powerful executive board, would place the selection in
the hands of a 15-member committee, eight of whom would be from the
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch proposed testing the system in this summer's selection
of a city to host the 2006 Winter Games, adding that it could be a
model for permanent reform. The expulsions as well as the reforms
are scheduled to go before the full IOC in a special session here
in March.
</P>
<P>
   For Samaranch, who was not present at the breakfast, the
opposition complicates his effort to steer the IOC through this
scandal. The number of members expressing resistance puts in
question whether he can muster enough votes from the full
105-member session to pass the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is under considerable pressure to contain the scandal
before it inflicts long-term damage on the image of the Games.
Olympics sponsors, who pay tens of millions of dollars to be
associated with the Games, have made it clear that they remain
committed but are worried about the impact of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rebellion in the ranks over the bidding reforms, the
IOC members expressed strong support for Samaranch personally even
as they demanded that the president reconsider his proposal, IOC
members said.
</P>
<P>
   Some members are circulating a plan to create a 15-member
committee to cull the list of bidding cities to two and then let
the full membership chose between the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Easton said the plan makes some sense because it places the
decision in the full IOC's hands at the end of the process,
minimizing the opportunities for candidate cities to lobby
individual members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't some small
adjustments,'' Easton said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said he leans toward enacting the reforms at
least for the selection of the 2006 city. ``It's certainly worth
trying as a public relations gesture to indicate to people that we
are serious about making a change,'' he said. ``Even if it hurts a
few feelings maybe that's something they must do at this point in
time.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Members also complained that the IOC's lingering corruption
inquiry is damaging the reputations of members Kim Un-Yong, Vitaly
Smirnov and Louis Guirandou.
</P>
<P>
   Smirnov says he has responded to the question raised by the
inquiry panel and is frustrated that his case hasn't been resolved.
``I'm president of the Olympic committee of a huge country,'' he
said. ``We are a country with many criminals, and sport is under
very big danger. The prolongation of this uncertain situation will
harm not only myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The special investigative commission is still reviewing the
cases of these members. However, the three have said that they have
responded to the questions raised by the inquiry and should either
be absolved or recommended for expulsion instead of being left
exposed to public contempt while the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   Before it makes its final decision, the commission wants to
review an investigation report by the Salt Lake City organizing
committee to make sure there are no surprises, IOC members said.
The report is expected to be completed next week.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the inquiry, IOC vice president Dick Pound, said he
didn't know when his panel would rule. ``We have to proceed with
this in the normal way . . . that is, not to act without proper
evidence, nor to fail to take all the steps we can to obtain the
evidence,'' he said. ``It's going to take time and are all going to
have to live with that delay.''

MAKING A FORTUNE, ONE MONSTER AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Domesticating animals is a lot of work. First you've got to
capture them, and they bite you and stomp on you. Then you have to
tame them, which means you need a place to keep them and train
them, lots of resources and manpower and some kind of inventory
system.
</P>
<P>
   You introduce digital technology, computer networks, commodity
trading, database integration and electronic commerce. Pretty soon
you're in the brokerage business, and your days as a
hunter-gatherer are a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with Pokemon (short for ``pocket monsters''), the wild
virtual beasties roaming across Nintendo Game Boy screens
worldwide. Starting with one monster, you raise and train it to
fight whatever wild Pokemon cross your path.
</P>
<P>
   Once creatures are sufficiently weakened, they can be captured
and tamed, then trained for battle. As their skills develop, they
evolve into stronger and fiercer war dogs (or war slugs, or war
rodents, or killer attack pigeons, as the case may be).
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to become the world's greatest Pokemon trainer by
battling and training 150 different monsters that roam wild in the
game environment. You must also defeat eight other Pokemon trainers
in combat. At that point, your own menagerie of bats and bugs and
ferocious mackerel becomes even stronger and more ferocious, with
awesome tail-whip and water-squirting capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Combat is a very dramatic term for what goes on here. It's more
like dueling data arrays. Even though you can collect scores of
these animals, you can carry only six at a time. A big part of the
strategy is deciding which monsters to use in each battle and how
those monsters should be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   This is an extremely complex set of decisions. First of all,
these 150 monsters fall into 15 categories (flying, electric,
plantlike, poisonous, icy, psychic and so on), and they all stack
up differently against one another.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, fire-type monsters are weak against water-type
monsters, which don't do much damage to plant-type monsters. It's
like playing rock-paper-scissors with 15 variables instead of 3.
</P>
<P>
   Certain Pokemon have three different stages of evolution, and
they typically evolve into more powerful versions of themselves as
they gain experience. But sometimes they evolve into completely new
monsters, and you have to decide whether you are going to throw ice
water on that process to preserve a given monster for tactical
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Each monster has both offensive and defensive ratings that are
built up during game play. So you also have to decide which
monsters to cultivate and which to shelve. In addition, each
monster can use only four different fighting moves, although many
more are available.
</P>
<P>
   If your Pokemon learns a special new technique, you have to
decide which of its previous abilities to discard. Some Pokemon can
soften up a rival's defenses; others are better at full-bore
attacks. So shuffling the batting order makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   That is when you realize that Pokemon is a marvel of interface
design. Witness the Pokedex, a self-described ``handheld
personalized electronic encyclopedia containing all available
knowledge about the known species of Pokemon.'' The Pokedex adds:
``Autosensor device triggers instantaneous database retrieval of
any Pokemon within range. An invaluable tool for the serious
Pokemon trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   A virtual personal digital assistant, the Pokedex may be the
first handheld consumer electronics device (italics)within(end
italics) a handheld consumer electronic device. But at any rate,
it's very well designed. It displays the height, weight and text
description of your Pokemon, along with images and sound samples of
their squeaky war cries, plus detailed statistics about your
current attack squad.
</P>
<P>
   It lists the items you're carrying, how much money you have and
any special information you've collected on your travels. And all
of this is clear and user-friendly on a 166-by-144-pixel LCD
screen, which is a miracle. If the Pokedex existed outside a video
game, it could give the Palm Pilot a run for its money.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of Pokemon, such devices are a matter of course.
This planet is wired to the gills. In every town, there is a Poke
Center where all your monsters can be restored to full health, and
in the corner of each Poke Center is a tiny personal computer
hooked into the Poke Net.
</P>
<P>
   Log into the PC and you can upload and download Pokemon from the
central Poke Server and read e-mail from Professor Oak, Pokemon's
answer to David Attenborough, as he monitors your progress from his
lab.
</P>
<P>
   Another corner of the Poke Center is reserved for the Link Cable
Club, which is for two players who have connected their Game Boys
with a cable (sold separately). They go to the nearest Poke center,
walk into the Cable Club and find a virtual meeting room. They view
each other's Pokemon statistics and decide whether to fight or
barter.
</P>
<P>
   Someone makes an offer. A request to confirm the deal shows up a
second later on the other player's screen. If that person approves,
the fight begins, or the trade goes through. It's a baby step
toward online banking. (The scary thing is, Pokemon transactions
may elicit more careful consideration than Internet stock trading
on the Web.)
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the real action in this game is trading and
transactions. There are two different versions of the cartridge,
blue and red, each containing different monsters, and if you want a
complete collection, you have to trade with a friend who has the
ones you're missing. Some Pokemon will evolve when you trade them.
And all Pokemon that are traded grow faster than Pokemon that
haven't been traded.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, hunting wild Pokemon stops making economic sense.
You can get so much farther as a day trader, churning high-growth
Pokemon on the open market. At lunch. Recess. On the bus. It
doesn't take a rocket scientist (or even a fourth grader) to figure
this out.
</P>
<P>
   To date, more than a million of these cartridges have been sold,
and the Poke brokers and market makers are out in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are selling Pokemon in the schoolyard, individual
monsters for five bucks apiece,'' said Eileen Tanner, a Nintendo
spokeswoman. No doubt, a Pokemon futures market is imminent. And
these are 10-year-olds. In 20 years, these people are going to be
running the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven help the Dow.

 &HT;    OLYMPICS OFFICIALS BALK AT GIVING UP RIGHT TO VOTE ON HOST
CITIES
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (s) Sports categories.

<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Threatened with the loss of their
cherished right to vote on Olympic host cities, International
Olympic Committee members on Wednesday expressed deep resistance to
sweeping reforms to the bidding process proposed by IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   During a hastily organized private breakfast attended by 41 IOC
members, here for a world summit on drugs and sports, many
complained to top Olympics officials that the reforms sought by
Samaranch were indiscriminate and unnecessarily harsh.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of emotional and sometimes bitter exchanges between
IOC members and the committee's executive board, the members argued
that innocent members were being unfairly punished for the abuses
of their colleagues, said IOC members who attended the closed-door
breakfast at the Lausanne Palace hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have some bad apples, they should be thrown out, but
don't tell us the whole general assembly is corrupt,'' said Italian
IOC member Mario Pescante. ``If 20 members are guilty, then 20
members should be expelled, but we can't change the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming majority of the members said they opposed the
proposal, he added. ``For the first time in the history of the
Olympic movement, the voice of the members is very, very loud,''
Pescante said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Easton, a U.S. member, said he was surprised by the tone of
the meeting. ``There were some hurt feelings that we were being
classed in that group of guilty IOC members,'' Easton said.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members are fiercely protective of their right to pick host
cities, perhaps the most important function they perform.
</P>
<P>
   However, Samaranch and other top IOC officials are equally
determined to make changes in response to the Salt Lake City
bidding scandal. Fourteen members have been implicated in the
scandal. Four resigned; one was issued a warning, and the executive
board has recommended that five be expelled. The cases of three
members are still under investigation. One of those implicated died
before the allegations came to light.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to act decisively late last month, the embattled
president called for sweeping changes in the bidding process to
minimize the opportunities for corruption. The plan, endorsed by
the IOC's powerful executive board, would place the selection in
the hands of a 15-member committee, eight of whom would be from the
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch proposed testing the system in this summer's selection
of a city to host the 2006 Winter Games, adding that it could be a
model for permanent reform. The expulsions as well as the reforms
are scheduled to go before the full IOC in a special session here
in March.
</P>
<P>
   For Samaranch, who was not present at the breakfast, the
opposition complicates his effort to steer the IOC through this
scandal. The number of members expressing resistance puts in
question whether he can muster enough votes from the full
105-member session to pass the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is under considerable pressure to contain the scandal
before it inflicts long-term damage on the image of the Games.
Olympics sponsors, who pay tens of millions of dollars to be
associated with the Games, have made it clear that they remain
committed but are worried about the impact of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rebellion in the ranks over the bidding reforms, the
IOC members expressed strong support for Samaranch personally even
as they demanded that the president reconsider his proposal, IOC
members said.
</P>
<P>
   Some members are circulating a plan to create a 15-member
committee to cull the list of bidding cities to two and then let
the full membership chose between the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Easton said the plan makes some sense because it places the
decision in the full IOC's hands at the end of the process,
minimizing the opportunities for candidate cities to lobby
individual members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't some small
adjustments,'' Easton said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said he leans toward enacting the reforms at
least for the selection of the 2006 city. ``It's certainly worth
trying as a public relations gesture to indicate to people that we
are serious about making a change,'' he said. ``Even if it hurts a
few feelings maybe that's something they must do at this point in
time.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Members also complained that the IOC's lingering corruption
inquiry is damaging the reputations of members Kim Un-Yong, Vitaly
Smirnov and Louis Guirandou.
</P>
<P>
   Smirnov says he has responded to the question raised by the
inquiry panel and is frustrated that his case hasn't been resolved.
``I'm president of the Olympic committee of a huge country,'' he
said. ``We are a country with many criminals, and sport is under
very big danger. The prolongation of this uncertain situation will
harm not only myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The special investigative commission is still reviewing the
cases of these members. However, the three have said that they have
responded to the questions raised by the inquiry and should either
be absolved or recommended for expulsion instead of being left
exposed to public contempt while the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   Before it makes its final decision, the commission wants to
review an investigation report by the Salt Lake City organizing
committee to make sure there are no surprises, IOC members said.
The report is expected to be completed next week.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the inquiry, IOC vice president Dick Pound, said he
didn't know when his panel would rule. ``We have to proceed with
this in the normal way . . . that is, not to act without proper
evidence, nor to fail to take all the steps we can to obtain the
evidence,'' he said. ``It's going to take time and are all going to
have to live with that delay.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The only skills required to install a tin ceiling are the
ability to drive screws and nails and cut sheet metal.
Nevertheless, the job can be tedious because you have to bend over
backward to nail the panels in place. This is definitely a
two-person job.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few basic tools are required: a hammer, chalk line, a
variable-speed drill or electric screwdriver (for driving drywall
screws), aviation or tin snips, a circular saw (for cutting plywood
panels) a hacksaw with a fine-tooth blade and heavy-duty work
gloves (the edges of cut metal pieces are razor sharp).
</P>
<P>
   Even though the individual panels are lightweight, they must be
nailed to a substantial substrate or they will eventually pull
loose from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   A layer of half-inch CDX (construction grade, exterior) plywood
provides the best base for the tin ceiling because it is easy to
install, and it offers a broad nailing surface. A network of 1 by 2
wood furring strips is another alternative, but the strips must be
placed precisely so they line up with the nail holes in the tin
panels.
</P>
<P>
   Before attempting to mount the plywood, locate all the ceiling
joists and the wall studs. When you have located the joists, snap
chalk lines across the ceiling to mark their position.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the plywood panels should run perpendicular to the
joists with the edges ending on a joist. Leave about an eighth-inch
between panels to allow for expansion during humid weather. Stagger
the sheets so the ends do not meet at the same place. Use
one-and-a-quarter-inch drywall screws to attach the plywood to the
joists.
</P>
<P>
   When the entire ceiling is covered with plywood, transfer your
layout to the ceiling. Mark off the border where the cornice will
project onto the ceiling and along the walls. Then snap chalk lines
to indicate the position of the field panels. The layout is
important so double-check your work.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can nail the field panels in place, using special,
decorative ''cone-head'' nails or common one-inch flat-head nails.
Start by nailing around the edges, then work your way across the
panel. Do not set the nails around the perimeter; instead leave
them protruding out about a quarter inch so you can pull them later
to slide the filler strips in place. Install an entire row of
panels before starting the next one.
</P>
<P>
   Be especially careful when driving the nails. Dents are
impossible to remove, so you will have to fill them with auto-body
filler. To do that, first roughen the area with medium-grit
sandpaper. Apply the filler, then try to mold it (it may be easier
if you let the filler dry, then shape it with sandpaper) to match
the surrounding pattern.
</P>
<P>
   When all the field panels are in place, install the cornice
pieces. Use one- inch flat-head nails to fasten the top of the
cornice to the ceiling and longer, one-and-a-half-inch flat-head
nails to secure the bottom edge of the cornice to the wall studs.
The hardest part of installing the cornice is mitering the ends to
fit within corners. One way to cut acceptable miters is by making
an oversized miter box. Place the cornice in the box and cut the
ends with a hacksaw. Place wood blocks behind the cornice to keep
the metal from buckling as you push the saw.
</P>
<P>
   With the field and cornice pieces in place, the next step is to
place the filler panels. One edge of the filler panel slips under
the field panels; the other overlaps the bead along the top of the
cornice. At the corners, cut the ends of the filler panel at a
45-degree angle so it butts neatly with the filler panel.
</P>
<P>
   After the installation, some of the seams between the field
panels may not be tight. Inject latex caulk into these openings,
then tap the seam together with a hammer and wood block.
</P>
<P>
   Before painting the ceiling, prime it with an oil-based primer.
(A latex primer will rust the metal.) You can paint the ceiling
with either latex or oil paint. Latex is easier to apply, but brush
marks are less likely to show if you use oil-based paint.

ON-LINE GUIDE TO TRASHY FILM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about everyone has a guilty pleasure tucked away, whether
it is a fondness for pork rinds or an obsession with Olympic
synchronized swimming. The glorification of truly bad films is
another popular one, judging by the enthusiasm of the readers and
writers at Stomp Tokyo (www.stomptokyo.com), a Web site celebrating
the art of the B movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stomp Tokyo is an effort dedicated to reviewing the kinds of
movies you see on cable or in the video store, but you're just too
afraid to see for fear that you might waste two hours of your
life,'' the site's mission statement says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sympathize, and so we screen these potential movie duds and
rate them on our exclusive lava lamp scale.'' The lava lamp rating
system ranges from the painfully awful (one lava lamp) to the
superior (five lava lamps). The site's links to both the exhaustive
Internet movie Database (us.imdb.com) and to Reel (reel.com), an
online video peddler, can help interested surfers further explore
the bad movies.
</P>
<P>
   The site is overflowing with detailed video reviews, news and
message boards devoted to cinematic kitsch, including hyperactive
Hong Kong action flicks and cheesy horror films. Created by Scott
Hamilton and Chris Holland, Stomp Tokyo, as the name implies, has
reviewed a large number of Japanese monster movies. More than a
dozen different Godzilla masterpieces are discussed here, as are
the exploits of some lesser-known reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamera, Guardian of the Universe,'' which stars a giant turtle
with overgrown lower bicuspids and the ability to blast himself
into space with a set of turtle turbothrusters concealed under his
shell, earns a lava lamp rating of three on the Stomp Tokyo scale.
The film, first released in Japan in 1995, has many scenes of
Gamera battling large space-pterodactyl creatures as scientists and
the Japanese military chase them all around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``If monsters were duking it out in Tokyo, we'd be as far from
Tokyo as humanly possible,'' the whimsically deadpan review reads.
``Barcelona sounds good. Monsters never attack Barcelona.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviews of the movies are grouped by genre, with grammatically
creative category names like Comedical and Dramatical. There is
also a category called Bleeping Things, Killer Androids and Little
Green Men that contains reviews of several of the ``Planet of the
Apes'' films.
</P>
<P>
   Some current television shows are also critiqued in the site's
Diary of a Tuber section. Lisa McInnis, the writer, discusses plot
and character motivation while picking up on some of the more
superficial aspects of a show. As she observed in her review titled
``Dawson's Creek: Oy! The Pain!'' the actors had a few problems
with continuity in the wig department. ``As bad as it was, the hair
catastrophe of the premiere is a surmountable obstacle,'' she
noted.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a letters page for its readers, an area called
Bad Movie Report and links to other places on the Web that share
Stomp Tokyo's distinctive sense of humor and video preferences. The
Stomp Tokyo is obviously not for everybody, but the site's creators
sum it up nicely: ``There's no accounting for taste, ours or
yours.''

WIDOW OF SLAIN CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER TELLS STORY OF STRUGGLE IN NEW
BOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if she does sound a bit overwhelmed, the quiet grace that
Myrlie Evers-Williams wears so well comes through the moment she
speaks.
</P>
<P>
   She has been in three cities in as many days for lectures, and
now the former chairman of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People is in New York to promote her new
autobiography, ``Watch Me Fly: What I Learned on the Way to
Becoming the Woman I Was Meant to Be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see it now,'' she begins, imagining what an impending
news story might say about her life full of tragedy and struggle.
`` `I spoke to her and she immediately broke into tears.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That may be what people expect, but it's simply not true. At 65,
Myrlie Evers-Williams, one of the most beloved and respected widows
of the civil rights movement, isn't crying. In fact, she is having
the time of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that when she lectures and shares her joy,
people want to know just how she kept going back in 1963 after her
husband, Medgar Evers, an NAACP field secretary, was ambushed and
shot in the back in the driveway of their home in Jackson, Miss.
How she found the strength to go back to college to get a degree
while raising three children alone. And how, in the wake of losing
a second husband, to prostate cancer in 1995, she could take over
the reins of the NAACP and in three years not only wipe out its
debt but also increase its membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young men and women ask me those questions repeatedly when I'm
on the lecture circuit,'' Evers-Williams says.
</P>
<P>
   The short answer, she says, is that she was determined to
preserve Medgar Evers' memory. The long answer is in ``Watch Me
Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Evers-Williams is in New York when she answers the telephone at
the Michelangelo Hotel on West 57th Street, the second stop on a
13-city book tour begun last month in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which Evers-Williams describes as an ``instructive
autobiography,'' reveals a religious faith that pulled her through
the severe financial worries she faced after Medgar Evers' death,
two hung-jury trials, the pain of knowing that her husband's
murderer was still at large. She admits that her grief led to
depression and self-doubt, causing her to ``take crazy risks,''
such as taking too many prescription drugs and contemplating
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But after nearly a year, she says, she reached a point when: ``I
said, `Tighten your grip, girl, and go on with your life.' I got up
and started going, and I've never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   And so began Evers-Williams' transformation. Over the next 30
years she would go from small-town Mississippi girl to accomplished
businesswoman to national civic and political leader. Thanks
largely to her determination to see the case through, she would
eventually see Medgar Evers' killer come to trial and be convicted.
She would also find love again.
</P>
<P>
   Although written against the backdrop of the civil rights
movement, ``Watch Me Fly'' contains two beautiful love stories. One
with Medgar Evers. And the other with Walter Williams, a
longshoreman and union activist whom Evers-Williams married in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to her story than even that: ``Watch Me Fly''
is a work of self-revelation about a woman who, despite her
successes, continued to feel that she had to prove herself.
</P>
<P>
   She writes at length, for example, about the ambivalence among
members of the NAACP when she became a contender for chairman. Many
members questioned her ability to lead, saying that she wasn't
tough enough, that she'd never even been a branch president, and
that she was ``just'' Medgar Evers' widow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't even take the time to look at my
accomplishments,'' she says. ``Medgar opened the doors that me and
others could walk through, but if you're not tough enough to learn
the game and play the game, you don't stay there. I think of my
life in corporate America, in politics. I've been a trailblazer.''
</P>
<P>
   Evers-Williams admits that, because she is naturally shy, she
came to leadership reluctantly. Medgar Evers pushed her to work
with him in the NAACP field office in Mississippi. And later,
Walter Williams pushed her to run for chairman of the NAACP board.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `This is the last thing I will ever ask you to do for
me,' '' Evers-Williams recalls. `` `You run and win.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And she did. By a 30-29 vote, Evers-Williams was elected to
replace William Gibson, who was ousted after allegations of
financial impropriety. Two days later, Walter Williams died of
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, Evers-Williams was crisscrossing the country,
seeking new members and money for the organization that Medgar
Evers had given his life for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bankrupt,'' she says of the NAACP. ``We just didn't
use the term. But I, with the help of others, was able to get the
organization out of debt. In terms of policies and practices, I was
also able to clean that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Having accomplished her mission, Evers-Williams stepped down
last year from her position to begin taking care of herself. And
she does so with a mind and heart open to the same God who has
brought her this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that as I keep still for a moment, God will guide me,''
she says. ``That's where I am right now, and it's exciting.''

STRANGE DEVICE? `SYMBOLS' CAN HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HUBERT B. HERRING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You see a circled ``P'' with a line through it, and you know you
had better keep looking for a parking spot. You see a skull and
crossbones on a jar, and you figure you'd better not add what's in
it to your morning coffee. You even remember the peace symbol from
the flower-child days.
</P>
<P>
   But you think such meager knowledge means you have a clue about
the world of graphic symbols? Ha! You don't know the half of it _
no, not even the (italics)hundredth(end italics) of it.
</P>
<P>
   What if you saw, say, a circle abutting a square, each with a
dot in it, on the door of a house? If you took it as a child's
harmless doodling and barged in, you might be sorry. For what it
means, in ``the American system of hobo signs,'' is ``Here lives a
man with a bad temper.''
</P>
<P>
   And how about a scarecrow-like figure with its arms curled
inward? In Ghana, at least, it means ``Come back and fetch it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be able to sketch some of these obscure symbols
on a napkin as a graphic icebreaker at the next party, head for
symbols.com, the online version of the book ``Thought Signs,'' by
Carl G. Liungman.
</P>
<P>
   A triangle with a couple of cartoonish arms emerging from the
sides, by the way, might not be the best one to start with. It is
the hobo symbol for ``man in this house is armed with a gun.'' And
if you're looking for that skull and crossbones, you won't find it
here. These are ``nonpictorial ideograms.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you want ice, you can choose among graphic
representations of ``ice grains, small, frozen raindrops,'' ``ice
granules,'' ``ice needles'' and ``ice, many signs for assembled.''
</P>
<P>
   The site includes more than 2,500 Western signs, from Cro-Magnon
carvings in mammoths' teeth to subway graffiti. Browsing is richly
rewarded, as you find two dozen types of crosses, from the cross of
the robbers to the Maltese cross to the cross of infinity, not to
mention different signs for a barking dog or a merely angry one.
There is even a British meteorological sign for dust devils.
</P>
<P>
   With each symbol comes a history of its origins, with links to
other relevant signs. The question mark, for instance, is likened
to a ``soothsayers' staff'' with ``the ideogram for a complete
wave, stood up in a vertical position, which symbolizes the contact
between the material actuality down here and the spiritual
possibilities up there.'' Thus the words preceding it ``have no
one-ness or truth'' but ``oscillate between possibilities.'' Any
questions?
</P>
<P>
   What of the word ``symbol'' itself? ``In ancient Greece,'' the
reader learns, ``it was a custom to break a slate of burned clay
into several pieces and distribute them within the group. When the
group reunited, the pieces were fitted together (Greek
symbollein).''
</P>
<P>
   But the value added _ what can't be found browsing in a book _
is that the symbols are arranged into 54 groups by graphic
characteristics. If you come across a symbol and hunger for its
meaning, you can do either an ``easy graphic search'' or, if you're
feeling like the king of your mouse, an ``advanced graphic
search.''
</P>
<P>
   Here you can try to define your symbol as ``single-axis
symmetric'' or ``multi-axes symmetric'' and sort the various lines
into permutations of ``soft,'' ``straight,'' ``crossing,'' ``not
crossing,'' ``open,'' and ``closed.'' Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   If you get frustrated, follow a link to something called ``The
Alphabet's Bastard Children'' to find ``ambigrams,'' which are
similar to palindromes but the letters themselves are played with
graphically so that a word, when flipped or seen in a mirror, comes
out identical.
</P>
<P>
   Or, when your head starts spinning with graphic possibilities
and you want to get back to basics, follow another link to
``typewriters.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, typewriters.

   &UR; Speed Check: Baud vs. Bps &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the baud rate the same thing as the bits-per-second speed
on a modem?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. A baud rate is the number of frequency or voltage signals
per second on a communications line (most often a telephone line).
It is also sometimes referred to as the switching speed. The word
comes from the name of J.M. Emile Baudot, the 19th-century French
scientist who invented the Baudot telegraph code.
</P>
<P>
   Bits per second, or bps, is a measure of data transmission speed
and refers to the number of bits that can pass a specific point per
second. A bit, in case you have ever wondered, is the smallest unit
of computer information storage, and its name is short for binary
digit. On most computers, eight bits add up to one byte, and one
byte equals one alphanumeric character, like a B or a 2.
</P>
<P>
   On early modems, the baud rate was the same as the bps rate,
which may be why the two terms are mistakenly used synonymously
today. An old 300-baud modem did transmit 300 bits per second. With
higher baud rates, more than one bit per second can be encoded in
each of the frequency or voltage changes. With higher baud rates,
the speed of the data transmission tends to be given in the greater
number, which is in bits per second. For example, you can have a
modem that operates at 2,400 baud but transmits data at a speed of
9,600 bits per second.

   Glossary:
</P>
<P>
   Star fruit: Also called carambola, this sweet-to-tart fruit is
especially fragrant when ripe. Fruit with green-tipped ribs can be
left at room temperature to ripen. Slice crosswise, without
peeling, to use in salads, desserts or as a garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Mango: Ripe mangoes are yellow-skinned with a red blush. The
skin is a rich yellow with a musky, exotic flavor. Mangoes can be a
chore to prepare because of their large, slippery seeds. Luckily,
sliced mangoes in jars are available in many produce sections.
</P>
<P>
   Papaya: A large tropical fruit with a smooth, green skin that is
bright orange-yellow when ripe.
</P>
<P>
   Plantain: A member of the banana family that is more starchy
than sweet. Must be cooked to be edible.
</P>
<P>
   Scotch bonnet chiles: These top-shape chiles aren't widely
available here, but their taste can be approximated by using
habanero chiles.

A WORLD OF FLAVORS STIRS THE SENSES IN `MELTING POT' CUISINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For wage slaves, these are the darkest days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   We're tied to our desks, caught between Christmas bills and the
tax man. There might be a vacation somewhere down the calendar, but
it's dismally far away.
</P>
<P>
   Cheer up: Culinary Zoloft is as near as your local supermarket.
Bring a taste of the Caribbean, and the sense of a holiday, to your
dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   North America uses the term ``melting pot'' to describe its
food. But with the exception of Louisiana, which melds
French-African-Spanish into Cajun/creole, we are a nation of many
separate cuisines. We have German, we have Greek, we have Italian,
we have Mexican, each standing on its own. It's our island
neighbors to the south who integrate many cultures into a culinary
whole.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that New England was being settled by
Europeans, so were the islands that stretch from southern Florida
and the Yucatan Peninsula to the coast of Venezuela. Over the next
500 years, waves of immigrants included the Spanish, the British,
the Dutch and the French. From the 1600s until the 1850s, millions
of African slaves were imported to work the sugar plantations. When
slavery was abolished, many of those jobs were filled by workers
from India and elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   All those cultures brought elements to the communal dining
table, making Caribbean fare a cohesive cuisine, although with some
variations. The Spanish influence is seen in the ``Christians and
Moors'' (black beans and rice); the British come through with
ginger beer; and the African use of yams and okra is widely
evident. And through all of this runs a river of almighty rum.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the input of man, it's the weather that most affects the
food of the islands. Hot, hot days and a lack of refrigeration led
to a cuisine that is heavily preserved with methods such as spice
mixtures and drying. The cooking method of choice is outdoors over
island-produced charcoal. Abundant tropical fruits show up in
chutneys, marinades, jams and beverages. The incendiary scotch
bonnet pepper and its relatives promote perspiration _ a health
benefit in hot climates.
</P>
<P>
   We can't duplicate the jeweled seas or the heady aromas, but we
can appease at least one of our appetites.

HE'LL TAKE HIS WEB PAGES STRAIGHT, WITH NO JAVA JIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Kan.)   (af)  
 By BENJAMIN CHEEVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everywhere I turn, there's another story or advertisement about
the Net. The copy is frequently illustrated with an enviably
attractive person sitting in front of a screen from which she has
just received masses of intensely satisfying information.
</P>
<P>
   The impression given, if never fully stated, is that most of
this red-hot stuff does not arrive in text but in pictures,
numbers, sound effects _ a new Ur data for which the tiresome old
ABC's are never or rarely employed.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Pentagon as a
system for linking government computers, the Internet (nee Arpanet)
has been called the most significant federal investment since the
Louisiana Purchase, but I'm still from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   All this hoopla reminds me of the A.A. Milne story in ``Winnie
the Pooh'': ``In Which Eeyore Has a Birthday and Gets Two
Presents.'' Eeyore is thrilled with the empty honey jar Pooh gives
him. ``I believe my balloon will just go into that pot,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The news bulges with stories about dispensing therapy on the
Net, doing business on the Net, trolling for unsuspecting sexual
prey on the Net. Not on this computer. Most of what I do on the
electronic superhighway is write and read letters, and if it did
not involve the elimination of envelopes and a certain parallel
loosening of style, the process would be similar to the one that
once involved lambskins and sharpened feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the fabulous Net to such base service may be the
equivalent of dropping a burst balloon into an empty honey jar, but
like Milne's old donkey, I am delighted.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, if it weren't for graphical user interfaces (GUIs),
I probably wouldn't be able to figure out how to get my e-mail. I
know this and am thankful. But when it comes to streaming video,
downloading music and all the other ways the Web is supposed to
deliver images glorious to behold, I'm not all that interested.
</P>
<P>
   What's wonderful to me is the happy marriage of hard science and
self-expression. And it happened so fast.
</P>
<P>
   That the Web would enhance communication _ via text _ was
apparent early on to some people, like James P. Girard, a novelist
who is a friend and e-mail correspondent. He worked at newspapers
as a reporter and later as a computer guru. ``Like most people,''
he told me in an e-mail message, ``I thought of computers as number
machines, right up until the day I applied for a job on the Wichita
Eagle in late 1977 and discovered that the copy editors were
working at computer terminals. These are word machines, I thought.
I gotta have one of these. I think I was the third person in
Newton, Kan., to own one, and I had to go all the way to Kansas
City to buy it. The guy I bought it from threw in a membership to
The Source and a modem _ 300 baud. I think there were maybe a
couple of hundred people on The Source.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early Source correspondents had handles, Jim
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Insane Chicken,' he wrote, ``was a very bright 9-year-old
girl from Boston, using her father's account (he never used it
himself), who pretended for a while _ quite successfully _ to be a
woman of 25. There was a highly respected programmer, named John
something-or-other, who everyone spoke of with a kind of reverence
and deferred to on software issues. (The Source had a built-in
programming language, which actually allowed users, if they knew
how, to modify the environment and introduce new capabilities; John
was one of the most active, and, as far as I know, invented a
number of things that are standard now.) It turned out he was a
15-year-old kid from Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't really know any of the usual things you know about
people _ age, gender, race, etc. You were really just dealing with
another human intelligence, through language, and the rest of that
stuff, when you did learn it, often turned out to be a kind of
disappointment. People were trying to make for themselves an online
persona that they liked better. I think that impulse, if nothing
else, is likely to boost linguistic skills tremendously over the
next couple of generations.''

<P>
   Katherine McNamara is another e-mail friend and the widow of Lee
Goerner, the editor Jim and I shared at Atheneum. In 1997, she
started Archipelago, a serious literary journal on the Net. In an
interview for the 1997 Dictionary of Literary Biography, she spoke
of the Web as providing a publishing opportunity for people with
limited capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though what's called literature or writing on the Web has
incited a great deal of self-indulgence and youthful
experimentation,'' she was quoted as saying, ``it has also made it
possible, I find, to distribute the best work you can find.''
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago is one of the sites I visit. Sometimes I do shop, at
other sites, but even then it's usually at Amazon.com, and what I
buy is books. I turn off the graphics.
</P>
<P>
   In my thirst for pure text, I seem not to be alone. ``Readers
admire our graphics,'' said Cyrus Krohn, managing editor of Slate
magazine (www.slate.com), ``but what they really admire is fine
writing. A month ago, we began delivering articles via e-mail
several times a day. We're delivering to In boxes around the world
with no art. The readers appreciate not having to wade through the
pulp to get to the juice.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of text on the Net. I found a Blake Web site. He
was described as a multimedia poet, which I think is a stretch, but
it is Blake nevertheless, annotated.
</P>
<P>
   If one characteristic of the Net is a flood of sites that are
chiefly cherished by this writer for their texts, another is that
the Net is wildly democratic. Amazon.com has reviews by
professional critics, but it also has reviews written by anybody.
``Contact Congress'' was one of the buttons on America Online's
welcome page as the House debated Clinton's impeachment. ``Talk
about it.'' By which it meant: Write about it.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview conducted by Jacob Weisberg for Slate, the
novelist Tom Wolfe described the online community as ``a virtual
Haight-Ashbury.'' He added, ``The users are kind of virtual
hippies; they sense they're discovering a wonderful community and
they feel high.''
</P>
<P>
   Which does not always make for a clear head. I visited a virtual
writer's club once and found many virtual writers. Many of them
were poets, blank verse having become the medium that requires an
awe-inspiring proficiency, or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   Never, or rarely, has the artist's feeling of stark and dismal
alienation been so widely shared. For his AOL screen name, my son,
now 12, chose ``stranger.'' Dozens of others had already picked it,
so he had to add a number to the end _ a very high one.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to be alienated, though, isn't it better not to
be alone? I have electronic friends now, just down the road and in
Santa Monica and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   I used to spend a half-hour every morning writing in my journal.
``I'm depressed,'' I'd write. Now I send e-mail to a half-dozen
close and articulate friends. ``I'm depressed,'' I write. ``Me,
too,'' they holler back, and we all feel better. Or at least I do.
</P>
<P>
   Once or twice, I've been betrayed when somebody sent me a
picture, but I'm the forgiving sort. Mostly they send me words.
Sometimes happy, sometimes despairing, often precise. It's
astonishing what you can do with those little things.

 &HT;    THREAT OF VIOLENCE LOOMS, AS OFFICIALS ONCE AGAIN DECIDE FATE OF
BOSNIAN CITY
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRCKO, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ International officials here like to
tell each other that this small town is a microcosm of the whole
country -- and that for peace to last in Bosnia, the problem of
Brcko must first be solved.
</P>
<P>
   Next week(CQ), an international arbitrator will try for the
third time in three years to decide the fate of the one town left
out of the Dayton Peace Accords.
</P>
<P>
   What has many here worried, however, is whether that decision
will spark renewed violence. In addition, Serbs and Muslims -- the
two factions with the most interest in the city's fate -- don't
trust one another, and the threat of NATO airstrikes against Serbs
in neighboring Kosovo looms.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Peace Accords, signed in December 1995, divided
Bosnia into two states: the Serb Republic and the Muslim/Croat
Federation. After three years of ethnic war and three weeks of
tense negotiations, the leaders of Bosnia's warring Serb, Croat and
Muslim factions were able to agree on where the line between the
two states should lie, except in Brcko -- a strategic deepwater
port and rail line where thousands of Serbs and Muslims died
fighting for control of it.
</P>
<P>
   An international arbitrator was appointed to resolve the issue
and pending the decision, a line was drawn through the middle of
the pre-war Brcko area, separating the urban area from the outlying
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator, Roberts Owen(CQ), a U.S. attorney involved in
the peace negotiations, has postponed the decision twice. On
Monday(2/8), he will begin to hear evidence from all sides and this
time, most here hope a final solution will be found for this
community of about 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very bad here right now,'' explained Miroslav Ristic, a
Serbian businessman living in downtown Brcko. ``The war has been
over for three years, but here it's still a situation where it's
not war but it's not peace yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ristic's driving school was bombed early last year when he
organized a car rally with a driving school in the Federation.
</P>
<P>
   There are several possible solutions for Brcko, a predominantly
Muslim town before the war when it was ``cleansed'' by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The downtown area could be left in Serb hands.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The whole town could be reunited and turned over to the
Muslim/Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A special district could be created out of either the downtown
or the whole town, a neutral city outside of both states.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Owen could even decide to postpone the decision again.
</P>
<P>
   Each possibility has its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim officials argue that giving Brcko to the Serbs rewards
ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a city is decimated by genocide, if its citizens are
expelled under threat of death, then later, that town belongs to
the perpetrators of that crime, I leave it to you to call it
names,'' said Bosnian prime minister Haris Silajdzic(CQ). ``What we
have now in Brcko is the rule of those people who perpetrated this
crime in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Serbs say taking Brcko away from them
would violate the Dayton Peace Accords, because the town is part of
the 49 percent of the country Serbs were promised in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   But more important to the Serbs is Brcko's strategic position as
a corridor between the eastern and western halves of the Serb
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a corridor that can be defended,'' explained Nikola
Kostich(CQ), a Serbian American attorney from Milwaukee
representing the Serb Republic in the arbitration. ``If you take
that away, then you are ethnically cleansing the Serbs here, and in
other areas. They're not going to stay. They're not going to feel
safe if Brcko isn't in the (Republic).''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim officials have said they will not be able to control the
reactions of people if the Serbs get Brcko. Serb officials have
responded with the same sort of inflammatory rhetoric. And Brcko
has had problems with violence, even after the war ended. In August
1997, 14 United Nations trucks were destroyed in a riot.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Though neither side thinks it's a good idea, the special
district option may be the easiest diplomatically. But without
support from either of the two states, international officials
would have to step in with money to prop up Brcko's government, at
least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the situation in Kosovo may cause Owen to postpone the
decision again. Some in the international community here think Owen
won't make any decision that would inflame Serb feelings while NATO
is threatening to bomb Serbs in neighboring Yugoslavia. The
potential for a snow-ball effect riot is too great.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Farrand(CQ), the international supervisor for Brcko says
he doesn't know what the decision will be. No matter what the
decision, however, he doesn't think there will be riots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that Brcko is a tender box I think is outdated,'' he
said. ``I think Brcko is in fact becoming a more stable community
than perhaps others in the Serb Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   But his office is preparing for violence, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the $64,000 question.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Naomi Donne thinks back on all the visitors she
accommodated in her old Perry Street apartment _ suitcases stashed
in the corner of the living room, bulging with socks and underwear,
pillows and blankets hogging the couch, towels dripping from
doorknobs _ the memory makes her cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were always sacked out on the couch,'' she said,
wrapping a tiger-print bathrobe even tighter. ``It almost drove me
mad.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Donne, a makeup artist who relocated from London to
New York eight years ago, went shopping for a new place with enough
room for her migrating friends and relatives, she found that two-
and three-bedroom apartments in the West Village were well out of
her reach. Still, Ms. Donne wasn't about to leave the Village,
which felt like home, for a neighborhood that had only buildings
with doormen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too invasive,'' said Ms. Donne, 42, who is known for her light
touch as a make-up artist. She has worked with actresses like
Winona Ryder and Kristin Scott Thomas, whose face she is currently
making up to make out with Harrison Ford, her co-star in ``Random
Hearts,'' a romantic drama now being filmed in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, two- and three-bedroom apartments are as hard to find
in the Village as imperfections in a leading lady. Chris Peters,
the sales manager at the Village office of the Corcoran Group,
could count the number of intact three-bedroom apartments he knows
on one hand. And Robert Eychner of Eychner Associates, a
real-estate agency that focuses on downtown, noted that ``the
demand for multi-bedroom, family-sized apartments has been wild for
the past few years.'' And they are priced accordingly. Corcoran's
forthcoming year-end residential sales report shows that in 1998,
the average price of two-bedroom apartments in the West Village was
$567,000, while three-bedroom apartments cost $1.4 million and up.
</P>
<P>
   But three years ago, with the can-do spirit of someone who
wielded the green eyeliner in ``Aliens IV'' and made Daniel Day
Lewis look haggard _ well, almost _ in ``The Crucible,'' Ms. Donne
sank $200,000 into a one-bedroom wreck with ceilings that reached
nearly 14 feet, because she dreamed that there would be just enough
space up there to create room for guests. ``It was inevitable that
people were going to visit,'' she said nonchalantly. ``I just
wanted them out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you improve on a dream? Robert Kahn, her architect, did,
suggesting he could add a mezzanine floor with two sleeping alcoves
_ and a library, with a view, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment Ms. Donne bought was part of a row of 19th-century
town houses off lower Fifth Avenue. The building had been a hotel
before being converted in 1980 into a 13-unit residential co-op.
Her 1,100-square-foot space had been stripped of its history: the
front parlor had been turned into the bedroom, and the kitchen was
crammed into a small rear addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a set from `Boogie Nights,' said Kahn, a
Manhattan architect whom Ms. Donne had met at a party and asked, on
the spot, to inspect the place before she bought it. ``There were
shag carpets, angled walls and a deejay booth,'' recalled Kahn, 48.
``The only thing missing was a disco ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Donne was interested only in knowing whether or not the
ceilings were high enough to fit in another floor. Pulling  &UR; that &LR; 
off, Kahn had thought, would be an interesting prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Donne is adept at summing up esthetic potential (``May
I pluck your eyebrows?'' she asked shortly after she first met a
reporter), she was confident that she could ``fix up the dump,''
she said. Architect and owner agreed that the first step was to
bring back its historical detail, adding period mantels, restoring
the moldings and putting the bedroom in the back. Any additions
would be both assertively and subtly modern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to treat the second level like an intervention of
a different style, with different materials that would still be
compatible,'' Kahn said. He added _ for good measure _ that he was
inspired by McKim, Mead &AMP; White's library at the University Club on
Fifth Avenue, where an industrial-style balcony runs steel rings
around the ornate space.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donne's new floor is reached by a stair in the hall that
leads up to the addition, a catwalk suspended less than 6 feet from
the ceiling. It runs the length of the hall and opens up into a
balcony overlooking the living room. The catwalk is made of narrow
fir planks, 3/4 of an inch thick, fitted into a steel frame that's
hung from beams embedded in the walls and ceiling. It is suspended
from above rather than supported from below because city
regulations would not allow supports to go directly to the floor,
which was not designed to carry that much weight (true of most
residential construction). Rigging, like that of a suspension
bridge, allowed the catwalk to float, a bonus that the architect
religiously accentuated by keeping the planks 1 inch away from all
walls.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the catwalk, there are two berths, each about 12
feet long, 4 feet high and 8 feet deep. The berths are raised 12
inches off the floor because the architect wanted to recreate the
feeling of stepping up into Pullman-style sleeping bunks, complete
with curtains for privacy. ``I chose a fabric with stars to remind
people of the sky,'' he said, recalling how magical it had seemed
as a child to take the overnight train from St. Louis, where he
grew up, to visit his grandparents in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   High enough to kneel in, but not to stand, the two cubbyholes
each hold a double futon with room to spare for a few suitcases. A
bookshelf with a reading lamp is built in at the head of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it should be noted that neither the architect nor the
homeowner is particularly tall, although Ms. Donne was quick to
point out that people well over 6 feet have visited for weeks on
end. And Ms. Donne herself likes to crawl into one and sleep there
when she's upset. ``It just feels so womblike and comforting,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly claustrophobic closeness of the catwalk, where the
ceiling is dropped about half a foot, suddenly evaporates when it
widens into a curved balcony overlooking the living room. The
balcony is spacious enough to pass for a small library, complete
with bookshelves, a desk and an armchair. Here, where the ceiling
is at its full height, it is finally possible to stand at full
height.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the balcony, Kahn tucked a dining table and highly
efficient kitchen. Ms. Donne recalled that when she said she wanted
a big American-style refrigerator with a water dispenser on the
door, the architect was quick to brand that ``tacky'' and insist on
a German AEG refrigerator that fits behind the maple cabinetry. The
kitchen's painted-glass backsplash suggests sophisticated subway
tiles. The zinc counter was the serendipitous result of a few
happy-hour meetings at the bar of Cafe Luxembourg. ``We even
imitated the rough welded seams,'' Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, as Ms. Donne picked up phone messages
(``Can you show  &UR; me &LR;  how to do what you did to my eyes,'' went one
from a cast member on ``Random Hearts''), she contemplated the sure
signs of a successful renovation. With an investment of about
$200,000 _ including the architect's 20 percent fee _ the
apartment's value, at least in today's frenzied market, has
probably climbed as high as $800,000, real-estate agents have told
Ms. Donne.
</P>
<P>
   And the stream of visitors has been not only constant but
unobtrusive. Few of them will ever realize that the last thing the
architect did was to soundproof her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Specs
</P>
<P>
   When space is tight and ceilings are high, the temptation to
build up is strong. Here are the steps that Robert Kahn took before
adding a floor to Naomi Donne's 1,100-square-foot apartment.
</P>
<P>
   First, he made sure that the ceilings, at 13 feet 6 inches, were
indeed high enough to allow the renovation, which added
approximately 150 square feet. (Had the ceiling been only a foot
lower, he would not have advised proceeding, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Renovations require government approval and a building permit.
In this case, Kahn submitted his plans for the new mezzanine as a
storage addition to New York City's Buildings Department. And he
got the approval of the co-op board.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the addition and the two sleeping berths are
constructed of drywall panels and metal studs.
</P>
<P>
   A caveat: Real-estate agents say that mezzanine additions to
prewar apartments increase the value of the apartment only when
they are done extremely well. A bad job will lower the value, and
there's no guarantee that the next buyer won't prefer the original
floor plan. At the Donne apartment, the mezzanine can be removed
easily, if not cheaply.

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    During his visit to Mexico and the United States, Pope John Paul
II expressed his hope to unite the Americas into a single Catholic
church called the ``Synod of America.''
 &HT;    American Catholic unification would solve several Catholic
problems. It could provide for more effective evangelization,
create economic solidarity between the rich and the poor, and
establish religious continuity for Catholics who immigrate to the
North.
 &HT;    Additionally, the pope may hope that the South's Catholic
traditionalism might dilute North American liberalism -- and thus
provide a stricter Catholic counterbalance to secular, post-modern
culture. A more traditional, unified church could combat the sexual
and political movements Rome finds objectionable.
 &HT;    Although the issues facing Roman Catholicism in the Americas
seem completely contemporary, they are entwined with one of Rome's
oldest problems: Protestantism.
 &HT;    In the Americas, as they had in Europe, Catholics and
Protestants handled their differences by separating one from
another. The United States and Canada were Protestant nations with
Catholic minorities left to fend for themselves with recourse to
the law. The rest of the hemisphere was Catholic with Protestant
minorities. The principle formulated in 1648 as a result of the
Thirty Years War in Europe, ``whose territory, whose religion,''
held sway in American religious politics as well.
 &HT;    In North and South America, Catholic and Protestant relations
existed as they had historically. They were bad. For the most part,
Catholics and Protestants had stopped killing one another. But
prejudice, tension and misunderstanding still existed between the
two.
 &HT;    During the 1960s, Vatican II encouraged Catholics to bridge the
gap between themselves and their neighbors. Catholics launched
ecumenical discussions on a world-wide basis. By mid-century,
Catholicism in predominately Protestant countries came to be
perceived as not hostile foreigner but full citizens.
 &HT;    A similar dynamic occurred south of the border. Historically
Catholic countries loosened strictures against proselytization.
Thousands of Protestant missionaries -- mostly fundamentalists and
Pentecostals -- poured into Latin and South America, successfully
converting millions of Catholics to their faith.
 &HT;    In the last fifty years, Americans have witnessed the greatest
religious intermixing between Protestants and Catholics in their
hemispheric history. Catholic ecumenism and immigration created a
greater Catholic presence in the North; Protestant missions
exponentially increased Protestant minorities in the South.
 &HT;    While this shift created greater freedom and inter-faith
cooperation for all Americans, it has also fanned the ancient
flames of Catholic-Protestant tension. And that shift appears to be
the impetus behind the pope's call for a unified church.
 &HT;    For Protestants, the changes have been mostly positive. As the
hemisphere's minority, ecumenism and evangelism strengthened
Protestant presence in every country. In just the last decade,
Protestantism has grown by 40 percent in Mexico alone. In addition,
innumerable Catholic immigrants to the United States have broken
with Catholicism and converted to Protestantism.
 &HT;    Thus, while Catholicism gained acceptance, Protestantism gained
adherents. The demographics worry Rome. If current conversion rates
continue, some parts of Latin America may boast Protestant
majorities. Not since the Reformation has Rome faced such
large-scale defections to Protestantism.
 &HT;    Unifying the church directly counters the Protestant challenge
by repositioning and strengthening Catholicism. It also undercuts
ecumenical achievements and inter-faith understanding and could
intensifies regional religious competition.
 &HT;    Rome may not, however, have much choice. Losing people means
losing power, influence and money. Even if Protestantism fails to
win numerical majorities, its influence on Latin America is already
being felt through movements for democracy and social equality. For
Rome, this is more than dwindling church attendance. The future of
Catholic Christendom hangs in the balance.
 &HT;    Rome has always looked warily toward the United States. For
here, as nowhere else, one possible Catholic future exists: Roman
Catholicism is one religion among many in a culture defined by
Protestant individualism and religious pluralism. Although
Protestantism may be the region's numerical minority, its ethos
shapes all of the Americas.
 &HT;    Many U.S. Catholics have adjusted to this by elevating
individual conscience and ignoring church authorities. North
American Catholics are ``good'' Catholics by resembling ``good''
Protestants -- mostly through personal virtue and church
attendance. Obedience to Catholic dogma has little to do with it.
In the Americas, religious intermixing has created Protestantized
Catholicism. And that is what the Vatican dreads.
 &HT;    If Latin and South American Catholicism embrace this highly
Protestantized form -- as they threaten to do -- Roman Catholicism
cannot survive as it does presently. With Protestantization comes
anti-hierarchicalism, ideals of personal liberties (including
sexual ones), and theological libertarianism -- hardly John Paul's
vision for Christianity's next millennium.
 &HT;    Depending on one's view, this is either the most exciting or the
most deeply troubling moment in Roman Catholic history. John Paul
II appears to believe it the latter. Those of us in the United
States see things differently.

HIGH ART MEETS WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manhattan is an island of islands, a patchy mosaic of
cliques and neighborhoods, overlapping yet often unaware of one
another _ and thrown into shock, or delight, when they converge.
</P>
<P>
   The World Financial Center is among the largest _ and, one would
think, least porous _ of these patches. The marble-and-glass
behemoth, headquarters to some of the planet's mightiest
money-houses, practically forms its own city, sprawled out across 6
million square feet and serving as the workplace for 39,000 people
_ with another 50,000, from the twin-towered World Trade Center
across the street, joining them for lunch or shopping in its
built-in mall.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, often, when these brokers, bankers, bookkeepers, and
secretaries zip down to the mall, they smack right into one of
those parallel universes. There's a show going on, with musicians,
poets, dancers, or installation-artists. Some of the performers are
famous, but most are more apt to be found in cramped nightclubs,
sidestreet galleries, or converted warehouses. Few have ever
performed for so many three-piece suits.
</P>
<P>
   These encounters have been going on for 10 years now and,
judging from the crowds they draw (on average, 1,200 per event) and
the corporate subsidies they consume ($21 million, to date),
everyone seems to like them.
</P>
<P>
   This culture-convergence is the brainchild of Anita Contini,
who, despite her title _ vice president of the World Financial
Center arts and events program _ seems as improbably suited to the
corporate realm as her arts-happenings are to this stone-cold
corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   Her main funders are American Express, Merrill Lynch, and World
Financial Properties Inc., the center's original property owners,
but every firm in the building ponies up a mandatory fee to keep
the show going.
</P>
<P>
   Contini sold the idea to the companies as something ``important
for the quality of life of their employees who work here, and for
the image of the World Financial Center as a world-class public
space.'' She added, ``They get great PR out of this _ they look
fresh, they look smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the events take place at the Winter Garden, a vast,
glass-and-steel atrium that comes inescapably into view when one
steps out onto the center's 300,000 square feet of public space.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Druckman of the Battery Park City Authority, the agency
that owns the center's land, has spent many hours watching office
workers come upon these events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see people walking through who think they're not
interested in, say, modern dance _ and then something strikes
them,'' Druckman said. ``They stop and they stay, and they stay a
little longer. That's the magical thing about this program.''
</P>
<P>
   It works for the artists, too. John Schaefer, who hosts a local
public radio show called ``New Sounds,'' has booked musicians for
Contini. Last November, Robert Fripp, leader of King Crimson,
played four sets of his out-there electric solo piece, ``Guitar
Soundscapes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I interviewed Fripp afterwards,'' Schaefer recalled, ``and he
said he loved playing there, for the privilege. . . of offering his
music to people who didn't know him and didn't know what he was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Contini, a wire of energy in her early 50s, is well versed in
mixing downtown business and downtown art. Over 25 years ago, she
helped start a nonprofit arts group called Creative Time. Downtown
property was cheap, so communities of artists sprang up, putting on
concerts and exhibitions in lofts or some nearby hole-in-the-wall _
right in the shadow of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed there were these existing communities _ business and
artists _ that didn't mingle at all,'' Contini recalled. ``So I
thought maybe there's a way to extend what we were doing to a
different kind of public art. I was new to this. I didn't know that
it wasn't easy to go ask business people for money or for space. So
I went and asked them. Turned out, it was easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The recession had hit New York hard, and there were plenty of
vacant buildings. Morley Cho ran a shipping company with 6,400
square feet of empty space at 88 Pine Street, a building designed
by I. M. Pei, and was eager to turn it over to Contini.
</P>
<P>
   ``His motive,'' Contini said, ``was that it was lifeless on the
street down there _ all these office towers, people coming to work
with their heads down. He thought the artists could enliven the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   A celebrated result, in 1975, was ``Ruckus Manhattan,'' in which
19 downtown artists created colorful, cartoonish models of the
city's skyscrapers and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate developers were then just starting work on Battery
Park City, a vast mile-long project of parks, offices, and
apartment towers that would stretch along the Hudson River from the
lower tip of Manhattan _ which, today, includes the World Financial
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The whole area was a sandy landfill, so Contini persuaded the
city to let artists, engineers, and architects use it for
experimental projects. She called it Art on the Beach, and it kept
moving north as the development progressed, finally ending in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Contini had a reputation for making bleak settings
fresh. So, the following year, when the World Financial Center was
finished, she was recruited to bring artists to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years and 650 performances later, Contini sometimes misses
her old makeshift quarters. ``But unfortunately, or fortunately,''
she said, ``you've got to move on.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pre-purse era _ In the B.C. years when Greeks and
Romans ruled, men carried their money in little drawstring bags
around their waist and women used pockets and their full, puffy
sleeves to hide their necessities. Of course, women in those days
didn't have cash, cosmetics, compacts and cell phones to worry
about, so there wasn't much need for a purse.
</P>
<P>
   13th century _ Still no purses, but small leather pouches called
aulmonieres were invented to carry alms for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   17th century _ The term pocketbook is used, but it held
addresses, not wallets.
</P>
<P>
   18th century _ Women carried traveling bags, as well as a small
elongated bag called a reticule. It was usually ornate with beads
and lace and hung around the waist and hips with fancy cord.
</P>
<P>
   19th century _ The term pocketbook is passe, and women are
talking about their purses and handbags still based on the reticule
design. The hot handbag designers of the era are Whiting &AMP; Davis,
known for those fringed mesh evening bags many celebs carry to the
Oscars, and Georges Vuitton who created canvas bags with the LV
monogram for his father, Louis.
</P>
<P>
   20th century _ Handbags become important accessories designed in
myriad shapes and sizes to complement a woman's figure and ensemble
and carry all of her feminine accouterments. It's also the birth of
the first metal-frame bag by the Vuitton family.
</P>
<P>
   1920s _ Small clutch bags are all the rage, designed to hold
compacts, lip rouge, cigarette lighters, gloves and embroidered
hankies as well as money and keys.
</P>
<P>
   1940s _ During the war years, women carried military-inspired
shoulder bags that left their hands free, as well as handmade corde
or gimp bags, made of rows of braided fabric sewn together.
</P>
<P>
   1950s _ The war is over and women are excited about fancy
clothes again, so they need purses to go with each outfit, and they
copy what their favorite movie stars are wearing, whether it's a
clear plastic box with handles, a straw tote, or Coco Chanel's
famous quilted shoulder bag that remains a fashion favorite.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, when actress Grace Kelly married Prince Rainier of
Monaco, her favorite leather handbag by Hermes is officially named
the ``Kelly bag,'' while Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren are linked
with Ferragamo bags.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade, Gucci introduced the now-classic bag
with bamboo handles and Vuitton has created the draw-string
bucket-bag, originally designed to carry a bottle of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   1960s _ We're in handbag heaven with numerous styles from
tasteful to tacky. In the early part of the decade there are purses
for lunch, dinner and dancing, requiring women to constantly change
purses. Once the domain of leather goods makers, purses now are
inspired by designers such as Pucci, who was known for wild color
combos in geometric patterns, as well as changing lifestyles. As
air travel becomes commonplace, purses shaped like travel and
camera bags become popular. Then the gypsy and hippie trends had
women looking for handcrafted designs, particularly fringed leather
tote bags worn slung over the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   1970s _ Fashion takes a dive, and ladylike purses are passe.
Straw purses that look like miniature picnic baskets, satchels,
hobo bags and old-fashioned physician's bags become popular purse
choices. Disco becomes hot, and women start carrying tiny bags to
hold an ID card, cash, keys and lipstick. The bags have extra-long
straps to wear across the chest while dancing.
</P>
<P>
   1980s _ It's the Reagan era and everybody's dressing up again.
Status handbags by Chanel, Hermes, Ferragamo and Vuitton look great
with power suits, but Chanel's small quilted shoulder bag with a
gold chain is the ultimate must-have, and numerous designers copy
it. Newcomer Miuccia Prada starts making her now-famous nylon
totes, but they don't catch on until the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   1990s _ In the early part of the decade, grunge fashion inspires
utilitarian bags such as totes and backpacks, although most women
prefer basic leather shoulder bags without a designer label. By
1995, Coach becomes an American favorite, noted for its
practicality and soft brown leather.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, hard-frame ladylike bags with handles are back, and the
must-have is Princess Diana's fave, the Lady Dior by Christian
Dior, which is noted for its gold charms dangling from the handles.
For younger women, the popular purse is a dainty tote in gingham or
straw by newcomer Kate Spade.
</P>
<P>
   Black-tie galas are in, too, so women start investing in antique
beaded bags or Judith Leiber's incredibly pricey ($5,000 and up)
pave crystal evening bags like those worn by stars to the Oscars. &QL;

SPRING IS IN THE BAG

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a good year for bag ladies.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of basic black leather or nylon
go-with-everything purses, handbags are blooming with flowers,
bright colors and nostalgic novelties.
</P>
<P>
   Think of straw totes with gingham lining, nylon body pouches
that wrap around your arm or waist, vinyl bags that look like they
could carry a bowling ball, tiny drawstring styles, classic leather
designs in shocking pink, and ladylike purses accented with plastic
handles and fabric flowers.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like a trip to ``Pleasantville,'' you're halfway
there.
</P>
<P>
   According to L.A. purse designer Julie Feldman, the
goes-with-everything black leather bag is out, and colorful bags
inspired by the '50s are hot. ``The old idea that everything
matches _ hat, dress, purse, shoes and gloves _ is all the rage in
Paris right now, and we'll be seeing more of it here,'' she
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   For those fashion-savvy retro fans, Feldman not only has
ladylike satin purses trimmed with multicolor ribbon roses,
Austrian crystals and big, splashy flowers, but a complete line of
matching purse accessories, including money clips, nail clippers,
hair brushes, pill boxes, small mirrors and magnifying glasses for
boomers who refuse to get bifocals to read restaurant menus. Plus
gloves and hair ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman says her purse project began last year and has become a
cottage industry located in the Valley. ``I wanted to create
something that was happy and fun, and it seems to have caught on,''
she says, referring to her designs seen on TV shows such as
``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ``Sunset Beach'' and ``Caroline in the City,''
and sold in boutiques all over town.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping to create a handbag heaven are Roniya Alexandra of
San Francisco-based JuJu, who designs elegant organza evening bags
with tassels that are available at Nordstrom stores; Sarah Shaw of
Los Angeles, who uses vintage fabric and a pair of pinking shears
for her trendy totes sold at Barneys and Nordstrom; and Karan Feder
of Hollywood, who uses funky fake fur, clear plastic and
AstroTurf-style artificial grass for her outrageous purses sold at
Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The new kids in the purse department are giving last year's hot
designer Kate Spade some major competition, and getting notice from
traditional purse makers like Chanel, Fendi, Ferragamo, Hermes,
Vuitton and Coach. To stay fresh, Chanel has introduced its new
aeronautically designed 2005 handbag; Fendi has a new
croissant-style purse covered in pastel sequins; Ferragamo has
created its own version of the Kelly bag; and Hermes has
reintroduced its canvas and leather-trim bag from the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Vuitton is still logo-conscious, but it has a clever little
leather box with a handle that looks swell sitting on the table of
a chichi restaurant, and the all-American Coach company has taken
its comfy-but-clunky bags and made them smaller, smoother and more
colorful. In short, more hip.
</P>
<P>
   Even Miuccia Prada, who introduced the world to parachute nylon
backpacks in the '70s, has waxed nostalgic with little silver
leather evening bags. But she also has a line of brightly colored
nylon body pouches to wear to the gym _ or on the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan, once known as the queen of power suits, has gotten
a big dose of '50s spring fever. Her latest collection includes
small straw tote bags accented with flowers, much like the one
Barbie carries in her postcard book, ``Nostalgic Barbie'' (Running
Press; $8.95).
</P>
<P>
   But DKNY fans need not worry. Karan, like Barbie, knows about
our need to change accessories. And flowers soon wilt.

TV BLOOPER LED TO TV CAREER FOR EX-MISS AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a child, she dreamed of playing the violin at Carnegie Hall
and sometimes practiced five hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   But by age 16, Gretchen Carlson says, she knew that the world
was so much bigger than music. She could become a lawyer, for
instance. And so with the same fervor with which she pursued her
musical aspiration, she went off to Stanford University to pursue
that dream.
</P>
<P>
   But then her mother decided that Carlson could also be Miss
America. Carlson soon warmed to the idea, dropped out of college
for a year to prepare, and, in 1989, became the first classical
violinist to win the coveted title.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, how the Minnesota native ended up moving to
Fort-Worth Dallas last December to anchor the weekend news at
KXAS/Channel 5 is a whole other story.
</P>
<P>
   It all began during her reign as Miss America. Carlson thought
she was doing a live video conference with 5,000 engineers who were
going to explain the workings of a satellite named for Miss
America.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, actor Gary Collins and his wife, former Miss America
Mary Ann Mobley, were called off the set, leaving Carlson to do all
the talking with the help of cue cards, some of which were out of
order, upside down or missing words.
</P>
<P>
   The producers ``were pretending to try to help me, but it was
all a joke,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   There was no video conference with engineers, Carlson later
found out. Instead, she was the target of TV's ``Bloopers and
Practical Jokes.'' But, she apparently pulled off the situation
with finesse.
</P>
<P>
   An agent who saw the segment called her and asked if she was
interested in a TV career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one experience,'' she says, ``scooted me over here
instead of law school.''
</P>
<P>
   But though the 32-year-old Carlson's route to television news
was admittedly circuitous, she says there's a connection between
her early years in music, her reign as Miss America and her news
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that red light goes on,'' she says, referring to the TV
camera's on-air cue, ``it's the same exact feeling I got when I
walked on stage: You're on.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson now has 10 years of television news experience, having
worked at stations in the Twin Cities; Richmond, Va.; and most
recently, as an anchor at WOIO in Cleveland. At the urging of her
former Cleveland boss, KXAS news director Kimberly Godwin-Webb,
Carlson joined Channel 5 as a reporter and weekend news anchor
opposite Calvin Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin-Webb describes Carlson as a ``true professional who comes
to work to win. She is a real go-getter who believes in teamwork
and works hard to get great stories on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson says her typical day at Channel 5 begins around 2:30
p.m. and ends sometime after 10. The day always begins with making
a list of things to do, including finding time to work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm highly organized. It's one of my better traits,'' she
says. ``Actually, I'm probably overly organized. The first thing I
do when I wake up is write a list. As a reporter, I need to be on
top of things. I keep a list beside my bed.''
</P>
<P>
   TV news reporting, she says, is about communicating with people
and getting them to tell their story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I report three days a week,'' Carlson says. ``That's why I
took this job. As the main anchor, my reporting was not utilized in
Cleveland, but I have the best of both worlds here. I get to report
and anchor the news.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carlson, who recently married Casey Close, a baseball agent
with International Management Group, says she isn't in Texas just
for the work. She wants to become part of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, I wake up and I try to do the best job I can,'' she
says. ``But I also want to be involved in the community. I want to
work with kids, talk to them about the importance of education and
introduce them to music.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a beauty queen.

BURNING A HOLE IN DEEP POCKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kristy French was having trouble
deciding between a pink and black Picasso and a very blue,
sun-dappled Monet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. French, a young collector from Dallas, was at the
International Art and Antique Fair here _ which closes on Sunday _
hoping to expand her collection of 20th-century art.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Picasso. ``It's just a little picture,'' she
explained. ``Cubist, from 1922. But I just bought a Lichtenstein _
1992 _ and it's very similar in style. That's something I like to
do _ weave a thread between them.'' Both paintings, she said, have
the same color scheme and similar zigzagging lines. The Picasso,
about the size of, say, a Town &AMP; Country magazine, was marked
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. French, 35, and Barry Williams, her interior designer friend
(her husband, Jim, was back in Dallas putting together land deals
around a new sports arena), were among the hundreds of antiques
lovers who gathered in a tent here last Thursday night for the
``vernissage'' _ Eurospeak for opening _ of the city's
three-year-old antiques fair. As the evening wore on, the ratio of
young collectors to old collectors tipped as the price of admission
dropped from $1,000 to $125 after 8:30. And what had been a
smattering of relative youth became, if not a solid bloc, a notable
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The younger patrons _ defined by David Lester, the show's
organizer, as ``men and women in their late 40s, people we were not
getting at this fair before'' _ contributed to this year's success.
Last year, Lester said, the opening raised $100,000 for the Norton
Gallery of Art here; this year, the museum reaped almost twice as
much.
</P>
<P>
   And while almost everyone at the vernissage was dressed divinely
_ lace the color of Ceylon tea was voguish for the older women,
silvery satin for the younger _ it was the under-40 crowd that lent
panache to the event, smiling sunny 90-degree smiles for paparazzi
and consulting with spouses, decorators and friends on cellular
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sands, 36, and Samantha Maltezos, 28, dropped in at
about 7:30. A collector of 20th-century furniture and American
Indian crafts, Sands compared the January Winter Antiques Show at
the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan with the Palm Beach fair.
At the armory, he said, ``you walk in and feel like all your
clothes just received a starching.'' The New York show, he added,
is a furniture show, with some old masters paintings, ``fit for
Fifth Avenue mansions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach, ``what happens is they pick all the colorful
things for the seashore,'' he said, as he studied a $2.7 million
Fernand Leger painting, which would be bought the next day _ but
not by him. Sands, who said he was ``into telecommunications'' in
Sun Valley, Idaho, has homes in New York, Sun Valley and Palm
Beach, where he now spends four or five months a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. French was among the first of the younger patrons. ``I never
miss these openings, because one time I missed a painting by Bo
Bartlett,'' she said, referring to the figurative artist born in
Georgia. ``By the time I saw it, it had one of those terrible red
dots on it. Since then, I've bought every painting by him I
liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Just around the corner, Ruth and Christopher H.A. Cecil were
admiring a $2.5-million unfinished Renoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like it,'' said Cecil, 33, adding that he had been
raised at Biltmore, the Vanderbilt summer retreat in Asheville,
N.C., now a house museum. ``My parents were the last to live in
it.'' He also mentioned his great-great-great-grandfather Cornelius
Vanderbilt, ``who built Grand Central Station,'' and ``Grandfather
Cecil'' from Britain, whose family treasures from Burghley House _
15th- and 16th-century Italian paintings _ will be exhibited at the
Society of the Four Arts here this month. (In Palm Beach, there
seems to be a great divide between those who have ancestors and
those who do not _ or do not mention them when meeting strangers.)
</P>
<P>
   Cecil and his wife appraised the Renoir, ``Mother and
Children.'' ``You can see the canvas showing through,'' he said.
``It's a sketch, a classic Renoir face, but he hasn't quite
completed it. The colors are there _ it's really quite unique.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cecils, who have lived here for six years, bought a 1930s
house by the Palm Beach architect Marion Sims Wyeth and are still
decorating it. ``There's so many decisions,'' Mrs. Cecil, 34, said,
glancing toward the Renoir as the dealer hovered.
</P>
<P>
   In another corner of the tent, a young couple, dressed to kill,
chatted near Picasso's $2.4 million ``Jacqueline at a Window.''
Jill Hepworth Crompton, 31, an interior designer and Palm Beach
socialite, whose photograph appears prominently in the current Palm
Beach Illustrated, laughingly denied she had come to buy. She was
at the fair ``because of the remarkable scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle, two stylish young women, Tuty Mena, 31, and
Cathy Vedori, 34, who wore diamond earrings with black pearls the
size of bubble-gum balls, were admiring a $900,000 Jean-Michel
Basquiat. Ms. Mena showed off a ring she had just bought from Fred
Leighton, the Madison Avenue jeweler, who has a booth here: a tiny
ebony elephant that she said was used to weigh opium.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the younger collectors, at least on opening night,
gravitated toward modern works. At Landau Fine Art, the booth with
the $2.7 million Leger, Robert Landau said on Sunday that he had
just that hour sold two pictures to young collectors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several dealers pointed to the nearly empty Art Deco booths.
``The dealers have to learn to accommodate themselves to the
market,'' Lester said, a tactful way of questioning whether the
Palm Beach crowd's appetite for shagreen and highly polished
rosewood had been overestimated. (By Tuesday, he reported, the Art
Deco dealers ``had started doing business,'' and he gave the
example of the Philippe Denys booth, where a 1930 Gio Ponti cabinet
of rosewood, silvered gilt and brass, marked at $45,000, had been
sold. Nevertheless, Denys later termed his business at the fair
``interesting, but quite slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one younger man interviewed at the opening, Christopher
Fillichio, 36, described himself as a furniture collector. Spotted
peering over a combination bench and bookcase, a 1952 Charlotte
Perriand design, Fillichio, who builds prefabricated houses, said
he collected Carlo Mollino, Gerrit Rietveld and plywood by Marcel
Breuer. Before the night was over, he bought the Perriand piece,
priced at $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   After days of hard bargaining, Ms. French, the collector from
Dallas, bought neither the Picasso nor the Monet. She chose a
Matisse aquatint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer to do things in a more relaxed manner _ have the
dealer ship it to me for approval, for instance,'' she said. ``But
everything at the show was so rushed _ so many people were
interested in it _ that I just went ahead and took it.'' And the
price? ``My husband said I can't say,'' Ms. French said primly.

NEW, IMPROVED FORCE-FEEDBACK JOYSTICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE HUTSKO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're flying a World War II prop fighter. An enemy plane floats
across your sights. You squeeze the trigger on your joystick and it
rat-tat-tats vigorously in your grip. An instant later, a weighty
lunge nearly rips the joystick right out of your hand. It's enemy
fire, from behind. Your engine sputters. Nose takes a dive. A fast
free-fall with no sensation at all, then one final shudder from the
stick when plane meets ground.
</P>
<P>
   This scene could be played out with any number of video games,
but players who take their fun very seriously are no longer content
with better-looking on-screen cockpits and dashboards. They want a
more realistic ``feel'' from a new crop of add-on gaming devices,
with a feature known as ``force feedback,'' which react and respond
in the player's hands to what is happening on screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have taken an interest in realism, which has driven
technology forward,'' says Mark Szabo, editor in chief of Force
One, a Web site dedicated to force feedback (www.force-1.com).
``Game developers have finally started to take advantage of the
hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   While force-feedback joysticks have been around for a couple of
years, the latest devices promise more realistic response,
better-built designs and, most important, better support for the
kinds of games that take advantage of them _ flying and driving
games. The force feedback effects are created by high-torque motors
that respond to instructions from game programs. Hit a bump in the
road or fire a machine gun and the device responds accordingly,
with a staccato vibration of the joystick or a weighty jolt in the
steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   In such a situation, a force feedback wheel challenges the
player's grip with a harder-to-hold tug that feels familiarly
unnerving _ and exhilarating _ to anyone who has ever experienced
the anxious few seconds of a real-life blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Just like being there? Not quite. But as feedback effects edge
closer to imitating the real thing, enthusiastic gamers are willing
to shell out cash to get their hands on the goods. The new devices
cost between $100 and $250.
</P>
<P>
   The first mass market force-feedback joystick, the Force FX, was
introduced in November 1996 by CH Products, which uses a technology
called I-Force, created by Immersion Corp. Immersion's designs were
inspired by highly specialized force feedback devices used for such
applications as military training and steering robotic hands to add
and remove volatile core reactor rods in nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Several manufacturers have licensed I-Force technology for their
products. But not Microsoft, maker of the very popular Flight
Simulator game. Wanting in on the fun, the company went shopping
for a force feedback technology to call its own. They found it at a
design firm called EXOS, absorbing its people and technology into
its ever-growing hardware division, which also produces mice,
ergonomic keyboards and even cordless phones.
</P>
<P>
   Where the devices vary are in price, esthetic design, special
features and how they connect to the computer. Microsoft's
Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro has an angular, split-level design
that is lighter and takes less space than Logitech's smooth and
curvy Wingman Extreme. The Sidewinder, which in its second
generation has lost the noisy cooling fan that gamers had
complained about, connects to a computer's game controller port.
The Wingman connects to a serial port, although it also accepts
optional snap-in cartridges to enable a variety other connection
options, including Universal Serial Bus ports. USB ports offer the
potential for more responsive feedback because they operate at
higher speeds than serial or game controller ports.
</P>
<P>
   In the force feedback wheel lineup, Act Labs' Force RS wheel is
wrapped in soft rubber and feels nice in the hands _ especially
comforting when the action turns white-knuckled. Optional
connectors make it work with not only PCs but also video game
systems like Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Microsoft's
Sidewinder Force Feedback Wheel, which is cushioned in the 3 and 9
o'clock positions, works only with PC's running Windows.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most significant difference in both kinds of devices is
what's inside them. The Microsoft products use gears to activate
and agitate their force feedback wheel and joystick devices.
Skipping gears altogether, the Logitech Wingman Force uses a series
of cables for tugging its stick to and fro. Players on several
newsgroups and Web sites dedicated to computer games report that
feedback effects produced with the cable-based stick feel better
and less harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Szabo at Force One attributed the difference to the space
between the gear teeth in the Microsoft Sidewinder. ``The cable
system in the Logitech Wingman alleviates this space,'' he said.
``There's no gear backlash, and response is smoother and more
immediate.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitive advantages and arguments aside, is force feedback a
geeky gimmick, or does it give gamers more than just throbbing,
sweaty palms? Szabo thinks so. ``There are many games out there
where force feedback improves player performance by providing
physical cues as to what's happening in the virtual world,'' he
said. He sited, for instance, ``the feeling when the tires are
breaking loose'' in a racing game. ``This indicates how close to
the edge of the envelope they're pushing the virtual race car.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest application of force feedback is finding its way to
the computer mouse. Dubbed Feelit technology by Immersion, the
device will respond tactilely to clicks and drags on screen.
</P>
<P>
   This is interesting to the players of first-person 3-D shooter
games like Quake and Half-Life, whose preferred method of play is a
combination of keyboard and mouse. (The keyboard is used for basic
character movement: forward, backward, jumping, crouching. The
mouse is used to ``free look''in the 3-D environment _ a nudge left
or right or up or down follows the player's virtual line of sight
in the same direction, providing a full 360 degrees of freedom.) A
force feedback mouse could be used to convey the rumble of firing a
canon, or the agony of being hit by enemy fire or falling from a
high terrace to a hard dungeon floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the console video game world, Nintendo made news in 1997 when
it introduced the Rumble Pack, a small cartridge that snaps into
the Nintendo 64 controller. The cartridge, which operates on two AA
batteries, houses a small motor that responds to on-screen action
cues. Sony has since come out with a batteryless controller for the
Playstation. Both represent force feedback at its most limited.
</P>
<P>
   But Shigeru Miyamoto, the Nintendo game designer who invented
Super Mario, hopes his latest best-selling game changes that
impression. ``We've made the N64 Rumble Pak a part of the Legend of
Zelda: Ocarina of Time in a new way, never seen before in video
games,'' Miyamoto said. ``For the first time, a video game
accessory will work on a proactive basis _ shaking to clue players
into action _ as well as on a reactive basis, shaking in response
to something that has already happened.'' It's the golden fleece of
feedback: the sensation that helps you win. But, of course, there's
a catch. ``In order for the Rumble Pak to work at all, players will
need to search for and find an item that will enable it,'' Miyamoto
said.

   NEW YORK _ The genius of Harold Arlen, whose songs range from
``Ac-centchu-ate the Positive'' and ``I've Got the World on a
String'' to ``One for My Baby'' and ``Over the Rainbow,'' will be
celebrated Friday and Saturday at Alice Tully Hall when Lincoln
Center for the Performing Arts begins ``Lincoln Center's American
Songbook,'' a new series on American songs and songwriters. This
weekend's semi-staged performance, ``I've Got a Right to Sing the
Blues,'' with full orchestral accompaniment, theatrical lighting
and slide projections, will feature Barbara Cook, Diana Krall, Jay
Leonhart, Audra McDonald, Maureen McGovern, Richard Muenz, Ken Page
and Mike Renzi. The next installment in the series is ``Richard
Rodgers: With a Song in My Heart,'' on March 5 and 6. It continues
with four more programs, scheduled for this fall and the spring of
2000.

   In the late 1920s, when Max Beckmann had achieved stature as a
German artist, he moved to Paris to compete with contemporaries
like Matisse, Picasso and Braque and seek international fame. ``If
one could only once hang our pictures together so that the people
could judge for themselves,'' Beckmann said. Now the opportunity is
at hand in ``Beckmann and Paris,'' an exhibition opening on
Saturday at the Saint Louis Art Museum. The show, which was
organized with the Kunsthaus Zurich and runs through May 9,
assembles for the first time nearly 100 paintings by Beckmann,
Picasso, Matisse, Braque, Leger, Georges Rouault and Robert
Delaunay and illustrates how Beckmann's themes and esthetic
approaches often paralleled those of his contemporaries in Paris.

<P>
   New York _ Swing will definitely be in the air Friday night when
Pace University sets the Roy Gerson Swing Orchestra to playing
music for dancers who favor the Lindy and the like. The event,
called ``Winterfest: Celebration of Swing Dancing,'' starts to
bounce at 8 p.m. at the Pace University Student Union Building at 1
Pace Plaza opposite City Hall Park in lower Manhattan.

ALL THAT GLITTERS IS PLASTIC AND VINYL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Accent on Design exhibition at this week's New
York gift show, where manufacturers show off products for the
coming year, was awash with items for the home in metallic plastic.
These are not plastic glasses and garbage cans spray-painted copper
or silver, understand, but objects molded of a polypropylene or
vinyl where the metal color is part of the material. Their flowing
shapes, loose and liquid as some special effect from ``Terminator
2,'' flaunt their plasticity. They seem to inhabit some alchemical
middle state between plastic and metal.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Umbra stand, at Authentics and Interdesign and Totem,
last year's frosty pastels have been superseded by hues that carry
names like silver, copper, titanium, metallic oxide and metallic
iris. One reason for the shift lies in the relentless march of
fashion in home furnishings. Another is the continuing redemption,
even glorification, of plastic, now presented as a precious
material. Thus the titanium waste can and the pearlescent
toothbrush holder. (This pearlescent is not to be confused with
pearl or even mother-of-pearl; think of it, maybe, as mother-in-law
of pearl.) There was the gold laundry bin and the silver flatware
tray. There were coppery greens and metallic blues, too, like
``blued'' or hardened steel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the next thing,'' Mary Handeland, national sales manager
for Authentics, said brightly. At her booth, silver and deep cobalt
blue glowed and glinted on the shelves. David Savchuk, national
sales manager for Interdesign, was similarly smitten: ``We expect
this will be really big for back-to-school,'' he said. He was
already looking down the road to students outfitting rooms with the
company's storage boxes and cans, which wore cuprous and argentine
hues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Interdesign, Umbra and other companies, metallics are a way
to fight cheap knockoffs. For not only do they change the fashion
ground rules, but also metallics are trickier to mold and allow
high-end plastic manufacturers to showcase their expertise.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Metallics,'' Savchuk said, ``are harder to produce in ways
that don't show the join lines. They also tend to clump in the mold
if not carefully fabricated.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is buying. At Heller plastics, where there was an
abundance of creams and yellows and a few silvery-grays, Alan
Heller sniffed at metallic as novel. ``We've had metallic cans and
other items for years now,'' he said. But elsewhere, plastics
wearing the look of precious materials were present in force.
</P>
<P>
   At the Totem stand was a new crop of products from Inflate, the
London company best known for its plastic bowls and vases filled
with air. Now, Inflate has turned to a sometimes metallic,
sometimes pearlescent sort of vinyl, out of which it makes
backpacks and cell-phone cases. For David Shearer, one of the
owners of Totem, in TriBeCa, these metallics, flecked with tiny
micalike bits of brightness, echo old bicycles and hot rods. ``I
can still remember those Schwinn bikes with metal fenders and
banana seats,'' he said. Some wore the candy-apple metallic red of
hot rods of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But if the metallic look harkens back to the past, it also looks
forward to a future of space-suit fabrics and pliable robots. A
Garbo garbage can from Umbra in silver would be at home with the
Jetsons. To Steven Holt of Frogdesign, the industrial design firm,
who teaches the history of industrial design at California College
of Arts and Crafts in San Francisco, the metal look ``is visual
future-speak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Metal is the apotheosis of the machine,'' Holt said. ``It's
about a still inchoate sense that the future is now part of our
present. It's a consumerized vision of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   We've already seen the return of metal to stereo components,
where brushed steel, dusted with irony, perhaps as a reprise of
'70s equipment, has taken over from professional black. Digital and
Advanced Photo System cameras have also given up the black look.
The metallic-looking materials of which they are made are only
occasionally actual metal; mostly, they are high-impact plastic.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as they imply the future, metallic plastics may be a
fitting material for the present, the right stuff for the times.
Their appeal lies in the subtle and elusive play of surface and
ambiguity about substance. Once, we had a president who was
described as Teflon. Now, we have one whose moral pliability
coexists paradoxically with glitteringly high popularity and golden
poll ratings. Each day brings new gloss to a stock market drunk on
a high-tech future, while Wall Street veterans warn that beneath
the glistening valuations lies stuff less sterling.

TWEAKING THE TRIED AND TRUE AT THE COLOGNE FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: optional sidebar appears in 2nd take)  
 (bl)  
 By ARLENE HIRST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Material was the message at the International
Furniture Fair, where retailers find the broadest range of
contemporary furniture available. Exhibitors in January, some 1,600
from 46 countries, were out of new ideas about form, stuck as they
were in the minimal, spare look of the 1970s. So they turned to
substances for inspiration. The materials of the moment are neither
cutting edge nor high tech. Instead, designers experimented with
the tried and true _ wood, glass, stainless steel and porcelain _
with surprising results. Here's a preview of the designs likely to
cause the biggest ripples when they arrive in America.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the bathtub by Giampaolo Benedini for Agape. Made of
teak, it has a simple rectangular shape with a luxurious, chaise
longuelike interior. Agape president Emanuele Benedini promised
dubious viewers that cleaning it would be a breeze. ``Just don't
use abrasives or ammonia,'' he advised. The collection will be at
Moss, a store in New York's Soho, this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Silvestrin, former partner of the minimalist architect
John Pawson, chose pietra lecce _ a humble, soft-to-the-touch stone
_ for his king-size, egg-shaped tub for Boffi. You may need a
special house to install it in; it weighs 1,100 pounds. The tub
will be at Boffi's New York showroom this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert Wangen, a Munich designer, covered chests in
stainless-steel mesh, tempering the hard rectangular forms with the
sensuousness of the fabric. They're available through Petersburg
Press in New York. Kurt Erni's sheer, all-glass storage units,
designed for Wellis in a range of shapes and sizes, resemble mini
glass-and-steel skyscrapers. The transparency makes it easy to find
things. The line is at Luminaire in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   At the new lighting hall, porcelain shades gave a softer, warmer
look to lamps. From German designer Ingo Maurer to Babylon Design,
a hip young English company, many were taken with this ancient
material. Maurer's lamps took the form of porcelain vessels,
although he also experimented with light-emitting diodes. His new
lamp, the Bellisima Brutta _ a gangly bouquet of LED flowers with
illumination that, for now, is more striking than effective _ is
just his first step: he expects to introduce an energy-efficient
LED collection in Milan in April.
</P>
<P>
   Designers also played with sophisticated technology for
Palluccoitalia, sealing an electro-luminescent fiber inside clear
plastic for light screens. The ghostly effect, which provides
atmosphere rather than real light, is available through Current, a
Seattle store, in two sizes. The Short Wave screen is $1,425; the
Long Wave, $1,520.
</P>
<P>
   No self-respecting contemporary furniture fair would be complete
without plastic seating. Best-in-show honors went to Matthew Hilton
for his Wait chair, with its sophisticated lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the shape first, before you even see the color,'' said
Murray Moss, owner of the store Moss, who quickly snatched it up.
Authentics, the German company that helped rehabilitate plastic's
image with its beautifully simple housewares, produced Hilton's
design, which draws on the technology used in the ubiquitous resin
garden chair. The Wait chair, at $50, appeals to anyone looking for
comfort and style, indoors or out.
</P>
<P>
   Revivals have become an essential part of any '90s fair.
Cassina's reissue of Le Corbusier's LC5 daybed, out of production
for at least 15 years, was probably the most universally acclaimed
item in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you want to hear about great new designs,'' said Dan
Friedlander, owner of Limn, a store in San Francisco, ``but the
Corbusier is the best thing we've seen.'' The sofa has a polished
chrome, plated-steel frame and black leather cushions. The ones on
the back are hinged onto the rear frame so that they can easily be
flipped over, increasing the depth of the seat to the size of a
single bed. It will sell for about $5,000 at the Cassina store in
New York this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The German manufacturer Thonet presented a virtual history of
its contribution to 20th-century design, some items brand new,
others from the company archives, dating back to 1926. They
included Mart Stam's, Mies van der Rohe's and Marcel Breuer's
tubular steel-frame seating of the 1920s and '30s; a 1934 bar cart
by A. Bamberg, never in production, and new tubular steel bookcases
by Haeberli and Marchand that looked as if they came straight from
Thonet's archives. ICF will distribute the line in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of multipurpose, space-saving furniture:
while American manufacturers focus on producing giant armoires for
the ever-larger suburban home _ items that most city dwellers
couldn't fit through their front doors _ Europeans obsess over
small spaces and the storage needs of the urbanite. Ligne Roset's
Yo-Yo table not only adjusts from cocktail to dining table height,
but also doubles its size.
</P>

   For the last few years, young American designers have been
attending the Cologne and Milan fairs _ not to get ideas but to get
work. ``Manufacturers here will talk to me, and possibly make
things,'' said Harry Allen, who had to resort to making his own
ceramic foam lamps, which are in the permanent collection at New
York's Museum of Modern Art. ``In Europe, there's a tradition of
design. The same environment doesn't exist in the United States.
Design has scared American industry for a long time.''

   When John Hutton resigned from Donghia last November, after 20
years as its acclaimed design director, it was the design-world
equivalent of the breakup of the Beatles _ and it might prove as
fractious. Buyers at the Paris furniture fair in January came
expecting to see Hutton's first solo collection. Instead, they
found an empty booth.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the trade show opened, Donghia was granted an
injunction that stopped Hutton from showing or selling his new
line. (The injunction meant that the line could not be shown the
following week in Cologne, either.)
</P>
<P>
   When the designer, known for his glamorous but comfortable
style, announced his resignation last fall, jaws dropped in the
design community. ``For an entire generation of designers,'' said
Mayer Rus, editor in chief of Interior Design magazine, ``the
Donghia name has been synonymous with John Hutton's vision, rather
than the late Angelo Donghia, as great as he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Of that accomplishment, he said, ``It's a remarkable feat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutton left to create his own company with a group of small
European manufacturers and David Sutherland, a Dallas businessman.
Discussions with Donghia for a settlement began this week, but for
now no one can see _ or buy _ the designs, as their ownership is in
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Jerrold Sonet, Donghia's chairman and the executor of the estate
of Angelo Donghia, who died in 1985, said, ``We took him to court
because we felt that the product belonged to Donghia.'' Sonet
insisted that Hutton could not have completed a new collection in
the two months since he resigned; he believes Hutton must have been
working on it while still in Donghia's employment.
</P>
<P>
   Hutton countered that in the company's early years, he often
created new product lines just as quickly. He added that he had had
only five days to answer the suit, and that the court based its
decision on oral arguments, not the visual evidence that he brought
into court _ sketches and drawings that he said were dated after he
left Donghia.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ruling, only a handful of people have actually
seen the new work _ mostly exhibitors at the Paris show who had
watched Hutton's booth being set up and taken down. Asked whether
the collection looked like Donghia, one manufacturer responded,
``It looked like John Hutton.''
</P>
<P>
   The pieces _ occasional tables, side chairs, lighting, fabric
and upholstery _ were said to have the fluid lines and striking
proportions for which Hutton is known.
</P>
<P>
   Hutton, ever the optimist, is already at work on another
furniture line. ``I'm drawing the collection this weekend,'' he
said, adding he hoped to show it in April.

THE YEAR OF THE CIRCLING WAGONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Washington)   By JAMES RYAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Julia Sweeney's parents, Bob and Jeri, have moved
out. Her boyfriend no longer has to crash in the office out back.
The guest room is empty, save for a few artifacts left behind when
her brother Mike died. The pullout bed in the living room remains
tucked under its corduroy cushions.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this comedian and ``Saturday Night Live'' alumna
has her Hollywood dream bungalow back to herself.
</P>
<P>
   To those who saw her one-woman show, ``Julia Sweeney's God Said,
`Ha!''' about living with cancer in a suddenly reconstituted
nuclear family, or read it in book form (Bantam, 1997), Ms.
Sweeney's parents and her brother are familiar characters. (The
film opens on Feb. 12.)
</P>
<P>
   What is absent from each of these versions is the central
battlefield in her story: her 1,200-square-foot home, which was
host to a nine-month family reunion in 1995 when her parents helped
care for Mike, who had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and for the actress
herself, who learned she had cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweeney was reduced to smuggling her boyfriend in and
sneaking the occasional cigarette. ``It was sort of like being back
in high school, only this time I was paying the mortgage,'' she
recalled as she sat at her round dining room table in her home,
which she bought for $320,000 in 1993 during her last season of
``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The time-warp is heightened by the fact that the small house is
crammed with items from her childhood home in Spokane, Wash., and
her grandmother's home, plus a comprehensive collection of Roman
Catholic artifacts _ plaster nuns, saints, cherubs and Madonnas.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of blocks from Paramount Studios, the home ties
together the two constant threads in her life: religion and show
business. She can hear the bells from a Roman Catholic church a few
blocks away and see the Hollywood sign from her front yard. An
antique Mexican rosary (her grandmother's) is affixed to the wall
above her bed. On the mantel is a painting of Madonna and Child
that has been in her family for 100 years. A kitchy statue of the
Virgin Mary prays beside a small, cobalt-blue tiled swimming pool
with hot tub she built out back.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweeney admits to being a lifelong collector. ``It all
started in 1974, when my parents' house burned down,'' she said.
``You know how people hoard food? I feel that way about stimulating
objects.''
</P>
<P>
   The cozy bungalow proved a fitting hospice as Mike declined
toward death. ``I felt like the spirit of the family was in the
house, like my grandmother Henrietta was there, because so many of
her things were there,'' she said. ``It was a healing
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   One floor-to-ceiling bookcase in her living room is devoted to
religion and philosophy. ``It's not an obsession,'' Ms. Sweeney
insisted. She said she couldn't understand why everyone didn't have
six shelves of religion books: ``It's the most interesting topic
there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweeney, who was raised Catholic, disagrees with much of the
dogma but adores the culture. ``I rejected the church but kept the
art,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the actress seems smaller, prettier than she does on
camera and far younger than her 39 years. Like its owner, the
unimposing facade of the single-story 1923 Mission-style home gives
few hints at the treasures within. ``It's very humble on the
outside and then when you come inside it's really much more than
you think,'' she said. ``This is my style. Because I think that's
how people should be. There isn't much to them until you get to
know them.''
</P>
<P>
   She knits sweaters, sitting in her L.&AMP; J.G. Stickley chair. Her
kitchen spices are hand labeled by purchase date. The 1,500 compact
discs in a Mission-style hutch are logged into the computer and
coded with colored dots. Books are cataloged by author. Bibles are
under G for God.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the accountant in me coming out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweeney grew up in Spokane, one of five children of a U. S.
Attorney and his wife. After Catholic schools, she majored in
accounting at the University of Washington and went to work in the
accounting department of Columbia Pictures. Her turn to comedy, she
believes, was divinely inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would drive to work and hear this voice saying, `You're a
performer,''' she recalled. ``I didn't want to hear it. I was 25
and not particularly good looking and I didn't have a great
figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she signed up for a course called the Business of
Acting, offered by the Groundlings, an improvisational theater
group. Five years later, in 1989, she landed a slot on ``Saturday
Night Live,'' along with Mike Meyers, Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman.
That's when she began playing her androgynous character, Pat.
Feeling out of place after four years because of cast changes (some
critics said the show's glory days were over), Ms. Sweeney left.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1994, she was decorating her Los Angeles bungalow in a
style she calls ``really girlie,'' _ picking out fabric for
curtains, rearranging the nun figurines and planning the rest of
her life when, as she puts it, God said, ``Ha!''
</P>
<P>
   Her first movie, ``It's Pat,'' was savaged by the critics. Then
she received a call from her brother Mike, who was 30 and working
as a box office manager for the Groundlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie bombed on Friday and on Sunday Mike called saying he
was very sick and didn't have insurance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike moved into her bedroom; their parents moved into the guest
bedroom. She began sleeping on a sofa bed in her office, out back.
As she told audiences, ``I found myself walking around thinking
things like, `When I go to college I'm going to get my own dorm
room.'''
</P>
<P>
   While they were all taking care of Michael, God said another
``Ha!'' Ms. Sweeney developed a rare form of cervical cancer, which
required a hysterectomy and a course of chemotherapy. (She says she
seems to be fine now.)
</P>
<P>
   During this period, to let off steam, she would tell funny
stories about her family at the West Hollywood club Luna Park. Her
friends urged her to do a one-woman show. Thus, out of the dark
circumstances of her life was born ``Julia Sweeney's God Said,
`Ha!'''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing it on Broadway for The New York Times, Peter Marks,
praised the author's ``powerful emotional current that has carried
her through the terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Ms. Sweeney's big fears was her parents' reaction. In the
show, she talked about her father's devotion to Cokie Roberts on
National Public Radio _ ``Do you know Cokie broadcast in her
pajamas today?'' She also does wicked impressions of her mother's
stream-of-consciousness way of speaking: ``Oh, I think that
cantaloupe would work, the blouse you want altered is on the bed,
have you seen the car keys?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' they finally said. ``We can handle a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweeney believes her retelling of that time in their lives
helps keep Mike alive for them. ``It was a terrible year, but you
would give everything for one of those days with Mike again,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Memories dispel the loneliness, too.``I think of Mike on the
sofa, in the Jacuzzi, how many fires we had in that fireplace or
the meals we cooked in the kitchen,'' she said. ``Those memories
make me feel less alone. I see the house as a stage where these
incredible events in your life are going to play out.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``We are as we as,'' Colman Rutkin said, meaning that
he and Sage Reynolds were not about to rush around straightening up
their rambling, 12-room house on Staten Island just because a
photographer was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness. In the bleak midwinter, I was looking for people
who didn't need spring to have green, living things keeping them
company. And I didn't want them tidying up seedlings on the kitchen
sink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plants in the bathroom,'' Rutkin said, ``plants in the
attic, plants in the cellar.'' I went right over. His first words
were, ``Sage, do you think she'll fit in the greenhouse?''
</P>
<P>
   Rutkin is 5 feet 4 inches tall, so he doesn't have to hunch down
like Reynolds, who is a half foot taller, to avoid banging his head
against 20 hanging pots of cattleya orchids, while stepping over
the 100 or so clivias that take up most of the floor of the
11-by-18-foot greenhouse the two men put up in their backyard five
years ago. By now, it's packed to the roof with their obsessions:
the orchids, the clivias, echeverias, gasterias, euphorbias, an
azalea or two. And dozens of lithops, which look like the soft pads
of little animals turned upside down in the desert. Tiny little
flowers open in between its two lobes, which vary in color from
gray to rose to magenta, or a chartreuse that seems to glow from
the inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of my favorites,'' Reynolds said, holding up a
little pot with an olive-green pair of toes. ``Lithops otzeniana,''
he said, his mop of brown curls bobbing over the plant. ``It
reminds me of a big mouth of teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   These succulents from South Africa are also known as flowering
stones, and Reynolds has started to hybridize them,
cross-pollinating his favorites with his finger or a Q-Tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were my first love,'' he said. `'When I was a kid, I'd
look through cactus and succulent books, and I couldn't believe all
the colors and textures.'' The lithops weren't widely available
until about 10 years ago, but now you can buy them at Home Depot
for $2 a piece. ``I went crazy when I found out I could actually
grow them and produce crosses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rutkin showed off the striated leaves of Clivia miniata, whose
cream-white stripes (``like old piano keys,'' he said), shade to
gray-green and then a dark green veering toward black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese think they're native to Japan, and the Chinese
think they're native to China,'' Rutkin said, ``but they really
come from the Natal province on the east coast of South Africa.''
C. miniata grows on rocks and trees along the coast, and it can
survive dry periods by drawing moisture out of the air. Sometimes,
a clivia with all green leaves will send up a striped one, which
pleases the Japanese no end, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more noble, the sign of a real aristocrat,'' he went
on. ``Like a lady in a very sober kimono, with something really
flashy inside the sleeves.'' To get out the door, we had to squeeze
by a camellia called Yamato Nishiki (Brocade of Old Tokyo), which
was loaded with pink and white blossoms, and a rhododendron with
long tubular white flowers that smelled of jasmine.
</P>
<P>
   We pictured the yard in spring, when there's a sea of blue and
white crocuses against the south fence. The rhododendrons are a big
event, with Percy Wiseman rhododendron turning from apricot-pink to
peach, and Dreamland opening its neon-pink buds, which slowly fade
to pure white. Reynolds stared down at the white leaves of a
dianthus and described how it would look come May: ``It has 2-inch
flowers with pale pink fringed edges and dark maroon spots in the
center,'' he said. ``It looks like saddle oxfords.'' He laughed
irrepressibly, which seems to happen whenever he thinks of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The two designers met at Florida State University close to 30
years ago, when Rutkin had abandoned a doctoral program in
humanities for a master's in fine arts. Reynolds was an
undergraduate, studying graphics and dance. He started growing
sarracenia, or pitcher plants, in buckets on his patio.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they came to Manhattan and formed the Four Hands
Design Studio and Colman Sage, to produce and market their designs,
which range from gift-wrapping paper and fabric to murals and
folding screens. Reynolds also designs stained-glass lamps and
torcheres, and his luminous paper tapestries _ from the blues and
greens of a Persian paradise garden to the golds of a ginkgo forest
_ line the walls of their sunny, 1920s neo-colonial house. Their
studios are on the third floor: Reynolds paints in the east room;
Rutkin in the west room, a table full of sansevieria keeping him
company.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Where aren't there plants? (In the kitchen closet; it's full of
fertilizer.) Abutilons fill the east windows in the kitchen, a
pisonia lounges on the white enamel sink, its big leaves brushed
with cream and green; a blue dish piled with the cuttings of a jade
plant sits by the faucet. Bottles of plant food share the same
table as a jar of canned peaches and the mixing bowls. Rutkin's
cymbidiums are stashed by the stove, by the closet, by the sliding
door. But only a few ceropegias survived the disaster that struck
Reynolds' collection one night last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went down to 23, and the heat didn't go on,'' Reynolds
said. ``Something like black death attacked the plants. They
probably could have survived the cold, but the cold-and-wet was the
problem.'' These rubbery vines, with hardly a leaf, hark from the
Canary Islands, South Africa and Madagascar, but they don't look
like much on Staten Island, until they cover themselves with their
waxy, intricate flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had about 40 different species,'' Reynolds said, ``but I
lost half my collection that night.'' He preserved color
photographs of their flowers, though, on a disk, and they sprang to
life on the computer: Ceropegia arabica has little minarets; C.
africana has twisted green cages; C. hybrida hort. has a black
velvet top, like a bishop's miter, and C. distincta var.
hayagarthii appears to be waving purple antennae in the air. They
can be viewed on his Web site at
www.users.interport.net/(tilde)colsage/.
</P>
<P>
   Up on the third floor, Rutkin has found the perfect place for
coaxing his clivias into bloom: the trunk room. He has the windows
cracked to keep the room chilly, which is what clivias need to send
up the flower buds hidden inside the axils on their sturdy, long
stalks.
</P>
<P>
   The young seedlings, though, thrive in the warmer temperatures
of the greenhouse and under lights in the cellar, along with
Reynolds' various succulents and cuttings and stacks of pots and
old storm windows (they make such good windbreaks for the rhodies)
and the wheelbarrow.
</P>
<P>
   What they really need, these collectors grumble, is another
greenhouse. ``Something the size of our house,'' Reynolds had said
earlier, hunched like Quasimodo over his lithops. ``We're thinking
of tearing this one down and putting one clear across the back,
with a 20-foot ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, in the dining room that has been given over to
etching presses and plant tables under lights, Reynolds held up
Ceropegia fusca, which looked like a bunch of gray sticks to me
(organ pipes to Reynolds). ``This is one that nobody has gotten to
bloom outside the Canary Islands,'' he said. ``Except maybe in the
Netherlands.''
</P>
<P>
   He fell in love with ceropegias just looking in books on
succulents. ``I was just taken with the flowers,'' he said.
``They're really spectacular.'' Over the years, he has ordered the
plants from catalogs, and traded seeds and cuttings with friends,
so it was hard to lose half of them in one fell swoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, on the Internet, I've got some people in Holland
who I hope will get me some more,'' he said. ``But I've been so
beaten down. I lost so many last year.'' Rutkin calls this ``the
voice of the plant-collector martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   Order of the Lost Ceropegias? How do I join up?

A QUICK FIX FOR THE BLAHS OF WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT within parentheses has been
used in the end note instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I were a truly honest person, I would admit that my motive
for hanging an intricately sequined Haitian voodoo flag over the
fireplace last Sunday was to add some color to a room that, like
the sky outside, was looking a little, well, gray.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unlikely that a truly honest person _ even one
suffering a bad case of seasonal blues _ could persuade my husband
to spend a good part of the afternoon teetering on a stepstool,
hammering nails into the wall. So instead I argued that the flag's
design, which depicted three solemn, dark-haired girls standing
shoulder to shoulder, would bring good luck to a household with
three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I added, although we technically were not practitioners
of a pantheistic religion, it would be foolish to pass up any
opportunity to summon helpful gods _ especially in the winter. (Did
I mention the hard, cold pellets of hail pummeling the
windowpanes?)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I will go to great lengths to combat the winter doldrums, a
malady that besets me in the late afternoons, when it gets dark
before dinner. As the sun sets, so do my spirits. I have tried many
treatments in addition to the sequin cure.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, I devised a simple, three-part strategy for enduring
the worst stretch _ that solitary, single-parenting portion of the
day that lasts from dusk until my husband gets home at 8 p.m. I
would turn up the heat, blast an old Bruce Springsteen album on the
stereo and saute as many onions as necessary to make the house
smell like my grandmother's. That trick worked for a while, but
this winter, instead of feeling cozy, I began to feel trapped, not
so much by my children as by the belief that winter will never end.
</P>
<P>
   I needed to escape. So after my daughters got home from school
the other day, had a snack and settled in with their homework, I
told them I had to go upstairs to my office for a second to check
for phone messages from work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I sneaked off to my secret computer life. It's perhaps
a sign of just how dreary these days can be that a machine can
manage to reaffirm my humanity, doling out small, incremental doses
of comfort disguised as amusing e-mail or ritual tours of my
favorite Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, I begin my computer treatment with a cleansing whine. I
typed a message to an old friend from college: ``Thin layer of ice
(deadly?) on brick path could lead to lawsuit if Fed Ex driver
trips next time ... would ice pick help?'' The topic was
technically a breach of the unspoken contract that requires our
e-mail to focus exclusively on annoying people we knew in college
but have not seen or heard from since 1984. But venting about
winter did perk me up slightly.
</P>
<P>
   I felt invigorated enough, in fact, to take a quick look at
Ebay.com to see if any particularly irresistible items of
Depression glass were being auctioned. But at $9.99 (plus
shipping), the Floragold `Louisa' Cup and Saucer _nice! _ was
slightly beyond the budget of someone who earns a living as a
writer. That reminded me that I hadn't yet read the latest
installment from one of my favorite writers, Anne Lamott. So I
zipped over to Salon magazine to learn how Ms. Lamott recently
achieved a modicum of spiritual comfort by wrapping herself in her
9-year-old son's still-warm blanket after he went off to school.
</P>
<P>
   This made me remember that I had a lot of pending spiritual
questions of my own, even beyond ``Are trees unhappy in the
winter?'' For instance, I started to wonder what powers those
Haitian gods shimmering on the wall downstairs might actually
possess. And since I was already online, it would take only a few
seconds to go to Hotbot to conduct a search on Haitian flags to do
some research. At gallery-guide.com/museum/noma/archive and
egallery.com/flags.html, I found out that the figures on my flag
probably represented lwas, or spirits invoked during a voodoo
religious ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   This led me to Amazon.com, where I found ``Haitian Vodou
Flags,'' a book by Patrick Arthur Polk that discussed the banners'
religious and cultural implications. The book was published by the
University Press of Mississippi, and after I read the description
of the book at www.upress.state.ms.us, I phoned to ask how to reach
the author.
</P>
<P>
   That's how, about 10 minutes later, I found myself eagerly
describing my flag over the phone to Polk, a museum scientist at
the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your flag depicts the three twins, or the holy triplets, of
the vodou religion,'' he said. ``Twins have a sacred power in West
African belief. In fact, this is interesting _ a child born after
twins is considered to have even more spiritual force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So the third girl is the most powerful?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all child protectors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' I said, ``because I have three daughters and
_''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, then this flag is absolutely the thing you've got
to have,'' Polk said excitedly. ``It's perfect. Make nice herbal
baths for the children on Christmas and invoke the holy triplets.''
</P>
<P>
   After I hung up, I realized my secret computer life had consumed
more than an hour of the time that could have been allotted to more
practical pursuits. I couldn't really remember where I had been; I
just knew that I had been away. But now I needed to come back home
to cook dinner. Check over homework. Read the baby's favorite puppy
book to her 40 times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Did I feel guilty about sneaking off? Maybe I should have. But
instead, when I went downstairs to examine the Haitian voodoo flag
again, I was pleased. Then I sat with my children while they
practiced their piano lessons. The music sounded like spring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As if tax forms were not confusing enough, many of the changes
made in tax laws several years back did not go into effect until
this year, showing up for the first time in the tax forms now
piling up in mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   Changes like those in the child tax credit, the Roth IRA and
education tax incentives; similar changes in the tax laws of many
states; the number of people moonlighting, and the effect of stock
market volatility on individual portfolios _ things like these have
made the traditional way of doing income taxes, sitting down at the
dining room table on a winter weekend, seem hopelessly quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can still prepare taxes without anything more than
the Internal Revenue Service forms, work sheets and a pencil, more
people are turning to outside help.
</P>
<P>
   That outside help ranges from professional tax preparers to
desktop software packages and Web sites. Professional tax preparers
can offer a level of hand-holding not available from software and
the Internet. But they can also be intimidating, and their services
typically cost much more than a desktop software package. And for
many people, talking about salaries and net worth is something to
be done only in the privacy of their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of professional help, desktop software, is
available for those who are comfortable with computers and would
rather do their own taxes. Such packages offer help in the privacy
of your home for a reasonable cost. The cost is even more
reasonable if you take advantage of the many discounts and rebates
available.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies selling desktop tax software also sell
professional versions, and both have the core components that
compute taxes. These companies usually offer to pay the penalties
if the actual computations are incorrect, a comforting thought when
staring at a bewildering array of tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   By necessity, the full-featured desktop packages lean toward a
``one size fits all'' approach. They tailor the questions you are
asked according to your earlier answers and figure out which IRS
forms you need, but it occasionally seems as though you fell
through the looking glass as you answer what appears to be the same
question for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   An added benefit is that most of the packages offer electronic
filing and electronic tax payments, which the IRS is pushing quite
hard this year. The tax agency predicts that about 30 million
individual tax returns will be filed electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Barr, the assistant IRS commissioner for electronic tax
administration, said the agency saw a 10 percent increase in
electronic filing last year, to 28 percent. ``This year we are
projecting a 20 percent increase and crossing our fingers,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reason to push electronic filing, which the IRS calls the
E-file program, can be deduced from simple arithmetic. Every paper
return has to be entered by hand into IRS computers, a task that
keeps tens of thousands of people busy at 10 regional centers.
Electronic returns do not have to be entered by hand. And
electronic returns go through rigorous error checks before they can
be transmitted, reducing their error rate to less than 2 percent.
For paper returns, that rate is about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer errors mean fewer contacts with the IRS and faster
refunds, something to please most taxpayers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some things to consider before buying tax software: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the software works on your computer. Many tax packages
have demanding system requirements. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you get all the forms you need.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the program handles your state returns. Not all
programs handle all states. State software can cost extra. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for a program that will import data you already have. If
you used tax software last year or use personal financial software,
some programs can make use of that information. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compare with Web-based programs. Using the Web to prepare taxes
can cost less than using software, but Web software tends to be
slower than a desktop package, have fewer features or both. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never pay list price. You can save money with discounts and
rebates, and it is often cheaper to download software from the Web.
You can deduct the cost on next year's return. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KIPLINGER'S TAXCUT  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (H&AMP;R Block; for Windows 3.1 and later, $34.95; for Macintosh,
$24.95.)
</P>
<P>
   From the wonderful folks who gave you those ubiquitous H&AMP;R Block
storefronts comes Kiplinger's Taxcut, in both desktop and Web
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the desktop packages, Kiplinger's Taxcut uses an
interview to gather information and then enters that information in
the correct tax form.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also like most packages, it allows users to bypass the interview
process and enter the information directly, something not for the
faint of heart. A nice added touch is the ability to pull into what
the program calls the ``fast lane,'' where the user can bypass
queries and go straight to selecting topics and forms.
</P>
<P>
   The program installed quickly, although the registration process
was somewhat painful, gathering more marketing information than I
thought was necessary and allowing registration only through a
dial-up connection, fax or snail mail. Users cannot register
through an Internet connection, which seemed like a strange and
unfortunate oversight.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice to check for software updates before
starting the interview process rather than waiting until going
through a half-dozen screens. It was also a bit perplexing when the
program claimed that it had found my previous year's Taxcut form
and offered to import some of the information because I had not
used the program before.
</P>
<P>
   Taxcut correctly located and imported data from the tax program
I used last year, which was Turbotax, and it can call in data from
the major personal financial programs, saving some retyping of
information. It even found possible deductions in the process. But
based on last year's data, it insisted on putting some Schedule C
expenses into Schedule A, where they had been last year. Once it
got past those minor glitches, the program sailed.
</P>
<P>
   The interview process was simple, focusing on areas that seemed
to matter the most, like whether you qualify for the child care
credit, while still offering the opportunity to look at other
options. It had the best explanation of Roth IRAs I have seen, and
a calculator to help decide if it was worth converting existing
IRAs to Roth IRAs, a feature I did not find in other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The screen has been laid out sparsely and has a big fat Help
button on every screen. Also handy was a drop-down Tools list with
a link to such things as the Windows calculator. The program also
looked at the entry in the ``occupation'' field and suggested other
potential deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service has changed its
business codes, and for those people who need to report outside
income, perusing the list of business codes is slow and painful.
Look it up elsewhere first.
</P>
<P>
   At $34.95, the deluxe Windows version of Taxcut costs $15 more
than the standard version, but the deluxe version allows you to
file electronically and install all the state versions you need at
no extra cost. The Macintosh version costs less, but you must
purchase the state versions separately.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Macintosh state version covers only 10 states; the
company said those states were the ones with the most complex
taxes. Street prices for this program are often lower than the
manufacturer's suggested price, which makes it a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not need the full-feature set of Taxcut, a
simpler version is available free through the Web (www.taxcut.com),
but it is only for filers planning to use the 1040EZ form. You
enter information directly into the Web version; nothing needs to
be loaded onto your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Goldenberg, vice president and publisher of the Taxcut line
at H&AMP;R Block, said he saw the Web service as a way to attract new
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling was that this was advantageous to help them out
now,'' Goldenberg said. ``Hopefully they will remember us when
their return gets more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Those using the 1040EZ product can log on, enter their data and
file electronically at no charge. This is partly good marketing and
partly an effort to keep the IRS happy. This, and a similar program
from Intuit, come from a push by the IRS to have 80 percent of all
returns filed electronically by 2007. Providing this free Web
service helps with Taxcut's market share and keeps the IRS happy,
usually a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   For the many users who have returns more complex than the EZ can
handle, Taxcut offers its more muscular products. They can be
purchased and downloaded at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel that there is enough demand for the full product
on the Web,'' Goldenberg said. ``When you come to taxes, it's the
big enchilada. People are really touchy about that.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TURBOTAX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Intuit; $29.95; Windows 3.1 and later, and Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   Intuit has been making financial software for the home and
professional market for quite some time now and has a dizzying
array of products available for the home user, the business user or
the home-and-business user.
</P>
<P>
   The company started a Web-based version of its tax software
several years ago (www.turbotax.com) and this year put the user
interface in its desktop products. It takes a close look to
distinguish the Web and desktop products; the chief difference
seems to be response time.
</P>
<P>
   The browser-style interface is usually quite helpful, but in
some places it would have been nice to cut back on the features and
make the screen easier to understand. With the navigation menu on
the left collapsing and expanding when the mouse inadvertently
moved over it, and the collection of Frequently Asked Questions on
the right changing from screen to screen, the page can fill up with
distractions. On the bright side, the information you need is
usually at your fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But that information seemed to exclude Roth IRA conversions. It
led to a maddening loop in the help files, and I failed to find a
form for entering information on an IRA that had already been
converted.
</P>
<P>
   The installation was straightforward, but as with Kiplinger's
Taxcut, registration was a problem. Although the software correctly
found the high-speed Internet connection to check for updates, it
could not figure out how to register the product.
</P>
<P>
   The program correctly located last year's return, done with
Turbotax, and the financial software package used and imported the
information, although, again like Taxcut, it put some Schedule C
information into Schedule A.
</P>
<P>
   The interview process became tedious as it looked for income _
and deductions _ in every nook and cranny. A way to speed up things
without triggering audit alerts later would have been nice.
</P>
<P>
   The program pointed out, based on answers to the interview
questions, several places to look for deductions, but it was hard
to find the correct code to indicate what business the taxpayer is
in. Audit alerts pointed out several errors, and a few things that
looked like errors but were not.
</P>
<P>
   When finished with the federal return, Turbotax walks you
through a review of your return, and it offers to export the data
to any state returns needed. State returns are available for $27.95
each in both Windows and Macintosh versions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turbotax is cumbersome at times, and more expensive
than its competitors, it deserves its reputation for quality.
People using Intuit's Quicken personal financial software will also
appreciate the tight integration between the products. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TAXACT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (2d Story Software; basic version is free, deluxe version is
$9.95; Windows 95 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   The new kid on the tax block is Taxact from 2nd Story Software,
a small company that has been in business for about a year and put
its first product on the market a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the newness fool you, though. The four founders of 2nd
Story Software have an extensive background in taxes and software.
They all worked at Parsons Technology on several tax and financial
packages as well as in related fields. The company distributes its
product over the Internet (www.taxact.com), which holds down costs,
and it gives away the basic version of the program to establish
market share.
</P>
<P>
   The program's screen layout is not crowded, making it easy to
breeze through the interview. And you'll find a nice twist in the
interview itself. Instead of having you sit down and enter data off
all those forms that come over the transom, it starts with a
discussion of ``life events.''
</P>
<P>
   The program asks if you were married or divorced, changed jobs,
moved, started a business or did any of 14 other activities. If any
are checked, it asks questions focused on those events and points
out likely financial consequences; then it gathers the information
needed and puts it in the appropriate places.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it still asks the standard questions, but since it
has gathered much of the information in the life events section,
that portion of the interview zips along.
</P>
<P>
   The deluxe version, at $9.95, carries a guarantee for accuracy,
covers more life events (the basic package deals with three) and
has a handful of other features. Electronic filing costs $7.95
more. The state versions of the software cost $12.95 each, but the
company covers only 21 states so far. This dark horse makes a good
showing for its first time out of the gate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WINTAX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Wintax; $10; runs with Excel 97.)
</P>
<P>
   Wintax is for those who will happily forgo all the bells and
whistles of the fancier tax packages but who do not want to do the
math. It is a set of templates for Microsoft Excel 97 that do all
the calculations for the user. There is no interview, no electronic
filing _ just forms and a built-in calculator.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Spiegel put the tax templates together to help himself.
Spiegel's background is in electronics and electrical engineering,
so he was comfortable with computers and chose Excel for doing his
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it for myself,'' Spiegel said. ``A year and a half ago,
my son said, `Gee, Dad, why don't you sell it on the Web,' so I
did.'' The software can be ordered through the Wintax Web site
(www.wintax.com). You need to have Excel 97 to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel has written templates for the 1040a and all of its
associated forms and is finishing up the 1040 and its forms. The
templates look just like the Internal Revenue Service forms
available on the Web, at a post office or at any number of other
places.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference is that many fields have a Help button that
calls up IRS information for that field. On many parts of the form,
entering inaccurate information will make red text pop up as a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who wants a little help doing the taxes but is not
excited about loading another program or doing the taxes on the
Web, this is a simple option. And it costs 10 bucks.

 &HT;    FATE OF JORDAN'S QUEEN NOOR TIED TO HER HUSBAND'S LEGACY
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ She stood up for her country when the United
States accused it of being too soft on Iraq, but back home she has
been seen as being just too American.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jordan's Queen Noor, 47, is literally by the sick bed
of her husband, Jordan's King Hussein, the woman who has worked
hard to straddle two cultures faces an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ailing Hussein, 63, shocked his country and the
region by removing his brother Hassan from the role of heir, which
he held for 33 years, and replacing him with Hussein's first son,
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The change was notable for its transparent intrigue. Hussein
wrote, in a letter to Hassan, that ``parasites'' and ``climbers''
were poisoning the palace atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor was in the mix. Friends and observers, though most
speaking anonymously, said she had longed hope that her son Hamzah,
could be the next King. Hamzah is Noor's first son, but not the
king's.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Ambassador to the United States, Marwan Muasher,
``categorically'' denies that Noor ever got involved.
</P>
<P>
   Hamzah is Hussein's favorite son and, had he become heir, it
would have sealed Noor's status. But the prince is only 18 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Some say she will be a respected queen mother, maintaining her
charitable works. But, finding a popular role has always been a
challenge for Noor among Jordanians, many of whom still look at her
suspiciously as a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein seemed intent on securing a place in Jordan for his
wife, apparently answering the criticisms he has heard of the
conspicuous blonde with the heavy American accent in her Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brought happiness and cared for me during my illness with
the utmost affection,'' he wrote. ``She, the Jordanian, who belongs
to this country with every fiber of her being, holds her head high
in the defense and service of this country's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been accused of spending too freely and being too much
in the jet-set. It may be that Jordanians criticize her for things
they don't want to express about the rest of the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not the only one (in the royal family) who's corrupt,
but, certainly, her tastes are very apparent in this poor
kingdom,'' said Laith Shubailat, a Jordanian dissident.
</P>
<P>
   Shubailat's niece is Noor's press secretary. But, when he
ridiculed Noor for crying at the funeral of slain Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin -- Hussein's treaty with Israel is highly
unpopular among Jordanians -- it was one of the statements the
police cited in jailing him for 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   Noor's background makes her an equally easy target, and unlikely
Arab figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in the United States as Lisa Halaby, to a mother of
Swedish background and father Najeeb Halaby, of Syrian-Lebanese
descent. Born in the United States, he once headed Pan American
World Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Halaby was a cheerleader and protested against the Vietnam
War. She graduated from Princeton -- class of 1974 -- with a degree
in architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Working on an aviation university in Jordan, she met Hussein,
the avid pilot. Their courtship included palace dinners,
introductions to the children from his three previous marriages and
rides on the back of the macho King's motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in 1978, the tall blonde with the beauty-queen
looks and the short-but-regal descendent of the Islamic prophet
Mohammed. Lisa Halaby converted to Islam and became Noor
Al-Hussein, meaning ``Light of Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   Noor has said she found adjusting to Jordan easy, relying on a
coterie of strong women friends that defied Arab stereotypes. But,
there was clearly a cultural gap to bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came here under very difficult circumstances,'' said
former chief of Noor's office, Mohammad Al-Adwan, addressing the
tough time that outsiders face in the cliquish world of Amman.
</P>
<P>
   She founded Jordan's gifted school and a music conservatory. Her
Noor Al-Hussein Foundation helps Jordan's poor, rural women find
economic independence through crafts, poultry raising and
beekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Since the death of Britain's Princess Diana, she has headed the
international push to ban land mines. Risking controversy in a
society steeped in tradition, she has spoken out against ``honor
killings,'' in which brothers or fathers in Jordan sometimes kill
female family members who have sex outside of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after U.S. officials vilified Hussein for staying
neutral in the Gulf War, Noor traveled to Washington, D.C. to help
explain her country's position.
</P>
<P>
   But, her first job is to stay in her husband's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not supposed to be the star. You cannot have a Princess
Diana in Jordan. No way,'' says Salameh Nematt, a Jordanian
journalist. ``It's a man-dominated society.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians appreciate that Noor raised four children to speak
excellent Arabic. She often wears embroidered Jordanian Bedouin
dresses and, according to a friend, will serve tea and sweets
herself at gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   She moved Jordanians with her attentiveness to Hussein during a
bout with cancer in 1992. It quieted rumors that the marriage was
in trouble due to infidelities by Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, people say they like her because she is Hussein's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is nice. She is popular because she is the Queen,'' said
grocer Nwayer Naber, 37.
</P>
<P>
   In a barber shop, haircutters echoed that mild endorsement. But,
one leaned forward on his chair to add carefully: ``She is
originally American. Her name is not Noor. It is something else.''

COUNT THE WAYS   HOW, NOT WHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, one can surely buy the poems of Emily Dickinson and
Shakespeare's sonnets this Valentine's Day from any bookstore or
online bookseller, but publishing has nonetheless turned the
holiday of a thousand and one romances into an exercise in the
utilitarian. The fuzzy and lyrical, the twisted skeins of lies and
sighs that make up so much of the romantic novel are not as popular
as the real and practical. How to make love, rather than why.
</P>
<P>
   Has it always been thus? Not really. Book publishers, who one
supposes are as sentimental and dreamy as anyone else in the
faraway spaces of their imaginations, seemingly have gotten caught
up this year in the increasingly popular self-help genre. So for
Valentine's Day it's refining sex and defining relationships,
without the flowers and chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be a bit of a risk since Valentine's Day and Mother's
Day are generally the only times of the year in which ``women's
fiction,'' as publishers loosely call it, can find its away to the
front of the bookstores (with the exception, of course, of the
mega-selling female authors). This is either because book makers
feel these are the two special days worth spending the money to buy
such positioning or the sellers themselves feel it might be good
business. Publishers, like other retailers, are driven by their
ambits of opportunity, like Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Typically this year, for instance, Amazon, the online
bookseller, has on its Valentine's Day gift list ``The Kissing
Companion: Secret Technique of Over 500 Exotic Kisses,'' by Stephen
Jarvis and Elaine Edwards, and ``10,000 Ways to Say I Love You,''
by Gregory J.P. Godek. For the outwardly rigid but secretly
incontestably romantic buyer there is ``Recruiting Love: Using the
Business Skills You Have to Find the Love You Want,'' by Jessica B.
Freeman. Barnes &AMP; Noble's online service is touting, among many
others, ``The Art of Spooning: A Cuddler's Handbook,'' by Jim
Grace, and ``101 Nights of Great Sex,'' by Laura Corn.
</P>
<P>
   And since the celebration is surely about nostalgia,
HarperCollins has issued what it calls the ``all new''
30th-anniversary edition of ``Everything You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex (but Were Afraid to Ask),'' by Dr. David Reuben, and
Pantheon has reissued ``The Technique of the Love Affair,'' by
Doris Langley Moore, originally published in 1928 but updated this
year by Norris Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   That book is almost high art in the lineage of such work, far
beyond the liaisons hinted at in the greeting cards, a work of such
apparent transcendental importance in the genre that Dorothy Parker
said of it that if only she had been privy to its secrets ``maybe I
could have been successful rather than successive.'' Probably the
most graphic book to capture the quality of this year's celebration
is ``Sex Tips for Straight Women From a Gay Man,'' by Dan Anderson
and Maggie Berman on Regan Books.
</P>
<P>
   Now none of the above is entirely fair to book publishers. There
are in fact plenty of lusty romantic fictions in the stores aimed
to flutter the hearts of the Valentine's Day buyer, although Irwyn
Applebaum, president and publisher of Bantam Books, said: ``Many
booksellers have the old Erich Segal syndrome: `Madison County,'
`Message in a Bottle.' They are more into those romances than ones
written by women.'' (Nicholas Sparks' ``Message in a Bottle'' was
published in hardcover last summer, but Warner Books has gotten a
huge gushy best-selling paperback pop out of advertising for the
movie, which opens two days before Valentine's Day.)
</P>
<P>
   But no such manly hangup for Applebaum. He hopes to make
Valentine's Day a bank day for two novelists who are women. In the
alchemy that is book publishing, Bantam is printing nearly 500,000
copies of a paperback original by Jane Feather _ her 12th book _
cleverly, if not obviously, titled ``A Valentine Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It combines two certain attention getters _ the word
`valentine' and the word `wedding' _ and we get a one-two punch,''
he said, sounding about as happy as a candy maker this time of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bantam also hopes to surf the high emotional tide of the
Valentine celebration with Luanne Rice's ``Cloud Nine.'' Applebaum
describes this as ``adult fiction in its best sense'' by which he
means it combines the complex themes of love, remission from cancer
and a surprise romance with an unexpected man. He is betting 50,000
copies, hardcover, for a first printing. ``There are many meanings
to the title,'' Applebaum said rhapsodically. ``It's the name of
the shop the character runs, in which she sells comforters, and of
course, dare I say it, she's on cloud nine with pleasure.'' You
see, titles are all important.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Warner Books, along with ``Message in a Bottle,'' the
publisher has great hopes for Katherine Stone's ``Thief of
Hearts,'' a novel of ``heart-wrenching betrayals and unforgivable
pain.'' Still John Aherne, the associate editor, said, ``It's
interesting to see how more and more the prescriptive books are
breaking out, along with the fuzzies that come out on the 14th.''
</P>
<P>
   He has high hopes for Joyce Marlow's ``Country Ways: Secrets for
Finding and Keeping a Country Man,'' aimed at those women who, as
with Lady Chatterley, are apparently searching for a gamekeeper.
``We've found that the books that tend to work for us are practical
advice,'' Aherne said, adding that he was particularly prideful
about what he called an anti-Valentine Day book, ``The Breakup
Book,'' by Monica Sheehan. ``It's for people who could use all the
advice they could get after the bitter reminder that it doesn't
always work out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what about Mother's Day, the next great celebration of love?
Bantam is gearing up ``Hot Sex: How to Do It,'' by Tracey Cox,
advice for Mom and Dad on the hot tin roof.

LOOK ON THE DARK SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're having a lousy day, filled with disappointments and
clouded by self-doubt. The Smashing Pumpkins' ``Cherub Rock'' _ the
song with the refrain ``Let me out!'' _ is blasting from the car CD
player, sounding strangely appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Days like this, some people tell you to buck up; there's even a
whole industry of motivational products telling you to look on the
bright side. But sometimes, instead of optimism, you want empathy,
best served with a dash of cynical humor. That's where Despair Inc.
and its Demotivators products come in.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into the hallway at the Dallas-based company's
``fulfillment center'' in an Irving industrial park, and you find
that cynical humor immediately. Posters brandish platitudes _
anti-platitudes, really _ about ``Ineptitude,'' ``Failure'' and
``Procrastination.'' Example: ``Pessimism _ Every dark cloud has a
silver lining, but lightning kills hundreds of people each year who
are trying to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   E.L. Kersten, founder of Despair Inc., doesn't look like an
unhappy guy. He looks, well, businesslike, with his easy smile and
smart suit (''I get my clothes from Wal-Mart,'' he says). But
behind the smile lurks a cynical heart _ or maybe just a realistic
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at something like our `Mediocrity' poster, and I think
it's true,'' he says. ``I look at the `Stupidity' poster, I think
it's true. I look at the `Failure' poster, and I think it's true. I
think the difference is that I personally would rather deal with
reality than paint a nice, happy veneer over it to make myself good
until reality comes crushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kersten's cynicism, Despair Inc. is all in good fun.
It's a parody of the Successories line of motivational posters that
adorn some corporate conference rooms. Kersten says he has yet to
hear any complaints from Successories. (Several calls to
Successories' headquarters weren't returned _ or maybe we should
say that we failed to get them to talk to us.)
</P>
<P>
   Kersten and his associates, brothers Justin and Jef Sewell, were
working for a start-up company in Dallas when the idea was born.
Things weren't going well, and one of them _ they're coy about who
_ began thumbing through a catalog for motivational products and
making up more pessimistic sayings. Then they began attaching the
one-liners to stock images and hanging them in their cubicles. The
sayings drew so much attention that the trio decided that, should
the start-up fail, they should market the sayings.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, the start-up stopped. The three took the money
they got from the sellout and started Despair Inc., with a Web
site, www.despair.com, to market their Demotivators posters,
calendars, T-shirts and note cards (''Ineptitude,'' for instance,
is illustrated with a shot of a skier wiping out). About a dozen
sayings are in circulation, and they're working on a dozen more
designs. They are also considering adding screen savers and coffee
mugs.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Web site didn't engender much response; five
orders was considered a good day. Then someone _ they don't know
who _ downloaded the images but didn't include the company's URL,
the despair.com address. Whoever downloaded the images began
forwarding them, and the images eventually turned up on the home
page of a computer-science professor at Washington University in
St. Louis. USA Today wrote about his page and the Demotivators
images, and Yahoo! named his page Cool Site of the Day. But the
images weren't his, and when he tracked down where they came from,
he gave credit where credit was due.
</P>
<P>
   The second the computer-science professor added the link to
www.despair.com, life changed for the guys at Despair Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had acclimatized ourselves to two or three orders a day,''
Justin Sewell says in a rare nonreticent moment (Kersten usually
does the talking). ``At 11 a.m. on _ I guess it was Oct. 23 _
suddenly, in the course of literally an hour, the fax machine would
go off every time we moved. Literally, after 100 consecutive
orders, it was like, `Hey, this thing is not stopping!' We struck
some sort of loser reservoir.''
</P>
<P>
   A big reservoir. The Sewell brothers work for Despair full time,
but they recently hired a full-time operations director to allow
them to step into the background and work on other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Despair Inc. accepts orders only through its Web site, although
Kersten and associates are working on adding a toll-free number. On
peak days _ usually just after a story in the media _ orders can
hit 250. The Wall Street Journal, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
and the Los Angeles Times have written about the company, and a
People magazine story is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The products' popularity says something about
turn-of-the-millennium malaise. Or does it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many people who tell us they are sick and tired of
motivational posters,'' Kersten says. ``I think it suggests that
there's a large group of people out there that want something that
is more honest, more refreshing, more in keeping with their
experience, rather than `Life is just this wonderful journey of
overcoming hardships.' Sometimes it's making peace with your
weaknesses and cutting your losses and moving on. Especially if it
includes purchasing a poster, which can be seen as an outward
indication of your healing.''

THE ABCs OF CHILDREN'S VITAMINS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Healthy children who eat whole-grain breads, cereals and pasta,
meat, milk, fruits and vegetables probably don't need extra
vitamins and minerals. But what about the 8-year-old who spurns
anything that might contain meat or eggs, or the 5-year-old who
will eat nothing but hot dogs, or the child who absolutely refuses
all vegetables?
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are frantic that their children aren't getting what
they need from their diets, but in most cases they are,'' says Dr.
Loraine Stern, associate clinical professor in the Department of
Pediatrics at the UCLA School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child won't eat meat, offer him peanut butter on a
whole-wheat cracker. It has the same complete protein,'' Stern
says. ``If young children will eat only white bread, plain noodles
and corn kernels, it's because that's what their parents offer
them.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's any doubt about whether kids are getting all the
vitamins and minerals they need for good growth and development,
talk to your pediatrician, she advises.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Dr. William Dietz, director of the Division of
Nutrition and Physical Activity at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, are co-authors of a guide to children's nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Published last month, ``The American Academy of Pediatrics Guide
to Your Child's Nutrition'' (Villard Books, $23) is an
authoritative, easy-to-use guide to children's diet and eating
habits.
</P>
<P>
   The book has a section on nutrition basics, with vitamin and
mineral tables listing all the essentials including effects, signs
of deficiency, signs of overdose and good sources for various
vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Page 97, you learn that vitamin A keeps skin,
hair and nails healthy, helps maintain gums, glands, bones and
teeth, helps prevent infection and promotes eye function. Good
sources include milk and dairy foods, fortified cereals, green and
yellow vegetables, deep-yellow or orange fruits and organ meats.
</P>
<P>
   It is always better to get vitamins from food than in pill form,
Stern says. First, the vitamin supplements available in pills are
incomplete, and second, a pill results in a high concentration of a
particular vitamin that may interfere with the absorption of other
nutrients from food.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary for children, vitamin and mineral supplements are
available in liquid drops and colorful chewable tablets. Most
provide vitamins A, D and C, with or without iron, and some also
contain vitamin E and the B vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, niacin
and B-6.
</P>
<P>
   One supplement that could be a must-buy is fluoride. If drinking
water does not have fluoride added or a child drinks only bottled
water, parents should put fluoride on the list of supplements that
children definitely need, Stern says.
</P>
<P>
   Fluoride is crucial to the formation of teeth, and is the main
reason pediatricians recommend mixing powdered formula with regular
tap water rather than bottled water. In most areas of this country,
the municipal water supply is fortified with fluoride..MDBR/.MDNM/

THE PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY: PITTSBURGH PRESENTS ITS NEW VOICE  
(DW) 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa.)  By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Pittsburgh Symphony, like most good orchestras,
has the knack of taking on the voice of its music director. This is
a benign form of ventriloquism, though one not practiced
everywhere. A few ``personality'' orchestras do in fact survive
(though some only as recent memories): the Vienna Philharmonic
(gemuetlich), the Philadelphia Orchestra (luxurious), the Chicago
Symphony (loud). On the other hand, most operatives on the world
stage are less shapers of style than they are the ones being
shaped.
</P>
<P>
   After profitable years under Lorin Maazel, the Pittsburgh
visited Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night with his successor, Mariss
Jansons. Much has changed, as this program of Dvorak, Berlioz and
Christopher Rouse showed. Maazel gave these players a combination
of power and elegance that made it sound like one of the country's
truly undervalued ensembles. Jansons brings a personal touch and
with it a looser sound.
</P>
<P>
   The string playing is together and in tune, though not so
sharply edged. The conductor's emotionalism also extends to a love
of the big noise, and when Berlioz's ``Symphonie Fantastique''
invited such displays, Jansons seemed happy to have his brass and
timpani players explore their outer limits.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Jansons is also somewhat of a micromanager, a man
who likes to map out phrases according to his own careful
itineraries. Phrase marks, hesitations, ritards, crescendos and
decrescendos are meticulously planned; though his players followed
him with skill, there was an apprehension and self-consciousness in
their responses.
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of conducting that works wonders when
conductor and orchestra spend a lot of time together, so one hopes
that in seasons to come Jansons will not follow the path of
absentee music director but give this worthy ensemble a suitable
gift of his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Midori was the soloist in the Dvorak A minor Violin Concerto,
and it was heartening, and a little chastening, to see how she has
survived the predictions of doom and destruction (some from this
writer) uttered during her years as a child prodigy. The sound is
fine and lean and the technique as impregnable as ever.
</P>
<P>
   More important is the soundness and seriousness of the
musicianship. First is the choice of repertory. The Dvorak is
neither a showpiece nor a career maker. Difficult without being
spectacular, its music has half hidden values, and Midori met them
with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing at all is hidden in Rouse's ``Infernal Machine,'' an
exercise in gee-whiz orchestration hellbent on demonstrating its
powers to amaze. The many effects are smoothly handled; the
entertainment value is high. The work behaves like a stand-up
comedian: glib, wise of mouth, inventive and relentlessly
self-referential.

`THE EVIL THAT MEN DO': LEARNING WHAT IS STANDARD ABOUT DEVIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening pages of ``The Evil That Men Do,'' Stephen G.
Michaud drops several intriguing comments like these:
</P>
<P>
   _ When rape victims struggle, rapists tend to remain with them
twice as long as when there is no resistance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deviant sexual crimes were ``both curbed and concealed in
America at mid-century by a moral climate hostile to sexual
extremes or erotic experimentation of almost any sort.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Aberrant offenders use pornography to validate their
deviance. ... The more they see of it, and masturbate to it, the
more their behavior is reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Since these are all controversial observations, the reader is
drawn to learn what more Michaud has to say on these subjects. But
this turns out to be not so easy to do in a book that is partly a
biography, partly an examination of methodology and partly a
collection of case studies.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud first met Roy Hazelwood, his subject and collaborator,
in 1984, when Hazelwood was a member of the FBI's Behavioral
Science Unit, based at the FBI Academy at Quantico, Va. This is the
team that was made famous in the 1980s by the Atlanta child murders
case, which Hazelwood and other members of the unit helped solve,
and by Thomas Harris' novel ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' which was
based on the unit's specialized work.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud writes of Hazelwood, ``Roy's domain is the sexual
criminal's mental and emotional planes, the deviant mind's hot
zones where lust and rage are fused and deadly fantasies flower.''
After their first meeting, Michaud decided to do a book about
Hazelwood's work, but several factors impeded him. His subject had
much of his career still ahead of him. He found it difficult to
adapt the formula of previous books on which he had collaborated,
like ``The Only Living Witness,'' a portrait of Ted Bundy, and
``Ted Bundy: Conversations with a Killer.'' Hazelwood's story had
too many focal points.
</P>
<P>
   Describing his eventual solution, he writes, ``The search for a
narrative thread through such diverse material led me at last to
settle on a thematic organization for the book, a chapter by
chapter exploration of sexual criminals and their victims, divided
according to offender types, their motives and their modus
operandi.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the resulting tangle doesn't have threads worth
following. Hazelwood is a fascinating figure who started out as a
career Army officer working with criminals, switched to the FBI in
1971, joined the behavioral unit in 1978, when sex crimes were
largely ignored because the bureau had little jurisdiction over
such matters, and helped transform the investigation of sexual
deviance into a scientific discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Among his major contributions were the realization that sex
crimes could usefully be classified as organized, disorganized and
mixed, and that rapists could be divided into six groups, according
to their motives and behavior. By such systematic analysis, he
developed the ability to read crime scenes analytically and to
profile deviant criminals with uncanny accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cases Hazelwood has helped solve with the behavioral
unit or as a member of the consulting group he joined in his
retirement, some, like the deadly explosion aboard the battleship
Iowa in 1989 or the hoax that a grand jury found was perpetrated by
Tawana Brawley in claiming falsely to have been raped in 1987, are
too familiar to be of much interest in their retelling. Others seem
to have attracted Michaud by their sheer weirdness, particularly
autoerotic fatalities from accidental strangulation, which
Hazelwood happens to be an expert on, and the case of a man who ate
parts of two victims in a macaroni casserole.
</P>
<P>
   The most instructive ones to read are those illustrating four of
Hazelwood's six basic types of rapist. These are what he terms the
common ``power reassurance rapist,'' who wants only to prove his
masculinity to himself; the ``power assertive rapist,'' less common
but more violent; the ``anger retaliatory rapist,'' who works out
his rage against women by using excessive force, and the ``anger
excitation rapist,'' a sadist who is sexually stimulated by his
victim's suffering. (The other two categories, which interest
Hazelwood somewhat less, are the so-called ``opportunistic
rapist,'' who is often drunk or high on drugs, and the ``gang
rapist,'' who succumbs to pathological group behavior.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you learn so much from cases like these that by the
end, in a chapter called ``You Be the Analyst,'' you find you are
able to put together many of the clues in the 1986 rape-murder of a
young typist in the FBI's San Antonio office. (Although one clue
that the author himself seems to have disregarded is the peculiar
sense of humor of the victim's parents, a German-American couple
named Vetter who called their daughter Donna, Donnerwetter being
German both for thunderstorm and an interjection translated in my
dictionary as ``damn it all!'' and ``blast!'')
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that in a survey of some 41 convicted serial
rapists undertaken by Hazelwood, he could find no comprehensive
reason, as he puts it, ``why some people act out and others
don't,'' although he still believes the answer has to do with
self-perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons that we all don't act out is that we have
inhibitors, or brakes, to control desires,'' he says. ``They can be
social status, religion, personal values or fear of jail. Those who
do act out are losers. They are convinced they are losers, so they
don't see how they have anything more to lose by yielding to their
desires.''
</P>
<P>
   He quotes one serial rapist as saying: ``Regardless of how
successful I may appear to be, I know I'm going to screw up. So why
not go ahead and do it and enjoy it? I'm going to give in to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazelwood concludes: ``I frequently run into this theme with
offenders. Sexual sadists. Serial rapists. It is a common theme.''
</P>
<P>
   Depressing.

   AIRTRAN-ATLANTA _ ATLANTA _ AirTran Airways has found a way to
get more of its planes into Hartsfield International Airport. The
airport will reconfigure parking spaces for larger planes to

gates for its 131 daily Atlanta flights. Hartsfield Airport will
allow it to double-park its airplanes. (Thurston, Atlanta

   DELCO _GM founder Billy Durant bought AC Spark Plug in 1909 and
four years later Dayton Engineering Laboratories (Delco). Soon, he

WHY ARE YOU SMILING? 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If things are going well but you're still feeling blue, it could
be because you're suffering from ``happiness anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 125 million Americans suffer from happiness anxiety,
according to an article in the prestigious supermarket tabloid
medical journal Weekly World News, a publication that is to the
advancement of psychiatric understanding what ``Biker Chick''
magazine is to the advancement of women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   If I understand the article correctly (no sure thing; my
attention often wandered to the photo of the Page Five Girl),
happiness anxiety is when you feel bad when you should be feeling
good, as opposed to unhappiness anxiety, which is when you feel
good when you should be feeling bad.
</P>
<P>
   From what I read in the newspaper (certainly not from what I
read in my bank statement), the United States is enjoying a period
of unprecedented economic prosperity. The stock market is up and
unemployment is down. Dan Quayle says he's going to run for
president and scientists say fiber may not be that great for your
colon after all.
</P>
<P>
   With news this good, it's no wonder so many people are ready to
tie cinder blocks around their necks and jump off a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   People who suffer from happiness anxiety either feel guilty when
they are happy or else worry that the bubble will burst as soon as
they crack a smile. While some might say that the happiness anxiety
phenomenon is just another example of how America is populated by a
bunch of pathetic whiners who not only don't appreciate their good
fortune but wouldn't recognize it if it bit them on the neck, I,
personally, am taking the matter quite seriously.
</P>
<P>
   We in the media, of course, do everything we can to promote
happiness anxiety. (People who don't know from one minute to the
next whether they should be happy or sad are apparently more apt to
buy a paper than those who do. They also tend to be big fans of the
comic strip ``Cathy,'' but that is another story.)
</P>
<P>
   Next to the front-page story of President Clinton's impeachment
trial we will run the results of a public opinion poll showing that
72 percent of the American people think that Clinton is doing a
great job even though he is a lowlife who deserves a good paddling.
(By Hillary, not Monica.) A TV network the other day announced that
Joe DiMaggio had died but then retracted the story about 20 minutes
later. (Joe, who is of an earlier generation, did not suffer
happiness anxiety upon hearing the premature news of his death, but
did, reportedly, very much want to strangle someone at the
network.)
</P>
<P>
   On the business page, we run stories about how great technology
stocks are doing next to a story about how the Y2K computer bug is
going to cause all the world's computers to short-circuit at
midnight, Dec. 31, 1999, sending us all scurrying into caves in the
Wyoming foothills where we will spend the rest of our lives
defending our cache of Spam and powdered milk from those who did
not have the foresight to prepare. The coming of the millennium, of
course, is the ultimate happiness anxiety story. On the one hand,
we love watching all those zeros roll up on our historical
odometer, but how can we really enjoy the moment when we know (or
fear) the world is going to come to an end at the stroke of
midnight?
</P>
<P>
   The real mystery here is why a full 50 percent of Americans are
not suffering from happiness anxiety. Are their powers of
self-delusion greater than the rest of us? Are they taking Prozac
or some other anti-depressant? Are they too cheap to buy a
newspaper? The next time I encounter a person who is suffering from
happiness anxiety, I'm going to ask him how he can smile at a time
like this.

TAKING AIM AT THE HEART OF THIS PROFESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HARRAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a decade or more, we have been reading surveys that say
public confidence in the news media is dropping.
</P>
<P>
   This is frightening information, because it strikes at the very
heart of what journalists do for a living. In its most simple
definition, journalism is relating information to people.
</P>
<P>
   It works when people believe that the information is credible.
When they do not believe that, it becomes an exercise in futility.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Newspaper Editors recently concluded a
three-year research project to study this issue, specifically
related to newspapers. There'll be more later about how that was
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a working journalist for 35 years, I dislike being lumped
into a category _ ``media'' _ that includes everything from
Internet sites to supermarket tabloids to shock television to talk
radio to highly niched magazines.
</P>
<P>
   I've argued that the standards are higher in newspapers than in
many other forms of journalism. I believe that, partly because I
have experience in different forms of media and partly because of
observation of the handling of stories about which I possessed a
great deal of information.
</P>
<P>
   But this study didn't deal with the ``media.'' This study dealt
specifically with newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The ASNE report grouped the results into six major findings:
</P>
<P>
   (1) The public sees too many factual errors and spelling or
grammar mistakes in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   (2) The public perceives that newspapers don't consistently
demonstrate respect for, and knowledge of, their readers and their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   (3) The public suspects that the viewpoints and biases of
journalists influence what stories are covered and how they are
covered.
</P>
<P>
   (4) The public believes that newspapers chase and overcover
sensational stories because they are exciting and they sell papers.
Readers don't believe that these stories deserve the attention and
the play that they get.
</P>
<P>
   (5) The public feels that newsroom values and practices
sometimes conflict with their own priorities for their newspapers
(for example, trading speed for accuracy).
</P>
<P>
   (6) Members of the public who have had experience with the news
process are the most critical of media credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The research was conducted in 3,000 telephone interviews
completed in April and May 1998, supposedly projectable to 197
million U.S. adults, and in 16 focus groups completed in August
1998. Also, a questionnaire was sent to 1,714 newspaper
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   To those of you who believe we rig the polls: I assure you that
we wouldn't have rigged this one to report these findings.
</P>
<P>
   The results are not surprising to anyone who is in daily contact
with newspaper readers.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't know is whether the issues they address have
changed over the years. My memory tells me that newspapers are more
accurate and more concerned with fairness and balance than they
were when I first broke into the trade, but maybe my memory is
faulty.
</P>
<P>
   I do know that the research findings are consistent with what I
see and hear from the readers.
</P>
<P>
   As an ombudsman, I handled perhaps 6,500 telephone calls and
several thousand e-mails and letters in 1998, and most of them
would have fit in one of the six categories above.
</P>
<P>
   The ASNE study broke out each of those findings in a separate
and more complete report. During the next month or two, I'll
occasionally deal with one of the findings in more detail.
</P>
<P>
   I promise not to blow it out of proportion. I don't, however,
promise to make no typographical errors. I always have been a lousy
typist.

Museum will turn over three important pieces from its antiquities
collection to the Italian government this week.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time the Getty has returned ancient
artifacts that were discovered to have been stolen. But the return
of a 480 B.C. Greek terra-cotta drinking cup, a torso of the god
Mithras from the second century and a second-century Roman copy of
a sculpture by Polyclitus, the head of a young athlete known as
Diadumenos, is one of the most significant archeological
restitutions to Italy in many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent them to Italy because that is where they belong,''
Marion True, curator of antiquities at the Getty, explained. ``Our
own examination confirmed the claims of the Italian government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Getty's decision, which was not prompted by legal action in
Italy, was a boon to Italian officials, who have waged a long,
complicated and often fruitless battle to retrieve artworks and
ancient artifacts stolen from archeological sites and museums and
sold on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   There are still many artworks on display in American museums
that are claimed by Italy, Greece and Turkey. The Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York City has a longstanding dispute with
Italian government officials over its collection of third-century
B.C. Hellenistic silver, which Italian and American archeologists
say were illegally removed from a site that Americans were
excavating.
</P>
<P>
   Italian officials say they see this week's restitution as a
hopeful sign. ``There is greater openness,'' said Gen. Roberto
Conforti, who heads the special police task force on art theft.
``We have had a lot of dialogue about this issue, and it is
beginning to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Getty's decision to return works that it thinks have been
proved stolen from a clearly identified site comes after years of
dispute between the Italian authorities and American museums and
private collectors. But there have been growing signs of
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Italy gave in to pressure from foreign museums
and loosened its loan policy, extending the time artworks could be
shown abroad from six months to a year. That display of flexibility
seems to have eased the Getty's decision. ``It can only help,'' Ms.
True said. ``We don't have to own everything if material is made
available for exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Getty made its decision on its own but acknowledged
that it might have repercussions for other museums and collectors.
``There is great fear among many museums; they are already getting
defensive,'' Ms. True said. ``But we have drawn a clear ethical
line: Once we have demonstrated that a documented piece was stolen,
it has to be returned.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 and 1982 the Metropolitan Museum, with great fanfare,
acquired 15 silver artifacts from a private art dealer in
Switzerland. A Sicilian magistrate, Silvio Raffiota, conducted a
long investigation and concluded that the silver had been stolen by
local thieves from the site at Morgantina. Malcolm Bell, an
American archeologist who oversaw the dig at Morgantina, agrees.
When Bell asked the Metropolitan Museum for permission to study the
silver to try to prove its provenance, it refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Getty has done is admirable and important,'' Bell
said on Wednesday night. ``The Met and other collectors have taken
a very hard line that they can buy what they please, and I think
this weakens their position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan on Wednesday declined to comment. A spokesman
said the museum staff had not had an opportunity to study the Getty
decision.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. courts have also started setting precedents for art
collectors. In 1997 a federal judge upheld the seizure of a gold
platter dating from 450 B.C. that had been bought by Michael H.
Steinhardt, a former hedge-fund manager, and that the Italian
government said had been smuggled out of Italy. That case is now
under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian authorities say they hope that court decision and
the Getty's decision will influence private collectors. Maurice
Tempelsman, a wealthy diamond merchant who was close to Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis, bought pieces of sculptures of two goddesses that
are over 2,000 years old from a London dealer. The Italian
authorities say they were stolen from a grave near Morgantina.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government has not sued for their recovery, relying
mostly on diplomatic contacts and appeals to Tempelsman.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Tempelsman, Gus Weill, said that Tempelsman
``has not been presented with one iota of evidence that the works
were in any fashion inappropriately acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Bondioli Osio, president of the Interministerial
Commission for Artworks, which seeks to recover lost patrimony,
said, ``I am convinced the goddesses were stolen from that site,
but I do not know if I can prove it in a court of law.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Warming up to raclette cheese
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The night was cold. The fire was hot. The cheese
he brought was raclette.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect! That's the cheese the Swiss love to heat in front of a
fire, scraping the slowly melting cheese off to eat with warm
vegetables or bread.
</P>
<P>
   It was an impromptu event, so I put the cheese in front of the
fire and set out a plate of crackers. The warm cheese oozed. I
scraped off a soft layer. It was good. I stretched out.
</P>
<P>
   And kicked over his glass of red wine. On the Oriental rug.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is clear. Do your cooking in the kitchen, not the
living room.
</P>
<P>
   And there is always cheese in my kitchen. Even if the blizzard
comes, and I haven't been to the store in a week, there will always
be cheese, enough Parmesan for pasta and blue for a salad, and
inevitably some good-eating cheese.
</P>
<P>
   With a little luck the refrigerator might even hold a big wedge
of a raclette cheese, which, with the proper accompaniments, can
become a meal. The preparation is an old standby, like Swiss
fondue, but it never caught on over here the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Eating raclette, like fondue, is a ritual. Melt and scrape. Melt
again and scrape. But there is more to be done with this cheese
than that. Because of its wonderful melting qualities _ it oozes
into a velvety consistency instead of running _ raclette has
multiple uses.
</P>
<P>
   These raclette crisps are easy snacks to serve with cocktails.
Simply slice the cheese, put the slices on a cookie sheet, sprinkle
with chopped pecans and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. That's it. No
mixing, no flour, no fuss. The crisps cool for a moment on the
cookie sheet, then are lifted to a paper towel-lined plate. When
cool they can keep for a few days in a well-sealed tin.
</P>
<P>
   For added interest, sprinkle with some fresh basil the last
minute they are in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   For this recipe the cheese needs to be very cold to slice
easily. Tuck it into the freezer for an hour ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   RACLETTE CRISPS WITH PECANS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 20 to 30
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound raclette cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons snipped fresh basil, optional
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Trim rind from the cheese. Slice the cheese 1/4-inch thick. Cut
each slice in half; you should have two square pieces, about 1 1/2
to 2 inches square.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pieces 2 inches apart on a nonstick cookie sheet (the
cheese will spread). Sprinkle each piece with some of the pecans.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the oil bubbles from the
cheese. Do not allow the crisps to brown or they will become
bitter. If using the basil, sprinkle over the crisps for the last
minute of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Cool the crisps on the cookie sheet for about 10 seconds and
remove with a spatula to a paper towel-lined plate.
</P>
<P>
   Serve at room temperature. They can be stored for a day or two
in a tightly sealed tin.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, there is no nutritional analysis for this recipe.
The fat bubbles up and separates from the cheese, with much of the
fat remaining behind on the cookie sheet. How much is a scientist's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recipe adapted from Hors d' Oeuvres by Gillian Duffy (Morrow
$23).
</P>
<P>
   Another appetizer that makes good use of raclette's superior
melting ability is cheese toasts. These are also good served with
soup.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the cheese must be very cold to slice.
</P>
<P>
   RACLETTE CHEESE TOASTS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 toasts
</P>
<P>
   One whole-grain baguette or country-style loaf
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces cold raclette cheese
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons whole-grain mustard
</P>
<P>
   Cut the bread on the diagonal into eight half-inch slices,
discarding the ends.
</P>
<P>
   On a baking sheet, toast one side of the slices under broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the cheese into thin pieces, using a cheese plane if you
have one.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the bread over and spread teaspoon mustard on the untoasted
side of each slice. Top toast with the cheese, dividing equally.
Broil until the cheese is just melted, about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recipe from Gourmet magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 181 calories, 9.7
g fat, 33 mg cholesterol, 410 mg sodium.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional way to serve raclette is from a wheel softened
in front of an open fire. That can be a fireplace inside or a
charcoal fire outside. A contemporary method is to use a raclette
pan with its own little broiler to warm the cheese. Those with
neither a fireplace or a raclette pan can do a makeshift version in
the oven.

   LOS ANGELES _ Ring in the Chinese Year of the Rabbit with a
feast of creations by Martin Yan, that fun-loving and entertaining
master of public television's cooking show ``Yan Can Cook'' who is

   For more than two decades (and 1,500 shows), Yan has brought
Asian culture and cooking into homes throughout this country. Now
he has compiled his favorite dishes in ``Martin Yan's Feast: The
Best of Yan Can Cook,'' (Bay Books; $34.95). It features 200
creations he has been making for years, along with 75 new recipes.
All have been updated and designed for contemporary cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today are looking for something fast, quick, healthy
and delicious,'' emphasized Yan during a telephone interview from
his San Mateo home. ``Nobody _ not even the Chinese _ wants to make
Peking Tea-Smoked Duck at home. Very few people want to spend lots
of time (two or three hours) cooking. I've maintained the integrity
and philosophy of the cuisine but made it more accessible to the
general public.''
</P>
<P>
   For a shortcut, Yan recommends using cut-up vegetable
ingredients from a supermarket salad bar and beef, pork or chicken
strips from the meat section. It's also feasible to use
store-bought prepared stir-fry, kung pao or other sauces instead of
making your own.
</P>
<P>
   Yan has also combined cooking steps to streamline his recipes.
For instance, he avoids water blanching vegetables or poaching
meat, each separately, prior to cooking them in a wok. Instead he
cooks the meat in the wok first, removes it and then stir-fries the
veggies, adds the sauce and returns the meat to the pan. Often, he
adds vegetables to pork or chicken in the wok when the meat is 80
percent cooked and then finishes off the dish. Yan also avoids long
ingredient lists, keeping them to a manageable eight to 12 items
when possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Yan also pays close attention to presentation,
using modern plates and arranging the food like works of art to
make the dishes look interesting. In the book, as in his television
shows, he tries to encourage and excite _ not intimidate _ his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese home cooking is basically very down to earth,'' he
said. ``We're doing everyday cuisine _ homey, comfort food. The
dish itself is simple _ the way you present the dish is what makes
it appetizing. Cooking isn't just about getting the right answer.
It's also one of life's greatest pleasures.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his memories of the Chinese New Year in China,
Yan, who was born in the Year of the Monkey (the Chinese zodiac,
centered around 12 animals, is believed to determine the
personality and fortune of those born during each animal's
respective year), delved into his truly unfortunate growing up
years in China in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much food or much to eat,'' he recalled, adding
that before he was 13, the Chinese New Year was almost nonexistent
for him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The first Chinese New Year he actually celebrated _ with
firecrackers, carnivals and different foods _ was in Hong Kong, he
noted, where he went to apprentice in an uncle's restaurant shortly
after his 13th birthday. ``It was just like Christmastime in the
U.S.,'' he recalled, but added, ``The Chinese New Year is more into
celebration and food symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Chinatown during the celebration, he noted, you'll
find tangerines, pomelos and red envelopes (which are filled with
money and given to children and single people to wish them good
luck and good fortune) in the stores. Restaurants feature special
menus with foods such as black moss (a hairlike seaweed which is
tasteless but quite expensive and is used in dishes to bring good
fortune) and dried oysters (to wish people good business and good
fortune).
</P>
<P>
   Lettuce wraps are also served. Lettuce symbolizes giving birth
and wealth and riches. The filling is usually dried oysters. Fish
is traditionally served for Chinese New Year, as is something
stuffed with mushrooms. During this time, the Chinese eat round
cookies, which are a symbol of coins and money.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of his new book includes Yan's reflections on
the road his life has taken in China, Hong Kong, Canada and
California (including the University of California, Davis, where he
earned both bachelor's and master's degrees in food science and met
his wife, Susan). In addition to recipes, the book also includes
technique information and a guide to ingredients. It makes for some
interesting reading.
</P>
<P>
   Yan, who resides in San Mateo with his wife and 6{-year-old twin
sons, believes in cooking healthy food _ lots of fish, vegetables
and tofu _ for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also eat a lot of pasta and noodles. My sons love to eat
raw tofu with soy sauce,'' said Yan, adding that they also like
chili garlic sauce and hot and spicy food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cook what you enjoy _ experiment, be passionate and
adventurous,'' advised Yan. ``And always try a dish before you say,
`No.' Food is a reflection of one's life. You have to eat every day
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
MINCED POULT &LR; R &UR; Y WITH WALNUTS IN LETTUCE CUPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my version of a favorite banquet dish that's often
served on festive occasions as a symbol of longevity. The crisp,
chilled lettuce makes a wonderful contrast to the warm filling, and
the sweetness of the hoisin sauce marries all the flavors.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
6 dried black mushrooms &QL; 
Water &QL; 
3/4 cup walnuts &QL; 
1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken, turkey OR duck &QL; 
1 tablespoon oyster-flavored sauce &QL; 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1 teaspoon minced ginger &QL; 
1 small carrot, cut into 1/4-inch cubes &QL; 
1 small zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch cubes &QL; 
1 cup diced water chestnuts OR jicama &QL; 
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine OR dry sherry &QL; 
1 teaspoon sesame oil &QL; 
Hoisin sauce &QL; 
12 small iceberg lettuce cups!off!
</P>
<P>
   Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20
minutes; drain, reserving 1/4 cup of soaking liquid. Discard stems
and chop caps.
</P>
<P>
   Spread walnuts in a pie pan. Toast in preheated 350-degree oven,
stirring once or twice, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Let nuts cool, then coarsely chop.
</P>
<P>
   Cut chicken into 1/4-inch pieces. Place in a bowl with
oyster-flavored sauce; stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place a wok over high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil,
swirling to coat sides. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until
fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add chicken and stir-fry 1 minute. Add
carrot, zucchini and water chestnuts; stir-fry 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Add reserved mushroom soaking liquid; cook until vegetables are
tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Add wine and sesame oil; cook until
heated through. Add walnuts and toss to coat.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spread hoisin sauce on a lettuce cup, spoon in some of
chicken mixture, wrap in lettuce cup and eat out of hand. Makes 4
to 6 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
WATERCRESS SOUP WITH CRAB &LR;  &QL; 
``This is a popular Cantonese treat, yet ironically watercress is
not of Chinese origin. It was brought to China by Western traders,
and over the centuries it has found a perfect home in Chinese
cuisine, as in this savory seafood broth.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARINADE: &QL; 
2 teaspoons cornstarch &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
SOUP MIXTURE: &QL; 
1/4 pound cooked crab meat, flaked &QL; 
2 teaspoons vegetable oil &QL; 
3 slices ginger, EACH the size of a quarter, lightly crushed &QL; 
4 cups chicken broth &QL; 
1 cup water &QL; 
1 bunch watercress (about 3/4 pound), coarse stems trimmed &QL; 
1/2 cup sliced carrots &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon white pepper!off!
</P>
<P>
   Combine all Marinade ingredients in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add crab meat and stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes. &QL; 
Place a 2-quart pan over high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil,
swirling to coat sides. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until
fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add crab meat and stir-fry 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Add broth and water; bring to a boil. Add watercress and
carrots. Reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are
tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. &QL; 
Stir in sesame oil and pepper. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
MANGO BEEF &LR;  &QL; 
``Like many Hong Kong-trained chefs, I love to combine the flavors
of meat and fresh fruit. Here, it's a case of meat meets mango in a
sizzling sweet-and-savory stir-fry. If you can't find mangoes, you
can substitute pears or peaches.'' &QL; 
MARINADE: &QL; 
1 tablespoon oyster-flavored sauce &QL; 
1 teaspoon cornstarch &QL; 
BEEF MIXTURE: &QL; 
3/4 pound beef sirloin, cut into 1/2-inch cubes &QL; 
1 ripe mango (about 1 pound) OR pear &QL; 
1 large Granny Smith OR other tart apple &QL; 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1 teaspoon minced ginger &QL; 
1/4 cup diced red bell pepper &QL;

   Add beef and stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes &QL; 
Peel mango and cut flesh from pit; cut flesh into 3/4-inch cubes.
Peel and core apple; cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
</P>
<P>
   Place a wok over high heat until hot. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons
vegetable oil, swirling to coat sides. Add ginger and cook,
stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add beef and stir-fry
until no longer pink, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Remove meat from wok.
</P>
<P>
   Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil to wok, swirling to
coat sides. Add mango, apple and red pepper; stir-fry 2 minutes.
Return meat to wok and add plum sauce, wine and soy sauce. Cook
until heated through. Add nuts and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Place on a serving plate and garnish with chile slices. Makes 4
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
CHICKEN AND SEAFOOD TRIO IN A BASKET &LR;  &QL; 
``This delicate stir-fry will be a hit, if you serve it in a
deep-fried edible basket.'' &QL; 
Water &QL; 
3/4 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch lengths &QL; 
1/2 pound mixed seafood (firm white fish fillets, scallops and
shrimp) &QL; 
1/4 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast &QL; 
1 tablespoon cornstarch &QL; 
1 egg white &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL;

tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Cut seafood into 1/2-inch cubes. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch
cubes. Coat seafood and chicken with cornstarch, egg white, salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place a wok over high heat until hot. Add oil, swirling to coat
sides. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10
seconds. Add seafood, chicken and green onion; stir-fry 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Add broth, oyster-flavored sauce and fish sauce; bring to a
boil. Add cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce boils
and thickens. Add asparagus and toss to mix.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon seafood mixture into 4 Edible Baskets. Makes 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   EDIBLE BASKETS: To make EACH edible basket, you need 2 (6-inch)
metal strainers. In a wok, heat vegetable oil for deep-frying to
350-degrees F. Peel and shred OR finely julienne 1 medium potato
(taro root OR cooked fresh egg noodles also can be used).

   Rinse shredded potato under cold running water; squeeze well to
remove as much moisture as possible and pat dry with paper towels.
Toss potato with 1 teaspoon cornstarch.
</P>
<P>
   Dip strainers into hot oil to coat them. Line 1 strainer with

<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
DRESSING: &QL; 
3 to 4 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1 teaspoon sesame oil &QL; 
3 tablespoons plum sauce &QL; 
SALAD MIXTURE: &QL; 
1/2 cantaloupe OR 1/4 honeydew melon &QL; 
1 grapefruit &QL; 
1/4 cup thinly sliced sweet pickled ginger &QL; 
1 medium carrot, shredded &QL; 
1/4 pound (3-inch wedge) jicama, shredded &QL; 
1 tablespoon sesame seeds &QL; 
6 ounces salmon fillet &QL; 
6 ounces firm white fish fillet, such as sea bass &QL; 
1 tablespoon lime juice &QL; 
1 tablespoon vegetable oil &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon white pepper &QL; 
1/4 cup chopped roasted peanuts &QL; 
1 green onion, slivered!off!
</P>
<P>
   Combine all Dressing ingredients in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For Salad, peel melon and cut into crescents. Segment grapefruit
by cutting away peel and white pith; cut and lift out segments. In
a bowl, combine melon, grapefruit, pickled ginger, carrot and
jicama.
</P>
<P>
   Place sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium heat; cook,
shaking skillet frequently, until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
Immediately remove from skillet to cool. &QL; 
Remove skin and any bones from fish. Thinly slice fish across grain
to make pieces about 1 by 2 inches. Fan slices on a serving

sesame seeds and green onion. Makes 4 to 6 servings. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOMATO BEEF FRIED RICE &QL; 
``Fried rice provides an easy way to convert bits of leftovers into
a quick snack or one-dish meal. There are no strict guidelines for
the embellishments, but you must start with cold cooked rice so the
grains remain separate when stir-fried. A wok is traditional for
cooking fried rice, but I find a nonstick frying pan works even
better and is so much easier to clean.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
SAUCE: &QL; 
3 tablespoons ketchup &QL; 
2 tablespoons soy sauce &QL; 
2 teaspoons sesame oil &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon salt &QL; 
BEEF MIXTURE: &QL; 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1/2 pound ground beef &QL; 
1 small onion, chopped &QL;

4 cups cold cooked long-grain rice &QL; 
1 medium tomato, peeled, seeded and chopped &QL; 
1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed &QL; 
2 eggs, lightly beaten!off!
</P>
<P>
   Combine all Sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For Beef Mixture, place a wide nonstick skillet over high heat
until hot. Add oil, swirling to coat sides. Add beef and stir-fry 1
minute. Add onion and green onions; stir-fry 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce heat to medium; stir in rice, separating grains with back
of a spoon. Add tomato, peas and eggs. Cook, stirring constantly, 1
minute. Add sauce and cook, stirring, until heated through. Makes 4
to 6 servings. &UR;

PUT LOVE OF DESSERT IN THE AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Valentine's Day just around the corner, here
is a trio of sweet sensations designed to win the hearts of those
you love. They are bound to earn rave reviews from all who indulge.
</P>
<P>
   The Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cup Pie and Raspberry Streusel
Bars are copycat versions of creations sampled at the Corner
Bakery, which recently opened in the new Commons shopping center in
Calabasas, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The original Corner Bakery opened its doors alongside Maggiano's
Littly Italy restaurant in Chicago in 1991. Today there are 38
Corner Bakery locations in various cities around the country. The
first California Corner Bakery adjoining a Maggiano's restaurant
opened in the South Coast Plaza complex in Costa Mesa, outside the
mall near Sears, in 1997, and a free-standing Corner Bakery is now
open inside the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cup with its three layers _
chocolate crust, peanut butter filling and brownie on top _ sold at
Corner Bakery is an individual-serving size. Although it was
delicious, I found the crust very hard and difficult to cut through
and eat. At first I thought it was overbaked, but the manager
assured me that was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   For ease and convenience, I took the liberty of creating a pie
instead of mini cups _ but with the same layers and basic
ingredients. The pie, which took a couple of tries to perfect, came
out great _ and the taste is close to the original. Also, the crust
in the recipe included here is easier to cut through than the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a colleague was in ecstasy about the Corner Bakery
Raspberry Streusel Bars and tipped me off that they would be great
to duplicate. I couldn't wait to try them. The bars are rich,
sinful and fabulous _ and among the best I've sampled. With their
tender and flaky crust and streusel topping, they are layered with
plenty of raspberry preserves in between.
</P>
<P>
   The replica version is a close facsimile and goes together in a
jiffy with butter, sugar, flour and vanilla. To streamline the
recipe, I used the same mixture for the crust and streusel topping.
After reserving some of the mixture for the topping, I added a
little whipping cream to the remainder to bind it together for the
crust. Use red raspberry preserves with seeds, like the Corner
Bakery does (I prefer Knott's Berry Farm brand). The trick to
keeping the jam from overflowing underneath the crust is to build
the crust at least an inch up the sides of the pan prior to
spreading on the preserves. Make a batch of these for your
sweetheart for Valentine's Day _ you won't be sorry!
</P>
<P>
   The Congo Tart at Tahiti restaurant in Los Angeles is a decadent
ending to any meal. Jackie Ravel Knezevich of BakeAway bakery makes
it for the restaurant and was kind enough to share the recipe,
which I tweaked a bit _ with wonderful results. Again, I opted to
make a single tart rather than individual ones like the restaurant
serves. Present the slices embellished with a scoop of coffee ice
cream and a drizzle of hot fudge sauce _ or simply top with
unsweetened whipped cream spiked with bourbon or rum. Any way you
serve it, it's a winner. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE CUP PIE &QL; 
CRUST: &QL; 
1 1/2 cups crushed Oreo cookie crumbs (put Oreo cookies in a food
processor and process until finely crushed) &QL; 
1/2 cup (4 tablespoons) butter, melted &QL; 
PEANUT BUTTER LAYER: &QL; 
1 cup crunchy peanut butter &QL; 
1/4 cup whipping cream &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 cup powdered sugar &QL; 
BROWNIE LAYER: &QL; 
1/2 stick (1/4 cup) butter &QL; 
1 square (1 ounce) unsweetened chocolate &QL; 
1/2 cup granulated sugar &QL; 
1 egg &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1/4 cup flour &QL; 
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips &QL; 
1/4 cup chopped nuts
</P>
<P>
   For Crust, in a small bowl, combine cookie crumbs and butter,
mixing well. Press into bottom and up sides of ungreased 9-inch
deep-dish pie plate.
</P>
<P>
   For Peanut Butter Layer, combine all ingredients, mixing until
well-blended.
</P>
<P>
   Turn into cookie crust and carefully spread evenly.
</P>
<P>
   For Brownie Layer, in a glass bowl or measure, combine butter
and chocolate. Microwave on high power 45 seconds. Mix well and
microwave 30 to 45 seconds longer until chocolate is melted.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in granulated sugar, egg and vanilla and with a fork, mix
well. Stir in flour until well-mixed. Mix in chocolate chips and
nuts. Carefully spread evenly over peanut butter layer.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 30 to 35 minutes or until
brownie is set. Cool to room temperature before cutting into
slices.
</P>
<P>
   Serve slices topped with a dollop of whipped cream. Refrigerate
any leftovers. Makes 8 to 10 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RASPBERRY STREUSEL BARS &QL; 
2 cups flour &QL; 
1 cup sugar &QL; 
1 cup butter (2 sticks), softened slightly and cut into 16 pieces &QL; 
2 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons whipping cream &QL; 
1 cup red raspberry preserves with seeds!off!
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl of food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine
flour and sugar and process briefly to mix. Add butter pieces and
vanilla and process a few seconds, until mixture is crumbly and
there are many pieces the size of large peas. Do not overprocess.
Remove 1 2/3 cups of mixture and set aside to use for streusel
topping.
</P>
<P>
   To mixture remaining in food processor bowl, add whipping cream
and process until mixture holds together. Press into bottom and
1-inch up sides of a buttered 8-inch square baking pan. Carefully
spread preserves evenly over bottom of crust (NOT up sides).
Sprinkle top with reserved streusel mixture, pressing lightly into
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 30 to 35 minutes or until top
and edges are golden. Cool thoroughly before cutting into 9 large
squares. Store in refrigerator if not eating within a day. Makes 9
large raspberry bars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CONGO TART &QL; 
1 refrigerated pie crust (1/2 of a 15-ounce package) OR pastry for
a single crust pie &QL; 
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter &QL;

2 teaspoons flour &QL; 
1/2 cup whole, lightly toasted macadamia nuts &QL; 
1/2 cup lightly toasted pecans &QL; 
1/2 cup lightly toasted walnuts &QL; 
1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut &QL; 
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips!off!
</P>
<P>
   Unfold pie crust and turn into an ungreased 9-inch fluted tart
pan with a removable bottom. Carefully press into bottom and up
sides. Line with foil, pressing into crust lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 450-degree oven 5 minutes. Remove foil and
continue baking 4 minutes more. Remove from oven.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a small pan or skillet, melt butter over medium
heat. Cook until butter browns, watching carefully. Do not burn.
Strain butter and cool. In a medium bowl, whisk together butter,
egg, sugar, salt, vanilla and corn syrup until light. Whisk in
flour, mixing until well-blended.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: When downtown wasn't run-down
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share their memories of growing up in small-town
America. Back then, or at least the way we remember it, life was
like a dream.)

<P>
   MEXIA, Texas _ Every trip I make through downtown Mexia leaves
me saddened and misty-eyed. Nostalgia overtakes me as I view the
vacant buildings and caved-in structures.
</P>
<P>
   During my growing-up years in the 1940s and '50s, there were no
vacant buildings, and faces everywhere were familiar.
</P>
<P>
   So many wonderful memories of so many wonderful people!
</P>
<P>
   Aubrey Franklin was always on hand to welcome shoppers to Duke &AMP;
Ayers, and he never seemed to mind that the new toys were tested
along the floor of the aisles ... Pearson Saltsman was the affable
butcher at Hitt Grocery ... Mrs. Wortham, Mrs. Spencer and Josie
Chandler were the helpful ladies at the Sears catalog store.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday nights found no empty parking places when the stores
stayed open late and families and friends gathered to shop and
visit. The stores were packed, people visited from car to car, and
the National and Palace theaters were full.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 9 or 10, Mother began sending me to town to run
errands, pay bills, etc. My bicycle would remain parked by the City
Hall, and there was never a concern that it would not be there when
I returned.
</P>
<P>
   Funny smells came from the Bill Moss Shoe Shop.
</P>
<P>
   Cox &AMP; Forrest Drugstore was a child's delight with its
marble-top soda fountain, tall leather bar stools, slow-moving
ceiling fans and ice cream tables and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Karner-Phillips was a ``grown-up'' store, and there was a cage
at the back where the cashier, Mrs. Ione Busby, sat.
</P>
<P>
   Gafford's Furniture had hope chests to die for.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Noles' J.C. Penney store was equipped with those
fascinating change cups which were zoomed by cable to the cashier,
Mrs. May, upstairs. How funny it was when the cup was not properly
secured and money rained down everywhere!
</P>
<P>
   Christmas toyland in Penney's basement was a magical wonderland
that seemed as large as a football field.
</P>
<P>
   The J&AMP;V Cafe was a popular gathering place, and Eubanks Hardware
was an institution with its wonderful creaking wooden floors and
leathery smells.
</P>
<P>
   On Main Street was the International Harvester dealership where
my dad worked for Ralph and Mabel Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Boss McKenzie was THE law in town, trains stopped regularly at
the depot and the textile mill whistle awakened the whole town each
morning. In summer the aroma from the cotton gin was delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Later, growing up, I worked summers and weekends at the dime
store making 30 cents an hour. My only worry back then was whether
I'd have a Saturday night date.
</P>
<P>
   I was blessed with loving Christian parents and a delightfully
happy childhood that was touched by the lives of so many who helped
mold me during my young years.
</P>
<P>
   Our downtown may be crumbling, but memories are forever!

 &HT;    MindSpring finds the way to San Jose
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ According to the guidebooks, U.S. 101,
California's Bayshore Highway, is not the way to San Jose. At least
not the right way. Interstate 280 is far prettier, going through
mountains, past lakes and other scenic vistas. But for the plugged
in and wired crowd, U.S. 101 is the only way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Every exit _ Cupertino, Palo Alto, Mountain View and Santa Clara
_ is another off-ramp on the real-life information superhighway.
Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, Netscape, Intel, USWeb, Informix,
Yahoo! and Netcom, the Internet service provider being acquired by
Atlanta's MindSpring, all call this little corner of the world
home.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling down U.S. 101 makes the so-called parking lot deal
between cable modem provider At Home and Web portal Excite in
nearby Redwood City not only plausible but downright inevitable.
You can't swing a cat without hitting some 24-year-old techie who
is making more money than his parents by spending 18 hours in front
of a state-of-the-art computer working on what nearly everyone,
even pinstriped analysts way back in New York, is convinced is the
Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   You've really got to love a place where ComputerWorld is
considered recreational reading, where the Technology Museum is
bigger than the Art Museum _ and has longer lines. And, in this
world, having three jobs in three years is seen as visionary
instead of aimless.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of this high-tech wonderland is Netcom, which
MindSpring snapped up for $245 million last month. Netcom operates
out of sleek Italian-modern offices in the heart of San Jose. It's
a good bet the chief executive officer does not have lawn furniture
in his office, as does MindSpring Chairman Charles Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring is pretty much an unknown quantity in California.
Brewer bought his way into technology's most exclusive neighborhood
_ a place most of his neighbors grew up in. Back home in Atlanta,
Brewer is king of the world. His company's every move is chronicled
and applauded in a city desperately trying to draw attention to its
growing high-tech community.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Silicon Valley, MindSpring is just another
technology company in a region dominated by technology companies.
Brewer is just another quirky company chairman in a sea of quirky
company chairmen, including Apple's Steve Jobs, Sun's Scott
McNealy, Intel's Andy Grove, and ``chief Yahoos'' Dave Filo and
Jerry Yang.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring is working hard to get noticed out here. Business and
tech types know MindSpring by reputation and by its stock price,
but California consumers still need convincing. The ``road
warriors'' who man MindSpring's psychedelic interactive traveling
bus say the puzzled looks began somewhere around Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the psychedelic bus. MindSpring's mini-media blitz through
the Valley and San Francisco was planned long before the Netcom
acquisition. The appearances and special events aren't about Netcom
or about connecting the two companies in consumers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring has been sponsoring ice skating events at San
Francisco's Embarcadero Center business/shopping complex since
early December. Thursday night the company pulled out all the stops
and sponsored ``singles skating night'' in conjunction with a local
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter with virtual computer games and a similarly
outfitted (and loud) monster truck were also there with balloon
banners and bright neon green MindSpring stickers for all skaters
to wear. The rink wasn't packed, but MindSpring banners were
everywhere _ even visible from the top floors of the nearby Hyatt
Regency hotel.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring says events like this aren't about signing up
subscribers, but creating a personal connection between potential
customers and the company.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of touchy-feely customer contact that is
supposed to go over well in California. But most of the skaters
were more interested in skating than MindSpring. Several skaters
got their kicks by telling MindSpring staffers what other (and
better) ISP they used, and no, not even the best customer service
in the world will make them switch. The MindSpring staff doesn't go
for the hard sell. They truly believe these misbegotten souls will
eventually see the light.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Netcom, already a venerable presence in the
Valley. One of the first companies to provide Web access to
consumers nationwide went public long before it became trendy.
</P>
<P>
   Its presence in the Valley consists of high-profile sponsorships
and community involvement. It is a charter sponsor of the pro
hockey team, the San Jose Sharks, and a major sponsor of the flashy
purple and orange San Jose Museum of Technology and Innovation.
Many of its 400,000 subscribers were online long before the
Internet was the rage du jour. In fact, Brewer was a Netcom
subscriber before the Internet became a major commercial enterprise
but canceled after a brief, frustrating experience in the early
'90s. He went on to become an excellent example of the adage, if
you want something done right, do it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of MindSpring's core values and beliefs now hang in
Netcom's offices, but otherwise it's business as usual. The
MindSpring team has been racking up frequent flier miles going to
San Jose to teach and to learn. Netcom employees say they are happy
to be part of MindSpring _ its stellar customer service will soon
be serving Netcom subscribers who've been moaning about lousy
service for years. Netcom wants the good MindSpring stuff, but not
at the price of its own identity and reputation in San Jose and
nationwide as an Internet pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Will MindSpring sponsor the beloved San Jose Sharks? Will it be
a good steward of the Netcom legacy? Nobody knows yet, but if the
fabulous California roadshow is any indication, watch for a
MindSpring banner at next season's Sharks games.

VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT PLEDGES TO REWRITE CONSTITUTION 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ In his first hours in office, President
Hugo Chavez Frias sent tremors through the political establishment
by moving to rewrite the Constitution in a process that is highly
likely to replace the newly elected Congress with one that has more
of his allies.
</P>
<P>
   For Chavez and his supporters, the 1961 Constitution is a symbol
of a corrupt political system that has fed popular resentment and
apathy. It was written by leaders of the two traditional parties,
Accion Democratica and Copei, to keep Marxist groups aligned at the
time with Cuban-backed guerrillas out of the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Marxist and socialist groups in the coalition that elected
Chavez sorely want to replace the document. As he took his oath of
office on Tuesday, Chavez called the Constitution moribund even as
he pledged to uphold it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution, and with it the ill-fated political system
to which it gave birth 40 years ago, has to die,'' Chavez said in
his address. ``It is going to die, Sirs. Accept it!''
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign leading to his landslide victory in December,
Chavez said that he wanted to replace the ban on presidential
re-election, opening the way for him to run for a second five-year
term in 2003. That led to warnings from opponents that Chavez, who
as an army officer started an unsuccessful coup against the
civilian government in 1992, was still a power-seeking
authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also said he hoped that a new Constitution would take
politics out of the judiciary by replacing the congressional
appointment of judges with one based on selection by a board of
legal scholars. He expressed hopes that a new Constitution would
also replace the system in which party bosses manage the selection
of congressional candidates and then control their votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaigns last year, Chavez's opponents said that a
referendum to form an assembly with powers to draft a new
constitution would be unconstitutional. But last month the Supreme
Court backed Chavez's position, and congressional leaders said that
Congress should call for the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Chavez issued the referendum decree, saying that
Congress should focus its energies on economic policy. His decree
set in motion a year of campaigning over three referendums, one on
whether to rewrite the Constitution, a second to elect delegates to
the assembly that would rewrite the Constitution and a third on
ratifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Some opposition leaders criticized Chavez for circumventing
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But most, apparently reluctant to take on Chavez at the height
of his popularity, had words of mild praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a government that needs cooperation,'' said Alcibiades
Castro, congressional leader of Copei.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez hopes that a series of ballot victories over the next
year will bolster his support among voters as he takes unpopular
measures like slashing government payrolls and imposing new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Many legislators, all elected to five-year terms, widely are
expected to resign to run for the assembly. Chavez's coalition
holds about a third of the seats in each chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Chavez believes by making the Congress more
representative it will be more favorable to him,'' a Western
diplomat who insisted on anonymity said. ``This process gets him
off to a very powerful start.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Winds roaring down the east slopes of the Colorado Rockies
gusted to 100 mph or more across the northeast corner of the state
early Wednesday. The fierce winds were fed by momentum from fast
jet stream winds associated with a disturbance moving across the
upper Middle West. On Thursday, the jet stream disturbance will
arrive in the Northeast, paving the way for rain and snow across
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will develop during the day over much of New England as the
jet stream disturbance helps to spawn a surface low pressure system
along the northern Middle Atlantic Seaboard. Snow will be confined
to high elevations in the Adirondacks of upstate New York to the
Green Mountains of Vermont, with snow eventually spreading to the
White Mountains of New Hampshire and the Longfellow Mountains of
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night and early Friday, however, rain will change to
snow over much of interior New England as the jet stream
disturbance, which marks the center of a pool of cold air aloft,
moves east toward the coast. Meanwhile, the surface low will
rapidly deepen in the Gulf of Maine, and, in the process, sending a
stream of Atlantic moisture inland. The end result will be a swath
of moderate to locally heavy snow over parts of northern New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, showers will dampen western Oregon and Washington as
moist Pacific winds persist. Snow will fall in the Cascades.
Farther inland, snow will fall on west-facing slopes of the Rockies
in the wake of a cold front slicing across the Great Basin. Showers
will fall in some of the valleys.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Downslope Windstorm
</P>
<P>
   Fierce winds gusted to 119 mph at Wondervu, Colorado, marking
ground zero of a windstorm that lashed the northeast corner of the
state. Ferocious winds that careen down the Front Range are a
cold-season feature of the regional climate. When fast winds
blowing from the west-northwest near mountain summits rise up the
terrain, they sometimes, in roller coaster fashion, descend rapidly
down east slopes. Rapid descent is favored when a narrow swath of
speedy jet stream winds pass just north and east of a location, as
happened Wednesday near northeast Colorado.

CHALLENGE FOR GOLDMAN, SACHS: SELLING STOCKS IN CHINESE POWER
COMPANY  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Much of the sparkle that China had for investors has
been dimmed by a slowing economy, debt-ridden corporate sector and
recurrent fears of a currency devaluation, which is why rivals of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. here are watching with keen interest _ and no
little relish _ as the investment firm struggles to sell shares in
a Chinese power company.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the initial public offering would be the most
significant listing of a Chinese company for Goldman since it led
the highly successful offering of China Telecom in 1996. But rather
than focus on the superlatives, analysts here are dwelling on the
uncertainties, many of which have little to do with the company,
Shandong International Power Development Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of mainland Chinese companies have declined in recent
weeks after the bankruptcy of China's second-largest investment
trust company, Guangdong International Trust and Investment.
Wednesday the Chinese government announced that it would shut down
five other investment trusts. Experts say this is the first act of
an epic change in China's corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a challenging environment for an offering,''
said John Pinkel, head of China research at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a diplomatic understatement. Analysts and fund
managers said Wednesday that Goldman, Sachs was getting a chilly
reception for the offering, which seeks to raise up to $282 million
for Shandong, one of the largest power producers in the
northeastern province of Shandong. Several analysts said Goldman
might be forced to lower the price of the shares. And some even
raised the prospect that the offering would be shelved if it did
not draw enough subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Chinese companies, Heilongjiang Agriculture and
Zhujiang Steel Pipe Holdings, canceled planned stock offerings late
last month after they could not drum up interest among investors.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Goldman, Sachs Asia, Peter Rose, declined to
comment on the Shandong stock offering, which is scheduled to be
priced on Friday and begin trading here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shandong International is not Goldman's only difficult foray
into China. The firm is directing the overhaul of a troubled state
company, Guangdong Enterprises Holdings, which alarmed its foreign
creditors last month when it disclosed that it had
higher-than-expected debts of $2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Guangdong Enterprises has been buffeted by reports
that its Hong Kong subsidiary improperly used money to speculate in
the stock market. Hong Kong's anticorruption authority has arrested
a former executive of the subsidiary, Guangnan Holdings Ltd., on
fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Guangdong Enterprises declined to comment except to say that it
would conduct its own investigation of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, meanwhile, has told creditors that it will report on
the company's finances at the end of month. But it has otherwise
been stingy with information, said one person who represents the
creditors. That has added to fears that the company's financial
troubles may go even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Shandong, Goldman must surmount more than fears
about China. The government has announced plans to deregulate the
power industry, using Shandong province as a sort of guinea pig.
While Shandong has some of the lowest operating costs of any
Chinese power company, deregulation could reduce tariffs and chip
away the company's profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can tell me exactly what the regulatory environment is
going to be in China in three years, I would buy this stock,'' said
Russell Young, a power analyst at Nomura International here. ``But
if you're walking into a deregulatory environment, you shouldn't
rush to embrace it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young is also troubled by two special dividends, valued at $94
million, which the company declared last December. The dividends
are to be paid out this year, mostly to its majority shareholder,
Shandong Electric Power Group. Its offering document said the
company would use ``internal resources'' to pay the dividends. But
some analysts fear Shandong is seriously short of money.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to its clients, GK Goh Securities said, ``We believe
the company could be quite desperate for cash by coming to the
market at this particular moment, given the poor sentiment
regarding mainland companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shandong offering has some strong selling points _ not least
that a major American utility, the Southern Co. in Atlanta, has
agreed to buy 40 percent of the shares of the offering, which would
leave it with 10 percent of the total capital of the company.
Rumors circulated Wednesday that a large European utility company
might also take a strategic stake in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody thinks Goldman is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think investors have deserted China as a
country,'' said Bill Kaye, the senior managing director of the
Pacific Group, an asset management fund in Hong Kong. Noting that
he had not read the offering document for Shandong, Kaye said, ``In
some respects, there is a price for everything.''

 &HT;    CLINTON BOOSTS MEDICARE, CRITICIZES GOP TAX PLAN
 &HT;    400&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Raising the bar for Congress, President Clinton
challenged Republicans on Wednesday to forgo tax cuts in order to
save the projected federal budget surplus to strengthen Medicare,
as well as Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the AARP (formerly the American Association of
Retired Persons) legislative council, Clinton criticized a plan
unveiled Tuesday by House Republicans to use $743 billion of the
projected $2.4 trillion surplus over the next decade for a 10
percent across-the-board income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the GOP tax cut would benefit the wealthy while not
providing support for the financially troubled Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the latest in a rather long series of large and risky
tax proposals that we have heard over the years,'' Clinton said.
``If we had adopted even one of the large ones, we wouldn't have
the surplus we enjoy today. We cannot return to the old policies of
deficit and debt.''
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address last month and his budget
proposal Monday, Clinton outlined plans to use 62 percent of the
projected budget surplus over the next 15 years to shore up the
Social Security system by reducing the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed using 15 percent of the surplus to bolster the
flagging Medicare system, which is projected to run into a deficit
by 2008 unless changes are made.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech marked the latest rhetorical skirmish over how
to use the federal surplus. Last year, the president prevailed with
his call for using the surplus for Social Security over GOP efforts
to offer a tax cut. Wednesday, he raised the stakes to include
Medicare as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who hopes to invest the surplus, or to spend it on
other programs, or to spend it with a tax cut must first tell
America's families, 'What is your plan to preserve and strengthen
Medicare in the 21st century?' `` Clinton said. ``I
</P>
<P>
   was always taught ... that you may want to do a lot of things,
but you have to do first things first. To me, Social Security and
Medicare, with their looming financial challenges, are the first
things and we have to take care of them first.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Corry, AARP director of federal affairs, said that while
there is general agreement with Clinton's plan to use 62 percent of
the surplus for Social Security, ``he is now upping the ante on the
use of the other 38 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested that his plan, to use 12 percent of the budget
surplus _ after Social Security and Medicare _ to provide tax
credits for private investment accounts for retirement would be a
better way to provide tax relief to working families than the GOP
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Such relief would be targeted to help low-income families by
providing a higher federal match on voluntary investments in the
private accounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his plan to invest about $700 billion over 15 years
in Medicare should not be seen as a way of avoiding major reforms
in the federal health care program for the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Without any changes, Medicare's hospital trust fund will be
depleted by 2008. By shifting money from the surplus into the
program, Clinton would extend the fund's life to 2020.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan commission is expected to issue its recommendations
for reforming Medicare on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing those reforms, Clinton listed four guidelines he
wants included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Using the surplus to extend the life of the trust fund.
Without that money, he predicted benefits would have to be severely
curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A modern, competitive system that ``maintains high-quality
care and top-notch service by drawing on the best private-sector
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A defined set a benefits for services that Medicare will cover
without excessive costs to the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   _ A prescription drug benefit, which Medicare does not now
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested the drug benefit, which would cost more
initially, would ultimately save Medicare money by keeping people
healthier and reducing the use of hospital services.

 &HT;    BANTAM BOOKS TO PUBLISH GLENN MEMOIR
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Glenn, America's resurrected space hero, has
signed a deal with Bantam Books to publish his memoir in the fall,
the publishing house announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 77, recently returned from nine history-making days in
orbit aboard the space shuttle Discovery, a journey that made him
the oldest man ever in space. His late October flight marked a
dramatic return to glory for Glenn, who at the age of 40 was
crowned the original space pioneer for making America's first
orbital flight in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's deal with Bantam was struck for an undisclosed sum, but
it had been expected throughout last year as he trained for the
flight. Glenn signed with a New York literary agent shortly after
NASA agreed to let him join a shuttle mission as the test subject
of experiments on how weightlessness affects elderly humans.
</P>
<P>
   During the flight, Glenn kept a tape recorder near the
pillow-end of his bunk to remind him to make entries in his oral
diary about the experience. He also had kept it close by during the
nine months he spent training for the flight at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to gaining renown as an astronaut, Glenn was a
decorated combat pilot who flew in World War II and Korea, and in
1957 set a record as pilot of the first transcontinental flight to
average supersonic speed from L.A. to New York.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bantam announcement, Glenn's book also will
deal heavily with his ``55-year partnership with his wife Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn retired after 24 years in the U.S. Senate representing
Ohio, and now is working on the creation of the John Glenn
Institute of Public Service and Public Policy at Ohio State
University. He also has been traveling around the world with his
six crewmates from the Discovery flight, providing briefings on the
shuttle flight to such groups as the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He's working with coauthor Nick Taylor on the still-untitled
John Glenn story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got deadlines,'' joked Barb Burg, a spokeswoman for
Random House, Inc. which owns Bantam.

SAMSONOV LOOKS FOR WAYS TOP END SCORING SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There's no question it's a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Samsonov hasn't scored a goal in 11 games since Jan. 15.
He hasn't had an assist since Jan. 21, a span of five games. And
hasn't compensated on defense, compiling a minus-10 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov, the NHL's rookie of the year last season, wants to do
something to get the Bruins and himself going. It's what the team
needs now. It's what he needs now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's been happening to me,'' said Samsonov, who has 15
goals and 35 points this season. ``We need some confidence. Just
one win. We come out there against Colorado (a 3-2 setback
Tuesday), but it just didn't happen. We got a lot of chances to
score, but we'll find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov is frustrated. ``I guess I'm getting my chances, but
the puck just isn't going in for me,'' he said. ``I'm getting three
or four shots per game, and it's not going in. If I keep on
working, if I keep working hard, good things are going to happen
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents aren't doing anything special to stop Samsonov. ``It's
the system,'' he said. ``Most teams are playing a trap, and it's
not a big scoring game or anything like that. You have to be
patient and wait for your chances. You can't really do anything
about it. You've just got to continue to work hard and stick to the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns took Samsonov off the first line with Jason
Allison and Dmitri Khristich against Colorado, replacing him with
Steve Heinze. Samsonov, who was with the top unit on power plays,
said he understood completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing very well together, so we needed some changes,
and obviously, it worked out well, with Jason scoring two goals,''
he said. ``I was happy for Jason. Since that line was getting good
chances, one of the goals on a power play, things got back to
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov feels he's shooting the puck enough, something just
about everyone has stressed to him since his NHL first game. ``I
have been shooting more; I'm trying to do that,'' he said. ``But if
I see someone open, I'm going to pass to him because he has a
better opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The goals and points seemed to come easily in the early part of
the season. Samsonov's longest drought before the All-Star Game was
four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying earlier this season that a lot of those goals
were lucky goals, lucky bounces,'' he said. ``I guess it's how fast
you're going to get out of the slump. The only thing that you can
do is try for more simple plays, where you don't have to make a
great play. You've got to put the puck on the net and go hard to
the net, looking for the bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   His defense is another source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I can't be too happy with that,'' Samsonov said.
``When you're on the ice, the puck goes into the net. Sometimes
it's frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, though. At minus-10, it wouldn't bother me as much
if the team were winning games. You start thinking you might be the
problem because your team isn't playing well. We've got to start
winning games. We've got to concentrate on our game.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Samsonov knows, means scoring more goals.

 &HT;    SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO AID HURRICANE MITCH VICTIMS
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A plan to spend more than $800 million to speed the
economic recovery of hurricane-devastated countries in Central
America and the Caribbean was introduced in the Senate on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. was joined by Sens. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, and Mary Landrieu, D-La., to introduce
the Central American and Caribbean Relief Act of 1999, which would
enhance trade and provide emergency U.S. assistance and financial
aid to Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Last October and early November, Hurricanes Georges and Mitch
caused extensive damage in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua,
Honduras and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic stability of the Western Hemisphere depends upon
the United States' ability and willingness to help its neighbors,''
said DeWine, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's
subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation includes the expansion of the Caribbean
Basin Initiative (CBI), originally passed by Congress in 1983,
which would give Caribbean Basin nations the same trade benefits
afforded to Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBI expansion is a step forward,'' Graham said. ``Without it,
the region's manufacturing base, its main source of economic
activity in the wake of Hurricane Mitch, will not have the
incentives it needs to grow during this period of reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for U.S. assistance to Central America.
It would provide $16 million for debt forgiveness to Honduras _ 67
percent of its debt to the United States _ $557 million in
humanitarian aid, and $150 million to replenish money spent by the
Pentagon to offer emergency assistance after the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would spend $70 million to expand the New Horizons
Program, a project that provides health care and builds roads and
schools through the U.S. military. This legislation also would
earmark $1 million to assist U.S. businesses in the region and
develop low-income housing.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also proposed assistance of $25 million for the
Central American Emergency Trust Fund, to be applied to the
countries' international debts.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is expected to announce its plans for
relief to Central America next week. Graham said he expects to see
similarities between the two proposals.

 &HT;    Problems relegate Asia to back seat
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not too long ago, everybody thought the 21st century
belonged to Asia, given the rise of Japan, China and Southeast
Asia. Not any more, Business Week (Feb. 8) suggests in its cover
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the U.S. and Europe are steadily converging to form a new
Atlantic economy _ with vast impact on global growth and
business,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   If Asia's economic problems are taking that part of the world
out of the race, the rise of the Atlantic economy is being driven
by a combination of the euro (the new European common currency),
deregulation, pension investing, a software and telecom boom, and
new styles of business management. ``Europe is in fact looking more
and more like America's twin,'' says Business Week. ``The two blocs
are bursting with market opportunities, with or without Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta in the spotlight
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta pops up more than usual in the latest batch of
national business magazines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlanta-based Miller Industries, North America's largest maker
of wreckers and other towing equipment, makes this year's list of
top stock picks assembled for Worth (February).
</P>
<P>
   Miller Industries gets high praise for entering the towing
business in addition to making tow trucks, a move ``to create the
FedEx of towing.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Inc. (February) spotlights suburban Chamblee as ``the promised
land for Latino, African and Asian immigrants'' and home of some
100 immigrant-owned businesses just seven years after projecting an
image of ``xenophobia and economic backwardness.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Fast Company (February/ March) says Atlanta-based MindSpring
Enterprises proves that ``you can forget everything you thought you
knew about Internet companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one that's growing responsibly, serving customers well
_ and making money ... it's worth $1.5 billion,'' the magazine
says.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Oil prices have slipped to levels not seen in more than a
decade _ $11 per barrel in 1998. But Ticker (February) says the
time may be right to buy energy stocks _ providing investors
``don't expect big gains anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Financial planning is important for everybody, but especially
for women, says Working-
</P>
<P>
   Mother (March). That's because ``about half of all women who are
over 65 are widows and nearly 52 percent of all marriages end in
divorce,'' making it ``imperative that women become financially
savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ America is on the brink of a trade war with Europe over
bananas. That may be unusual, but in fact it's just one of the
signs that protectionist pressure is rising in the United States,
with ``little hint of the determined political leadership needed to
resist it,'' says The Economist (Feb. 5).

<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ Suha Arafat, the first lady of the
Palestinian territories, maneuvered her blue BMW through the
chaotic streets of Gaza City, blond hair flying as she dodged
donkeys and peddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Behind and beside her, security cars struggled to keep her
covered as Palestinians stopped on the street to stare: a woman
driver is a strange enough sight in this poor, Islamic society, but
Madame Arafat chauffeuring herself?
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a bodyguard's lap, her daughter, Zahwa, bilingual in
French and Arabic, chattered away until they rounded a corner under
a giant billboard of Yasser Arafat. ``Papa!'' she said merrily,
looking herself like the image of the Palestinian leader _ if he
could be imagined as a 3-year-old girl with a blue hair ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is totally her father,'' Mrs. Arafat said. ``A real
authoritarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arafat, 35, would seem an unlikely partner for the
69-year-old Palestinian revolutionary, who remains forever wedded
to his cause.
</P>
<P>
   She was raised in a well-off home in the West Bank, educated by
nuns and refined at the Sorbonne. Her black patent leather high
heels clash with his combat boots. And her deep-seated Christian
faith and Western assertiveness seem at odds with his world:
desperate Gaza with its veiled Muslim women.
</P>
<P>
   But in ideology Mrs. Arafat, whose husband is to meet on
Thursday with President Clinton in Washington, is every bit the
fiery Palestinian freedom fighter. And if there is such a thing as
pillow talk in their modest residence, where the spartan first
floor is his and the stately second-floor extension belongs to her,
Arafat surely gets an earful.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arafat is a merciless critic not of her husband but of his
government, willing to do battle on Palestinian television with
advisers she believes are dragging down Arafat and the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every beautiful flower ends up surrounded by weeds,'' she
said. ``I'm fed up with criticizing them. It doesn't do any good.
History will be their judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, during a long afternoon in the living room of their
home, Mrs. Arafat _ surrounded by images of Jesus Christ, Pope John
Paul II and a young Arafat with lantern and gun _ was scathingly
critical of many key ventures of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed the new Yasir Arafat International Airport, which
operates under strict Israeli security supervision, as ``a branch
of Ben Gurion in Gaza,'' referring to the airport outside Tel Aviv.
She ridiculed the thriving Palestinian-run casino in Jericho as ``a
disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it,'' she said. ``It's the most shameful act that the
economic counselors of the Palestinian Authority did. Right across
from a refugee camp, no less. We have no hospitals, no sewage, sick
children, a whole sick society. But, oh, we have gambling. Great.''
</P>
<P>
   And she mocked the American-brokered peace agreement signed by
her husband and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in
October. She did not attend the signing ceremony in Washington, and
since the agreement's fulfillment has been frozen for two months,
she feels justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time we're going to get how many new inches of land, we
have to make a celebration?'' she said. ``It turns out it was only
a photo opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   For years after they were secretly married in Tunis almost a
decade ago, Mrs. Arafat was dismissed as a ``decoration'' for the
longtime bachelor, particularly by the inner circle of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, who could not bear the sight of
their fearless leader making goo-goo eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not easy to enter into their world,'' she said. ``It is
a man's world, and very closed _ like a family with a lot of
intermarriages, and, well, you know the result of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But by speaking her mind and by establishing humanitarian
institutions in Gaza, Mrs. Arafat has earned a place for herself as
a Palestinian leader in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is like a big mother for the people,'' said Randa Bamia,
the director general for international relations at the Palestinian
tourism ministry. ``She feels a lot for their miseries, and she's
very popular because of it. At first they wanted to make her out to
be frivolous, but really she lives much more modestly than the wife
of almost any minister in her husband's government.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Arafat, From Defender to Dictator,'' a new biography of
Arafat published in London by Bloomsbury, Said K. Aburish, a
Palestinian-born journalist, said he had tried to but could not
find any basis to rumors that Mrs. Arafat took advantage of her
role by making business deals.
</P>
<P>
   As she did this past autumn, Mrs. Arafat often spends months at
a time abroad, usually in Paris, where her parents keep an
apartment. That has fueled other rumors, that she was away on
shopping sprees, but she said she spent most of her time there
raising money for her relief organizations. In her Gaza life style,
there is no obvious bounty of any mad spending.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the villas of some Palestinian officials and
businessmen, the simple house rented by the Arafats is humdrum and
middle-class. Mrs. Arafat said she had to beg her husband to add
the second-floor addition so she and Zahwa would not have to share
the lower floor's two rooms with the Palestinian leader's security
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally unveiled the tasteful but hardly lavish second
floor, Arafat told her it looked like a cabaret and returned to his
monk's quarters downstairs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Arafat is in town, she visits Gaza's refugee camps
regularly, soaking up their tales of hardship and also their
complaints about her husband's government, many of which she cannot
help but agree with.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arafat endeared herself to many in the camps when she
refused on principle to accept a VIP pass from the Israelis that
would have allowed her to cross Israeli roadblocks without the
hassle that most Palestinians face.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arafat keeps a small office at one of her relief
organizations, a foundation for physically disabled children. The
center is a bright and modern place, filled with the latest
developmental toys, and Mrs. Arafat seems to have a personal
relationship with the children.
</P>
<P>
   They stroke her hair, and she hands out chocolates and quizzes
the teachers about their progress. Presented with a problem by her
staff, she wonders aloud if she can find a donor to solve it,
remarking that a French delegation is visiting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in the Authority are not very helpful,'' she said.
``They want to talk politics but not humanitarian things. But
people are fed up with politics. So what if Netanyahu gives up 30,
40, 60 percent of our land? The people want food on their table,
and decent health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is doing a lot,'' she continued, referring to
her husband. ``Sometimes he screams at me when he comes home. `Can
you imagine today you cost me $100,000, Suha?' But he is very kind
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sipping black coffee spiced with cardamom, Mrs. Arafat spoke of
intense pressures on her husband to put off the declaration of a
Palestinian state on May 4, the date that the Oslo peace accord set
for the conclusion of a final agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, as Suha and not as the wife of Arafat, that this date
is sacred,'' she said, ``and nobody in the world has the right to
make us bargain it away. We can't go on and on in this ambiguous
condition.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Depressed about what sees as a failing peace effort and
corruption within the Palestinian Authority, Mrs. Arafat said her
vision of the future is ``black.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Jerusalem, Mrs. Arafat grew up in an affluent and
political household, first in Nablus, then Ramallah. Her father was
a banker, and her mother, Raymonda Tawil, a well-known and
provocative journalist who was frequently placed under house arrest
by the Israelis. When she met the Palestinian leader, during a trip
to Amman, Mrs. Arafat was working as a free-lance journalist based
in Paris. Smitten, he hired her to do public relations for the PLO
in Tunis, where she nominally converted to Islam before they
married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I married a myth,'' she said. ``But the marriage helped him
step down from his pedestal and become a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   More tender than the old guerrilla leader, her husband still
lives in a kind of bubble, focused on the struggle, she said. Once
he sat next to Catherine Deneuve at a dinner without seeming to
notice, and Mrs. Arafat had to educate him about the French actress
by using her Paris Match magazines, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the real instruction comes from Zahwa, who was named for the
Palestinian leader's mother. An irrepressible and commanding little
girl with a mop of curly hair, she stormed and complained when she
did not see her father enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when he is in Gaza, his bodyguards pick her up from school
and take her to his seaside office. A veteran watcher of CNN on the
lap of her mother, Zahwa tells her father about Bill Clinton and
Kofi Annan and Monica Lewinsky, all the important TV characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zahwa softens Arafat,'' Mrs. Arafat said.

JOSEPH KINGSBURY-SMITH, PULITZER PRIZE WINNER, DEAD AT 90 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joseph Kingsbury-Smith, a Pulitzer-prize winning
journalist and former national editor of the Hearst Newspapers,
died Wednesday at his home in suburban Virginia. He was 90 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   During more than 60 years of service with The Hearst
Corporation, Mr. Kingsbury-Smith held a variety of posts, including
publisher of the New York Journal-American and chief foreign
correspondent for the Hearst Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   He retired as a vice president and director of The Hearst
Corporation. He also was a former trustee of the estate of William
Randolph Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist, Mr. Kingsbury-Smith interviewed most of the
contemporary world's great leaders and was widely acclaimed for his
achievements in the field of diplomacy. His exchange of
correspondence with Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin in 1949, which
became headline news around the world, was widely acknowledged to
have been a factor in the lifting of the Berlin Blockade.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusive stories of this exchange won him the George Polk
Memorial Award for Outstanding Journalism, the National Headliners
Club Award for Exclusive Foreign Correspondence, the Sigma Delta
Chi Award and, for a second time, the George R. Holmes Memorial
Award.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kingsbury-Smith won the 1956 Pulitzer prize for
Distinguished Reporting of International Affairs as a member of a
three-man team that included William Randolph Hearst Jr. and Frank
Conniff and which conducted a series of interviews in 1955 with
Nikita Khrushchev and other top Soviet leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and chief executive officer of
The Hearst Corporation, said: ``Joe's passing is a great loss to
the international journalistic community as well as to The Hearst
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the most distinguished individuals in our field
during the 20th century. He was, however, unbelievably modest when
it came to his many accomplishments; when he was inducted into the
Hall of Fame of the Society of Professional Journalists in 1992,
his speech attributed most of his achievements to chance. He will
be greatly missed.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York City, Mr. Kingsbury-Smith attended public
and private schools in New York and later the University of London.
In 1924 at age 16, he was hired as a copy boy by Hearst's
International News Service (INS). Soon after, the New York World
asked him to write a copy boy's impression of the 1924 Democratic
National Convention at Madison Square Garden. The newspaper
published the story on page 1.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, Mr. Kingsbury-Smith was assigned to the INS bureau in
London. He was transferred to the Washington bureau in 1931 and
later became chief INS diplomatic correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, he was named INS vice president and general manager.
Three years later, when INS and United Press consolidated to form
United Press International (UPI), he assumed the temporary post of
UPI vice president and associate general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kingsbury-Smith later returned to general management duties
with The Hearst Corporation before becoming publisher of the New
York Journal-American in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he was appointed European director of The Hearst
Corporation and chief foreign writer for the Hearst Newspapers,
with headquarters in Paris and later in Rome. He was named national
editor of the Hearst Newspapers in 1976 and later was appointed
director of corporate activities in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kingsbury-Smith was a Knight of Malta and a member of the
Brook Club of New York and the Metropolitan Club of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Eileen; two daughters, Eileen
Pulling and Diane Keesee; two grandchildren, Eric Odelfelt and
Helen Youngman; and two great-grandchildren.

ISRAELI PRESIDENT COMMUTES SENTENCES FOR JEWS, ANGERING
PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Ezer Weizman of Israel has commuted the
sentences of five Jews serving long prison terms for murder or
attempted murder of Arabs, an aide to Weizman announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The president, whose post is ceremonial, signed recommendations
submitted by Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, a political ally of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The move drew harsh criticism from Palestinian officials and
lawmakers from the Israeli opposition, who accused the government
of a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has refused to release Arab prisoners ``with blood on
their hands'' as part of interim peace accords with the
Palestinians. He has routinely accused the Palestinian Authority of
freeing Arab terrorists through a ``revolving door'' in its
prisons, and this week he asserted that 21 Muslim militants were
recently released.
</P>
<P>
   To deflect accusations of leniency toward Jewish killers,
Hanegbi and an aide to Weizman portrayed the reduction of their
sentences as a demonstration of even-handedness after previous
Israeli releases of Arab convicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have released thousands'' of Palestinian prisoners under
the peace accords, Hanegbi said, ``and I thought that a similar
custom should be followed when it comes to Jewish prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Aryeh Shumer, an aide to Weizman, said the president had
previously commuted the sentences of five Israeli Arabs convicted
of killing suspected informers or planting bombs. One was freed two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Jewish and Arab prisoners had expressed regret for
their actions, and the reduction of their sentences ``should be
received in the spirit of general reconciliation'' that should
accompany peace efforts, Shumer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmad Abdel Rahman, the secretary-general of the Palestinian
Cabinet, called the move a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel should have released those mentioned in the peace
accords instead of freeing Jews who killed Palestinians in cold
blood,'' he told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian negotiator, said, ``This
shows the true face of this government, which protects terrorists
and murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   One Jew whose sentence was reduced is Ami Popper, who killed
seven Palestinians in 1990 when he sprayed gunfire at a group of
laborers in the Israeli town of Rishon Letzion. Popper was given
seven life sentences, and his term has now been commuted to 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Another Jewish prisoner, Yoram Skolnick, killed a
grenade-carrying Palestinian in 1993 after he had been caught,
partly stripped and tied up near the West Bank settlement of Susia.
Skolnick was given a life sentence for the execution-style slaying,
but the term was later reduced to 15 years. It has now been cut to
11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nehemia Mashbaum was convicted as a teen-ager of throwing a
grenade in an Arab market in Jerusalem's Old City that killed an
elderly Palestinian in 1992. His sentence, previously cut from 15
to 12 years, was reduced to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Two more prisoners, Yehoyada and Eitan Kahalani, who were
sentenced to 12 years each for trying to kill a Palestinian, had
four years taken off their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television reports said the sentences of the Israeli
Arab convicts were reduced far less, to an average of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The early release of the Jewish killers ``violates the basic
principle, touted so proudly by this government, that terrorists
with blood on their hands must not be freed,'' said Yossi Sarid, a
lawmaker from the leftist Meretz Party. ``Does a murderer deserve
to be freed just because he is a Jew?''

ABE LINCOLN: MAKING THE MOST OF THE LEAST

Times Syndicate sales representative DEBRA WEYDERT at (732)

 &HT;    
 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In the century and more since his death, Americans have come to
regard Abraham Lincoln arguably as our most beloved political
figure, and inarguably as one of our most effective presidents.
 &HT;    From the thousands of Lincoln books and articles penned by
scholars over the years one unifying theme has emerged: He made the
most of the least, and he turned the worst into his best. Indeed, a
lesser man would not have been so patient in the face of adversity,
nor so persistent in pursuing his goals.
 &HT;    There were dozens of circumstances that could have turned him
aside from his purposes, and thus cost him the admiration and
respect that he subsequently earned. Consider these:
 &HT;    He was born to poor parents who could neither read nor write. He
got his schooling a little at a time, which amounted to less than a
year of formal instruction all added up.
 &HT;    His younger brother died as an infant, his older sister died in
childbirth and his mother, Nancy Hanks, died when he was but 9.
 &HT;    The lad was raised by a stepmother who could scarcely scratch
out her own name. For a spell he and up to a dozen of his kin lived
together, crowded into a small, primitive cabin.
 &HT;    As he grew into manhood Abraham was never much to behold. He had
a spare frame and angular face. His hair was thick and coarse, and
it would hardly stay put. His nose was large and his ears stuck
out. His adult voice was thin and high-pitched, and it grated on
listeners' ears. At every age he towered over all.
 &HT;    As a boy and man, Lincoln survived several of life's perils. As
a child he nearly drowned in Knob Creek; as a teen he lay
unconscious a long time after being kicked in the head by a horse.
He was almost slain by brigands on his first flatboat trip to New
Orleans, and he was robbed at knifepoint in Louisville.
 &HT;    Socially, he was awkward in polite company, and his early
relationships were tentative and melancholic. Ann Rutledge, his
first close female friend, died suddenly of a fever. His initial
engagement to Mary Todd was canceled by mutual consent. He shortly
after proposed to Mary Owens, but she turned him down.
 &HT;    Lincoln's business ventures were similarly unspectacular. He
bought a New Salem store, and then a second enterprise, but both
went bust. It took him 20 years to pay off all he owed; he ruefully
called that obligation ``the national debt.''
 &HT;    Although he eventually earned a more than adequate cash income,
he never owned much real estate. From time to time he helped out
his folks in Coles County, Illinois, but his lazy stepbrother
frittered away most of the funds Lincoln sent.
 &HT;    Lincoln eventually married Mary Todd, who turned out to be much
more than a handful. She was jealous and resentful of other women,
she was rude to Lincoln's colleagues and she had a tart tongue for
tradespeople. Mary squandered much of her husband's modest earnings
on extravagant furnishings and clothing.
 &HT;    By his own admission, Lincoln was not much of a disciplinarian
to his four growing sons. Mary ran the household, and the offspring
pretty much ran themselves. Sadly, two of the children died young,
sending Mary into unending grief.
 &HT;    Lincoln's political career took many disappointing turns among
its few key successes. He was defeated for the Illinois Assembly
his very first try, defeated twice for speaker of that house later
on, defeated for presidential elector, defeated for Congress and
defeated in a vice presidential bid.
 &HT;    And, because in 1858 U.S. senators were chosen by the various
state legislatures, Lincoln lost that year's Senate race to Stephen
A. Douglas, even though Lincoln had polled more popular votes.
 &HT;    Finally elected to the White House by only a plurality among
four strong national candidates, Lincoln presided during this
country's most perilous and tragic period. He became one of the
most reviled figures in American history at the time, among both
his own and the opposing political parties.
 &HT;    During the four-year Civil War that began six weeks after he
took office, he was frequently at odds with his own cabinet. And
his generals on the battlefield were all too often either
incompetent or reluctant to fight the enemy.
 &HT;    Seven members of Mary Todd's own Kentucky clan fought for the
Confederacy. Mary herself during the war was investigated by a
congressional committee for possible treasonable activities.
Lincoln had to personally assure the members of Congress of her
abiding loyalty to the Union.
 &HT;    By the day Lincoln was assassinated he had received dozens of
death threats. Sadly, the Union he had helped preserve could not
protect its chief.
 &HT;    Many years after Lincoln had died, poet Rosemary Benet mused,
``If Nancy Hanks came back as a ghost/Seeking news of what she
loved most/She'd ask first, ``Where's my son?/What happened to Abe?
What's he done?''
 &HT;    Americans past and present could proudly answer that inquiring
ghost by slightly paraphrasing the rest of that poem: ``Yes, Nancy
Hanks, we knew your son/He did grow tall, he did have fun./He
learned to read. He got to town. We knew his name./In spite of it
all, he did get on.''

   Consumer Digital Camera Breaks the Pixel Barrier  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Breaking another barrier for consumer digital cameras, Fuji
Photo Film USA on Wednesday introduced the first pocket-size camera
that captures more than two million picture elements, or two
megapixels, per image. The Fuji MX-2700 will cost ``well under
$1,000'' when it becomes available in April or May, a Fuji
spokesman said, and will have a maximum resolution of 1,800 pixels
by 1,200 pixels. Until now, only professional digital cameras
costing thousands of dollars each had similar resolution. Other
digital camera makers are expected to introduce two-megapixel
cameras later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Higher resolution improves the picture quality, and Fuji asserts
that its MX-2700 rivals traditional film cameras in color and
sharpness. Higher resolution also allows consumers to print bigger
enlargements of their digital images with relatively inexpensive
ink-jet color printers and photographic paper. Fuji says that
glossy color prints as large as 8 by 10 inches are now possible and
that 4 by 6 prints are ``stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Pepper, editor and publisher of the newsletter Digital Focus
(www.digfocus.com), said that while crossing the two-megapixel
threshold was significant for consumer cameras, it also means a
leap up in image storage requirements because file sizes will be
bigger. The MX-2700 will come with an 8-megabyte Smart Media card,
the Fuji spokesman said, capable of holding eight images at the
highest resolution and more than 100 at the lowest. An optional 32
MB version of the storage card will be available later this year.
Many other digital cameras use a rival storage system called
Compact Flash, which has a higher maximum capacity, 80 MB.

   In the Home or Out of It, Women Have a New Web Site
</P>
<P>
   If Cosmopolitan and Ms. magazine came together under one roof,
it might be seen as culture clash. But the operators of two
disparate Web sites for women recently announced a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com is a Web site (www.women.com) &UR;  &LR; that focuses on issues
facing professional women, entrepreneurs and mothers who both drive
the children to soccer practice and coach the team. Homearts.com,
owned by the Hearst Corp., has a softer editorial side, offering
features like how to plan a wedding around one's astrological needs
(www.homearts.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. recently purchased a 50-percent stake in
Women.com. As part of the deal, Hearst is giving Women.com control
over Homearts.com. The idea behind the merged company, called
Women.com Networks, is to create a company whose combined Web sites
will be a formidable force in attracting women and advertisers who
want to cater to them. The company points to figures from Media
Metrix, a market research company, showing that the two Web sites
will reach a combined audience larger than that of any other single
women's site.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Meier, senior vice president of Women.com, based in San
Mateo, Calif., said the newly merged sites would have no trouble
co-existing. ``Woman have many different parts of themselves,'' she
said. ``They can have their cake and make it, too.''
 &QL;

<P>
   Technology for Blind Users Even Reads the Internet Ads
</P>
<P>
   This week IBM started selling technology that allows blind users
to hear the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Called Home Page Reader, the software, which costs $149, uses a
speech synthesizer not just to read the text on a given Web page
but also to describe the graphics and even advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Other screen readers are capable of reading Web-page text. But
Paul Luther, a manager with IBM's special-needs unit, said the Home
Page Reader was designed specifically with the Web in mind and
tailored to reading pages built in HTML.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a picture of a person on bicycle, the Home Page
Reader will say, `There's a picture of a person on a bicycle,''' he
said. ``Then the blind user can say, `I'm not interested in this,'
and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   (And when there's a banner advertisement, it will probably say:
``Loading, loading, still loading. Go take a nap; I'll call you in
20 minutes.'')
</P>
<P>
   Help With Math Homework? A Search Engine Can Help
</P>
<P>
   A new search engine is tailored to help students from
kindergarten through high school do their homework. The site,
www.searchopolis.com, includes databases of sites in various
school-related categories, like history, math, science and social
studies.
</P>
<P>
   The site, created by two Internet content developers, Look
Smart, of San Francisco, and N2H2, of Seattle, also includes a
reward for homework well done: television listings.
</P>
<P>
   Web Surfers Starting to Look Like Just About Everyone Else
</P>
<P>
   The universe of Web users might need a group therapy session to
come to terms with the latest assessment of their state:
collectively, they have grown average.
</P>
<P>
   That is the essence of a new survey from the Pew Research Center
for the People and the Press, based in Washington. The study found
that the demographics of Web surfers, and their interests, had
evolved strikingly in the last two years and now more closely
resembled those of the general public.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the single most-sought-after news item on the Net
is the weather; today, 64 percent of users log on to learn about
the weather, up from 46 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, said the
changes reflected the changing demographics of the Web. ``The ways
the Internet is being used are more ordinary,'' he said. ``The
kinds of people who are using it are more typical and ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Notebook With Consumer Feel Will Be Aimed at Companies
</P>
<P>
   After years of making industrial-strength notebook computers
designed for corporate use, the Hewlett Packard Co. this week
announced its first laptop with a true consumer feel. The trouble
is that it won't be intended for consumers. The low-end of the HP
Omnibook XE includes a 266-megahertz Intel Pentium II processor, a
4.1-gigabyte hard drive and 32 megabytes of RAM. It's not a bad
package for $1,499, the expected retail price.
</P>
<P>
   But Hewlett Packard won't initially be selling it in any
consumer retail stores. Rather, the company, which markets itself
as a maker of laptops for use in large internal networks and
corporations, will continue to sell it through existing corporate
channels and on the Web. The company hopes to position the laptop
as a freestanding notebook for small- and medium-size businesses.
</P>

<P>
   Free e-mail site cuts back on services for some users
</P>
<P>
   Juno, a New York company that pioneered the concept of free
e-mail, recently announced that thousands of its users would be
able to check their e-mail only once a day. The reason, the company
said, is that those users live in regions of the country where
telecommunications costs are more expensive. Users affected by the
change who still want to check e-mail more often must pay $2.95 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ardai, the company's president, said that ``fewer than 1
percent'' of the company's 6.5 million subscribers were affected.
But he was less than reassuring when asked whether he might expand
the geographic area falling under the once-a-day for checking
e-mail. ``I have no opinion about that,'' he said. While the Juno
service is free, users view banner advertisements that appear at
the top of messages. The idea of advertising-supported e-mail, and
the related concept of advertising-supported Internet access, have
attracted many entrepreneurs. But analysts contend that the
business model presents difficulties because millions must be spent
on marketing and technology to build a subscriber base to attract
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Ardai wrote to the subscribers affected by the latest Juno
limitation and suggested his motive was not profits, but keeping
the service widely available. He asked those subscribers who could
afford it to pay $2.95 a month to upgrade their service so they
would be helping to subsidize the accounts of members who cannot
afford service. ``You will be helping us to move closer to this
important goal,'' he wrote, of providing ``free e-mail services to
all Americans.''

SENATE PREPARES FOR BATTLE OVER LEWINSKY TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL, JUDY HOLLAND and DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican Senate braced for a struggle
Thursday over whether to have former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky testify at the impeachment trial of President Clinton _ in
person or on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The White House tried to forestall personal testimony by the
25-year-old former presidential paramour by embracing admission of
Lewinsky's entire videotaped testimony rather than having House
prosecutors present excerpts to the 100 senators.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart also sought to allay
Republican concerns that Clinton might claim vindication if the
Senate fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict and
remove the chief executive from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now declare in a post-impeachment era, this is a gloat-free
zone,'' Lockhart said. Clinton is accused of perjury and
obstruction of justice in trying to conceal his affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Senate prepared to vote Thursday on
the request by House prosecutors to admit videotaped testimony from
Lewinsky, presidential confidant Vernon Jordan and White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans theoretically have enough votes to admit witnesses'
testimony on videotape or in person because the party holds 55 of
the Senate's 100 seats. A majority of 51 votes is all that would be
needed to admit videotaped testimony or live witnesses in the first
presidential impeachment trial since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   But key Republican senators said the outcome was too close to
call on the question of admitting the taped statements.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said: ``It's too early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Sens.
Larry E. Craig of Idaho and Olympia Snowe of Maine echoed the
caution, saying they couldn't predict the vote.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said the Senate would vote Friday on whether to
invite one or more of the three witnesses to testify before the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But again, Republican senators voiced doubts about actually
calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he favored calling witnesses, but added: ``I
seriously doubt that there will be the votes to have any live
witnesses in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe said she could not ``personally foresee circumstances
under which we would call Monica Lewinsky'' to the floor of the
Senate to provide testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said she had learned so
``few new things'' from viewing videotapes of Lewinsky and Jordan
that ``I would not say that we need to have them on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., a former Democrat, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of the same, nothing explosive, no dynamite,''
Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors completed three days of videotaped depositions
Wednesday, questioning Blumenthal on allegations that Clinton
coached his subordinate in a scheme to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, leader of the
13-member prosecution team seeking the conviction and removal of
Clinton, said prosecutors ``always prefer live witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be open to questions from senators (and)
cross-examination in a setting conducive to truth telling,'' said
Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., who questioned Blumenthal, said the
prosecutors had a ``constitutional duty'' to make a case before the
Senate with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who questioned Jordan on Tuesday,
said senators deserve to have the witnesses present for
questioning. Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor during the
Reagan presidency, said ``live testimony's better than video and
video is better than written statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, reversing iron-clad White House opposition to
testimony on the floor of the Senate, announced that the
president's team could accept the presentation of videotaped
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said ``there's no need to release these videotapes,''
but added: ``If the Senate majority decides that there is some
compelling reason that they have to release them, this shouldn't be
done in snippets.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., echoed the White
House position. ``We should take it all or we should not take any
of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman said if the Senate voted to admit videotaped
testimony, he expected the entire depositions to be admitted as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any groundswell to only put out snippets,''
Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News/New York Times survey released Wednesday showed that
more than two-thirds of the people questioned said the Senate does
not need to call witnesses to help senators decide on the two
articles of impeachment adopted by the House on Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six percent disapproved of the way the Senate was handling
the trial; 37 percent approved.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said the Republicans would pay a political price if they
agreed to summon witnesses. ``Live witnesses will do nothing but
perpetuate a trial that now nobody wants,'' Daschle said. ``The
more the Republicans demand an extension, the more it becomes a
Republican trial.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying over witnesses took place amid equally frenetic
maneuvering over a Republican-backed proposal for the Senate to
endorse a so-called ``finding of fact'' that would declare Clinton
guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice without taking the
next step of removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is a middle-ground approach. The Constitution
requires the Senate to come up with a two-thirds vote, or 67
senators, to vote for conviction and removal of a president.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of votes last week showed that the White House has
at least 44 Democrats _ 10 more than the 34 required _ to block any
Senate effort to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman said the Senate would debate various proposals
over a possible statement of wrongdoing next week before a final
vote on the two articles of impeachment on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., rejected the
``convict-but-don't-evict'' scenario as an end run around the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Offering senators a ``way to convict the president without
having to accept responsibility for removing him from office would,
in effect, bastardize the impeachment process,'' Byrd said in an
opinion piece published Wednesday in the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   But the approach was finding favor among some Republicans.
Craig, the No. 4 Republican in the Senate leadership, said a
finding of fact met the requirements of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitution does not say we can not make expressions of
the finding of the court,'' Craig said, dismissing a
post-impeachment vote on censure ``a wet noodle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said a finding of fact was ``certainly
worth discussing,'' adding: ``It's not a verdict, not a
condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, in a bid to shift the Senate focus to an effort to
censure the president, set up a task force to develop a censure
resolution. Daschle said he hoped Sens. Dianne Feinstein of
California and Patrick Moynihan of New York could work out a
censure resolution with the Republicans.

KOSOVO NEGOTIATORS FORESEE AN IMPOSED SETTLEMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The negotiators who will direct the talks
on Kosovo this weekend between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians
believe they will have to impose a settlement on the parties
quickly, senior Western diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill, and
Wolfgang Petritsch, the Austrian ambassador to Belgrade and the
European Union's special envoy for Kosovo, will run the talks at
Rambouillet, outside Paris, along with a Russian diplomat, Boris
Mayorski. The talks will be conducted under the general
chairmanship of the French and British foreign ministers, Hubert
Vedrine and Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and Petritsch have already sketched out the first two days
of the talks, in which the Serbs and the fractious ethnic Albanian
delegation will meet in plenary session to state their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, however, as the hosts try to impose a news blackout
on the participants, the negotiators will be flexible in their
approach, using direct talks as well as isolating each side and
shuttling between them.
</P>
<P>
   But the negotiators believe that both sides, after six months of
shuttle diplomacy by Hill and Petritsch, have ``quite a good idea
by now of what the outcome is likely to be,'' one senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
   By coming to the talks, the antagonists ``accept they have to
negotiate, even if compromise is an evasive idea in the Balkans,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But after a relatively short time, another senior official said,
``a compromise accord is likely to be presented to the parties and
basically imposed upon them, with credible threats directed toward
both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get across the message that you mean business and
that there is international resolve behind you, and that there will
be a price to be paid for a lack of seriousness,'' the official
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to the Serbs is clear: punitive air strikes on
targets in Serbia that will be costly for the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, to replace. But the threat to the Kosovo
Liberation Army, should it violate a cease-fire or refuse to
compromise, can also be real, the officials insisted.
</P>
<P>
   American and NATO officials are already working to reduce the
flow of arms to the guerrillas from Albania and are using
sophisticated surveillance techniques along the mountainous border.
While no one believes that border can be sealed, the officials have
talked with the government of Albania about a more intensive
international effort to scrutinize the Tirana airport and the
Albanian ports of Vlora and Durres to prevent the smuggling of arms
and money to the ethnic Albanian forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Liberation Army bank accounts can be closed, the
officials said, and communications and logistics disrupted. The
ethnic Albanians have also been told that the current international
support and sympathy for them and their fight for self-rule could
quickly disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators understand that these talks are ``a high-wire
act,'' one senior official said. ``But I feel confident because of
the resolve of the international community _ the United States, the
European Union and especially the Russians. This is the single most
important chance to come to an early compromise settlement, even if
the conflict won't end in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The structure of the negotiations is intended to preserve the
unusual unity on the Kosovo issue so far by the member nations of
the so-called contact group on the former Yugoslavia, which
includes Russia, Serbia's traditional ally, and the United States,
Britain, Germany, France and Italy. The group is backed by the
influence of the European Union, the U.N. Security Council and the
military might of NATO, which is providing the iron fist behind the
elegant surroundings of Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   The principles for a settlement, backed by the contact group,
are carefully drawn to try to allow both sides to come away feeling
that they have gained important successes, the officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under an internationally supervised and enforced three-year
interim agreement, the ethnic Albanians will gain effective
self-government under newly elected authorities, with almost
complete independence from the authority of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Yugoslavia, headed by Milosevic, will control
foreign, defense, trade, monetary and fiscal policy _ but not
internal security or police. Still, Kosovo will not become
independent for the period of the agreement and will remain a part
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav army units will have to be sharply reduced in number
and confined to barracks, while NATO peacekeepers patrol the
province. The current Serbian police in Kosovo will be folded into
a larger Kosovo police force, which as a whole will more closely
reflect the population, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, and
will largely patrol local areas where Serbs are dominant.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a dispute-resolution mechanism and a joint
commission to supervise implementation, but much power will be
vested in the head of the international monitoring force of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, currently
William Walker, an American diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE will also organize and monitor new elections and
promote a freer press and media.
</P>
<P>
   While the negotiators expect the Serbian delegation to be
difficult, they expressed the most frustration with the divided
Albanian delegation, where the increasingly popular fighters of the
Kosovo Liberation Army are trying to diminish the power of the
formally elected ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, who has
pledged himself to nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army is also resisting efforts by the
prime minister of the Kosovo Albanian government-in-exile, Bujar
Bukoshi, to put more former members of the Yugoslav army on the
rural-based guerrilla force in an effort to professionalize it. The
Kosovo Liberation Army also wants Bukoshi to relinquish control of
money raised from Albanian exiles abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are slowly realizing that the Albanians can be as much
a problem as the Serbs,'' one official said. ``Some of them think
they can get independence through fighting. Others mistrust the
international community. Others simply want to promote themselves.
If they ran a state like this, it would be disastrous.''

INDIA, PAKISTAN LEADERS PLAN NEW ROUTE TO PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India
accepted a warmly worded invitation Wednesday from Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan to ride the first bus to roll from India
to Pakistan in half a century and to search for a breakthrough to
peace between the hostile nations.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the two leaders, probably in a month, would be
their third since India and Pakistan conducted underground nuclear
tests in May. The idea for the Delhi-Lahore bus service emerged at
a meeting in September when they were in New York for a U.N.
session. In recent months the leaders have developed a closer
rapport during regular telephone conversations, Sharif and Indian
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif invited Vajpayee, whom he described as ``an extremely
decent man'' in an interview with Shekhar Gupta, editor in chief of
The Indian Express, an English-language daily here, which was
published Wednesday. By Wednesday afternoon the Indian prime
minister had accepted.
</P>
<P>
   In a transcript of the interview provided by Gupta, an effusive
Sharif promised that Vajpayee, arriving on the luxurious
air-conditioned bus that India is outfitting , would be received
with a hospitality ``so great that people will not forget it for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will even be happy to go back with him,'' Sharif added. ``We
will solve 50 percent of our problems, make 50 percent progress on
all issues, on our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, who was in Lucknow Wednesday, said, ``I would like to
have a bus ride to Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, a spokesman for the External Affairs Ministry, K.C.
Singh, said, ``His visit will be one more manifestation of India's
abiding desire to build peaceful, friendly and cooperative
relations with Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee has recently gone out of his way to ensure that the
first cricket series between India and Pakistan in a decade was
peaceful. He publicly accused Hindu militants who had dug up a
cricket field in New Delhi of being cowards, though they are active
in the Shiv Sena, a party that his Bharatiya Janata Party is in a
coalition with in the state of Maharashtra.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee also sent the home minister to press the Shiv Sena
chief to withdraw his threats to disrupt the games. The series
ended peacefully on Sunday, with a victory for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Sharif proposed that the countries go beyond
setting up bus service and competing in sports to discuss with ``an
open mind'' the core issue that has poisoned their relations since
they became independent in 1947, their rival claims to Kashmir. He
also said the countries should talk directly about nuclear weapons,
missiles and conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries have been holding
talks since October on peace and security problems. But they have
generally repeated their unyielding positions, including on
Kashmir. Some experts fear that the region could become a nuclear
flash point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say, Vajpayee Sahib, let's solve the Kashmir
problem, let's solve the other problems, so that we can also move
on like the rest of the world,'' Sharif said. ``See, there are such
great prospects for our cooperation in business and investment. You
are busy making weapons, and so are we, because we are competing
against India. Some rivalry this is!''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif said he believed that the people of Pakistan were ready
to normalize relations with India. Both nations are scarred by the
violent division of the subcontinent in 1947 into predominantly
Hindu India and majority Muslim Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years have already gone by,'' Sharif said. ``How many
more decades are we going to waste? Are we going to waste all our
resources in the arms race?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been wishing for a long time to come to India and see
the Red Fort, Agra or those parts of Delhi that represent its rich
culture and history,'' he said. ``Similarly, I believe that the
people of India are fervently hoping to visit Pakistan, see Lahore
or visit the houses and villages they have left behind. They don't
get a visa, nor do our people. Nobody comes, nobody goes.''

SENATE PREPARES FOR BATTLE OVER LEWINSKY TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Drops `Republican' in lede; pickup 2ndgraf: The White
House)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL, JUDY HOLLAND and DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate braced for a struggle Thursday over
whether to have former White House intern Monica Lewinsky testify
at the impeachment trial of President Clinton _ in person or on
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The White House tried to forestall personal testimony by the
25-year-old former presidential paramour by embracing admission of
Lewinsky's entire videotaped testimony rather than having House
prosecutors present excerpts to the 100 senators.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart also sought to allay
Republican concerns that Clinton might claim vindication if the
Senate fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict and
remove the chief executive from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now declare in a post-impeachment era, this is a gloat-free
zone,'' Lockhart said. Clinton is accused of perjury and
obstruction of justice in trying to conceal his affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Senate prepared to vote Thursday on
the request by House prosecutors to admit videotaped testimony from
Lewinsky, presidential confidant Vernon Jordan and White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans theoretically have enough votes to admit witnesses'
testimony on videotape or in person because the party holds 55 of
the Senate's 100 seats. A majority of 51 votes is all that would be
needed to admit videotaped testimony or live witnesses in the first
presidential impeachment trial since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   But key Republican senators said the outcome was too close to
call on the question of admitting the taped statements.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said: ``It's too early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Sens.
Larry E. Craig of Idaho and Olympia Snowe of Maine echoed the
caution, saying they couldn't predict the vote.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said the Senate would vote Friday on whether to
invite one or more of the three witnesses to testify before the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But again, Republican senators voiced doubts about actually
calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he favored calling witnesses, but added: ``I
seriously doubt that there will be the votes to have any live
witnesses in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe said she could not ``personally foresee circumstances
under which we would call Monica Lewinsky'' to the floor of the
Senate to provide testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said she had learned so
``few new things'' from viewing videotapes of Lewinsky and Jordan
that ``I would not say that we need to have them on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., a former Democrat, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of the same, nothing explosive, no dynamite,''
Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors completed three days of videotaped depositions
Wednesday, questioning Blumenthal on allegations that Clinton
coached his subordinate in a scheme to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, leader of the
13-member prosecution team seeking the conviction and removal of
Clinton, said prosecutors ``always prefer live witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be open to questions from senators (and)
cross-examination in a setting conducive to truth telling,'' said
Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., who questioned Blumenthal, said the
prosecutors had a ``constitutional duty'' to make a case before the
Senate with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who questioned Jordan on Tuesday,
said senators deserve to have the witnesses present for
questioning. Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor during the
Reagan presidency, said ``live testimony's better than video and
video is better than written statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, reversing iron-clad White House opposition to
testimony on the floor of the Senate, announced that the
president's team could accept the presentation of videotaped
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said ``there's no need to release these videotapes,''
but added: ``If the Senate majority decides that there is some
compelling reason that they have to release them, this shouldn't be
done in snippets.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., echoed the White
House position. ``We should take it all or we should not take any
of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman said if the Senate voted to admit videotaped
testimony, he expected the entire depositions to be admitted as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any groundswell to only put out snippets,''
Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News/New York Times survey released Wednesday showed that
more than two-thirds of the people questioned said the Senate does
not need to call witnesses to help senators decide on the two
articles of impeachment adopted by the House on Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six percent disapproved of the way the Senate was handling
the trial; 37 percent approved.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said the Republicans would pay a political price if they
agreed to summon witnesses. ``Live witnesses will do nothing but
perpetuate a trial that now nobody wants,'' Daschle said. ``The
more the Republicans demand an extension, the more it becomes a
Republican trial.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying over witnesses took place amid equally frenetic
maneuvering over a Republican-backed proposal for the Senate to
endorse a so-called ``finding of fact'' that would declare Clinton
guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice without taking the
next step of removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is a middle-ground approach. The Constitution
requires the Senate to come up with a two-thirds vote, or 67
senators, to vote for conviction and removal of a president.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of votes last week showed that the White House has
at least 44 Democrats _ 10 more than the 34 required _ to block any
Senate effort to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman said the Senate would debate various proposals
over a possible statement of wrongdoing next week before a final
vote on the two articles of impeachment on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., rejected the
``convict-but-don't-evict'' scenario as an end run around the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Offering senators a ``way to convict the president without
having to accept responsibility for removing him from office would,
in effect, bastardize the impeachment process,'' Byrd said in an
opinion piece published Wednesday in the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   But the approach was finding favor among some Republicans.
Craig, the No. 4 Republican in the Senate leadership, said a
finding of fact met the requirements of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitution does not say we can not make expressions of
the finding of the court,'' Craig said, dismissing a
post-impeachment vote on censure ``a wet noodle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said a finding of fact was ``certainly
worth discussing,'' adding: ``It's not a verdict, not a
condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, in a bid to shift the Senate focus to an effort to
censure the president, set up a task force to develop a censure
resolution. Daschle said he hoped Sens. Dianne Feinstein of
California and Patrick Moynihan of New York could work out a
censure resolution with the Republicans.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As Johnny Muhammad tells me about his
childhood, I am thinking I know this story, know the loneliness in
his words. It's like crying under a driving rain. No one can see
the tears, but they're there.
</P>
<P>
   He is a little boy, he recalls, no more than 8 or 9. But as
always, the adult world beckons him to be a man. He washes the
dishes, makes sure his little sister's hair gets combed and the
homework gets done.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, to help make ends meet, there is an odd job for him
to do. And if he manages to go to school at all, learning is out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't focus on studying, because I was focused on making
sure the door was locked,'' he says. ``Did I make sure I locked the
front door?''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, 33, repeats his story often these days for seventh-
and eighth-grade students at Dunbar Middle School in Fort Worth. He
hopes he can have a positive effect on kids whose lives have not
been much different from his.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, one of four behavior-modification instructors in the
Fort Worth school district, works with students at risk of being
suspended or expelled because of discipline problems. Under the
program, which began this school year, members of the local
nonprofit African-American mentoring group Umoja offer guidance,
anti-drug messages and other instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad shares his story so students will know that they, too,
can overcome even the worst neglect, the worst odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at them and I see me,'' he says. ``I came from the same
kind of environment _ trying to make money to help out. I want them
to know that if Mr. Muhammad can get through it, they can, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He sits now just inside the door of the school auditorium. He is
a survivor who has gone from desperation to redemption, from
homeless crack addict to custodian to teacher. He has been clean
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   It would not have been possible, he says, had it not been for
the teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and Minister Louis
Farrakhan, teachings that a friend shared with him.
</P>
<P>
   The most important teaching, he says, is to love yourself. He
also says it's the one he tries hardest to impart to his students
who ``don't just have low self-esteem. They have no self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time most students meet Muhammad _ if they are lucky
enough to meet him _ abuse and neglect have taken their toll and
have resulted in academic failure, mischievous behavior, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, he gets discouraged. He has four or five hours a day
to reach students, and it often seems too little. But while he has
them, he tries to get the students to see why they are worth
loving, to show them that one mistake doesn't define who they are.
</P>
<P>
   What is troubling to him is that he knows his story may not make
a difference. The reservoir of bitterness can be a powerful one,
even deadly; the community's apathy can be too entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have men tell me all the time `Brother Johnny, you're
getting too close,' '' he says. `` `Brother, you're just wasting
your time. That's a lost cause. The only way they're going to get
it right is when Jesus returns.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I say, `Well, don't you have Jesus in you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad maintains that whether one believes in the teachings of
Jesus or in those of some other God, it is time for adults to put
aside religious differences, to put aside titles and to work
together to make a difference in the lives of children.
</P>
<P>
   He says he feels blessed to be able to share his story, to do
his part.

A LIFE NOT WORTH LIVING IS WORTH SHARING

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As Johnny Muhammad tells me about his
childhood, I am thinking I know this story, know the loneliness in
his words. It's like crying under a driving rain. No one can see
the tears, but they're there.
</P>
<P>
   He is a little boy, he recalls, no more than 8 or 9. But as
always, the adult world beckons him to be a man. He washes the
dishes, makes sure his little sister's hair gets combed and the
homework gets done.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, to help make ends meet, there is an odd job for him
to do. And if he manages to go to school at all, learning is out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't focus on studying, because I was focused on making
sure the door was locked,'' he says. ``Did I make sure I locked the
front door?''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, 33, repeats his story often these days for seventh-
and eighth-grade students at Dunbar Middle School in Fort Worth. He
hopes he can have a positive effect on kids whose lives have not
been much different from his.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, one of four behavior-modification instructors in the
Fort Worth school district, works with students at risk of being
suspended or expelled because of discipline problems. Under the
program, which began this school year, members of the local
nonprofit African-American mentoring group Umoja offer guidance,
anti-drug messages and other instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad shares his story so students will know that they, too,
can overcome even the worst neglect, the worst odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at them and I see me,'' he says. ``I came from the same
kind of environment _ trying to make money to help out. I want them
to know that if Mr. Muhammad can get through it, they can, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He sits now just inside the door of the school auditorium. He is
a survivor who has gone from desperation to redemption, from
homeless crack addict to custodian to teacher. He has been clean
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   It would not have been possible, he says, had it not been for
the teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and Minister Louis

</P>
<P>
   The most important teaching, he says, is to love yourself. He

QUICK! DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH ITS HEART!

<P>
   With all the hand-wringing that studios go through to pick out
movie titles, you'd think they'd try to make them critic-proof as
well. It's like parents who attempt to give their children
pre-adolescent jibe-proof names.
</P>
<P>
   If the people at 20th Century Fox had such foresight, they might
have avoided phrases like `` `Simply Irresistible' is actually
easily resistible'' or clever retitlings such as ``Simply
Irritating.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Michelle Gellar, riding her fame from skewering
bloodsuckers on the WB's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' has made
some less-than-stellar big-screen choices. After forgettable scream
queen portrayals in ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' and
``Scream 2,'' Gellar shuns serial killers for a heaping helping of
gooey romance _ not that she's abandoned all things dark and creepy
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Gellar is Amanda Shelton, the hapless chef of a struggling
Tribeca restaurant _ successful when her mother was at the stove.
Amanda lacks Mom's panache, so the customers have dwindled to a
hard-core few.
</P>
<P>
   Her fortunes change when she encounters what is presumably her
guardian angel or fairy godfather or whatever (the script never
makes it clear), who sells her a basket of magic beans, uh, I mean
crabs, and introduces her to the man she'll fall in love with, Sean
Patrick Flanery, who tries way to hard to make something of this
nothing part.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a watchful guardian crab, Amanda becomes a
master chef overnight, whipping up dishes that give patrons a
plateful of her deepest emotions. She even wows Flanery's Tom
Bartlett, a hotshot young exec opening a chichi restaurant in an
uptown department store _ can you guess where this is going from
three miles away?
</P>
<P>
   Matters heat up quickly as magical occurrences become
commonplace: vanilla peach desserts cause the lovers to float over
pools of bubbling dry ice, caramel pastries spark the same kind of
aphrodisiac response as Herbal Essence shampoo. There's conflict,
there's resolution and everyone lives happily blah, blah, blah, but
you've figured it out five minutes into the movie. The whole thing
has about as much depth as an ``ABC Afterschool Special,'' but
that's really not fair to after-school specials.
</P>
<P>
   Gellar and Flanery make convincing young lovers, but the premise
of their relationship is such hurl-inducing hocus pocus, you're
begging for Puritans to show up with torches and giant stakes.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of stakes, how 'bout putting aside the schmaltz and
making a ``Buffy'' movie, Sarah?
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply Irresistible'' is rated PG-13 for mild profanity, adult
subject matter and sexual innuendo.

COMMENTARY: THE PHANTOM ALLIANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: boldfaced words should be italicized) 
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A specter is haunting the Middle East _ the
specter of a Phantom Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, Israel and the United States firmly deny its existence.
The Turks assure fellow Muslim nations that its new military and
economic ties to the Israelis don't threaten them. The Americans
say the U.S. tilt toward Turkey should be of no concern to Arab
monarchs. The Israelis say: Alliance? What alliance? No one of the
three is committed to go to war if another is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The more vociferous the denials, the more other nations become
convinced that the Phantom Alliance is now a Middle Eastern fact of
life. And they're right.
</P>
<P>
   Turks, unfairly kept out of the European Union by Germany and
Greece, see America as making the world go round and Israelis as a
key to American support.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis need a powerful friend in the Muslim world and the
large Turkish land mass over which to train their air force.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans need Turkey as a base to strike Iraq, and
recognize that keeping sanctions on Saddam Hussein also hurts the
Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Now follow the three-way backscratching. The Turks sell textiles
and other commodities duty-free to Israel, which adds its labor to
the product and sells it to the United States duty-free. This
boosts the Turkish economy, which hires Israeli companies to
construct power plants and develop irrigation projects. Meanwhile,
the United States leans on oil companies to build a pipeline from
the Caspian Sea through Turkey rather than Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis side with the Turks against the Greeks on Cyprus. A
couple of Israelis were just jailed by the Greeks for snooping
where Russian S-300 SAMs aimed at the Turks were scheduled to be
installed. The United States, not wanting to block a Russian sale,
got the Greeks to put the weapons on Crete rather than Cyprus, and
to reduce charges against the Israelis from espionage to
``possessing scanning equipment without a license.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel urges the United States to sell Turkey our Apache
helicopters, to use in the battle against the ``bad'' Kurds seeking
to break off a piece of Turkey. Meanwhile, U.S. and Israeli
intelligence and diplomats help track down the Turks' most wanted
Kurd, Abdullah Ocalan, forced out of Damascus by a threat by Turkey
to invade Syria and now seeking refuge everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Turks quietly help the United States support the
``good'' Kurds in northern Iraq who may cause Saddam trouble,
despite Turkish worries about autonomous regions becoming
independent Kurdistan. And we need Turkey to lead the Turkic
peoples of Southwest Asia away from fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   But never say ``the allies.'' It's just the Three Musketeers
marching along together, sometimes all for one and occasionally one
for all.
</P>
<P>
   Others want to join the informal club. These range from Muslim
separatists in Chechnya to a much more significant player _ Egypt _
of late stridently anti-Israel. President Hosni Mubarak visited
Turkey three times in the past two months. He apparently sees his
economic lifeline from the U.S. endangered by the Phantom Alliance
and may want the largest Arab nation to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan seemed to be in, but King Hussein's firing of his brother
as successor throws that into doubt. If Palestinians seize his
Hashemite throne, Jordan could line up with a grouping of enemies
of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, when almost any  &UR; entente &LR;  becomes  &UR; cordiale &LR; , it
invites a counter-grouping. Although Russia is temporarily impotent
and the Saudis permanently feckless, Iran, Iraq, Syria and its
captive, Lebanon, and the emerging Palestinian state may be
strange-bedfellowing. We can hope that Greek-Americans can prevail
on Athens to avoid such an unpromising alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that any war will immediately spread through the
region? No; this is not NATO vs. the Warsaw Pact. In a local fight,
there would be much holding of coats.
</P>
<P>
   But the untreatied association is good for the three democracies
of Turkey, Israel and America. People in Istanbul remind me that in
the year 1492, when Ferdinand and Isabella cruelly banished all
Jews from Spain, the Ottoman Empire's Sultan Beyazid II welcomed
the refugee Israelites to what is now Turkey. Another event of the
same year paved the way for what has become the Phantom Alliance.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT FACES FRESH CREDIBILITY GAP
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government sought to poke a hole in the
credibility of Microsoft Corp. Wednesday by showing in court that
the software giant used a flawed videotape to mount its antitrust
defense.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in as many days that Microsoft was unable
to drive home its charge that the government's prototype program
for separating Windows 98 from its built-in Internet Explorer
browser broke the operating system. The issue is important because
if the government can show that Microsoft tied the browser to
Windows as a marketing move to harm rival Netscape Communications
Corp., the judge in the case _ after it's proven such a solution is
technically feasible _ could order the company to ship Internet
Explorer as a separate application.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's four-minute tape purported to show that the removal
program, devised by Princeton professor Edward Felten, caused
Windows to behave as if it had fallen victim to a digital lobotomy.
</P>
<P>
   But that effort broke down when Microsoft Senior Vice President
James Allchin was forced to admit under cross-examination on the
witness stand that the demo was taped on multiple computers,
running various applications, rather than, as originally claimed
simply on a virgin machine that had been simply ``Feltenized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has not been a good demonstration,'' Allchin
allowed, offering to bring his own laptop to court Thursday in
another bid to prove that, contrary to the government's claim in
the antitrust case, Windows and its browsing tool are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   Such a live demo would violate court rules. But the episode
clearly exasperated U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson who
told Allchin: ``It certainly casts doubt on the reliability _ the
entire reliability _ of your video demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was an agreement, reached at a hastily convened bench
conference, that Microsoft would try once more Wednesday night to
test its Felten-destruction thesis and show the results in the
courtroom on a new video Thursday. Both Allchin and a host of
government experts were to be present at Microsoft's Pennsylvania
Avenue law offices to referee the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go about it the right way and get to the bottom of
this,'' promised Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Allchin said earlier discrepancies in the
video, uncovered Tuesday by David Boies, the government's lead
lawyer, arose from inadvertently filming a computer that had once
had the Prodigy Internet service on it.
</P>
<P>
   The original Microsoft tape sought to show how, even after the
Felten program had run, users could still get out to the Internet
via the Windows help utility system, as well as through the
remaining vestigial stub of the browser, which ran far more slowly
than the full-fledged product.
</P>
<P>
   But the demo flopped because instead of the title ``Windows
98,'' which appears at the top of the Felten version of Windows,
were the words: ``Internet Explorer.'' David Boies seized on the
shift, asking Allchin how he could claim the Felten program made
Windows run more slowly when the screen suggested it wasn't even
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I'm seeing here,'' Allchin replied, ``they filmed
the wrong system.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, the three technicians who performed the lab
tests had arrived here on a commercial flight from Seattle with the
computer they used for their tests. Overnight, they showed Allchin
how they had installed and then uninstalled a copy of the Prodigy
Internet service. After they removed Prodigy, the title bar that
once read ``Windows 98'' again read ``Internet Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   This patch job held for a few hours until Boies blew his
multiple-machine hole in Microsoft's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence that they have put forth to the court is simply
unreliable,'' Boies said on the courthouse plaza. ``This is not
public relations. This is not sales _ you've got to come up with
something that is accurate and something that someone can be
cross-examined on.''

FRENCH FIND $2.9 MILLION IN ASSETS SEIZED DURING THE HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A government-appointed panel examining the seizure of
assets from Jews in France during World War II has reported finding
$2.9 million taken from deportees to Nazi death camps that was
never claimed and remains in a government bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the second interim report since it was set up in 1997, the
nine-member panel, headed by the prominent banker and Resistance
veteran Jean Matteoli, recommended on Tuesday that if the money
remains unclaimed, it should go to a government fund to expand the
Memorial to the Unknown Jewish Martyr in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also recommended that thousands of seized paintings
and other art works now in museums and French diplomatic and
government buildings here and abroad should be assembled and
publicly exhibited so that rightful owners or their heirs get
another chance to make claims.
</P>
<P>
   At least two-thirds of the roughly $1 billion of Jewish property
that was seized in France was reclaimed and restored to its
original owners in the first five years after the war, the panel
reported.
</P>
<P>
   But after 1948, postwar French society turned to other things,
and the issue of remaining unclaimed Jewish assets sank into the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed public outrage half a century later was prompted by the
discovery that French museums were exhibiting works of art whose
rightful owners they had done little to try to find, and by claims
from Jewish groups that banks had profited from deposits of gold
bullion and cash that belonged to people killed in concentration
camps.
</P>
<P>
   After President Jacques Chirac did what none of his predecessors
had dared to do and publicly acknowledged that France, not just the
collaborationist authorities based in Vichy, had been guilty of
crimes against humanity in helping the Nazis persecute Jews on
French soil, the government decided to find out how much injustice
still remained 50 years after the incomplete restitutions it made
just after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 75,721 Jews the French authorities deported to Auschwitz
from camps at Drancy, north of Paris in the German-occupied zone,
and elsewhere between 1941 and 1944, only 2,564 came back. The
total population of Jews in France during the war was estimated at
330,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who disappeared were people who had fled the Nazis
from Poland and other countries in Central Europe. They left behind
orphans who had no way of claiming the often meager assets that had
been taken from their parents, and the commission has recommended
lifetime government pensions for Jewish survivors previously denied
them because they were not considered French.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report said it had found a total of 9,733,308
wartime francs _ the equivalent of $2.9 million today _ still in
the state national deposit bank. Maurice Kiffer, a French
functionary scandalized by what he and other French administrators
of the camp at Drancy were being made to do by the Germans, had
deposited the money in escrow accounts there for the people who had
been forced to surrender it.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Lebegue, the head of the bank, the Caisse des Depots et
Consignations, said it would cooperate fully in efforts to return
funds to their rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 168 banks and other financial institutions listed as
having blocked tens of thousands of accounts by Jewish depositors
following Nazi orders in the occupied zone between 1940 and 1942,
the commission said, were a few American ones which have said they
would cooperate to return themoney in the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It listed them as Morgan &AMP; Co., now part of the J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co., Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, now also part of J.P. Morgan,
and Chase Bank, now part of Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth institution, American Express, was also named in the
report, but a spokeswoman said that it was not aware of any
accounts that were turned over to Nazi authorities but that it is
reviewing its archive. Its offices in occupied France were closed
in early 1941, the spokeswoman said. The report estimated that
altogether, these American banking operations had about 60 such
accounts, their total value unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by a group of six large French banks and the
French Bankers Association said they welcomed the recommendations
of the commission, which reflect many of the recommendations the
banks themselves have made in the past.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT FACES FRESH CREDIBILITY GAP
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government sought to poke a hole in the
credibility of Microsoft Corp. Wednesday by showing in court that
the software giant used a flawed videotape to mount its antitrust
defense.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in as many days that Microsoft was unable
to drive home its charge that the government's prototype program
for separating Windows 98 from its built-in Internet Explorer
browser broke the operating system. The issue is important because
if the government can show that Microsoft tied the browser to
Windows as a marketing move to harm rival Netscape Communications
Corp., the judge in the case _ after it's proven such a solution is
technically feasible _ could order the company to ship Internet
Explorer as a separate application.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's four-minute tape purported to show that the removal
program, devised by Princeton professor Edward Felten, caused
Windows to behave as if it had fallen victim to a digital lobotomy.
</P>
<P>
   But that effort broke down when Microsoft Senior Vice President
James Allchin was forced to admit under cross-examination on the
witness stand that the demo was taped on multiple computers,
running various applications, rather than, as originally claimed
simply on a virgin machine that had been simply ``Feltenized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has not been a good demonstration,'' Allchin
allowed, offering to bring his own laptop to court Thursday in
another id to prove that, contrary to the government's claim in
the antitrust case, Windows and its browsing tool are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   Such a live demo would violate court rules. But the episode
clearly exasperated U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson who
told Allchin: ``It certainly casts doubt on the reliability _ the
entire reliability _ of your video demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was an agreement, reached at a hastily convened bench
conference, that Microsoft would try once more Wednesday night to
test its Felten-destruction thesis and show the results in the
courtroom on a new video Thursday. Both Allchin and a host of
government experts were to be present at Microsoft's Pennsylvania
Avenue law offices to referee the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go about it the right way and get to the bottom of
this,'' promised Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Allchin said earlier discrepancies in the
video, uncovered Tuesday by David Boies, the government's lead
lawyer, arose from inadvertently filming a computer that had once
had the Prodigy Internet service on it.
</P>
<P>
   The original Microsoft tape sought to show how, even after the
Felten program had run, users could still get out to the Internet
via the Windows help utility system, as well as through the
remaining vestigial stub of the browser, which ran far more slowly
than the full-fledged product.
</P>
<P>
   But the demo flopped because instead of the title ``Windows
98,'' which appears at the top of the Felten version of Windows,
were the words: ``Internet Explorer.'' David Boies seized on the
shift, asking Allchin how he could claim the Felten program made
Windows run more slowly when the screen suggested it wasn't even
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I'm seeing here,'' Allchin replied, ``they filmed
the wrong system.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, the three technicians who performed the lab
tests had arrived here on a commercial flight from Seattle with the
computer they used for their tests. Overnight, they showed Allchin
how they had installed and then uninstalled a copy of the Prodigy
Internet service. After they removed Prodigy, the title bar that
once read ``Windows 98'' again read ``Internet Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   This patch job held for a few hours until Boies blew his
multiple-machine hole in Microsoft's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence that they have put forth to the court is simply
unreliable,'' Boies said on the courthouse plaza. ``This is not
public relations. This is not sales _ you've got to come up with
something that is accurate and something that someone can be
cross-examined on.''

JAPAN UNLIKELY TO EXPERIENCE NEW WAVE OF FOREIGN TAKEOVERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ohio)  (sidebar with GOODYEAR-SUMITOMO) 
(bl) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co.'s deal for control of most
operations of Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. echoes faintly an
earlier U.S.-Japanese marriage in tires. In 1988, amid a wave of
high-profile Japanese acquisitions in the United States,
Bridgestone bought Firestone of Ohio for $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's agreement comes as Japan undergoes a surge of
mergers and acquisitions _ including some involving U.S. companies.
But a reversal of the 1980s trend is unlikely, and few here expect
the Goodyear deal to herald a new flood of foreign takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't see it,'' said Clifford Shaw, head of Merrill
Lynch Mercury Asset Management Japan Ltd. ``I don't think this is
the beginning of a major trend.''
</P>
<P>
   For one, investment bankers said, the Goodyear-Sumitomo deal was
spurred by competitive pressures specific to the tire industry.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the lingering recession that is forcing Japanese
companies to seek out deals also means that many assets up for sale
may not be at the top of international shopping lists. How many
auto companies want to buy a plant and increase capacity? How many
foreign companies want to pay for expensive headquarters here? Or
the real estate under a department store when renting is markedly
cheaper?
</P>
<P>
   Recent purchases by foreigners have largely been in financial
services _ deals that are also being driven by the deregulation of
Japanese markets. Companies like GE Capital, Citigroup and Merrill
Lynch have been picking off struggling operations while others are
forming joint ventures and other alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reactive M&AMP;A rather than pro-active on the part of the
Japanese companies,'' said Craig Chudler, a strategist with Salomon
Smith Barney in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, deals between Japanese companies are breaking fast and
furiously. Toshiba Corp. has been paring its exposure to affiliates
and subsidiaries, as has its rival, Hitachi Ltd. Nippon Oil Co.,
Japan's largest refiner, is buying Mitsubishi Oil Co. in an effort
to consolidate, and Asahi Chemical Industry Co. has agreed to sell
its processed foods subsidiary to Japan Tobacco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the number of mergers and acquisitions involving
Japanese companies rose 35 percent last year, to 908 deals,
according to Nikko Securities Co. Foreign buyers were responsible
for 121 deals.
</P>
<P>
   More foreign deals may soon be on the way. Nissan Motor Co. has
been talking with foreign automakers about buying a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and alliances among Japanese companies have always been
fairly common, even in good times. But the recession has clearly
driven many deals as companies restructure and sell assets not
integral to a core business.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Sumitomo, it is a second-tier tire company
staring rapid consolidation in the auto industry in the face and
contemplating its prospects, one of its bankers said.
</P>
<P>
   With $2.76 billion of debt, more than three times its equity,
striking a deal with Goodyear _ with which is already had a
substantial relationship _ was a stroke of good fortune. Goodyear
is providing $1 billion in cash, which will go a long way toward
cleaning up Sumitomo's balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo's operations in the United States and Europe are
profitable, but marginally so. And an alliance with Goodyear
promises to catapult it almost overnight into the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wednesday's deal is merely part of a global
consolidation sweeping the auto business, which can produce 20
million to 23 million more cars annually than anyone wants to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, home to 11 vehicle manufacturers, numerous auto parts
companies and thousands of dealers, can produce four million more
cars than it can sell, so it is a natural market for such
consolidation. Nissan is seeking the same sort of deal that
Sumitomo made with Goodyear, and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is
shopping bits of itself around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the auto industry _ and the tire business is part
of the auto industry _ there are quite specific reasons why deals
are being brokered,'' said Chudler of Salomon Smith Barney. ``The
same could be said for financial services here. But those specific
reasons don't imply a broader trend for M&AMP;A in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the deal with Goodyear is not a straightforward
merger or acquisition in the way Daimler melded with Chrysler, and
that is largely, bankers say, a function of Sumitomo's Japanese
character.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies prefer the safety of a joint venture, capital
participation or other types of corporate links that allow them to
hold hands without quite getting into bed, precisely what the six
ventures between Goodyear and Sumitomo are.
</P>
<P>
   They let Sumitomo maintain a vestige of control and
independence, which its bankers say was critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of M&AMP;A you're most likely to see here,'' an
investment banker said.

   DECATUR, Texas _ Fellow travelers, there is a Zen way for food
to evolve, and Sarah Chapman has found the path.
</P>
<P>
   It's not through the pleasure palaces of Chicago, where Svengali
Charlie Trotter assembles towers with 75-year-old balsamic vinegar
and golden raspberries. Nor is it through the glass-encased towers
of Dallas, where chefs marry Morocco with Macao in a journey of
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   But Chapman, in her little Courthouse Cafe &AMP; Restaurant in
Decatur, succeeds in advancing our natural cuisine without taking
her customers on a roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman's stage is as unpretentious as her food. The restaurant
is tucked into a corner of the Wise County Courthouse square, amid
stores that can't decide whether they want to be gentrified.
Wanda's Frames &AMP; Thangs is decidely rural, while across the square
Harris Family Center (vacuums, music and Metabolife representation)
is a store in transition. But also on the square is Memory Lane,
Est. 1988, a sign that the bed-and-breakfast boomers are looming.
</P>
<P>
   Like her town, Chapman has a foot in two worlds. Her food is the
classics of Texas: meatloaf and fried chicken and pimiento cheese
sandwiches. But unlike most such restaurants, which freeze their
food in a time capsule of how grandmother would have cooked it,
Courthouse Cafe incorporates the progress that time brings.
</P>
<P>
   Daily plate lunches are served, just as they are in every
courthouse square in Texas. But the salad with the meal is made
with a lettuce mixture that includes frisee, arugula and radicchio,
and is topped with a house-made Thousand Island dressing miles
ahead of any bottled version.
</P>
<P>
   And the salad is just the beginning of the $5.99 daily special _
roast beef on a recent Monday. Thinly sliced pieces of roast are
fanned on the plate, sided with still-crunchy carrots and mashed
potatoes so rich with cream and butter that they slide across the
tongue. The all-hallowed biscuit, part of any Texas communion, is
presented with a sprinkling of rosemary in the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Soup of the day, cream of broccoli for $1.25, is more French
than is fashionable in a Texas cafe, a light potage of pureed
vegetables that is more soothing than solid.
</P>
<P>
   Apple cobbler, included in the daily special, is so beyond the
saccharine norm that it should be renamed. The crust, flaky with
unsalted butter, tops a savory combination of the fruit punctuated
with cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom _ an imagination celebration
that Grandma would have never dreamed up.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe is a core sample of this century's dining. The original
hulking bar, a remnant of the cafe's pharmacy days, looms on one
wall. Chicken-wire tile is visible here and there on the floor. And
the booths, hideous green pressed-plastic jobs, are certainly from
some equally hideous fast-food joint of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, this cafe says in a calm voice, is a wondrous thing.

MEXICAN PRESIDENT URGES OPENING OF POWER INDUSTRY TO PRIVATE
INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Warning his compatriots that Mexico's energy needs
are fast overwhelming its state-run power plants, President Ernesto
Zedillo urged the nation's Congress on Wednesday to approve an
extensive restructuring of the country's electric power industry,
opening it to private investment.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo proposed two constitutional reforms that would reverse
Mexico's 1960 nationalization of the industry and allow private
companies to invest in the leasing and construction of power plants
and regional transmission lines. The national power grid and
nuclear plants would remain under government control, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Public ownership of energy industries has been a central tenet
of Mexican nationalism, and Zedillo underlined the urgency of his
proposals by announcing them in a nationwide television broadcast
on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico needs to attract $25 billion in private investment to the
electric power industry over the next six years, an amount
equivalent to a quarter of the entire budget this year, the
president said. That investment would allow Mexico to increase its
generating capacity by 36 percent to keep up with the explosive
demand for energy resulting from industrialization and population
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do in a few years what before took decades,''
Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Tellez Kuenzler, the energy minister, said at a news
conference Wednesday that ``these reforms mean the total opening up
of the sector to private investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Private analysts agreed that Zedillo's proposals would, if
approved, bring sweeping changes to the electricity industry. They
could encourage dozens of U.S. and other foreign companies to make
major investments, but how enthusiastically investors enter the
market will depend on the clarity of the laws passed to permit the
broader access, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Past government proposals to privatize parts of the
petrochemical, natural gas and electricity-generating industries
have been undermined by policy zigzags and contradictory official
statements, they added.
</P>
<P>
   Limited changes to Mexico's energy laws passed in 1992 have
allowed two major generating projects to date. One, the
$647-million Samalayuca 2 generating plant near the border
industrial city of Juarez and built by a consortium of U.S. and
Mexican companies, went on line in August. The other, Merida 2, a
$450-million plant in the Yucatan peninsula, is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Despite numerous lengthy negotiations between the government and
foreign energy companies, other projects have failed to go beyond
the proposal stage, partly because the government still prohibits
private companies from independently marketing the power they
generate. Instead, the private companies have been obliged to sell
their electricity to Mexico's sprawling government power utility,
the Federal Electricity Commission. Zedillo's proposal would break
that arrangement for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big change,'' said George Baker, an independent
consultant in Houston who studies the Mexican energy industry. ``If
they're changing the Constitution and allowing investors in a power
plant to look for their own industrial customers, so they're not
vulnerable to the whims that come with having only one buyer, then
it will become a lot easier to attract financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael T. Burr, editor of Independent Energy magazine,
published in Tulsa, Okla., said the proposed changes would likely
prove attractive to the 25 or so energy corporations in the world
capable of building and operating major power plants. But he said
that attracting $25 billion in six years is ``really a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about $4 billion per year, and that's pretty
aggressive,'' Burr added. ``It's tough to rally that kind of money.
I'd be surprised if they can garner that kind of investment. I'd be
awed.''

MAYOR SAYS HE ACTED `HASTILY' IN ACCEPTING RESIGNATION; JOB OFFER
EXPECTED 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to end the first major flap of his young
administration, Mayor Anthony A. Williams conceded Wednesday that
he acted hastily in asking a white aide who used the word
``niggardly'' in conversation with a black colleague to resign from
his job.
</P>
<P>
   While not apologizing to the aide, David Howard, 44, who stepped
down last month, Williams said in a statement that he has asked him
to return to his job as head of the District of Columbia's office
of the public advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, who had worked on Williams' election campaign, met with
the mayor for 20 minutes Wednesday and told him he would like to
return to city government but in a different job. Williams said he
would try to accommodate him, saying in a statement, ``I believe I
acted too hastily in accepting David's resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Howard said he was satisfied with resolution of
the matter but that it was ``really not about me or the use of the
word niggardly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about feelings underneath the surface that a lot of
people in Washington and the whole naion wanted to talk about.''
he said. ``This was just the flashpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he believed the city would benefit from the
incident. ``A lot of good came of this,'' he said. ``It has
fostered a discussion, not about racial tensions but about racial
perceptions. It can only help us to understand each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' decision to invite Howard back follows a swirl of
events that began on Jan. 15, the day Howard used a synonym for
miserly in a budget discussion with two co-workers, one of whom
said later he thought he heard Howard use a racial epithet. Howard
said at the time: ``I will have to be niggardly with this fund
because it's not going to be a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   After rumors of the misunderstanding and news of hurt feelings
reached Howard, he acknowledged he had used ``bad judgment'' in
selecting such a word and offered his resignation on Jan. 26. It
was immediately accepted by Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But that only led to a bad situation turning worse, prompting
waves of protest around the city _ from language purists, arguing
that niggardly is a perfectly acceptable word; from gays, defending
Howard as the mayor's first openly-gay appointee; and from many
blacks who already have questioned Williams' loyalties to the black
community.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the incident became the latest example of the
difficulties District leaders have navigating issues of race in a
majority black city that has no voting representation in the
majority white Congress that, ultimately, runs the city. Williams,
the city's former chief financial officer who was educated at Yale
and Harvard, is black, but he is perceived by many in the city as
``less black'' than his predecessor, Marion S. Barry Jr., a veteran
of the Civil Rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Williams initiated an investigation of the matter
after Howard resigned. He said in his statement that he concluded
that `` Howard did use the word `niggardly' but did not use a
racial epithet. The review also showed that an employee of the
Office of the Public Advocate did misunderstand Howard to have used
a racial epithet.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was inaugurated on Jan. 2, also said that he has
learned a lot through this incident. ``While it is important for a
mayor, or any leader, to act decisively, make bold decisions and
create a sense of urgency,'' he said, ``it is not always necessary
to act hastily.''

U.S. DECLARES WAR AGAINST UNWANTED INVADERS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Wednesday declared
the ecological equivalent of war against an invasion of unwanted
and mostly foreign species that are steadily infiltrating the
American landscape.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed an executive order to establish a
council of scientists and bureaucrats to combat zebra mussels,
leafy spurge, long-horned beetles and hundreds of other invasive
pests.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House urged Congress to increase spending by $12.8
million, nearly doubling the current amount spent by the government
on a problem that scientists have estimated costs the nation $123
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alien species are the stealth destroyers of the American
environment,'' said noted biologist Edward O. Wilson, who joined
administration officials at the presentation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said that competition from invasive species is the main cause
of decline in 18 percent of endangered species, and contributes to
the loss of 24 percent of them. Only the outright destruction of
habitat is a more important cause, said Wilson, a leading authority
on biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Officials presenting the plan to a crowd of hundreds at the
National Geographic Society used rhetoric that was one part Winston
Churchill and one part H.G. Wells. They vowed in patriotic tones to
fight on beaches, fields, hills and city streets, but also threw in
many alarming references to hordes of invading aliens. One official
dubbed Clinton's call to arms ``the X-files executive order.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan they are putting in motion has been urged on the
White House for years, gaining momentum after 500 scientists,
agriculture officials, conservationists and land managers sent a
letter to Vice President Al Gore demanding concentrated action.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said that the government can
really only envision ``modest goals of containment.'' Still,
officials said that the executive order, which requires all federal
agencies to design their policies with the war against alien
species in mind, is an important step.
</P>
<P>
   Measures would be taken by agencies as diverse as the
Transportation Department, the Commerce Department, the Defense
Department and the Customs Service to control the influx of pests,
as well as by the agencies with chief responsibility for protecting
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   One problem facing the administration is that international
trade rules can defeat import barriers imposed to control invasive
species. Asked about this by a member of the audience, Babbitt said
that in his view the world's nations need to do a better job at
reconciling trade and environmental statutes.

   IMPEACH-RPD (Washington) _ With the impeachment trial of
President Clinton set to reconvene Thursday, House prosecutors on
Wednesday questioned the last of three witnesses behind closed
doors and began a final drive to bring Monica Lewinsky and two
Clinton advisers to testify in person before the Senate. By Alison
Mitchell. With photo.

   ARAFAT (Gaza City, Gaza Strip) _ Suha Arafat, the first lady of
the Palestinian territories, would seem an unlikely partner for the
69-year-old revolutionary, who remains forever wedded to his cause.
She was raised in a well-off home in the West Bank, educated by
nuns and refined at the Sorbonne. And her deep-seated Christian
faith and Western assertiveness seem at odds with his world:
desperate Gaza with its veiled Muslim women. But in ideology Mrs.
Arafat, whose husband is to meet on Thursday with President Clinton
in Washington, is every bit the fiery Palestinian freedom fighter.
By Deborah Sontag. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   FOREST-SERVICE (Washington) _ The Clinton administration,
determined to emphasize conservation over development on public
lands, called Wednesday for a mining ban in a vast section of
federal land in Montana. The move would significantly expand
protections along the Rocky Mountain Front, at the edge of one of
the richest wilderness zones in the lower 48 states. It also is the
latest round in a long-running fight between the administration and
the mining industry, as well as between the administration and
Congress, which has blocked attempts to toughen mining regulations
administratively. By John H. Cushman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CABLE-TV-INTERNET (Washington) _ As AT&AMP;T completes two large
business deals _ a merger with one large cable company and a joint
venture with another _ that will give it access to the cable lines
into almost half of the nation's homes, a ferocious
multi-million-dollar legal and lobbying battle is taking shape in
Washington and in cities around the nation over the future of the
Internet. The fight, which is being led by America Online, the
nation's largest internet service provider with 15 million
customers, has drawn many of Washington's most prominent former
officials who are now lobbyists. By Stephen Labaton.

   DOCTORS (Undated) _ Angry about declining incomes and being
dictated to by managed-care organizations, doctors are joining
labor unions in record numbers, hoping for a more powerful voice to
counter what many call the corporatization of medicine. By Steven

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK     
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
     OLYMPIA, Wash. _ In the Democratic caucus of the Washington
state Senate, male legislators, already outnumbered by their female
counterparts 18-9, have formed a Last Man's Club _ betting among
themselves, with a touch of nervous bonhomie, on who will be the
final one left before all the caucus members are women.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The men also shrug good-naturedly when asked whatever happened
to their posh, marble-lined bathroom in the state Capitol. The
women took it over last year, and the male legislators were
re-assigned to a decidedly less ornate lavatory, with fewer stalls,
that had been the ladies' room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy in action,'' explained Sen. Harriet Spanel, smiling
sweetly.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, women have not yet taken over the Legislature
here, but they do constitute 40.8 percent of the membership _ the
highest percentage of women in any state legislature in the
nation's history. The women of Olympia are a powerful symbol of an
electoral tide that has brought record numbers of women into public
office this year, notably in the increasingly important state
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is hardly alone. Women make up 36.5 percent of the
Nevada Legislature; 35.6 percent of Arizona's; 33 percent of
Colorado's, and 32.7 percent of Kansas'.
</P>
<P>
   No legislature anywhere yet mirrors the proportion of women in
the general population, 51 percent. And wide disparities exist
among the states. The national average of female state legislators
is 22.3 percent, and in the state at the other end of the spectrum,
Alabama, only 7.9 percent of state lawmakers are women.
</P>
<P>
   But enough states have a critical mass of women that an old
debate has fresh currency: What difference does it make when women
are in charge? And this debate has added meaning as states assume
more and more power over issues like welfare and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Some academic studies indicate that legislatures with greater
numbers of women are more favorably inclined toward measures
involving care for children and the elderly and toward women's
health issues, a view with which many lawmakers here and elsewhere
heartily concur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, generally, men like tax-type issues; they like
criminal-justice issues,'' said Sen. Shirley Winsley, a Republican
from the Tacoma area, who has served in the Legislature for 22 of
the last 26 years. ``When you get down to the nitty-gritty issues
of dealing with children, aging, long-term care, all those are
things that are a natural for women. They're wives, they're
mothers, they've been much more active in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But even many female legislators, noting that women are hardly
monolithic in their views, question whether there is a women's
agenda to be advanced with their rising numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally sometimes kind of bristle at the idea that there
are `women's issues' for us to carry,'' said Rep. Cheryl Pflug, a
Republican who was recently elected to serve a district outside
Seattle and who ran on a platform of lowering taxes and tackling
traffic congestion and suburban sprawl. ``All issues are women's
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the mechanics of political power, some experts note that
women have not yet captured their share of the most powerful
positions in the legislatures, like House speaker, which have the
most impact in setting the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, for instance, the picture is mixed. Women do
head 12 of the 15 standing committees in the Senate, and they hold
five of the top six Democratic leadership positions in the Senate.
On the other hand, the four pre-eminent leadership positions in the
Senate and the House are held by men, and no woman has ever served
as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trends here and around the nation are striking. In
1969, women held just 4 percent of all state legislative seats in
the country, according to statistics compiled by the Center for the
American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University's Eagleton
Institute. In every two-year election cycle since then, that
percentage has risen _ to 10.3 percent in 1979, 20.5 percent in
1993 and 22.3 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, in the U.S. Congress, nine women serve in the
100-member Senate and 56 in the 435-member House of Representatives
(12.9 percent of the membership there), both all-time highs,
according to the Rutgers center. The number of women in statewide
elective posts is 89, also a record number, representing 27.6
percent of the available positions. Female legislators are
disproportionately Democratic, while women in executive positions
are more evenly divided between the two major parties.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has long drawn attention for the high numbers
of women who hold public office. Even so, the inroads in the state
Legislature stand out. Twenty-three of the 49 state senators are
women, as are 37 of the 98 state representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled around the country and spoken with a lot of
lawmakers in other states,'' said Sen. Pat Thibaudeau, a Seattle
Democrat. ``And I've never seen a woman yet, be she Republican or
Democrat, who doesn't get this big smile on her face when I tell
her that we're almost half the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   One question that has been widely explored is just why women
seem to hold much larger percentages of legislative seats in
Western states than they do in many other parts of the country,
especially the South. (By comparison, New York's legislature is
20.9 percent female, Connecticut's 29.4 percent, and New Jersey's
16.7 percent.) The most widely advanced theory seems to be that the
Western states' pioneering traditions created a culture in which it
was acceptable and even necessary for women to exert strong
leadership roles. Many of these states were also among the first to
give women the right to vote.

</P>
<P>
   ``A woman had to be able to shoot dinner, chop the wood, harness
the horses,'' said Sen. Valoria Loveland, a Democrat from
southeastern Washington. ``And I think that's carried over in our
history. I was basically raised never to use the word `can't.'''
</P>
<P>
   But other factors also play a role in women's political
participation, experts say; for example, women sometimes do better
in states with weaker party structures, which tend to be more open
to candidates entering politics through untraditional routes.
</P>
<P>
   A larger question is just what difference women make in the way
government functions and in what kinds of bills get passed. Debbie
Walsh, associate director of the Center for the American Woman and
Politics, has studied that issue closely. In particular, she said,
women are generally more likely than men to cite child care
(especially as a component of job-training programs), affordable
health insurance and long-term care for the elderly as their
top-priority issues, as well as a range of issues dealing with
women's rights, including divorce and spousal-abuse laws.
</P>
<P>
   A study by political scientists at the University of Florida,
``Impacts of Female Legislators on Policy Making,'' based on
surveys of legislators around the country and released last summer,
also found an interesting difference between the sexes: although
Republican women in office express more conservative views than
male Democrats on several issues dealing with taxes, finance and
business matters, they are still more likely than those Democratic
men to sponsor bills in ``women's policy'' areas, even ones that
require additional government or industry financing.
</P>
<P>
   And although both male and female legislators listed education
as their top priority, they split on their second issue. Women
listed health care; the men chose taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the female legislators here, many seemed leery of the
notion that their priorities might be different from men's, a view
echoed by Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the Legislature, we had women who were heads of
the environment committee, economic development, education, natural
resources, the budget, local government,'' Locke said in an
interview in his Capitol office. ``They were experts in a wide
variety of issues. I didn't see the women in our Legislature just
focusing on particular issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But many other female lawmakers said it was only natural for
their priorities to be somewhat different.
</P>
<P>
   ``When more women come into the process,'' said Sen. Pat Hale, a
Republican from eastern Washington, ``I think the debate changes,
and that's healthy.''

CLINTON SEEKS MINING BAN TO PROTECT LAND IN MONTANA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont.)  (dal) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, determined to emphasize
conservation over development on public lands, called on Wednesday
for a mining ban in a vast section of federal land in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The move would significantly expand protections along the Rocky
Mountain Front, at the edge of one of the richest wilderness zones
in the lower 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly undeveloped, the front has become a tempting zone for
exploration by mineral companies. In 1997, the Forest Service moved
to restrict oil and gas leasing there, and on Wednesday the agency
moved to prohibit mining for metals and ores as well.
</P>
<P>
   A rugged cascade of limestone and shale that tilts eastward to
the plains, the Rocky Mountain Front is home to elk, mountain goat
and grizzly bear and is the doorstep to millions of acres of
mountain wilderness. Although it bears no physical resemblance to
the savannahs of Africa, conservationists sometimes call it
America's Serengeti because of its spectacular wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech prepared for delivery Wednesday night in Missoula,
Mike Dombeck, the chief of the Forest Service, said he has
petitioned the interior secretary to immediately impose a
moratorium on new mining claims in 400,000 acres of the Lewis and
Clark National Forest and on 29,000 acres of the adjacent Helena
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The region is full of some of the nation's finest trout streams,
such as the Blackfoot River made famous in Norman MacLean's book
``A River Runs Through It.'' Runoff from the cyanide used in mining
can endanger these streams.
</P>
<P>
   Although the petition just begins a long process of public
comment and hearings that is to result in a final decision in two
years, the move means there will be no mining in the meantime. The
larger administration goal appears to be to eventually block mining
in the area for at least the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the move means all the public land along the Rocky
Mountain Front, from the Glacier National Park on the Canadian
border south for 100 miles through the wilderness areas and the
national forests, will be off-limits to mining.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest round in a long-running fight between the
administration and the mining industry. The administration has
sought for years to get the nation's mining law rewritten, raising
the price industry would pay for access to minerals on public land,
and to toughen mining regulations administratively, but has been
blocked in Congress so far. The administration did foil plans to
build a gold mine on the edge of Yellowstone National Park, buying
the land last year. And it set aside millions of acres in Utah as a
national monument to limit coal mining there.
</P>
<P>
   Even if pro-mining forces in Congress try to reverse the latest
proposal, it would be difficult because Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
strongly favors the plan. (Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., was said to
be upset when informed of the decision Wednesday morning.)
</P>
<P>
   There is little or no mining along the Rockies Front now, but in
recent years a few clusters of mining claims have been staked under
the 19th-century law that allows prospectors to move onto public
lands.
</P>
<P>
   That alarmed conservationists, who began to lobby the
administration to withdraw the land from eligibility for mining.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only place in the lower 48 where grizzlies roam
out on the plain,'' said Bob Ekey of the Wilderness Society's
Bozeman office. ``It is largely intact right now, and we would like
to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Grasser of the National Mining Association said that
``this is of great concern to us,'' especially coming on the heels
of other measures to restrict development on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are apparently marching in a particular direction,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, the move to protect the Rockies Front was just the
boldest announcement in a wide-ranging speech that Dombeck's aides
described as a comprehensive explanation of the Forest Service's
new vision of its mission. He discussed several important shifts in
how the agency intends to balance national forests' many uses:
logging, mining, grazing, recreation and conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiple use does not mean we should do everything on every
acre simply because we can,'' Dombeck said. ``Many areas are simply
not appropriate for certain activities, such as hard rock mining.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a time when plans for 65 percent of the national
forests are under revision, bringing changes to federal management
of more than 150 million acres of land, and when the agency is
about to issue new scientific guidelines for forestry and to
develop a new policy on building logging roads in the remotest
parts of the forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my expectation that in the future, we will rarely build
new roads into roadless areas, and if we do, it will be in order to
accomplish broader ecological objectives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the emphasis will be on maintaining existing
roads or, in many cases, obliterating them. The agency, he said,
has a road maintenance backlog of $8.5 billion and a budget for
that purpose of less than $600 million a year. Only 18 percent of
its roads are maintained up to existing standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unacceptable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck appeared to be signaling a thorough overhaul of the
Forest Service's priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider, we are spending about $2 billion per year managing
191 million acres of forest, yet contributing only about $200
million toward the 500 million acres of state-managed and
privately-owned forests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the policies he endorsed was a new definition of
``salvage'' timber sales, in which dead and dying trees are cut in
an effort to improve the forest's health. He said the new
definition should ``reduce if not eliminate'' the current practice
of cutting healthy green trees on the same tracts.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second year, he said, the administration would try
to end the practice of passing on revenues from timber sales to pay
for local roads and schools, finding other sources of money
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the richest country in the world finance the
education of rural schoolchildren on the back of a controversial
federal timber program?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of measuring the Forest Service's success, and
determining its budget, based on how much timber it sells, Dombeck
called for new measures that would evaluate water quality, wildlife
habitat and soil condition.

GOVERNOR THREATENS TO CUT UMASS BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci Tuesday threatened to strip $4.6
million from the University of Massachusetts' budget in retribution
for the UMass board of trustee's surprise move to raise tuition and
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also filed legislation to take away the UMass
trustees' power to set tuition costs and fees, transferring it to
the state Board of Higher Education, whose chairman, James F.
Carlin, has steadily crusaded against increasing costs at UMass and
the state colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very upset that the board apparently has decided to raise
the fees,'' an agitated Cellucci told reporters outside his State
House office Tuesday. ``We've been trying to get college and state
universities to be more affordable, more accessible to the citizens
of this state. Now all of a sudden the University of Massachusetts
wants to increase the costs of going to that university for the
students and I don't think it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the governor appoints the UMass trustees as well as the
board of higher education members, who all serve for five years, he
said he feels the trustees are not heeding his call to make the
university more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it very clear what I think should be happening,''
Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the UMass board of trustees reversed four years of
tuition expense cuts at its meeting Tuesday, unanimously approving
an average increase of 1.4 percent in tuition costs and fees at the
four undergraduate campuses of the state's public university. For
students who live on campus, costs will rise an average of 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts in tuition costs, along with increases in fundraising
and standards, have helped raise the esteem of the university, and
attract top notch students. But the trustees defended Tuesday's
move as necessary, and well-reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am astounded at the level of anger this has caused,''
chairman Robert Karam said. ``It's not like we shoved this down or
did the Marie Antoinette bit, `Let them eat cake.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the governor is in favor of tuition and fee cuts, and
Carlin is in favor of tuition and fee cuts. We'd all like to agree
to that, but when we're sitting there every day, we have to make
some tough decisions. If they're the wrong decisions, we'll find
out. But we're doing the best we can to protect the public
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he was not upset by UMass President William M.
Bulger's gradual 49 percent pay increase _ approved in October but
not detailed until Tuesday _ which will bring the former Senate
President's salary to nearly $300,000 within 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of the salary, I think, is a decision for the
board of trustees,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he does not understand why the trustees raised
tuition costs and fees.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the board of higher education has final approval over
tuition costs, but not fees. Carlin, the chairman, has already
threatened to veto the tuition recommendation unless the trustees
cut it by five percent. But the UMass board has power to set the
fees, so Cellucci was left with few options but to cut the public
university's state funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to ask them to reconsider this and if they persist,
I will veto $4.6 million, which represents the (student cost)
increase'' from the upcoming budget, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the Legislature has increased funding
for UMass by 13 percent, Cellucci said. In his fiscal 2000 budget
proposal, Cellucci recommends a 5 percent funding jump of $20.4
million for UMass.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 80s and 90s, UMass tuition costs more than doubled
as the state funding was cut 22 percent. Since 1996, however, the
board has cut tuitions and fees each year. But Karam said the
trustees had no choice but to increase them this year, given
technological updates and building repairs needed on the four
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not take increases lightly,'' Karam said. ``The simple
fact of the matter is, we cannot operate effective with the amount
we receive from the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has been very generous, we're not complaining,''
added. But UMass, he said, had already done all it could to raise
money from donors, alumni, and research grants.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting Tuesday, the trustees insisted the increase was
only a slight one, and emphasized that they had kept their promise
to keep any increases below the rate of inflation, which is 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``An increase less than inflation is helping to keep (the
governor's) commitment,'' Karam said. The university president's
office also pointed out that tuition and fees at other public
universities rose an average of 4 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people are going right by us, all over the country,''
Karam said. ``To have an average increase of one and a half
percent, I think is a very reasonable and very measured response
from the board. It is measured, it is minor. I understand that
money means a lot to a lot of people, but for a university
education, when we're dealing with (private) campuses in the state
that charge 30,000 a year, and we're expected to be as good as some
of those campuses, to be at under $10,000 is pretty reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Karam said he would ask the governor to meet with him, to try to
persuade him with the logic behind the board's decision.

U.S. TELLS TALIBAN THAT BIN LADEN MUST BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior U.S. official met Wednesday in Pakistan
with leaders of the Taliban, the armed religious group that rules
most of Afghanistan and shelters Osama bin Laden, the world's most
wanted terrorist suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, Rick
Inderfurth, told the Taliban's deputy foreign minister, Jalil
Akhund, that bin Laden must be ``expelled from Afghanistan and
brought to justice for his crimes,'' said State Department
spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi exile whom the United States calls an
international financier of terrorism, has been indicted in the
bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, which killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans, six months ago. The director of Central
Intelligence, George Tenet, told Congress on Tuesday that bin Laden
could strike again at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have never shown any inclination to turn him over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to really make clear to them the risk they are
taking by harboring Osama bin Laden,'' a senior State Department
official said. ``We believe there are real threats against us
coming from Osama bin Laden. This is an extremely serious matter
and we going to hold them responsible for his behavior.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Taliban preside over one of the world's poorest and most
war-ravaged nations. Afghanistan spent the 1980s under Soviet
occupation, enduring a war that killed perhaps a million people and
sent perhaps 6 million into exile.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets withdrew 10 years ago this month. But then the
Afghan rebels, which were backed some $3 billion of military aid
from the CIA, and, separately, supported by bin Laden in their
struggle, spent much of the 1990s fighting one another over their
nation's broken remains.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Afghanistan is a refuge for stateless outlaws, its
economy largely a bazaar of guns and drugs. The United States
estimates that Afghanistan is the source for as much as 40 percent
of the world's supply of heroin. The United Nations and
international aid groups have almost entirely withdrawn from
Afghanistan after violence against their personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, an armed religious group organized with assistance
from Pakistan's intelligence service, wrested power from the
feuding rebel groups in 1996. They have been shunned by most of the
world for their intolerance, their violence and their embrace of
bin Laden. Only Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia
recognize the group as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Taliban want from the outside world is acceptance and
recognition,'' a State Department official said. ``We can't promise
we will recognize them, but we're telling them: if you want to be
seen as a government, you have to act like a government. If you go
along with international norms, you will receive wider acceptance
and probably greater assistance.'' The United States has held
periodic meetings with the Taliban over the past year, sometimes at
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met with
Pakistani officials Wednesday to tell them that since ``they have
used their influence to assist the Taliban in their rise to power,
we expect them to use their influence to stop them'' from harboring
bin Laden, a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech delivered in Islamabad, Talbott called Afghanistan
the site of ``the last battle of the Cold War'' and ``one of the
first, most severe and most ominous battles of the post-Cold War
world: the battle against the forces of terrorism, extremism and
intolerance.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton called on Wednesday for a ``great
national debate'' about how to spend the growing federal budget
surplus as he promoted his plans to shore up Social Security and
Medicare at the expense of Republican tax cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to work together across party lines to make these
decisions,'' Clinton said even as he warned of the dangers of
Republican ideas in a speech here to a powerful lobbying group for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   As he sketched out his broad goals for strengthening the
Medicare system, Clinton was clearly trying to box in the
Republican Congress. He accused Republicans of proposing tax cuts
without first addressing the elderly's health care needs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that before spending any of the surplus on new
programs or tax cuts, policymakers ``must first tell America's
families: `What is your plan to preserve and strengthen Medicare in
the 21st century?'''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fired back that Clinton was offering a false choice
between cutting taxes and saving the surplus until popular programs
are fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't make Americans pay higher taxes because the
politicians haven't finished their work,'' said Ari Fleischer, the
spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee. ``Let's work hard
and work together to get it all done.''
</P>
<P>
   The aging of the population is increasingly straining the
Medicare and Social Security systems. A bipartisan commission on
Medicare is scheduled to report its recommendations by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Steering clear of any specific proposals for a radical overhaul
of Medicare, Clinton reiterated earlier ideas as he presented four
guideposts for strengthening the system.
</P>
<P>
   He called for committing 15 percent of surpluses to Medicare;
assuring ``a modern, competitive system'' for high-quality care,
and guaranteeing Americans specific benefits without ``excessive
new costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last, he urged the creation of a prescription drugs program that
he said would be paid for with savings from changing the system.
Clinton's proposal for that new benefit drew applause from the
audience, the national legislative council of the American
Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., who heads the advisory commission
studying Medicare, welcomed Clinton's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased that the president is forcefully focusing on
Medicare as a prime part of his legislative package this year,''
Breaux said in an interview. ``His call for modernizing Medicare
and making it more competitive is consistent with what we're trying
to do at the commission. I look forward to producing something that
can meet his standards and get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux added: ``Just adding money to an antiquated system that
provides inadequate benefits isn't the answer. I'm pleased that the
president has recognized that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly said he also favored tax relief. But he
derided Republican ideas _ what he called ``a rather long series of
large and risky tax proposals'' _ as short-sighted.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that it would ``benefit clearly the wealthiest
Americans,'' the president criticized a plan put forward on Tuesday
by Rep. John R. Kasich, R-Ohio, for a $1 trillion cut over the next
15 years. ``It would do this before Medicare has been secured,''
Clinton warned.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cuthbertson, a spokesman for Kasich, said of the surplus:
``We view this as the people's money; it's not our money and the
government's. Mr. Clinton believes just the opposite, that it's the
government's money.''

APPEALS COURT WEIGH JEHOVAH'S WITNESS TRANSFUSION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three justices of the Massachusetts Appeals Court were
asked Tuesday to make a precedent-setting decision on whether a
17-year-old girl, a Jehovah's Witness, may refuse a blood
transfusion even if doing so would mean her certain death.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily convened session, Kent B. Smith, George Jacobs, and
Elizabeth Porada heard arguments in the case of Alexis Demos, of
Lenox, who ruptured her spleen in a snowboarding accident Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Richard Simons told the justices that Alexis is a
``mature minor'' who has often stated her belief that the taking of
blood violates biblical tenets and who had made a written
declaration only 10 days before the accident saying she did not
wish to have a blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the justices to consider that the law does not fix a
single age to define maturity or juvenile status. The test he asked
them to apply is the balancing of a child's paramount interest
versus the interests of the state.
</P>
<P>
   For Alexis, he said, the paramount interest is that she be
allowed to follow her religious convictions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Benjamin Smith, attorney for the Berkshire Medical
Center in Pittsfield, where Alexis is now apparently recovering
from her injuries, said the position of the hospital and of
physicians working there is that a situtation could easily arise
where the girl would die without a transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   That concern had prompted the hospital to obtain an order from
Superior Court Judge Judd Carhart that allows the doctors to
administer a transfusion. The Demos family is appealing that
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Jehovah's witnesses consider transfusions to be covered by the
prohibition against eating blood which may be found in at least
three places in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alexis now seems on the way to recovery, Benjamin Smith
said, the healing process of the spleen could be interrupted by a
sudden movement by the patient and that heavy bleeding could be
started, with a blood clot coming loose. Without a timely
transfusion, the brain would be deprived of oxygen with resulting
permanent damage, if not death.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Alexis's father Alec Demos declined to answer
when asked whether he was prepared to let his child die rather than
violate the biblical injunctions. He said that he knew of many
physicians across the country who would be prepared to try
alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's questions by the justices probed at the point that
Alexis is now out of the intensive-care unit, off intravenous
tubes, is eating a regular diet, and is showing a rising
red-blood-cell count, suggesting that their decision may not be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital's attorney emphasized that ``The hospital's
position is that this court shouldn't allow the avoidable death of
a child.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still the danger of a sudden bleeding, Smith said, and
``Alexis Demos would not have any opportunity to change her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The jduges did not make an immediate ruling.

 &HT;    Time Warner chairman `proud' of arena naming
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin praised the city of
Atlanta and the management of his Turner Broadcasting System unit
for a deal naming the new downtown arena Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of Atlanta,'' said Levin during a briefing
Wednesday about the company's quarterly financial performance.
``The arena deal is significant for Atlanta and its downtown
renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said the deal, in which Philips Electronics North America
will pay his company $180 million over the next 20 years, cements
his company's presence in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has become important intellectual and physical
presence for us,'' said Levin. ``(In) no other location do we have
such an integration of facilities and businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Atlanta, Time Warner has its corporate offices in
New York. The company's movie and television production is based in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Levin has signed off on a major renovation of CNN Center, the
downtown headquarters for Turner Broadcasting. The center is adding
an atrium that will tie in with the adjacent Olympic Park. Philips
Arena will sit beyond the CNN Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my idols is William Paley (the deceased founder of
CBS),'' said Levin. ``He had his company as a whole, from the
architecture of its buildings to the way he did business, project a
certain grace. I think what we are doing in Atlanta shows a certain
elegance.''

 &HT;    Lucent's deal to make fiber optics for Pathnet may be biggest of
its kind
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lucent Technologies has landed a $440 million
agreement to make fiber optics for Pathnet Inc. _ a deal that could
grow to $2.1 billion over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, a sign of continued boom in high-speed
telecommunications, is also confirmation of Lucent's decision to
expand the 170-acre, 3,000-worker surburban Atlanta factory known
as the Atlanta Works, which makes fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Works, which is already undergoing expansion, will
not grow any faster because of the Pathnet deal, said Bob Mohalley,
chief strategy officer for Lucent's Network Products Group. ``This
is a good match with our capital investment. We expect that this
will make us even more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the deal grow to its full potential, it would represent
the largest fiber-optics purchase thus far in the United States,
the companies said. The network group already accounts for more
than $3 billion of the $30 billion in revenue that New Jersey-based
Lucent Technologies reported last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pathnet, a 2-year-old company based in Washington, D.C., is
buying Lucent's cutting-edge fiber. That cable, called TrueWave,
can potentially handle up to 40 billion bits of data per second,
Mohalley said. ``You have to build the right photonic highway for
the speeds that are coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent beat out rival Corning for the contract, according to
Dick Jalkut, president and chief executive officer of Pathnet.
Jalkut, CEO of Nynex until its purchase by Bell Atlantic, sits on
the board of directors of Home Wireless Networks _ which has
received a hefty capital investment from Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Lucent's attitude about working with an ``early stage
company'' like Pathnet that convinced Pathnet to make the deal,
Jalkut said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber optic cables, which use pulses of light to convey
information, are capable of transmitting data far more quickly than
traditional analog phone lines. Although expensive, fiber is also
capable of carrying far heavier data loads than analog. But because
of its price, many smaller cities have been bypassed by the
companies installing high speed national networks.
</P>
<P>
   Pathnet started as a microwave company, carrying data
wirelessly. But company strategy now is to construct a fiber
network that connects the ``second- and third-tier cities'' to the
larger centers, president and chief executive officer of the
company. ``There is a significant part of the network that is
siginificantly underserved. Qwest is connecting to National
Football League cities, not downmarket to cities of 100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pathnet does not carry its own traffic, instead leasing the
use of its lines to long-distance companies, Internet service
providers and others. Jalkut said the eventual entry into
long-distance of the regional Bells such as BellSouth will likely
add to demand for such high-speed service.

FOR A `RIGHT HONORABLE' BRITON, A STEEP FALL FROM GRACE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The distance between grace and disgrace is nowhere
greater than in Britain, where every rent in the shredding of a
reputation can be measured by a lost title, a black-balled club
membership, a fur-fringed ceremonial robe consigned permanently to
a hanger.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who enjoyed in abundance the favors with which
the British establishment has traditionally rewarded things like
good family background, Oxbridge education and the stylish exercise
of ambition was Jonathan Aitken.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a family of wealth and privilege and with angular good
looks to advertise it, Aitken, 56, was a member of Parliament, a
minister in the last Conservative Cabinet, a privy counselor to the
queen, a rake with enough glamorous conquests to earn him the
tabloid title ``Casanova of the Commons'' and a leader of wit and
intelligence that made him a rumored contender for future prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Today his likely future is in prison. Gone are his marriage, his
fortune, his seaside estate in Kent, his seat in Parliament, his
claim on the honorific Right Honorable and, most important, he
says, his good name. He is $3.5 million in debt and will have to
sell the 10-bedroom Georgian town house where he once posed for
soigne family portraits with his wife, son and twin daughters for
glossy celebrity magazines.
</P>
<P>
   His diplomatic passport has been confiscated, his remaining
assets have been frozen, and his gentleman's club, the Beefsteak,
says his case has prompted it to ponder the rare act of evicting a
member.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty Jan. 19 to perjury and intending to pervert
the course of justice for having drafted false testimony for his
teen-age daughter to give in court in his behalf. Afterward he
contemplated his ruination and the near certainty of jail at his
sentencing in June.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference befitting his breed, he said: ``As far as the
physical miseries go, I am sure I will cope. I lived at Eton in the
1950s, and I know all about life in uncomfortable quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad behavior in British cabinets is not an unusual thing. Twelve
ministers from John Major's government had to resign because of
financial or sexual transgressions, and four of Tony Blair's
principals have had to step down in the last three months. But a
collapse of Aitken's dimensions has not been seen since John
Profumo, the war minister in Harold Macmillan's government, was
caught lying to the House of Commons in 1963 and had to quit.
</P>
<P>
   The press typically chronicles these falls from grace with giddy
delectation, and in one of the many instances where Aitken's own
hubris got the best of him, he virtually made sure that none of the
many episodes would end up getting as much attention as his.
</P>
<P>
   Accused by The Guardian and a Granada TV documentary in 1995 of
accepting money from Arab arms dealers while he was Major's defense
procurement minister, Aitken threw down a now-infamous challenge to
the press. It is a moment that has been replayed on television here
in recent months as frequently as President Clinton's
finger-wagging denial of sex with Monica Lewinsky has run in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying himself as a reluctant crusader burdened by destiny,
Aitken said, ``If it falls to me to start a fight to cut out the
cancer of bent and twisted journalism in our country with the
simple sword of justice, and the trusty shield of British fair
play, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   He brought a $3 million libel suit in the High Court, and his
polished performance on the witness stand was so convincing that
the newspaper and the documentary makers offered to settle out of
court. Aitken turned down the peace bid, saying it would compromise
his honor to meet with his tormentors, and he let the trial
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that the newspaper uncovered airline and car rental
records that proved that Aitken was lying when he said his bill at
the Hotel Ritz in a 1993 visit to Paris was paid by his wife rather
than by a Saudi contact as The Guardian alleged. The documents
showed that she had in fact been in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Aitken withdrew his libel suit. His daughter Victoria, 17, was
subsequently arrested for having submitted false written testimony,
though prosecutors did not pursue her once it was clear that her
father had drafted the document and made her sign it. He was
charged with perjury, and his wife, Lolicia, said she was ending
the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   His past caught up with him again in early January when DNA
tests revealed that he was the father of the 18-year-old daughter
of Soraya Khashoggi, the former wife of Saudi arms dealer Adnan
Khashoggi.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators have had to mine Shakespeare, Greek tragedies
and countryside morality tales to come up with parallels for what
the life of Jonathan Aitken promised and what it produced.
</P>
<P>
   His great-uncle was the newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook, his
grandfather Lord Rugby, a distinguished colonial civil servant, and
his father, Sir William Traven Aitken, a Member of Parliament.
After Eton, he studied at Christ Church, Oxford, and during his
summer vacations he worked as a speechwriter for Selwyn Lloyd,
Chancellor of the Exchequer in Macmillan's government.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s he developed contacts in the Arab world,
created a financial services group and made his fortune. In 1974 he
entered Parliament and drew favorable attention with his right-wing
views that were coming into favor in the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   But party leader Margaret Thatcher refused to move him onto the
front benches. Among his high-profile romances was one with her
daughter, Carol, and when he abruptly ended the relationship, Mrs.
Thatcher reportedly told an associate that she would never promote
a man who ``made Carol cry.''
</P>
<P>
   She also had cause to resent him because of a brash answer he
had given an interviewer inquiring about her views of the Middle
East. ``I wouldn't say she is open-minded on the Middle East so
much as empty-headed,'' Aitken said in a widely quoted response.
``She probably thinks Sinai is the plural of Sinus.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 Aitken married a Swiss economist named Lolicia Azucki,
but his publicized affairs continued, including one with a
prostitute who later gave detailed accounts of his taste for whips
and canes. He finally made it into the government under Major,
becoming the government's arms purchaser, and then Treasury
secretary. He resigned in 1995 to fight his libel case.
</P>
<P>
   Aitken today claims religious conversion and speaks of his past
with unaccustomed contrition. ``Sometimes you become a prisoner of
your own lie,'' he told The Express the day after his plea.
``Ultimately, I have no excuses.''

GOVERNOR THREATENS TO CUT UMASS BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixing time reference.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci Wednesday threatened to strip
$4.6 million from the University of Massachusetts' budget in
retribution for the UMass board of trustee's surprise move to raise
tuition and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also filed legislation to take away the UMass
trustees' power to set tuition costs and fees, transferring it to
the state Board of Higher Education, whose chairman, James F.
Carlin, has steadily crusaded against increasing costs at UMass and
the state colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very upset that the board apparently has decided to raise
the fees,'' an agitated Cellucci told reporters outside his State
House office Wednesday. ``We've been trying to get college and
state universities to be more affordable, more accessible to the
citizens of this state. Now all of a sudden the University of
Massachusetts wants to increase the costs of going to that
university for the students and I don't think it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the governor appoints the UMass trustees as well as the
board of higher education members, who all serve for five years, he
said he feels the trustees are not heeding his call to make the
university more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it very clear what I think should be happening,''
Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the UMass board of trustees reversed four years of
tuition expense cuts at its meeting Wednesday, unanimously
approving an average increase of 1.4 percent in tuition costs and
fees at the four undergraduate campuses of the state's public
university. For students who live on campus, costs will rise an
average of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts in tuition costs, along with increases in fundraising
and standards, have helped raise the esteem of the university, and
attract top notch students. But the trustees defended Wednesday's
move as necessary, and well-reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am astounded at the level of anger this has caused,''
chairman Robert Karam said. ``It's not like we shoved this down or
did the Marie Antoinette bit, `Let them eat cake.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the governor is in favor of tuition and fee cuts, and
Carlin is in favor of tuition and fee cuts. We'd all like to agree
to that, but when we're sitting there every day, we have to make
some tough decisions. If they're the wrong decisions, we'll find
out. But we're doing the best we can to protect the public
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he was not upset by UMass President William M.
Bulger's gradual 49 percent pay increase _ approved in October but
not detailed until Wednesday _ which will bring the former Senate
President's salary to nearly $300,000 within 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of the salary, I think, is a decision for the
board of trustees,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he does not understand why the trustees raised
tuition costs and fees.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the board of higher education has final approval over
tuition costs, but not fees. Carlin, the chairman, has already
threatened to veto the tuition recommendation unless the trustees
cut it by five percent. But the UMass board has power to set the
fees, so Cellucci was left with few options but to cut the public
university's state funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to ask them to reconsider this and if they persist,
I will veto $4.6 million, which represents the (student cost)
increase'' from the upcoming budget, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the Legislature has increased funding
for UMass by 13 percent, Cellucci said. In his fiscal 2000 budget
proposal, Cellucci recommends a 5 percent funding jump of $20.4
million for UMass.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 80s and 90s, UMass tuition costs more than doubled
as the state funding was cut 22 percent. Since 1996, however, the
board has cut tuitions and fees each year. But Karam said the
trustees had no choice but to increase them this year, given
technological updates and building repairs needed on the four
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not take increases lightly,'' Karam said. ``The simple
fact of the matter is, we cannot operate effective with the amount
we receive from the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has been very generous, we're not complaining,''
added. But UMass, he said, had already done all it could to raise
money from donors, alumni, and research grants.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting Wednesday, the trustees insisted the increase
was only a slight one, and emphasized that they had kept their
promise to keep any increases below the rate of inflation, which is
1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``An increase less than inflation is helping to keep (the
governor's) commitment,'' Karam said. The university president's
office also pointed out that tuition and fees at other public
universities rose an average of 4 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people are going right by us, all over the country,''
Karam said. ``To have an average increase of one and a half
percent, I think is a very reasonable and very measured response
from the board. It is measured, it is minor. I understand that
money means a lot to a lot of people, but for a university
education, when we're dealing with (private) campuses in the state
that charge 30,000 a year, and we're expected to be as good as some
of those campuses, to be at under $10,000 is pretty reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Karam said he would ask the governor to meet with him, to try to
persuade him with the logic behind the board's decision.

APPEALS COURT WEIGH JEHOVAH'S WITNESS TRANSFUSION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixing time reference.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three justices of the Massachusetts Appeals Court were
asked Wednesday to make a precedent-setting decision on whether a
17-year-old girl, a Jehovah's Witness, may refuse a blood
transfusion even if doing so would mean her certain death.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily convened session, Kent B. Smith, George Jacobs, and
Elizabeth Porada heard arguments in the case of Alexis Demos, of
Lenox, who ruptured her spleen in a snowboarding accident Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Richard Simons told the justices that Alexis is a
``mature minor'' who has often stated her belief that the taking of
blood violates biblical tenets and who had made a written
declaration only 10 days before the accident saying she did not
wish to have a blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the justices to consider that the law does not fix a
single age to define maturity or juvenile status. The test he asked
them to apply is the balancing of a child's paramount interest
versus the interests of the state.
</P>
<P>
   For Alexis, he said, the paramount interest is that she be
allowed to follow her religious convictions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Benjamin Smith, attorney for the Berkshire Medical
Center in Pittsfield, where Alexis is now apparently recovering
from her injuries, said the position of the hospital and of
physicians working there is that a situtation could easily arise
where the girl would die without a transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   That concern had prompted the hospital to obtain an order from
Superior Court Judge Judd Carhart that allows the doctors to
administer a transfusion. The Demos family is appealing that
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Jehovah's witnesses consider transfusions to be covered by the
prohibition against eating blood which may be found in at least
three places in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alexis now seems on the way to recovery, Benjamin Smith
said, the healing process of the spleen could be interrupted by a
sudden movement by the patient and that heavy bleeding could be
started, with a blood clot coming loose. Without a timely
transfusion, the brain would be deprived of oxygen with resulting
permanent damage, if not death.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Alexis's father Alec Demos declined to answer
when asked whether he was prepared to let his child die rather than
violate the biblical injunctions. He said that he knew of many
physicians across the country who would be prepared to try
alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's questions by the justices probed at the point that
Alexis is now out of the intensive-care unit, off intravenous
tubes, is eating a regular diet, and is showing a rising
red-blood-cell count, suggesting that their decision may not be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital's attorney emphasized that ``The hospital's
position is that this court shouldn't allow the avoidable death of
a child.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still the danger of a sudden bleeding, Smith said, and
``Alexis Demos would not have any opportunity to change her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The jduges did not make an immediate ruling.

ANOTHER SHAKE-UP AT TBWA/CHIAT/DAY'S NEW YORK OFFICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: England, Cal., Minn.)  By STUART ELLIOT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A shake-up in top management is under way at the New
York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day.
</P>
<P>
   Again? Yes, again.
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives have come and gone frequently at the
problematic office since the merger that combined the New York
operations of TBWA Advertising with Chiat/Day in 1995. For example,
three executive creative directors have departed in less than three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all the turmoil? Culture clashes between
executives who had worked for the two predecessor agencies, along
with widespread perceptions _ fed by the popularity of campaigns
for products like Energizer batteries and Taco Bell fast food _
that the TBWA/Chiat/Day California office, now based in Playa del
Rey, has long been superior.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the annual Best Agencies issue of the trade
publication Advertising Age, published last month, declared that
the TBWA/Chiat/Day New York office ``remains below the standards of
the California agency.''
</P>
<P>
   But the importance of New York as the largest market in the
world's leading country for advertising requires another effort at
de-worming the Big Apple office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, the North
American unit of the TBWA Worldwide division of Omnicom Group. This
time around, the changing of the guard is taking place on both
sides of the agency _ administrative and creative _ at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're really going to be what we want to be, the best
worldwide network there is, the New York office needs to be a
strong, shining light,'' Bob Kuperman, president and chief
executives for the Americas at TBWA Worldwide, said in an interview
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do now is not to fix an old office that
was broken,'' he added, ``but to construct a new office and bring
in the best talent to run it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the administrative side, the new top manager, with the title
of president and chief executive, is arriving at the TBWA/Chiat/Day
office on Madison Avenue from a sibling agency overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He is Carl Johnson, 40, who for the last two years has been
chief executive at what is now TBWA GGT Simons Palmer in London,
which handles accounts like National Westminster Bank PLC; the
Virgin Direct unit of Virgin Group PLC French Connection U.K., an
apparel retailer making a foray into the United States; Sony
Playstation video games, and the Holsten Pils beer sold by Scottish
&AMP; Newcastle PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Total billings at TBWA GGT Simons Palmer are estimated at $400
million, compared with the estimated $250 million handled by
TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York; the California office handles $1.4
billion, including the agency's crucial Nissan Motor Corp. account.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Johnson helped found Simons Palmer Denton Clemmow &AMP;
Johnson, one of five shops that contributed to TBWA GGT Simons
Palmer. It was runner-up for the 1998 Agency of the Year honor from
the British trade publication Campaign; the article included praise
for ``how nimble the new management is on its feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will need to be nimble to help restore the reputation of
TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, particularly as competitors like Fallon
McElligott and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy are making ambitious attempts to
bolster their Gotham operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in playing second fiddle to anyone in New
York,'' said Johnson, who joined Kuperman for the interview, ``or
anyone in our network.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The London office is the third or fourth biggest TBWA
office,'' said Johnson, whose resemblance to the British actor Tim
Roth of ``Reservoir Dogs'' was heightened by the black sports coat
he wore. ``When you think about what I'm leaving behind, I wouldn't
have come from that to run an ordinary office.''
</P>
<P>
   On the creative side, the new top manager, with the title of
executive creative director, is arriving from crosstown.
</P>
<P>
   He is David Page, who since October has been senior partner and
executive creative director at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather New York, part of
the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group PLC. Page, 43, an
art director, has been working on such accounts at Ogilvy New York
as the Eastman Kodak Co. and the Hershey Foods Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Page, a particularly peripatetic creative executive, also has
worked at agencies like Ammirati &AMP; Puris in New York, later the
Ammirati Puris Lintas unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies;
Goodby, Berlin &AMP; Silverstein in San Francisco, now the Goodby,
Silverstein &AMP; Partners unit of Omnicom, and Carmichael Lynch in
Minneapolis, now also part of Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   An ad created by Page for Harley-Davidson ``is one of Lee's
all-time favorites,'' said Kuperman, referring to Lee Clow, chief
creative officer at TBWA Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad shows a man with the Harley logo tattooed on his arm,''
Kuperman recalled, ``and the headline `When was the last time you
felt this strongly about something?'''
</P>
<P>
   The appointments of Page and Johnson were reported this week by
the trade publication Adweek. Page will succeed Eric McClellan, who
left in September. Though Johnson's position is new, Mary Maroun
has served as managing director _ the top administrative title
until now _ since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maroun, 42, has been asked to ``continue on as managing
director,'' Kuperman said, ``and she is considering that.''
</P>
<P>
   Page, who is to begin on Feb. 15, and Johnson, who is to begin
in April, will be responsible for all accounts at the
TBWA/Chiat/Day New York office, which include Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.;
the Nivea skin care line sold by Beiersdorf AG ; the New York Life
Insurance Co., and such liquor brands sold by the Seagram Americas
unit of the Seagram Co. as Absolut vodka, the Glenlivet Scotch
whisky and Seagram's Gin.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the New York office of what was then
Chiat/Day had matched if not surpassed its West Coast sibling, with
acclaimed campaigns for clients like the Nynex Yellow Pages and
Arrow shirts. But constant churn, as the office won and lost
accounts like Reebok International Ltd. and American Express, took
its toll.
</P>
<P>
   The office has been doing better recently, landing accounts like
Barnes &AMP; Noble, Outback Steakhouse and the Promus Hotels Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to the experience of sitting in an office with no
clients, just some partners, owing money to the banks and saying,
`OK, boys, here we go,''' Johnson said. ``That you never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether being English would hinder his efforts to
understand the New York and American markets, Johnson said, ``I can
feel as foreign walking across the road in London to an agency that
does things I don't believe in as I can anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's hiring is the second time in a week that a president
and chief executive has been named at a TBWA/Chiat/Day office. Tom
Carroll is joining Playa del Rey with those titles from Messner
Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG in New York, a unit of
Havas Advertising, where he had been a partner and managing
director.
</P>
<P>
   At Ogilvy New York, said Toni Lee, a spokeswoman, a successor to
Page is being sought.

MAIER TO COMPETE AT VAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hermann ``The Hermannator'' Maier will take on the tough Vail
downhill course on Saturday, an odds on favorite to take the gold
in this year's World Alpine Championships taking place at the
Colorado resort over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the overall World Cup standings, Maier will take on
Norway's Lasse Kjus, who has been chasing him all season, and is
about 200 points behind the Austrian.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the ski racer best known for his spectacular
flying crash at last year's Olympic downhill, was tied in the Vail
Super-G.
</P>
<P>
   True to the growing rivalry, Norway's Kjus was just as fast as
Maier and in a rare tie for first, shared the first-place podium
with a time of 1-minute 14.53 seconds. At the Nagano games, two
days after his downhill crash, Maier rallied to win the Super-G.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in women's action Wednesday, Alexandra Meissintzer
led an Austrian sweep of the Super-G, showing why she is often
called the female Maier. Over a rolling bumpy course, Meissintzer
nailed the Vail course to beat her teammate Renate Goetschl by .03
seconds. Another teammate, Michaela Dorfmeister, placed third ahead
of a German star, Hilde Gerg.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Gerety, skiing before the watchful eye of boyfriend, Tommy
Moe, had a decent run going before she crashed off the course,
leaving on her own power, unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   The best US finish went to Kate Monahan, who skied with a bad
back, but placed 23d.

IRS CLEARS FOUNDATION IN GINGRICH ETHICS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case involving the ethics violations that led
the House of Representatives to reprimand former Speaker Newt
Gingrich in 1997, the Internal Revenue Service has cleared a
private foundation close to Gingrich of breaking tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS ruling, involving the Progress and Freedom Foundation,
does not directly exonerate Gingrich. But it suggests that he did
not illegally use tax-exempt money for political purposes, one of
the main accusations against him.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich could not be reached for comment Wednesday. His closest
associate in Washington, Joe Gaylord, did not return a telephone
call about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Galen, executive director of Gopac, a political action
committee that Gingrich headed for eight years, said the finding by
the IRS showed that the House ethics investigation of Gingrich had
been ``way off base.''
</P>
<P>
   James M. Cole, a Washington lawyer who served as special counsel
to the House Ethics Committee and brought the case against
Gingrich, said Wednesday that despite the ruling he had not changed
his opinion that Gingrich had broken the tax law.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich stepped down as speaker last year after Republicans
lost five House seats in the November election. In December, he
paid the last installment of a $300,000 fine imposed by the House
for ethics violations. He resigned from Congress last month.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS' ruling, after an audit that took three and a half
years, cleared the foundation of any violation of tax laws in
connection with its sponsorship of a college course Gingrich
taught. The foundation is a conservative research institute whose
president, Jeffrey Eisenach, was once on Gingrich's staff.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation released the ruling Wednesday. Officials at two
schools in Georgia where Gingrich taught the course, Kennesaw State
University and Reinhardt College, said in interviews Wednesday that
they had received letters from the IRS last month also clearing
them of any violation of tax law in the Gingrich case. Galen said
Gopac had not been audited.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of the case go back to 1993, when Gingrich was the
inspirational leader of Republicans in the House, who had been
mired in the minority for a generation. He was determined to put an
end to that status.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who has a doctorate in history, began teaching a
course that year, Renewing American Civilization, at Kennesaw State
College. The theme of the course was the central message at the
time of conservative Republicans: that the ``welfare state'' should
be replaced by an ``opportunity society.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 and 1995, the course moved to Reinhardt College. It was
also broadcast around the country on cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of satellite uplinks and other expenses were covered by
tax-deductible donations to the colleges and by the Progress and
Freedom Foundation, which also is tax exempt. Gingrich was not
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, tax-deductible contributions like those given to
the colleges and the foundation cannot be used for partisan
political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   After a long investigation, a subcommittee of the Ethics
Committee reached an agreement with Gingrich in late 1996. In the
agreement, which was essentially a plea bargain, Gingrich did not
admit to the direct tax law violation he was accused of by Cole,
the special counsel. But he did admit that he had failed to obtain
the necessary legal advice that the financing of his course was
within the law.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also admitted to providing the Ethics Committee with
false information when he told the panel in writing that Gopac, the
political committee he headed from 1986 until 1994, had nothing to
do with his course. In fact, Gopac paid at one point for satellite
broadcasts of the course material.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats saw this as a more serious violation than the tax
matter. Gingrich said one of his lawyers had been responsible for
the erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the agency called it a ``close case'' but
concluded that the private interests of Gingrich and the Republican
Party were served only incidentally by the use of tax-exempt money
to pay the expenses of the course.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were set forth in what the agency calls a
``technical advice memorandum.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery L. Yablon, the Washington tax lawyer who represented the
Progress and Freedom Foundation, said the 74-page memorandum was by
far the longest and most detailed finding he had ever seen
involving the question of whether activities were tax exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion that no tax law was violated, the agency said,
was based on many factors, including ``the nonpartisan content'' of
the course, the favorable mention in the curriculum of
officeholders who were not Republicans and the fact that the
colleges at which the course was taught were well established.

PRAYER BREAKFAST INVITATION TO ARAFAT MEETS CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The invitation of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Thursday's annual National Prayer Breakfast has transformed the
event designed to symbolize global peace and reconciliation into a
hotbed of angry protest and finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to Arafat's attendance has been building over the
last week, as conservative religious groups, including the
Christian Coalition and the National Jewish Coalition, charge
President Clinton with exploiting a spiritual event for political
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Mike Forbes, Republican of New York, is one of at
least two members of Congress who have announced they would boycott
the breakfast following a flurry of calls and letters sent to
members of Congress from conservative religious groups asking that
they refuse to join the hundreds of foreign dignitaries, heads of
states, and other political luminaries attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply wrong for Congress to treat this unrepentant
terrorist with the respect due a legitimate world leader,'' said
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   A group called The Committee for a Secure Peace, chaired by
former Senator Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, also took out a
full-page ad in Wednesday's Washington Times that said,
``Congressman and Senators: Don't Go.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad accused Arafat of breaking his commitment enshrined in
the Oslo and Wye accords to combat terrorism, and noted that Arafat
last week released five terrorists who killed Americans, and listed
the victims by name.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to meet with Arafat some time before or after the
breakfast. State Department spokesman James Rubin said there was no
evidence yet to support these claims by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   While some members of Congress may boycott the event, attempts
by religious groups to have Arafat disinvited, however, were
rebuffed by Representative Steve Largent, an Oklahoma Republican
and chairman of this year's National Prayer Breakfast committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly the type of event people like Arafat ought to
be invited to,'' said Largent. ``The idea of a prayer breakfast is
to bring people together for reconciliation and healing and
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of goodwill is unlikely to prevail as the
Christian Defense Coaltion holds a demonstration and a prayer vigil
outside the breakfast. Inside, relatives of the victims of
terrorist violence conducted by the Palestinian Liberation
Organization intend to approach Arafat at the breakfast, according
to the religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yasser Arafat is an unrepentant murderer and terrorist with
blood on his hands,'' said Adrea Sheldon, executive director of the
Traditional Values Coalition. ``It's Jewish blood, it's Christian
blood, it's American blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat arrived in Washington Tuesday for a three-day visit to
discuss the breakdown of the peace agreement with Israel.

CHINESE ENCOURAGE TEACHING OF ATHEISM IN TIBET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ The Chinese authorities in Tibet like to say
they tolerate religious freedom, though many Tibetans complain that
their religious activities are tightly controlled and permitted
only on Chinese terms.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, people are allowed to worship at temples at certain
times, but authorities closely monitor any activity _ in
monasteries, universities or elsewhere _ that hints at anything
they consider a threat to Chinese control over Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as officials take a tough line aimed at discouraging any
unrest as a series of sensitive anniversaries approach in the
coming months, the Chinese government is encouraging the teaching
of atheism, which appears to run counter to the promises of
religious tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering of senior officials in Tibet last month,
authorities announced that they would expand the teaching of
atheism among Communist Party members and government employees and
also in Tibetan society in general.
</P>
<P>
   An official report on the meeting, carried in
government-controlled media in other parts of China in recent days,
described an endorsement of the teaching of atheism, saying it
should be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improving the publicizing of atheism is an important
responsibility of the propaganda and ideological front by the
Communist Party,'' the report said. ``It is also an important
measure in the waging of an in-depth struggle against separatism,
resisting the reactionary infiltration of the Dalai Lama clique,
and guiding Tibetan farmers and herdsmen in ridding themselves of
passive religious influence.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said there was a growing need to ``improve the moral
and ideological quality of all Tibetan people,'' which in Communist
Party language means accepting party principles of atheism and
obedience.
</P>
<P>
   This latest step appears to be an extension of a ``patriotic
education campaign,'' as authorities call their recent efforts to
stamp out allegiance to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader,
who has lived in exile since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, atheism has been encouraged among Communist Party
cadres in Tibet,'' said Kate Saunders of the Tibet Information
Network, a London-based organization that monitors the situation in
Tibet. ``Now they are extending it to wider society, especially in
the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials are concerned about two sensitive
anniversaries, Ms. Saunders said. They are the 40th anniversary of
an uprising on March 10, 1959, when the Dalai Lama fled, and the
10th anniversary, on March 8, of riots in the Tibetan capital,
Lhasa, that led to the imposition of martial law.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of China, authorities have begun a widespread
crackdown on dissidents, writers and the media in recent months,
apparently determined to prevent any protests during other
sensitive anniversaries _ namely, the 10th anniversary of the
Tiananmen crackdown in June 1989, and the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   In Tibet, officials are focused on blocking any show of sympathy
or allegiance to the Dalai Lama. But their current campaign is
being publicly presented in a broader context of the official aim
to modernize Tibet, still a poor and largely rural area populated
mostly by farmers and herdsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publicizing atheism should start with every aspect of daily
life for the masses,'' the official report said. ``It is imperative
to give play to the advantages of modern media, with its immediacy
and breadth, and to popularize scientific know-how and medical
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the official policy of permitting religious worship,
many Chinese officials see the intense devotion to Buddhism among
Tibetans as primitive and ignorant.

BEAM OF LIGHT FROM MIR WON'T PLEASE EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The skies over a long swath of Canada, together with
parts of Europe, Russia and central Asia, are scheduled to flare
with a new kind of light as Russian cosmonauts attempt to test a
bizarre space technology meant to brighten life in northern cities.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, cosmonauts aboard the Mir space station
will unfurl an 82-foot-diameter mirror made of aluminum-coated
plastic foil, beaming bursts of reflected sunlight down upon a
series of cities around the globe, from Quebec City to Karaganda,
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment Thursday night marks a major step forward in a
strange, wildly ambitious and environmentally controversial Russian
project. The ultimate goal is to eventually launch batteries of
gigantic _ and potentially hugely profitable _ space mirrors into
orbit to serve as cosmic spotlights, illuminating the long, dark
winters of northern latitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Such artifical moons, say Russian designers of the futuristic
scheme, could eventually save energy and cheer up the lives of
people dwelling in the far north of Russia, Canada and other realms
where the sun hardly shines through the winter, and where
alcoholism and depression are common.
</P>
<P>
   More prosaically, space mirrors could be used simply to extend
``daytime'' in northern urban centers, eventually adding an hour or
two of light for commuters and shoppers in Montreal, Moscow or even
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers around the world are aghast at the plan, and
bitterly oppose the space project as a threat to sensitive
telescopes and other astronomical gear that enable humans to peer
to the far edges of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This first experiment is a novelty, and perhaps harmless,''
said Michael De Robertis, professor of astronomy at Ontario's York
University and president of the Canadian Astronomical Society.
``But the bigger plan is very alarming. It could literally blind
telescopes. It has potential to seriously compromise astronomical
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Beatty, senior editor of Sky and Telescope, a Cambridge,
Mass. magazine covering astronomical issues, put it more bluntly:
``The result could be horrific destruction of the night skies.''
</P>
<P>
   To some dwellers in the frozen north, however, the project
sounds pretty good. ``Just tell us where to sign up for some of
that outer space sunshine,'' said Jason Kilabuk, social counselor
in the Inuit settlement of Iqaluit in Canada's Northwest
Territories. ``The cold isn't really the problem up here. It's the
long days of darkness _ that's what wears people down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the experiment, scheduled to start over Russia in the morning
and continue into the night over North America, cosmonauts aboard
the Mir station plan to deploy the prototype space mirror _ named
Znamya, or Banner _ and beam down shafts of reflected sunshine
during a series of orbits over a 13-hour span. After the
experiment, the silvery contraption will fall back toward earth and
burn up in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmonauts will attempt to aim bursts of light at a series
of population centers around the north, including Calgary, Alberta;
Winnipeg, Manitoba; Frankfurt, Germany; Poltava, Ukraine; and
Saratov, Russia. During the test run, the Znamya mirror is expected
to throw light beams 10 times brighter than the full moon onto
target areas measuring about five square miles. The only United
States community that may be directly illuminated by the bounced
light is Devils Lake, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mirror will look like the brightest star in the sky,''
space engineer Vladimir Syromyatnikov, the 66-year-old Russian
visionary behind the experiment, told reporters in Moscow several
weeks ago. ``You won't be able to look at it without squinting your
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ray falling on Quebec City, the nearest Earth target to New
England, is scheduled to be beamed down at 6:56 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium of Russian aerospace companies operating the
project hopes over the next decade, beginning in year 2003, to
place a necklace of hundreds of space mirrors into higher,
semi-permanent orbit. These would be much larger versions of the
Znamya prototype _ each roughly the size of a football field _ and,
in theory, capable of bathing whole cities in light equivalent to
that of a brightly illuminated parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is to determine whether the beams can be kept
focused on a particular place on the earth. ``If it is successful,
it would be a major step foward in the ability of the Russians to
control these huge and fragile mirrors in outer space,'' said
Beatty. ``They hope to orient these mirrors the way a stagehand
points a spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paris-based International Astronomical Union plans to
protest the project before the United Nations and has already fired
off concerned letters to Moscow claiming that efforts to probe the
universe will be drastically curtailed by the explosion of night
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's technology run amok,'' said astronomer Woodruff T.
Sullivan of the University of Washington, heading the assessment of
the orbiting mirrors for the worldwide body of professional
astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian consortium has been vague about its plans, but most
analysts are convinced the ultimate goal is profit. The expectation
is the Russians and their financial backers hope to sell the beams,
whether to Canadian cities seeking a longer day or to commercial
interests _ mine operators, say, or construction teams _ that could
use extra hours of working light.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, given the enormity of the project, it has received very
little attention in North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard nothing at all about this,'' said a Canadian
official with expertise in technology and international affairs.
``Are you sure this isn't some sort of science fiction fantasy? It
doesn't sound plausible.''

 &HT;    Georgia Lottery $60 million winner `taking a few days off'
 &HT;    By Doug Payne and Clint Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was easy to spot the winner of Tuesday's $60
million Big Game drawing _ he was the big guy with the huge grin as
he walked into the Georgia Lottery Corp.'s news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sheets, 42, looked like a man who's suddenly many millions
of dollars richer than he was the day before _ $33 million before
taxes, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   You don't often hear of that happening to someone who owns a
bait shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what to say,'' Sheets, of the Chattanooga
suburb of Harrison, Tenn., said at the start of the news conference
in his honor. ``It's all so unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the big question out of the way quickly, Sheets said he
doesn't know what he'll do with the money. Maybe take a long family
vacation with his parents and three children. Certainly there'll be
more time for golf, he said. Beyond that, he said he hasn't really
been able to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bait shop, it was just a sideline anyway. Sheets is a
property assessor in Hamilton County, Tenn. Before driving to
Atlanta to claim his prize, he gave the shop to his son and
``called my boss (in the tax assessor's office) to say I'd be
taking a few days off.''
</P>
<P>
   No comment on whether he'll continue working there after a few
days off.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets and a friend drove to Ringgold on Monday for the express
purpose of buying tickets for Tuesday's Big Game drawing. They
bought their tickets at Favorite Market No. 79 on U.S. 41, just
north of Ringgold.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Kevin Bartenfield, asked the clerk for three Quik
Pik numbers. Then Sheets stepped up and said, ``Give me five of
what he got'' _ he, too, going the Quik Pik route instead of
thinking up his own numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time Sheets had ever bought lottery
tickets. The last time was a couple of years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the first of Sheets's five number series was
the winner: 6-14-23-31-33, with the Big Money Ball 13. Had
Bartenfield asked for four number sequences instead of three, maybe
he'd have been the guest of honor at Wednesday's press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Sheets bought his tickets at that market means a
big bonus for the employees who work there. The Georgia Lottery
gives a $25,000 bonus to the retailer who sells a jackpot-winning
number. The company policy of the Dalton-based Favorite Market
chain is to share that bonus with store employees. The company will
keep half and give the rest to the staff at Favorite Market No. 79.
</P>
<P>
   As manager of the store, which is two miles from the Chattanooga
city limits, Angie Bryson will get a $6,250 bonus. The six other
employees of the store will get bonuses of slightly more than
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sheets' winnings, he chose the lump-sum payout option,
which meant he got a big presentation check for $33,277,860 from
Georgia Lottery President Rebecca Paul. It was the biggest single
payout in the Lottery's 5 1/2 year history, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the real check that was cut by the lottery corporation
for Sheets withheld state and federal taxes. The check that he
drove back to Harrison with was for $21,963,387.60.

PRAYER BREAKFAST INVITATION TO ARAFAT MEETS CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The invitation of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Thursday's annual National Prayer Breakfast has transformed the
event designed to symbolize global peace and reconciliation into a
hotbed of angry protest and finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to Arafat's attendance has been building over the
last week, as conservative religious groups, including the
Christian Coalition and the National Jewish Coalition, charge
President Clinton with exploiting a spiritual event for political
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Mike Forbes, Republican of New York, is one of at
least two members of Congress who have announced they would boycott
the breakfast following a flurry of calls and letters sent to
members of Congress from conservative religious groups asking that
they refuse to join the hundreds of foreign dignitaries, heads of
states, and other political luminaries attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply wrong for Congress to treat this unrepentant
terrorist with the respect due a legitimate world leader,'' said
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   A group called The Committee for a Secure Peace, chaired by
former Senator Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, also took out a
full-page ad in Wednesday's Washington Times that said,
``Congressman and Senators: Don't Go.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad accused Arafat of breaking his commitment enshrined in
the Oslo and Wye accords to combat terrorism, and noted that Arafat
last week released five terrorists who killed Americans, and listed
the victims by name.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to meet with Arafat some time before or after the

SENATE PROPOSAL WOULD CRACK DOWN ON SWEEPSTAKE OPERATORS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Ill., Miss., Mich.)  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation was introduced in the Senate Wednesday
to strengthen regulations prohibiting sweepstakes mailings that
mimic government documents and increase civil penalties for
companies that send out fraudulent or deceptive sweepstakes entry
forms.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was described by one of its sponsors, Sen. Susan M.
Collins, R-Maine, as a means of increasing protection for senior
citizens and other consumers who are vulnerable to sophisticated
mass-marketing techniques and pitches by celebrities used by
sweepstakes companies and similar mass mailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen countless examples of mailings that deceptively
promise extravagant prizes in order to entice consumers to make
unnecessary purchases, said Collins, who introduced the legislation
along with Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and two Democrats, Sens.
Carl Levin of Michigan and Dick Durbin of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Collins cited as examples of deceptive practices two recent
mailings to constituents in Maine. One of them, she said, appeared
to be a government document and said, ``Urgent Delivery, A Special
Notification of Cash currently being held by the U.S. Government is
ready for shipment to you.'' The mailing asked recipients to send
$9.97 to learn how to get the cash. A sweepstakes entry package
said, ``You Were Declared One of Our Latest Sweepstakes Winners And
You're About to Be Paid $833,337 in Cash!''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would establish new standards requiring sweepstakes
companies and other mass mailers to disclose that no purchase is
necessary to win a prize and strengthen laws against mailings that
appear to be official documents. It also would streamline Postal
Service procedures for stopping fraudulent mailings and increase
penalties for civil violations from the current $10,000 to up to $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations opened an
investigation into the extent of sweepstakes fraud late last year
and public hearings are expected in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Cerasale, senior vice president for government affairs at
the Direct Marketing Association, the industry trade group in
Washington, said the organization had been working with Collins and
her staff to develop new laws aimed at eliminating fraudulent
sweepstakes operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our push is that we want to get rid of fraud in the
sweepstakes areas because that makes it better for legitimate
sweepstakes companies,'' he said. ``We do agree that there are
clearly people out there that are fraudulent and we've got to go
after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerasale said that the vast majority of sweepstakes companies
comply with the law and most people who enter the contests
understand what they are doing and are satisfied with the products
that they receive.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for senior citizens have contended that they are
particularly vulnerable to the sophisticated mailings and lookalike
documents used by the sweepstakes indus4ry. Senior citizens have
spent thousands of dollars entering contests after receiving
mailings promising that they were finalists or winners, though the
fine print disclosed that no purchase was necessary to enter and
that the odds of actually winning were often greater than those of
winning a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Most actions against sweepstakes companies have come from state
attorneys general, who use consumer protection laws to go after
allegedly fraudulent mailings. The proposed legislation would not
preempt existing state laws.

AMA AND FIRED EDITOR STRIKE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association has announced a cease-fire with
the top-ranking editor it fired last month, but the announcement
left many questions unanswered about the fate of Dr. George D.
Lundberg and the AMA itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the nation's largest doctors' group and
Lundberg said Wednesday they had ``reached agreement on the terms
of Dr. Lundberg's departure,'' but they would not discuss the
provisions, which are believed to include a sizeable financial
settlement. The statement also said Lundberg would continue
contributing to ``scientific medical research and journalism,
including JAMA,'' but it added that such contributions would be
``subject to editorial discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   AMA officials declined to amplify on the terse statement and
Lundberg was unavailable. But others close to the controversy said
the announcement does not settle the issues of journalistic
independence raised by Lundberg's firing, nor does it erase the
black eye the incident gave the AMA, whose membership was already
down to less than 40 percent of US physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we need to do as a committee is address the
issue of creating some kind of firewall'' between the AMA
leadership and JAMA, said Dr. Michael M.E. Johns of Emory
University in Atlanta, a member of the AMA committee charged with
finding a new JAMA editor. ``Any candidates are going to ask about
this, and I think we need to find something that provides better
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Raymond Scalettar of Washington, D.C., who chaired the AMA
board in 1992-93 and has led unsuccessful bids to shake up the
organization, went a step further. ``This sad chapter at the AMA
will not end by just `making nice' '' with Lundberg, he said.
``Fundamentally, a scientific and medical journal has to have
complete independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about that independence were raised last month when
the AMA abruptly terminated Lundberg after a 17-year tenure, during
which he transformed the journal from a mouthpiece of the AMA to
one of the world's most esteemed medical publications. But the
feisty and blunt-spoken Lundberg also had raised the ire of many
AMA trustees, some staffers and Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, the
retired Air Force general the AMA brought in last year to rescue it
from earlier scandals and boost its sagging membership.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and his supporters apparently were distressed when
Lundberg published a special issue last year on alternative
medicine, and when he appeared the CBS-TV ``60 Minutes'' show
arguing that hospitals should do more autopsies when patients die.
The episode that led to his firing came last month when he
published a survey study in which a majority of college students
had agreed with President Clinton's controversial contention that
oral-genital contact does not constitute ``having sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Running the study just as Clinton's Senate impeachment trial was
getting underway, Anderson said, amounted to ``inappropriately and
inexcusably interjecting JAMA into a major political debate.'' But
leading medical editors from around the world, and even Lundberg's
interim replacements at JAMA, railed against the firing, saying it
called into question JAMA's editorial integrity and raised the
spectre of the journal once again becoming an AMA house organ.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's statement by the AMA and its ex-editor sought to put
the controversy behind them, saying that ``neither Dr. Lundberg nor
the AMA wishes to add to the confusion and uncertainty surrounding
this event.'' It went on to point out areas where both agree,
including ``their absolute commitment to JAMA's editorial
integrity, independence and excellence.'' And it called Lundberg's
career ``distinguished and invaluable,'' adding that ``the AMA and
Dr. Lundberg have now resolved their substantive differences.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a dramatic change in tone from the AMA's statements
last month, when Anderson said Lundberg had ``threatened the
historic tradition and integrity'' of JAMA.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's statement was just one in a series of steps the
association has taken to end the controversy. Last week it named a
committee of health leaders who will help choose a new JAMA editor,
although that announcement was somewhat overshadowed when a member
of JAMA's editorial board _ Dr. Donald Lindberg, director of the
National Library of Medicine _ resigned in protest over Lundberg's
firing. Thursday Anderson is due to address the controversy in a
special meeting of the AMA staff at a Chicago hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more than that, however, to win back many of those
alienated by the AMA's interference with its respected medical
journal, said one well known Boston physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fan of the AMA, but I have been a fan of JAMA and I
have felt there was a nonpermeable wall between the two,'' said Dr.
Thomas Delbanco, head of general medicine and primary care at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and editor of a monthly
column in JAMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a wall between the two, and it was called editoral
independence. Unless that were restored beyond just nice words, I
don't see how anyone in good conscience could serve on a search
committee for the successor to Dr. Lundberg.''

3 STATES CANCEL PLANS TO SELL DRIVERS LICENSE PHOTOGRAPHS TO
DATABASE CONCERN 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: S.C., N.H., Colo., Fla.)  By LISA NAPOLI   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A private company's effort to buy driver's license photographs
and place them in an electronic database has raised privacy
concerns, prompting three states to backtrack on their decision to
sell the data.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Image Data of Nashua, N.H., manufactures a
fraud-protection device that allows store clerks to verify the
identity of a consumer using a driver's license number or Social
Security number to call up a digital photograph. The device is
currently being tested in 10 stores in South Carolina, which sold
Image Data digital records of 3.5 million drivers licenses last
year for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   But after news reports of the sales, officials in South
Carolina, along with those in Colorado and Florida, moved to halt
the transfer of data to the company.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the attorney general, Charlie Condon, will
appear in court Thursday morning to ask for a temporary injunction
to halt the use of the photos. Ten stores across the state have
been wired with Image Data's True ID security device since last
August.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Condon's office explained that state officials
only recently became aware of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lawsuit asks for the photos back because the budget
proviso that allowed the sale was unconstitutional,'' said Robb
McBurney, Condons spokesman. ``At the last minute you can stick in
a lot of things with a budget proviso, and this got in in 1998 with
no public scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado and Florida had signed contracts with the company, but
Colorado has not yet delivered data. On Monday, Gov. Jeb Bush of
Florida terminated the states contract with Image Data, after a
temporary injunction blocking the transfer of images was issued by
a Seminole County judge. Prior to the injunction, Florida had
released 35,000 of the states 14 million drivers license records to
the company, and had been paid $140,000 by Image Data for all of
the records.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Colorado State Sen. Tony Grampsas introduced
legislation to repeal a bill he had introduced in the Colorado
House of Representatives two years ago to allow the sale of the
states drivers license records to Image Data. Gov. Bill Owens
lobbied for the repeal on Tuesday after the sale of the photographs
became public last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became apparent the public wasn't going to buy off on it,''
said Dick Wadhams, press secretary for the governor. ``Even though
it was Super Bowl weekend, a lot of legislators got hammered pretty
hard by their constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Christie, vice president of public affairs for Image Data,
called the public outcry surrounding True ID a
``misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   When a digital image is called up by a store clerk, it only
stays visible ``for seconds,'' Ms. Christie said. No other personal
information is displayed on the LCD screen, she said, nor can the
clerk operating the device capture any of the data. Transmissions
between Image Data's computers and the retail store are encrypted,
she said, to inhibit wiretapping of private information.
</P>
<P>
   Though the device is built for check identification purposes,
Ms. Christie said it could be expanded to verify credit card
purchases as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a misperception that we were selling our database to
retailers,'' said Ms. Christie. ``We are using technology to
protect customers. Our use of the information is only for identity
purposes, not for marketing.''

PRAYER BREAKFAST INVITATION TO ARAFAT MEETS CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The invitation of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Thursday's annual National Prayer Breakfast has transformed the
event designed to symbolize global peace and reconciliation into a
hotbed of angry protest and finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to Arafat's attendance has been building over the
last week, as conservative religious groups, including the
Christian Coalition and the National Jewish Coalition, charge
President Clinton with exploiting a spiritual event for political
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Mike Forbes, Republican of New York, is one of at
least two members of Congress who have announced they would boycott
the breakfast following a flurry of calls and letters sent to
members of Congress from conservative religious groups asking that
they refuse to join the hundreds of foreign dignitaries, heads of
states, and other political luminaries attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply wrong for Congress to treat this unrepentant
terrorist with the respect due a legitimate world leader,'' said
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   A group called The Committee for a Secure Peace, chaired by
former Senator Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, also took out a
full-page ad in Wednesday's Washington Times that said,
``Congressman and Senators: Don't Go.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad accused Arafat of breaking his commitment enshrined in
the Oslo and Wye accords to combat terrorism, and noted that Arafat
last week released five terrorists who killed Americans, and listed
the victims by name.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to meet with Arafat some time before or after the
breakfast. State Department spokesman James Rubin said there was no
evidence yet to support these claims by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   While some members of Congress may boycott the event, attempts
by religious groups to have Arafat disinvited, however, were
rebuffed by Representative Steve Largent, an Oklahoma Republican
and chairman of this year's National Prayer Breakfast committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly the type of event people like Arafat ought to
be invited to,'' said Largent. ``The idea of a prayer breakfast is
to bring people together for reconciliation and healing and
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of goodwill is unlikely to prevail as the
Christian Defense Coaltion holds a demonstration and a prayer vigil
outside the breakfast. Inside, relatives of the victims of
terrorist violence conducted by the Palestinian Liberation
Organization intend to approach Arafat at the breakfast, according
to the religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yasser Arafat is an unrepentant murderer and terrorist with
blood on his hands,'' said Adrea Sheldon, executive director of the
Traditional Values Coalition. ``It's Jewish blood, it's Christian
blood, it's American blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat arrived in Washington Tuesday for a three-day visit to
discuss the breakdown of the peace agreement with Israel.

 &HT;    Senate trial needs a deft Dickens wrap-up
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since White House lawyer David Kendall evoked his
name last week on the Senate floor, it has been impossible to
dislodge the image of Mr. Micawber, hat askew, looking down grandly
from the gallery on the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   This story has had Charles Dickens' touch all along. Only he
would have been brash enough to name a deceitful friend Tripp and a
lowlife reporter Drudge. Kendall himself, reed-thin and acerbic,
could be one of those Chancery lawyers in ``Bleak House,'' droning
away endlessly over Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce.
</P>
<P>
   The story badly needs the author's services now. Dickens wrote
his novels, just as the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal has unfolded, in
weekly magazine installments that twisted plots this way and that,
accumulating characters by the dozens. The more bankable side of
Dickens' genius was his ability to sense when his public had read
enough, knit all the plot threads back together and account for all
the characters in a grand concluding chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has set itself on schedule to bring the trial to a
close by Feb. 12, but wrapping up the loose ends will be, well, a
Dickens of a job.
</P>
<P>
   Neither ``adjournment-plus,'' Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch's
suggestion, nor the ``finding of fact'' idea offered by Maine's
senators, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, is likely to leave all
the sides in this serial with an agreeable sense of closure.
</P>
<P>
   Even before they vote, the senators, who include several genuine
war heros in their number, have had their courage questioned by the
increasingly entrenched House Republicans. House Judiciary Chairman
Henry Hyde last week said he was glad the senators who wanted a
short list of witnesses weren't at Valley Forge or the Alamo, and
Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia this week branded them a ``Senate of
cowards'' for hurrying to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   It seems very shrill for Republican House members, who only had
to vote on impeachment and often run in safely drawn districts, to
speak this way of the senators, who face a far more difficult vote
on removal from office and the much more daunting challenge of
running statewide, in races more likely to reflect the national
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senators are trying to find a twist that will
reconcile the demands of their House colleagues with the demands of
a public that overwhelmingly wants this story to conclude _ a hard
job for the best novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall brought up Micawber, who was ``always waiting for
something to turn up,'' simply to draw scathing comparison to the
House managers' strategy in calling for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Like all great characters, however, the debt-ridden but
bombastic gentleman from ``David Copperfield'' finds his own seat
in the imagination, and seems no more out of place at this trial
than Paul Coverdell or Max Cleland.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, re-reading ``David Copperfield,'' might see a lot
of Bill Clinton in the duplicitous James Steerforth, the charming
climber whose real ambition is to ``ride over all obstacles and win
the race.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat would be more likely to see the president in the
book's title character, who grows into an able man with the
``undisciplined heart'' of a fatherless child. But Micawber _ the
well-meaning but ineffectual family man, who composes messages to
Parliament from debtor's prison, a credit risk who becomes a
magistrate in the end _ is the type of fellow who could be sitting
on either side of the aisle.

GM DISAPPOINTED BY JANUARY SALES
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

(dal) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ As many of its competitors reported double-digit sales
increases, the General Motors Corp. said Wednesday that January
sales rose a scant 4 percent compared with exceptionally weak sales
in the month a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed in the January results,'' said Michael
DiGiovanni, GM's chief forecaster. ``But we're optimistic going
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   GM reported sales of 308,880 cars and light trucks in January, a
4 percent increase compared with sales in the month a year earlier,
which were off 6 percent from January 1997 and thus not especially
tough to beat. Sales industrywide were up nearly 12 percent last
month.
</P>
<P>
   GM's car sales rose 11.4 percent, to 166,970 vehicles. Gains
came largely from GM's newer midsized cars. In other market
segments, sales of Cadillac's flagship Seville, which hit the
market in January 1998, climbed 21 percent, and Saab, buoyed by its
new top-of-the-line 9-5, had its best January in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   However, GM's truck sales dropped 3.7 percent, to 141,910. Ford
far outsold GM, and DaimlerChrysler nearly matched it in truck
sales. GM continues to be plagued by inventory shortages,
particularly of its new full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC
Sierra full-size pickup trucks, in the aftermath of last summer's
two-month strike, which shut down almost all of GM's North American
assembly plants. Sales of the two trucks combined rose 3 percent in
January, but their inventory levels remain 44 percent below last
year's level.
</P>
<P>
   Shortages of the Sierra were compounded in November when a die
for the hood broke, halting production and costing about 4,000
Sierra sales in January alone, GM officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Silverado and Sierra sales could be better with more
availability,'' said Donald R. DeVeaux, GM director for North
American market analysis. ``They are turning well at dealerships.
It's a matter of how fast we can get them out there and sell
them.''
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to add 250,000 units of truck production this year,
including new full-size sport-utility vehicles to replace the
Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon and Chevrolet and GMC Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GM were unchanged yesterday at $89.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors worked against GM last month. On Jan. 1, GM began
revamping its field organization, which assists dealers. Some
personnel were not in place by Jan. 1. In conjunction with the
reorganization, GM installed a new computer system for dealers
ordering vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Also in January, Cadillac paid for its December sales surge,
with sales off 38 percent compared with those in the month a year
earlier. Cadillac offered a lot of incentives in December to
maintain luxury car leadership over the Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln
division. Heading into December, Cadillac risked losing its 60-year
sales reign over Lincoln, but ended the year just ahead of its
rival.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sales of the Catera were off 88 percent in January
because Cadillac had been unable to sell the 1999 German-built
cars. The car's engine-management system had been changed for the
1999 model year but had quality problems. The 1999 Catera began
arriving at dealerships at the end of January. Production of
Cadillac's new full-size sport utility vehicle, the Escalade, which
just went on sale last fall, also was halted because of a tooling
change at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its problems, GM missed out on a blistering sales
pace for the industry, which spilled over into the new year from
1998. U.S. vehicle sales for January totaled 1,090,950 cars and
light trucks, an 11.6 percent increase compared with sales in the
month a year earlier. Car sales totaled 546,030 units, up 8
percent, and truck sales increased 15.4 percent, to 544,920
vehicles. That put the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for
light vehicles at 15.6 million cars and light trucks for January.
</P>
<P>
   GM's forecasters agree with many analysts who see a continued
strong automotive market. GM is considering increasing its industry
sales forecast for 1999. GM opened the year expecting 1999 sales of
all trucks and cars to total between 15 million and 15.5 million in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously moving to the upper end of that range,''
DiGiovanni said.

RUSSIAN PREMIER BEGINS CRACKDOWN ON CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT AND
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's top prosecutor suddenly resigns, officially
for health reasons, although no one believes that. A former justice
minister, out of office for two years, is arrested on charges of
fraud and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Then police on Wednesday night confirmed that they had found
evidence of illegal wiretapping during a city-wide raid of offices
and apartments linked to Boris A. Berezovsky, Russia's best-known
businessman, ace political intriguer and the most public target of
what seems to be Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's opening shot in
a crackdown on economic crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov had already sent out a warning signal last week when he
said that an amnesty of 94,000 Russian prisoners would free up the
cells needed to house an incoming wave of corrupt officials and
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   But as Berezovsky noted in a public response, economic crimes
are a malleable offense that can be easily twisted to political
purpose. Berezovsky, who has openly boasted about his role in
making and breaking successive Russian political fortunes, has
already seen the Primakov government methodically chip away at his
power base, starting with an attempt to push him out of Russia's
largest television station, now virtually bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did he call on Primakov to cool his threats than armed
federal agents in black ski masks this week swooped through the
offices of Sibneft, a Berezovsky-controlled oil company, and Atoll,
a Berezovsky-controlled security company. Atoll has been accused of
serving as Berezovsky's private intelligence agency, secretly
spying on top Russian officials and even members of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's own family.
</P>
<P>
   The raids _ widely seen as the final blow to Berezovsky's
dwindling prestige and influence _ took place Tuesday, the day that
Yeltsin accepted the resignation of chief prosecutor Yuri Skuratov.
It was also the same day that Yeltsin, still convalescing from a
bleeding ulcer, unexpectedly made a brief appearance in the Kremlin
_ his first this year _ where, in keeping with past practice, he
promptly fired four of his own aides.
</P>
<P>
   If, as some believe, the events are linked, then they suggest
that Russia is again undergoing another bout of old-style political
intrigue, which, as one Soviet expert once said, is as difficult to
decipher as a wrestling match under a rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``To outside observers, all this smells of deep medieval
political barbarity, thickly mixed with an uncivilized reckoning of
accounts between opponents,'' noted a political commentator for
Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a newspaper with close ties to Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   In private conservations, Kremlin aides acknowledged that there
was more to Skuratov's abrupt exit than a bad heart, the ailment
with which he was admitted Monday night to the Kremlin hospital.
They said Yeltsin's displeasure had been a long time building,
first over Skuratov's failure to bring Russia's most publicized
crimes to trial and, more recently, over his failure to move
against Russia's outspoken neo-fascist and anti-Semitic
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a sudden phenomenon,'' said one Kremlin aide. ``It
was a sum of all the cases, several of them important, that were
not solved.'' The prosecutor's foot-dragging in bringing a case
against Albert Makashov, the Communist lawmaker who last October
publicly called for Jews to be driven from Russia, was linked to
the resurgence last weekend of a small splinter neo-fascist group
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Although Skuratov has not solved any of Russia's more notorious
murders _ including the killing of Galina Staravoitova, a widely
respected liberal legislator from St. Petersburg _ he did recently
launch well-publicized investigations into the former leadership at
Russia's Central Bank and into some of Russia's biggest privatized
companies, earning himself enemies among liberal reformers and
friends among Russia's Communists.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow or other, the most prevalent theories about his
resignation seem to revolve around Berezovsky, whose political
influence stems in large part from the fact _ or the illusion _
that he has close ties to Yeltsin's family, in particular Tatiana
Dyachenko, the president's daughter and political adviser.
</P>
<P>
   According to one version, Skuratov, fearing Berezovsky's
influence, had dawdled over the investigation into Berezovsky's
wire-tapping operations, even after they were publicly revealed in
a newspaper article. According to another, contradictory version,
his attempts to investigate Berezovsky alarmed Yeltsin, who has
reasons to want to stop any leaks about evidence of his family's
financial dealings that might be in Berezovsky's possession.
</P>
<P>
   But others believe that the real driving force behind Skuratov's
ouster may have been Primakov, who, after four months in office,
wants to make headway on his threats to crack down on corruption.
As if to illustrate the government's new vigor, the interior
ministry on Wednesday night announced that it had arrested former
Justice Minister Valentin Kovalyov on charges of embezzlement, two
years after he resigned from office under the cloud of a sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At an assembly of law enforcement officials that was to have
been addressed by Skuratov on Wednesday, the acting prosecutor
general Yuri Chaika said that the scale of corruption among Russian
bureaucrats had reached unprecedented levels, with Russia now
ranked as the fifth most corrupt country on earth.

UN ORDERS AMERICAN, BRITISH WORKERS TO LEAVE IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Buckling under pressure from Baghdad, the
United Nations ordered a pullout Wednesday of all American and
British UN employees in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, approved by Secretary General Kofi Annan, brings
an end to Iraq's yearlong campaign to expel citizens from Western
nations seeking to topple Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as the Pentagon has expanded attacks against Iraqi
antiaircraft systems.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials said Wednesday that the two remaining American
citizens _ Darlene Bisson, the deputy director for the World Food
Program in Iraq, and the secretary of the chief UN envoy to Iraq,
Prakash Shah, are expected to leave the country in the coming days.
All of Britain's nationals have left.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Eckhard, Annan's chief spokesman, said UN security chief
Benon Sevan ordered the evacuation after Iraq ignored a series of
appeals to allow all UN staffers to carry out the UN's efforts to
provide humanitarian relief to the country's poor. He added that
Iraq also issued unspecified ``threats'' against the two Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The specific threats were to these two nationalities so it was
the security coordinator's call,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has long charged Washington and London with planting
intelligence agents in the UN mission in Iraq to spy on the
government. The accusation has been given weight by recent
revelations that the United States used the UN weapons inspectors
to spy on Iraqi security agencies in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi leadership first demanded the expulsion of American
and British weapons experts seeking to rid Iraq of chemical and
biological weapons in the fall of 1997. But the executive chairman,
Richard Butler of Australia, refused, insisting that Iraq did not
have the right to single out nationals. The United States and
Britain vigorously backed that stance.
</P>
<P>
   Butler finally withdrew the whole team of inspectors on the eve
of US airstrikes in December.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart insisted that the decision to
pull out the Americans was not a prelude to a fresh bombing
campaign in Baghdad. And he expressed sympathy with the UN's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials said Americans have been singled out in other
countries, including North Korea, where the World Food Program only
recently was allowed to post its first senior American official,
Douglas Broderick. They said that the relief effort in Iraq would
continue despite the expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has more than 400 relief workers in Iraq
providing food and medicines to the countries poorest. The
operation is financed by the oil-for-food deal, which allows
Baghdad to sell more than $10 billion in oil over one year to buy
humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has withdrawn more than a dozen American and
British nationals serving with the United Nations. UN sources
insist that the British and departed American employees left on
vacation and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we need to stay to save lives,'' said
Abby Spring, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program. ``Otherwise,
250,000 children with malnutrition would probably have to die.''

IT'S A FILM ABOUT WINNING A TRUCK? YES, BUT MORE.
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds like a terrible idea for a documentary: film two dozen
people in East Texas standing around a brand-new pickup truck,
trying to win it by keeping one hand on the truck and doing almost
nothing else for 70 hours or more. The rules promise no big-screen
excitement: ``5-minute breaks every hour, 15-minute breaks every
six hours, no leaning, the last person left with a hand on the
truck owns it.''
</P>
<P>
   But when aspiring filmmaker S.R. Bindler walked out of a bar in
his hometown of Longview, Texas, in 1992 and saw the final,
grueling hours of the contest in the parking lot of a local auto
dealership, he could not shake the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was truly surreal,'' he recalled recently. ``It was the
middle of the night, and these bright tungsten lights made it look
like daytime. It looked like a movie set. At the time, I didn't
know what to think about it, but I couldn't quit thinking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as it turned out, Bindler never did. He returned to Longview
in 1995 with two young friends who had studied filmmaking with him
at New York University. With little more than local high-school
volunteers, borrowed video equipment, a vague idea and a free place
to stay _ with Bindler's parents _ they made a crude, funny and
sometimes harrowing 97-minute documentary about the contest. The
film has been quietly building a following and received glowing
reviews around the country over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Without the help of a major Hollywood distributor, the film,
``Hands on a Hard Body,'' which Bindler directed, has opened in
several cities and has picked up a handful of audience awards and
other prizes at small film festivals. (It opens Friday in Chicago
and New York.)
</P>
<P>
   A critic for Philadelphia Weekly recently wrote that the film
has done ``for Longview, Texas, what the Coen Brothers did for
Fargo, N.D.'' In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a reviewer said it managed
to drape the mind- and body-numbing quest for a $15,000 Nissan
Hardbody truck with all the ``moral trappings of Greek drama.'' In
Austin, Texas, the film has filled a theater for 30 weeks and shows
no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Bindler, 28, now lives in Los Angeles, where he has received
offers to direct small feature films as a result of the
documentary's success. But over breakfast last week in New York's
Soho, near where he is staying with a friend while in town
promoting the movie, he said he was still a little stunned by the
response. After all, the film's budget was only slightly more than
the cost of the new truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it takes people into a mind-set and to a place that
they normally couldn't go,'' he said. ``We always thought that
people in Texas would watch it and go: `I know this. I know people
like this. It's fun.' But we didn't know how people from the rest
of the country would react.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, for some, inevitably conjures up ``They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?,'' the 1969 movie by Sydney Pollack that used a
seemingly endless dance marathon as a metaphor for greed and
sensationalism during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In Longview, a blue-collar oil town with 70,000 people, many of
the hopeful men and women who were chosen in a drawing to
participate in the 1995 competition did not simply want the truck.
They needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Welch, a rancher, had been forced to sell his only good
truck after a bad winter. Kerri Parker, who was then a bartender,
was unable to afford a car and rode her bicycle 12 miles a day to
put her name repeatedly into the drawing. Another contestant, Kelli
Mangrum, who loaded trucks for the United Parcel Service, explained
how she would ready herself to remain on her feet for days for the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm going to have to do,'' she told herself, ``is realize
that if I don't get it, I'm going to have to get another job. And I
don't want another job.''
</P>
<P>
   But the movie _ shot in a shaky freehand that gets shakier as
both contestants and filmmakers crumble from lack of sleep _ tends
to concentrate more on the funny and quietly heroic moments, as
homespun philosophies get tested and unlikely friendships form
across the pickup bed.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Valverde, a fervently religious homemaker who sold her
pickup before the contest because, she said, she believed it was
God's will that she would win a new one, kept herself motivated by
listening to Christian music. She often broke out in spasms of
laughter and whooping.
</P>
<P>
   Across the truck, a gangly, frenetic young man who wanted to
replace his old Volkswagen Beetle so he could stop feeling ``like
an oddball'' told the filmmakers that he admired Ms. Valverde.
``She started to laugh a while ago, and she said it was the Holy
Ghost,'' he said, swaying on his feet. ``I thought that was pretty
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie also spends a lot of time examining, through the eyes
of the contestants, the exalted position of the pickup truck in the
Texas value system. Ronald McCowan, a maintenance man, said: ``A
truck makes money. A car don't make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Benny Perkins, a swaggering, wisecracking mechanic who emerged
as a kind of star of the movie, added that in Texas ``you just grow
up saying: `Eventually, you're going to own a truck. Eventually,
you're going to need a truck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, who had won the competition in 1992, proved to be what
Bindler called ``a moviemaker's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins provided a virtual voice-over for the movie, dispensing
discount wisdom in his cigarette-scarred baritone, warning against
eating hamburger during breaks: ``Eat something heavy like that,
and it's going to take you down.'' He explored the more profound
implications of the competition: ``It's a human drama thing. It's
more than just a contest. It's more than just winning the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the movie, in fact, the dramatic tension came
not from the question ``Who will make it to the end?'' but ``Can
they beat Benny?''
</P>
<P>
   Bindler _ whose parents grew up in Texas and met at the
University of Texas in Austin, where they both studied art and
became interior designers _ admitted that he had never owned a
truck.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his friends, Michael Nickles and Chapin Wilson,
finished shooting the documentary, Bindler returned to Los Angeles,
where he had worked as what he called an office boy for another
friend, Kevin Morris, a successful entertainment lawyer who is one
of the film's producers.
</P>
<P>
   Morris and Bindler at first made a short trailer of their film.
``People saw it, and they didn't know what to make of it,'' Bindler
said.
</P>
<P>
   So Bindler went back to Longview and moved in with his parents
to try to edit the movie. In Longview, he borrowed an old editing
machine in the back room of a church. When that broke down, he
bartered to get the use of another machine at night, and finished
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The only real Hollywood help the filmmakers received was at the
end of the project, when they needed money to transfer the edited
video to film in order to enter film festivals. It was at this
point that Longview's most prominent native son, actor Matthew
McConaughey, a childhood friend of Bindler's, came through with a
check.
</P>
<P>
   Bindler said he had made little money so far from the movie. But
he spent what he has made to replace his worn-out car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what I got because it's too embarrassing,''
he said. ``Kind of a wimp car. I went to go buy a truck, is what I
did. But I couldn't find one for under $10,000 that was worth a
damn. I guess I should have known that, right?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is a whiff of bipartisanship in their
exasperation, at least, as the Republicans and Democrats of the
Senate impeachment court wend their way to their fifth week of
judgment, stolid as parents peppered endlessly at the wheel by the
waif-like plea of constituents: Are we there yet?
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the answer to that question was, well not yet, but
we'll finally be getting really close once we make a choice at this
fork in the road that points to either ``Findings of Fact'' or
``Censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators in both parties labored to polish comprehensible
sound-bites to explain this latest confusing fork in their trial
meanderings to cranky back-seat constituents who long ago gave up
counting brindled cows and other ballyhooed phenomena on their way
to the widely anticipated destination of Acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking it's Ground Hog Day,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, sympathizing with puzzled constituents. ``I feel like Bill
Murray,'' he said of the actor in the movie about endless
repetitions of predictable events. ``I just keep doing this over
and over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   In the corridor outside the Senate, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.,
struggled with the problem of explaining to the people why
Democrats prefer condemning the president's misbehavior by
legislative censure after the trial, while Republicans hope to vote
a finding of facts to condemn him as a court during the trial
despite the expected acquittal. ``It's tough to explain to the
American people why we're even in trial, let alone why we're
considering `findings of fact,' '' he said somewhat dispiritedly.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were similarly caught up in the need to explain such
arcane disputes within a trying ordeal to constituents impatient
for a plain ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an overwhelming feeling of sadness that we've got
ourselves in this mess,'' said Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt.,
striking a bipartisan note of melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as the last deposition witness emerged from the
security-tight testimony room in the Capitol attic, some senators
sampled the two earlier videotaped depositions. But most gravitated
to separate party caucuses intent on seeking workable if not
elegant endgame strategems. The trial was in recess until Thursday.
The corridor crossfire was muted, with ``cockamamie'' the most
interesting partisan epithet of the day, used by a smiling
Democrat, then a mildly amused Republican in rebuttal, as they
paused at the trial fork to either Censure or Findings of Fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of hearing myself answering questions,'' Sen. John
B. Breaux, D-La., said apologetically after delivering a riff of
anti-Republican sound bites on the issue. ``I can't make them sound
different, more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   He let out a low yowling sound in the corridor when asked if he
sensed some tedium in the trial. ``Aaargh! A sense of weariness, a
sense of exhaustion!'' he corrected as he offered a crazed grin in
moving on.
</P>
<P>
   There was naked delight from some Democrats that the Republican
majority must gingerly try to manage an end to the trial that
serves history, soothes the zealous Republican prosecutors, and
entices enough Democrats aboard to seem a bipartisan deliverance to
the public. ``They must reach across the aisle,'' said Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., straight-faced as a cat waiting outside a
mousehole. ``This is more of us trying to save them from
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   One genuine bipartisan note was general agreement in the
corridors that Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., had bombed Tuesday
night in attempting political humor at a showcase dinner of
Congress and the news media. Republicans sat steaming as he tried
to needle them with a bludgeon. But on Wednesday Schumer seemed
invincible as ever as he estimated the chances of the trial ending
on some sort of a bipartisan note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been almost a Cassandra saying in the caucus that this
always unravels out of control,'' said the freshman senator who
fought in the House impeachment trenches last year. ``Now, I'm more
optimistic than I've ever been that this could end by the 12th,''
he said of the Senate's target date for deciding whether to remove
President Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   For that schedule, the journey must move beyond what is being
called its ``bolt-of-lightning'' phase, by which a fresh round of
witnesses or evidence could be sought, but only if the two party
leaders concurred. This seems unlikely, but only as unlikely as a
bolt of lightning hitting the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Before that juncture, there remains the turn to either Findings
of Fact or Censure, and the senators' continuing struggle to draw a
meaningful distinction between the two for constituents wondering
where the end is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't finding-of-fact, it's finding-of-fiction,'' Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy declared spur of the moment Wednesday morning in
dismissing the Republicans' preferred route to a small group of
news workers who cornered him by an elevator. The senator himself
brightened at the simple coinage he had just wrought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you say it around the corner at the television mikes?''
he was asked by a producer who thought the line had legs, at least
for a news cycle that needed fresh traction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said the senator, trying out the line one more time in
the corridor, then opening with it on camera as the impeachment
trial moved along.

ADMIRAL HAROLD SHEAR, 80, A LEADING SUBMARINER
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adm. Harold E. Shear, retired, a onetime vice chief of naval
operations and veteran submariner who helped build the nation's
undersea armada into a powerful nuclear force, died on Monday at
his home in Groton Long Point, Conn. He was 80 and, his family
said, had long been ill.
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years beginning in World War II, Shear sailed on
destroyer escorts and submarines. When the Patrick Henry, the
nation's second submarine equipped with Polaris ballistic missiles,
was commissioned at Groton in 1960, he was aboard as skipper.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower saluted him that year with a
personal ``well done'' after a successful test-firing off Rhode
Island, and by 1961 his boat and others of the fast-growing Polaris
class were within missile range off Russia to counter any Soviet
nuclear threat.
</P>
<P>
   Shear had first became a central player in the naval fleet's
missile buildup in the role of commander of Soviet submarine units
during a war game in 1956, when his ``enemy'' subs wiped out much
of the Strategic Air Command's bomber and land-based missile force.
His boldly conducted attack underscored the vulnerability of the
nation's defenses, and the conclusion, endorsed by Eisenhower, was
that missile-armed submarines could be an important weapon for the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Edson Shear was born in New York City and grew up on
Shelter Island, near Long Island's East End, an experience he never
forgot. Many years later, after retiring from the Navy, he was
instrumental in organizing Shelter Island's Mashomack Preserve,
covering 2,000 unspoiled acres bought by the Nature Conservancy in
1980. He was a leading member of the board of trustees, which last
year dedicated to him the overlook at Major's Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1941, the Armed
Forces Staff College in 1954 and the National War College in 1965.
In 1974, he received his fourth star, making him a full admiral,
from President Richard M. Nixon, who put him in command of American
naval forces in Europe. He then served a tour as vice chief of
naval operations, the Navy's second-highest-ranking officer, until
President Jimmy Carter chose him to be commander in chief of Allied
forces in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that post that he retired from the Navy, in 1980.
After a brief period in corporate life, he was chosen by President
Ronald Reagan to head the Maritime Administration in the Commerce
Department. He retired from that job in 1985 and, back in Groton,
helped develop the Submarine Force Library and Museum, home to the
Nautilus, the world's first atomic-powered submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Shear is survived by his wife of 56 years, Elizabeth Perry
Shear; a daughter, Kathleen Shear of Manhattan; a son, Kenneth E.
Shear of London; a stepbrother, Capt. Kenneth H. Payne Jr. of
Shelter Island, and a stepsister, Constance Payne Mattie of
Anderson, S.C.

 &HT;    Organization with close links to Gingrich did not violate tax
laws, IRS finds
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Washington-based think tank with close ties to
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich did not violate its tax-exempt
status by helping him finance a college course at two Georgia
schools, the Internal Revenue Service has concluded in an audit.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year investigation of the Progress and Freedom
Foundation was ``a close case'' because of Gingrich's involvement
in Renewing American Civilization, the college course he taught at
Kennesaw State University and Reinhardt College, according to the
IRS' audit letter, formally known as a technical advice memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency eventually concluded that the foundation ``did
not serve the private interests of Mr. Gingrich, GOPAC (his
one-time political organization), and Republican entities.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax-exempt charitable organizations like Progress and Freedom
may not take part in partisan political activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about as utter, complete and comprehensive a vindication
as I could hope for,'' said Jeffrey Eisenach, the foundation's
president and a longtime Gingrich adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation made a copy of the audit letter available
Wednesday via the Internet. IRS spokesman Dan Roberts would not
confirm or deny the existence of the audit or its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts said that a technical advice memorandum is issued by
IRS headquarters when an auditor in a field office requests an
``authoritative interpretation'' of tax law.
</P>
<P>
   The audit resulted from a 14-month House ethics committee
investigation of the links between the college course and GOPAC.
</P>
<P>
   James Cole, the special counsel appointed to direct the
investigation, concluded that Gingrich's use of charitable
organizations to finance his political activities violated federal
tax law.
</P>
<P>
   Cole concluded that donors who wanted to support GOPAC made
charitable contributions to ALOF, which then funneled the money to
GOPAC. In this way, the donors could claim tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics committee was less certain and referred Cole's
findings to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The committee determined that Gingrich had violated House ethics
rules for other reasons, and the House eventually imposed a
$300,000 sanction on the speaker and reprimanded him.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS apparently is continuing to investigate the Abraham
Lincoln Opportunity Foundation, another charitable organization
implicated by Cole. Howard ``Bo'' Calloway, the former Georgia
congressman and ALOF director, said he has not received a similar
clearance letter from the IRS.

GORE URGES CONGRESS TO LISTEN TO PUBLIC ON IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ It's time for Congress to take its cue from the
America public on the impeachment trial of President Clinton, Vice
President Al Gore said Wednesday during a trip to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to a new New York Times/CBS News poll showing an
impeachment-weary majority of Americans wants the trial to conclude
swiftly, and without the removal of the president, Gore issued one
of his strongest statements yet on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the country has long since come to the conclusion that
all of those in Washington who have been concentrating on partisan
political agendas should instead concentrate on the people's
business,'' the vice president said in an interview with the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I sense that we are nearing an end to the long
ordeal, and I certainly hope the Republican leadership in the
Congress will start listening to the desires of the American people
and shift their focus to what really matters most to the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked whether he thought the Senate should take any
disciplinary action at all against Clinton, Gore declined to
specify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to leave that for the Senate,'' Gore said. ``I have
had confidence they will end up doing the right thing, because in
my view none of the offenses that are alleged rise to the level of
offense justifying removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was clear, however, on those issues he
thought Congress should focus on rather than impeachment, including
making college more affordable the improving the quality of
education at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   And on a trip billed as official government business, but with
campaign themes, Gore took his own advice for much of the day,
engaging in detailed policy discussion while dancing delicately
around most political queries.
</P>
<P>
   He had little to say of the House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt's decision not to run for president, saying he wanted to
defer to Gephardt, who didn't make his plans official until later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gore did vow that he and Gephardt ``will work closely
together in whatever capacity to win back Democratic control of the
House of Representatives next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore supporters and aides were more optimistic, saying they
hoped to gain Gephardt's support and were confident that, at the
least, the minority leader would not support another candidate over
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   So far Gore has only one other rival for the Democratic
nomination: former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, who has formed
an exploratory presidential campaign committee. Wednesday, Gore
refused to speculate about a possible presidential candidacy by
Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry, who has long been mulling a
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is an extremely able public servant with an expansive
vision of this country's future,'' Gore said. ``Whatever decision
he makes, he will make a strong contribution to the future of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   He was similarly circumspect about Boston's chances of beating
Denver and Los Angeles in the competition to host the 2000
Democratic National Convention. Boston had ``made a wonderful and
strong bid,'' Gore said, but offered no further hints about which
city he favored or felt would be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   In his public events, Gore, making his 14th trip to New
Hampshire since 1994, repeatedly underscored how much the Granite
State economy has improved since the Clinton administration came to
office.
</P>
<P>
   A state that had been losing 10,000 jobs a year in 1992 is now
adding 12,000 each year, said Gore, who claimed New Hampshire now
has ``the highest concentration of high-tech jobs in the entire
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   That boom in high-tech jobs, with their demand for skilled
workers, is one reason why lifelong learning opportunities are so
important, Gore stressed in stops at New Hampshire Community
Technical College in Nashua and PC Connection, a skyrocketing
computer company in Merrimack.
</P>
<P>
   So do the issues the vice president touted in Wednesday's
tightly focused trip offer an intellectual framework for a Gore
2000 campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Aides said yes. But Gore was characteristically cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past is always prologue, so in that sense whatever we are
doing that is succesful in New Hampshire should be taken as a
framework for future progress in New Hampshire,'' he told the
Globe. ``But I don't want to put it in a political context because
it is still 1999 and the election is in 2000.''

GOODYEAR AND SUMITOMO PLAN HUGE JOINT VENTURE

 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. and Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd.
said Wednesday they would combine many of their plants and sales
operations into a huge joint venture with annual sales of about
$15.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, which will be the controlling partner, will pay
Sumitomo about $936 million for the assets it contributes. And, the
two companies will swap about $110 million in stock, giving
Goodyear 10 percent of Sumitomo, and giving Sumitomo a 1.4 percent
stake in Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which had been expected, gives Goodyear access to
Sumitomo's Dunlop brand and a toehold in Japan. It also catapults
Goodyear to the No. 1 spot in the world tire market in terms of
sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal is eliciting big yawns from Michelin Group of
France and Bridgestone Corp. of Japan, the two companies the new
venture will jump over. Executives at those companies noted that
Goodyear and Sumitomo have cooperated in manufacturing and sales
ventures for two years now. And, with the consolidation in the tire
industry, it was only a question of what order the smaller players
like Sumitomo, Continental General and Perelli would get snapped
up, not whether any of them would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was predictable and logical, and it doesn't change the
balance of power at all,'' said Etienne Mercier, a spokesman for
Michelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not adding capacity, they're changing the name on the
door,'' said John Lampe, the president of Bridgestone's U.S. unit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the joint venture may not change the competitive
landscape much in the short term. Sumitomo ranks fifth in worldwide
tire sales. Bridgestone, Michelin and Goodyear together command
more than half of worldwide tire sales, but they have always been
within a percentage point or two of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear is the dominant player in the United States, and
attaining 75 percent ownership of Sumitomo's U.S. plants will not
change that. In Europe, where Sumitomo and Goodyear each do about
$2 billion in annual tire sales, the venture will push past
Bridgestone in share, but Michelin still reins supreme.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, though, a bigger, more powerful Goodyear may
have a larger impact. Despite the careful use of words like joint
ventures, Goodyear has in fact acquired controlling interest in
Sumitomo's operations in Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   For now, both companies' plants are operating at capacity. But
Goodyear has more advanced manufacturing technology. Goodyear chief
executive Samir Gibara said Goodyear could use its technology to
increase Sumitomo's production by a third, without adding capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Bozarth, executive director of the International Tire &AMP;
Rubber Association, noted that Goodyear could well use that
capacity to make truck tires, which are in short supply. Goodyear
could also help turn Dunlop, a big seller in Japan, into a
powerhouse brand in North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of cost-cutting is also expected. The joint venture will
likely close the oldest plants, executives said. And Goodyear and
Sumitomo said they would realize as much as $360 million in savings
from combining their purchases and eliminating duplicate functions.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Goodyear's role is smaller and more subtle. Sumitomo
is the controlling partner there and is holding onto its own
manufacturing plants, though Goodyear said they would eventually
incorporate its advanced tire-making technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But the venture gives Goodyear inexpensive access to a market
that it has had little luck penetrating. ``The only way to compete
against Bridgestone in Japan is through Sumitomo,'' Gibara said.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact on Goodyear shareholders is still to be seen.
The deal involves a combination of taxable and tax-free events
around the world, and Goodyear's lawyers are ``working to see how
to best minimize the tax implications for shareholders,'' a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Goodyear, which ended 1998 with about $2 billion in debt
and a debt-to-equity ratio of about 30 percent, will have to borrow
heavily to come up with the $936 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goodyear's investors seemed pleased with the move. Shares
of Goodyear, which is based in Akron, Ohio, rose $1.625, to $52,
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear reported its fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday; the
posting of 78 cents a share met analyst expectations, when one-time
gains of about 4 cents a share were factored out.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear earned $121.5 million, or 78 cents per share, in the
final three months of 1998, compared with $2 million, or 1 cent per
share, a year earlier. Sales fell to $3.2 billion from $3.3 billion
a year ago.

BORK AND HATCH CLASH OVER IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Robert Bork, the one-time Supreme Court nominee
whose prickly, conservative pronouncements have made him a beacon
for right-leaning politicians and jurists, finds himself in an odd
position of late, but not unhappily so.
</P>
<P>
   Bork disagrees with one of his strongest supporters and
ideological soulmates, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on how the
impeachment trial of President Clinton should be handled. In so
doing, Bork has aligned himself, for the moment at least, with some
of the president's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said this week that he and some fellow Republicans would
like to see a bifurcated vote in the Senate _ that is, one vote
declaring that Clinton gave false and misleading testimony and
hampered the search for truth about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, and a separate vote adjourning the Senate trial without a
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, Hatch argued in an Op-Ed column on Tuesday in The
New York Times, Clinton would be denied the acquittal he seems
certain to win in the Senate. Furthermore, Hatch said, ``The
House's vote to impeach President Clinton will stand as a rebuke
forever, and the search for truth will have trumped political
expediency.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Bork said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orrin Hatch is a friend of mine, so I don't want to sound too
harsh,'' Bork, a former solicitor general and federal appeals court
judge said in an interview, good-naturedly describing the senator's
idea as constitutionally dubious and unsatisfyingly ambiguous,
assertions he made on Monday in an Op-Ed column in The Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, now chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was one
of the strongest backers of Bork during his unsuccessful fight for
confirmation to the Supreme Court in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding for a moment like the Clinton supporter he definitely
is not, Bork said Hatch and his Republican colleagues ``ought to
face up to the fact that they're going to lose.'' Although
Republicans have a 55-45 advantage in the Senate, no one has
suggested that Clinton's foes can muster the 67 votes needed to
convict and remove him.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican Senate aide said Wednesday that Hatch still felt
strongly that an acquittal of Clinton, in the face of convincing
evidence that he committed perjury and obstructed justice, would
set a bad precedent for history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one right answer,'' said the aide, who is close to
Hatch and commented on condition of anonymity. ``You could count
the number of impeachment experts and scholars on the fingers of
one hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bork argued further, both in an interview and in an Op-Ed column
Wednesday in The New York Times, that indicting a president while
he is in office would probably be unconstitutional and that
bringing him to trial surely would.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the founding fathers, Bork said. Having spelled out the
duties and powers of the president and the sole method for his
removal (impeachment and conviction), would they want to see a
president brought down by 12 people on a jury?
</P>
<P>
   Another outspoken conservative, William Kristol, editor of The
Weekly Standard, said he agreed with Bork, and that he could stand
the thought of Clinton's being acquitted. ``The judgment of history
is left open,'' Kristol said. ``I want to have that argument over
the next few years.''

<P>
   Minority entrepreneurs have difficulty obtaining bank credit to
start or expand their businesses even when annual revenues exceed
$1 million and the firms have been operating for a minimum of three
years, according to a study scheduled for release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared by the Organization for a New Equality, the study of
200 minority firms in cities around the country contends that
access to capital remains a serious problem for an estimated 3.7
million minority firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``ONE's analysis reveals that even viable businesses owned by
minority entrepreneurs have difficulty obtaining the financing they
need to grow,'' said the Rev. Joseph E. Washington, ONE chairman
and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The survey indicated 89 percent of the companies had applied for
a particular bank credit product or program, but fewer than half,
or 43 percent, received it. Fifty-seven percent were turned down.
ONE also found fewer than half of the credit applications submitted
by companies with yearly revenues of more than $1 million were
approved.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 26.5 percent of the companies surveyed had annual
revenues of more than $1 million, and 22 percent had more than 20
employees.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal statistics, 51 percent of all white
business owners are approved for credit, compared with 41 percent
of all minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, of 116 businesses in the ONE study whose first credit
applications were denied, 65 applied for bank credit a second time,
but only 8 percent were approved on the second try. Fifty percent
of the companies turned down a second time reapplied three or more
times. Of those, 20 percent eventually received credit. ONE
suggests these business owners had not received information that
would have improved their chances of getting a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said minority firms often turn to alternative sources
of funding because they have difficulty gaining access to bank
loans. Of the 200 companies surveyed, for example, 69 percent
applied for alternative methods of funding and paid interest rates
that were, on average, 59 percent higher than rates paid for bank
credit.

TROUBLE AHEAD FOR CARDOSO AS DEPUTIES SWITCH PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ A raft of newly elected members of Congress
switched parties just before taking office here this week, in a
move that appears to signal a more fractious second term for
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso as he forges ahead with
unfinished changes.
</P>
<P>
   Some deputies, belonging to the evangelical Christian movement,
dropped the powerful conservative party that had delivered the
votes for their elections, joining a smaller party in which they
could hold more sway. They promised a more critical stance toward
Cardoso's proposals for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's against the people and against the nation, we're going
to fight head on,'' vowed Marcos Jesus, who as with many candidates
who ran on evangelical platforms, switched from the small Liberal
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Several legislators from Minas Gerais dropped Cardoso's party
for the party of Gov. Itamar Franco of Minas Gerais. Franco is in
the middle of a battle of nerves with Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
   Franco declared a moratorium on his state's debt to the federal
government, shattering Brazil's already fragile credibility in
world markets and unleashing the latest round of economic
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso is waging an all-out campaign to return the faltering
economy on course, bolstered by a $41.5 billion standby loan from
the United States, the group of seven industrialized nations, the
International Monetary Fund and other lending agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Having experienced 39 percent annual interest rates,
unemployment at a 15-year high and soaring, and a currency that has
been devalued more than 30 percent in the last month, Cardoso's
popularity has fallen to an all-time low, with 27 percent of 2,000
Brazilians questioned in a survey saying they supported him.
</P>
<P>
   The first deputy managing director of the IMF, Stanley Fischer,
postponed his return to the United States Wednesday night. Fischer,
along with technical and negotiating teams from the fund, have been
combing through accounts and reworking the targets and conditions
for aid.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is eager to speed delivery of the second part of $9
billion in aid.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cardoso's six-party coalition enjoys a comfortable
majority of about 380 among the 513 deputies in the House, some
important parties in the coalition have disparate factions.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian Democratic Movement Party of Franco, for example,
is split between those who support him and those who back Cardoso.
Because of defections this week, Franco's party swelled, from 83 to
95 seats, the total that Cardoso's party has in the lower chamber.
Franco is widely seen as a highly likely presidential contender
four years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cardoso's party shows signs that the ready Congressional
support for most of his proposals would not last into his next
term. Aecio Neves, leader of Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy
Party in the House, told a newspaper that the party ``had to act
with more liberty, without making so many concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Carlos Rodrigues of Rio de Janeiro, another member of the
evangelical block, dropped the government-allied conservative party
that helped him win office in October to switch to an opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Rodrigues criticized the government for raising taxes,
saying spending had to be cut. But he said laying off public
workers and cutting pension benefits were not the answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't solve anything,'' the bishop said. ``It's only a
palliative.''
</P>
<P>
   To balance its books, he added, the government ought to simplify
taxes to reduce opportunities for evasion and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Rodrigues said he switched parties because of a Cardoso
administration plan to push for laws that would require members of
Congress to vote along party lines, removing their independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wants party loyalty not for political reasons,
but to put a muzzle on the deputies, and I won't accept that,''
Bishop Rodrigues said. ``For that, you don't even need to be here.
You could just sit in your house and have the party leader vote for
you. Why even be a deputy at all?''
</P>
<P>
   The administration sees a law on party loyalty as a way to cut
down on pork barrel projects and other concessions that each
victory in Congress demands

MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH CHIEF WANTS REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRIC
EXPERIMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PHILLIP HILTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief of the nation's mental health research agency says he
will propose the establishment of a new federal committee to review
all human experiments in psychiatry that might be considered ``high
risk'' for the subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the National Institute of
Mental Health, says he plans to announce the proposal Thursday at a
meeting of the NIMH Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman's proposal is an attempt to walk a narrow line between
factions in the rancorous debate that has split research
psychiatry. Some scientists say that the idea of a review committee
is long overdue while others argue that it could snarl research in
more red tape and bureaucracy. Meanwhile, patient advocates suggest
that it is too small a step.
</P>
<P>
   The debate centers on the subject of whether, when and how
experiments that offer no hope of treatment benefits to the
experiment's subjects should be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   NIMH funds more than $470 million worth of studies annually,
including more than 1,700 grants for clinical studies carried out
at universities, medical centers and clinics around the nation.
NIMH is one of the federal research institutes that make up the
National Institutes of Health, and other institutes have already
cut back their internal research as well, and shifting the funds to
pay for more grants.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past eight years, patient advocates have charged
researchers with ethics abuses in studies that were done at both
the NIMH headquarters and in universities and clinics around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have been criticized for ethical lapses, and
government agencies have found federal ethics violations in a few
of the cases, including two at major universities.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman recently suspended a number of studies carried out at NIMH
headquarters itself, after an internal review indicated scientific
or ethical problems. Of the 108 in-house clinical studies, 29 were
suspended and more than 50 others were ordered changed in some way.
</P>
<P>
   In the most typical cases, the patients have been taken off
their medicines while scientists observe their return of psychotic
symptoms. The risk for patients in such studies is in dispute, but
may include suffering extra bouts of symptoms briefly, to permanent
deterioration of the patients' mental state. At least four
instances in which such subjects have committed suicide have been
reported in the press in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In the riskiest subset of the cases, patients have not only been
taken off of their medicines, but have also been given drugs to
intentionally provoke psychotic symptoms while the scientists
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that too often patients are not clearly told and do
not understand that when they enter such an experiment, the study
offers them no hope of benefit or treatment, and at the same time
subjects them to serious risks.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the research say that while some experiments may
not be up to ethical standards, the great majority are. As for the
subjects, the defenders say the suffering caused in the experiments
is probably not permanent, and the brief suffering is necessary to
help learn how to best treat illness.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said he is taking steps to assure that the riskiest of the
human experiments are scrutinized more closely. Although the number
of such experiments is not known, it is likely to be in the range
of a few dozen or fewer experiments per year, researchers estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal, experiments in which mental patients with
the most serious disorders are taken off their medication, and
those experiments in which drugs are used to provoke illness, will
be reviewed by a committee of eight to ten scientists and patient
advocates just before final approval of the each grant.
</P>
<P>
   The group will review each study to determine whether the study
includes proper plans to get informed consent from patients, as
well as plans to closely follow patients in case trouble should
arise.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Klein, a professor at Columbia University and
researcher at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, said he
thought the proposal was ``jumping the gun. As far as I know, the
studies going on out there have had no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there should be very firm evidence of a systematic
problem before establishing a new bureaucratic organization. ``What
we need is a study, to find out whether there is a problem, not
another bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of Psychiatry at the University of
Pittsburgh, one of the largest psychiatric research centers in the
nation, and former president of the American College of
Neuropharmacology, said he thought the proposal is a reasonable
step forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned so much, are so much farther along, we can
afford to standards a little bit higher. We do not have to do as
many fishing expeditions as we did 25 years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Klein worried that science would be slowed and some
experiments prohibited, Kupfer disagreed. ``I don't think this will
stop any good things from happening and it need not lead to more
bureaucracy,'' Kupfer said.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Hassner Sharav, head of the New York-based activist group
called Citizens for Responsible Care in Psychiatry and Research,
said of Hyman's actions, ``What he is doing is a start.''She called
for further investigation of the issue. ``What we need is an
independent investigation of all risky human experiments funded by
NIMH across the country,'' she said. ``We believe thousands of
patients are being harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said ``we must keep the public's trust that we are doing
the right thing. If there are deficiencies we need to care of them
ahead of time, not wait till they become horror stories.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new panel review was simply a proposal to reaffirm
faith in methods while moving ahead with the research.

IN A CITY OF FROZEN DUSK, GALLERIES AND THEATERS ARE TRUE
LIFESAVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRBANKS, Alaska _ The ice was too cold. When the temperature
sank under 30 degrees below zero here last week and bottomed out at
47 below zero through the weekend, an icy fog swaddled this city in
a glowing soup. And the local sculptors who have dotted the city
with angels and polar bears and other crystalline icons had to put
away their sanders and their chisels and the water _ ``Arctic
superglue'' in local parlance _ they use to fuse ice limbs to ice
torsos and to make repairs.
</P>
<P>
   It was cold even for Fairbanks, where residents routinely use
the frozen Chena River for a road; cold enough for a cup of coffee
tossed in the air to freeze before the droplets hit the snow; cold
enough for automobile tires to square against the ground, and cold
enough for heating oil to begin thickening. At such temperatures,
blocks of ice simply become too brittle and prone to shatter for
the delicate shaving and whittling that a sculptor's work requires.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kathleen Carlo-Kendall gave it a shot. With Anita Tabor,
a wood sculptor who moved here from Arkansas 13 years ago, Ms.
Carlo-Kendall, an Athabascan Indian and mask maker, spent an hour
or so on Saturday in front of the Westmark Hotel downtown, working
on two large native-style masks, one traditional, one contemporary.
They did not make much progress, but it was a good workout; the two
women are half of the first all-female team to enter the
International Ice Art Championships (``Frigid Women,'' they
jokingly call themselves) held here each March.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a good excuse to battle the cabin fever that many
people say is a winter burden, brought on more by lingering
darkness than by the cold. There are but seven hours of dim
sunlight a day right now, up from little more than three hours at
the winter solstice six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get out of the house,'' Ms. Carlo-Kendall said.
``I haven't been out in three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The arts have a tough row to hoe in this part of the world, a
place where man's creations pale beside Mother Nature's, and
particularly at this time of year when the world is dark, and for
many, the spirit is, too. Yet there may be no other place in the
country where the arts serve such a practical function as they do
in this surprisingly diverse (ethnically and artistically),
brutally winterbound and isolated environment.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this not a pretty town _ the blocky, economical
architecture is often lamented, with good reason, by the locals _
Fairbanks manifests a persistent and enduring interest in the arts.
They not only bring people out into the cold and cheer the bleak
landscape, but they are cited by many here, not outlandishly, as a
reason to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suicide during this time of year runs a little high, and the
arts have been a comforter,'' said Mayor James Hayes. ``They play
an integral role in this city. Without them, I don't know what we'd
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The state, with its notorious small-government bias, has cut
back on arts subsidies in recent years; its support to the
Fairbanks Arts Association diminished to just $11,000 this year
from more than $65,000 in the early '90s. But the political isn't
personal, says June Rogers, the executive director of the
association, who notes that many of the budget-slashing legislators
contribute generously to the arts from their own pockets. The city
supports the arts with a hotel bed tax; its contribution to the
association this year was $77,000, 90 percent of which was
channeled to local nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks maintains two dance companies, two art galleries, two
community theaters (one performs original work, the other
Shakespeare), a chorale and a light opera company that often sells
out a 1,400-seat hall.
</P>
<P>
   The city also has an ambitious amateur symphony whose
co-principal violinist also plays the tuba. On Saturday night the
symphony's Arctic Chamber Orchestra lured about 300 people out in
30-degrees-below-zero weather for a program that included Bartok's
difficult ``Divertimento for Strings'' and the world premiere of
``Sculptured Memories,'' a dissonant tone poem by Gregory Mertl,
29, of Rochester, his first commissioned work.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks has a fair amount of public art, supported by a state
levy on builders of 1 percent of the cost of all new buildings. And
the city is rife with painters, musicians, writers and
photographers, as well as decorative weavers like Marnie Cornwall,
who specializes in the delicate wool of the qiviut, or Alaskan musk
ox; artists using natural materials (aside from ice) like Penny
Wakefield, who works in dried and painted fish skins, and
Athabascan skin sewers and beadworkers like Dixie Alexander, whose
variations on tribal clothing are in the collections of the
Smithsonian Institution and other museums in ``the lower 48.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a gem of a museum here, on the main campus of the
University of Alaska, tiny and crammed with the natural history of
the state, along with native artifacts and art objects ranging from
1,500-year-old Eskimo carvings of wood and ivory to contemporary
paintings. The university is a focus for the regeneration of native
arts, whose connection to tribal life had long been attenuated by
the encroachment of modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alexander (who also runs an annual fiddling festival where
Athabascan elders gather to play the twangy, countrified music
brought here by Scottish and French-Canadian traders in the 19th
century) spends part of the year in villages around the state,
reintroducing the traditional art forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people still have their elders sewing for them,'' she
said. ``What happened to the younger generation? The Alaska Cable
Network. Computers. Snowmobiles.'' She added, ``We get a lot of our
funding from suicide prevention groups.''

PADRES DEAL VAUGHN, SWEENEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ So Greg Vaughn and his 50 homers have relocated from
San Diego to Cincinnati. So why didn't the Red Sox, desperately in
need of power after the loss of Mo Vaughn, come up with an offer to
bring Mo's cousin to Fenway Park?
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the way the ball bounces in baseball these
days. Economic considerations more often than not outweigh
outstanding individual numbers as well as common sense.
</P>
<P>
   In helping the Padres to the World Series, Greg Vaughn posted
career highs in home runs and runs batted in (119). He had a great
season. But it produced mixed results. And cost-conscious San
Diego, in the process of overhauling its roster and payroll,
wondered whether it could afford him after 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So Vaughn's immediate reward was to be traded Tuesday along with
first baseman-outfielder Mark Sweeney to Cincinnati in a
five-player deal that sent outfielder Reggie Sanders, infielder
Damian Harris, and minor league righthander Josh Harris to the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn might have joined the Red Sox if the price had been
right. Instead, Boston was apparently one of four teams that put in
bids and didn't get him. Boston, Arizona, and Anaheim didn't offer
the help in specific areas the Padres were seeking. Toronto offered
prospects and never really was in the running.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, according to sources, initially offered veteran
infielders John Valentin and Tim Naehring. The Padres weren't
interested and Boston since has let Naehring go. Recently, the Sox
tried to sweeten the offer by including some prospects but were
again rejected. Several Red Sox regulars have multiyear contracts
which San Diego apparently wasn't eager to assume.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been the irony of the offseason if Boston had
wound up with one Vaughn to replace another. The price was right,
at least from a contract perspective. Greg Vaughn, 33, will make
$5.75 million in 1999, then become a free agent. Mo Vaughn joined
the Angels for a six-year, $80 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also turned down the Diamondbacks, who offered
lefthanded pitcher Brian Anderson (12-13, 4.33 ERA) and outfielder
Bernard Gilkey (.233, 5 HRs, 33 RBIs), and the Angels, who dangled
outfielder Jim Edmonds (.307, 25 HRs, 91 RBIs) along with a couple
of prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best offer we had,'' said Padres general manager
Kevin Towers Wednesday when asked why he chose the Reds package.
``It was certainly better than Arizona. I'm not as worried about
the rotation as I am about defense, speed, and scoring runs.''
</P>
<P>
   So why a trade?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the makeup of this team reminds me of the 1996 team
that won the division,'' said Towers at a press conference
following the announcement of the deal. ``That team had pitching,
speed, and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes he got that with the addition of Sanders and
Jackson. So, Towers reasoned, he could part with Vaughn, who joins
an exodus of headliners who have left San Diego since the Padres
lost the World Series to the New York Yankees _ pitchers Kevin
Brown and Joey Hamilton, third baseman Ken Caminiti, and outfielder
Steve Finley, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he hits 50 home runs again, Greg Vaughn won't get the
kind of free agent deal cousin Mo did. And his stay in Cincinnati
may be short-lived, especially if the Reds are lagging around the
All-Star break and other contenders come calling.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call, Vaughn said, ``I have some friends who
said, `Don't unpack.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the rejected suitors will have another crack at him
after all.

FAIRBANKS: prevention groups.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On campus there are signs of renewal. Alvin Amanson, who directs
the native arts program at the university, is an Aleut painter from
Kodiak known for modern expressionist portraits of Alaskan
wildlife. (De Kooning is his acknowledged influence.)
</P>
<P>
   He has been encouraged, he said, by the skill of his young
students, who are beginning to meld the rhythms and skills of their
villages with contemporary imagery. One young woodcarver, he said,
a Yupik from southeastern Alaska, dazzled him with the masks he
made for a university dance troupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one was of Bart Simpson,'' he said, laughing
uproariously.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in a broad valley cut by the Tanana River, between the
towering Alaska Range to the south and the Brooks Range to the
north, Fairbanks is home to 31,000 people, with another 50,000 in
the surrounding North Star Borough. It is a small place, but it is
nonetheless the state's second-largest city (behind Anchorage, 400
miles south), and the only urban center serving Alaska's interior,
a region the size of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place that must be all things to many people. ``We've
got more variety of arts per capita than most places our size,''
said Matt Reckard, a retired civil engineer and part-time actor.
``But I don't know that that makes us an arts town. We've got more
car dealerships than you'd expect, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1902, Fairbanks has been an important mining center
through most of the century. In recent decades, however, its
population and urbanity have been augmented by the presence of Air
Force and Army bases and the growth of the state university, whose
main campus serves 9,000 students. Construction of the Alaska
pipeline brought thousands of laborers in the 1970s; many stayed on
after the wild times of the period settled down.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the outdoors attracted individualists from all over
the United States, many of whom decided that the glories of summer
(not only hiking and rafting and midnight softball but a two-week
summer arts festival) were worth enduring the hostile winters.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoors is alluring to artists as well, of course. They
include both lifelong Alaskans like Lisa Rogers, a self-taught
painter, sculptor and crafts artist whose work includes imagery
from her years of a subsistence life style in Lime Village, a
remote northern town with a population of 40; and others, like
David Mollett, a landscape painter who was born in Oregon but has
lived most of his life here.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a landscape painter it's nice that nobody's painted it
much,'' said Mollett, who has lived and exhibited in New York and
Paris. He was among the very first painters to venture into the
Brooks Range. In his studio, he keeps a canvas that was shredded by
a bear on one of his sojourns there.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all these influences, the population of Fairbanks
is idiosyncratic and tends to be self-selecting. By their own
assessment, the city's residents tend to be curious people and
readers, even though Alaska is, in the words of Greg Hill, the
director of the local library, ``book poor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the libraries in the state put together don't have the
volumes they have at the University of Washington,'' Hill said.
``But Alaska has 10 percent higher usage rate than the rest of the
country, and Fairbanks has a 10 percent higher rate than the rest
of Alaska. We have our kooks and cranks, but they tend to be
intelligent here.''
</P>
<P>
   The population is also increasingly diverse. This is a city
whose best restaurant is arguably a Thai luncheonette, and where
last week at the Arctic Bar, a local watering hole, Marc Brown, an
Athabascan guitarist, introduced the members of his band, the Blues
Crew, by saying, ``You probably won't see another blues band with
an Indian, an Eskimo, a black guy and a white guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And although country music is prevalent in most of the
roadhouses, there are places that occasionally feature Celtic
music, jazz and even rap. Fifteen percent of Fairbanks residents
are black, including Hayes, who is also the pastor at the Lily of
the Valley Church of God in Christ, one of several black churches
in the city that nurture a tradition of gospel singing. On Sunday
morning the church choir, 20 strong, accompanied by an organist and
drummer and singing in a distinctively pop style, stirred a full
house of congregants to the extent that the ushers were passing out
fans, making it the only overheated place in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The arts are warm, but in Fairbanks in winter, maybe a lonely
flame. Drive a short way out of town, and the snowfields and
snow-sugared black spruce seem to stretch on forever, an endless
abstract in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at all this grayness, and I think about depression and
loneliness and all the things grayness can contribute to,'' said
Ms. Rogers of the arts association. ``But you know, it is
beautiful. I don't find it depressing. And I think that's what art
can do for people here, give them another way to look at things.''

CELEBRATING GRAHAM IN WORDS AND ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The gala opening of the Martha Graham Dance Company's
three-week season at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night was strong
on the stark and the spare. With one exception, all the dances were
choreographed by Graham in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   If the evening did not offer a complete picture of Graham's
theatrical range, her radical vision of an ecstatic theater could
be seen in the company's performance of her 1931 masterpiece
``Primitive Mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, no dance was like another, even within this
selective sampling. Graham, who died in 1991, divulged a secret
when she was heard suddenly on tape at the beginning of the
performance: ``I take the puppet, which is myself, and I fling him
against the sky.'' In this extravagant and perfect metaphor for the
unbridled creative act, Graham defined herself. Certainly she went
her own way, as a group of well known former Graham students
reminded us in their onstage remarks. The choreographer Twyla Tharp
led the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who am I to introduce Martha Graham?'' she asked, adding that
Graham's works required no validation. She wished, she said, to
address Graham as a teacher, as a creator of a dance technique and
as a woman. ``Without these my career would be severely less than
what it is,'' Ms. Tharp said, and asked for 15 seconds of silence
``to give the stage back to Martha and for what Martha Graham, her
works and her company mean to all of dance worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tharp thanked all for their support, which includes a
$110,000 grant that Schuyler G. Chapin, the New York City cultural
affairs commissioner, said would be made to the Graham
organization. Speaking before the performance, Chapin said the
grant, from the mayor's office and the City Council, was part of
``continuing city support of this extraordinary organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Graham legacy was extolled with conviction by Pearl Lang, a
luminous dancer in the troupe's earlier days, and with a mix of
seriousness and humor by three actors who studied with Graham at
the Neighborhood Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Randall's dry wit reached back to his first day at the
playhouse school in 1938 when he met ``a boy'' who became his best
friend, Eli Wallach. ``This is a week of high culture for me,''
Randall said. ``Sunday I was at the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallach and his wife, Anne Jackson, joined Randall in
reminiscences about Graham's courses. Wallach said that Graham,
exasperated with the way he walked across the stage one day,
exclaimed, ``Eli, for God's sake, walk as if you carry the seed.''
Wallach lifted his chest and walked across the stage at the Joyce.
 &UR;  &LR; Graham is at her purest in ``Primitive Mysteries,'' inspired by
Spanish-Indian ceremonies she saw in the Southwest. The ceremony
onstage is nonetheless not a literal ritual but a highly abstract
rendering of an image: a community celebrates the Virgin by
celebrating the coming of age of a young girl.
</P>
<P>
   As the Madonna figure, Rika Okamoto, in Graham's famous white
dress, is surrounded by 13 women in blue who enter three times with
her in silence. Hands cupped to their hips, their bodies often held
in a contraction of the lower torso, the women step in, holding one
foot to ankle before placing it on the floor. This unison footfall
in the entrances and exits of each section creates an aura of
anticipation and suspense.
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin relives Jesus' passion. The deliberately flattened
style of Mexican altar sculpture is dominant. Steven Spielberg
chose Ms. Okamoto for the title role of a future film of Arthur
Golden's ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' and certainly she has no trouble
holding center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Horst's deceptively simple and dolorous score, played by
Alison Potter, Ariana Ghez and Alan Moverman with Alan Sherber
conducting, propels the drama onstage. In the first section, ``Hymn
to the Virgin,'' the central figure blesses the women who support
her in adoration. In ``Crucifixus,'' she cups her hands to her
cheeks, inching forward with two acolytes. When she attains her
religious vision, she throws her arms out in an ecstatic release,
which spreads to the women who circle like a band of furies.
</P>
<P>
   A slip to the floor by one dancer did not obviate the meticulous
detail that the ensemble, under Yuriko's coaching, incorporated
into the difficult movement. Graham did not distort for
distortion's sake but to express the essence of emotion, as visible
in the final ``Hosanna'' section.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's first principles of movement are based on the
contraction and release of the pelvis; the release is as important
as the first part, as the program's solos demonstrated. In
``Frontier'' (1935), Denise Vale, advancing three times from Isamu
Noguchi's fragment of a fence, exulted as an American pioneer
contemplating the future. ``Deep Song'' (1937), created during the
Spanish Civil War, had a spellbinding Christine Dakin as the
anguished wife in all wars. Her dancing was unusually tight, and
the final release in despair all the more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation was the young Fang Yi Sheu in the recent
reconstruction of ``Satyric Festival Song'' (1932). She captured
the spring and freshness of the Indian clowns who were Graham's
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The 1981 ``Ritual to the Sun,'' with a male and female ensemble,
has been danced more solidly in the past. But compelling is the
word for Terese Capucilli's agitator in red, seconded by Miki
Orihara, and a fabulously swift and forceful young female group in
``Prelude to Action'' (1936). The musical ensemble was completed by
Laura Koepke, Hiro Noguchi and Peter Wilson.

LONGHORNS SEEN IN BREAKTHROUGH RECRUITING EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call them exit polls. Not a slam-dunk predictor of how things
will turn out, but a pretty good indicator.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the pronouncements from recruiting services
around the country, the overwhelming winner in Wednesday's annual
national letter of intent signing day festivities was . . . the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting guru Tom Lemming, who has been charting the progress
of high school and prep football talent for 20 years, calls it a
breakthrough year for the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it's hard to argue. In only his second season,
coach Mack Brown landed the USA Today Offensive Player of the Year
(quarterback Chris Simms) and the USA Today Defensive Player of the
Year (linebacker Corey Redding).
</P>
<P>
   ``We only called 35 guys and we got 28 of them,'' said Brown as
he sweated out the final few hours of recruiting while the official
faxes and commitments came into the football offices in Austin. ``A
lot of guys said they wanted to go to Texas. That made it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or easier.
</P>
<P>
   In an enterprise that is considered a major crap shoot, just
like the NFL draft, Texas was the consensus No. 1. Following in
varying order were Notre Dame, Ohio State, UCLA, Texas A&AMP;M, Miami,
Alabama, and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In a banner year for the Big East, the conference had three
teams in the Top 25, topped by Miami, which harvested the talented
fields of south Florida for a new power base, followed by Syracuse
and, if you can believe it . . . Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   BC's ranking, according to the people who study such things, is
unusual. Rarely do teams with losing records climb into the Top 25
in recruiting. But this year California and LSU also fit that
description.
</P>
<P>
   BC made its hit by taking talented players out of New Jersey,
another fertile recruiting field. The biggest catch was running
back William Green from Absecon, projected as the successor to
All-American Mike Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was crucial because verbal commitments mean nothing
until the letter of intent is signed. The national champion
Volunteers learned that a few weeks ago when Simms switched from a
verbal at UT to a verbal at UT, which startled the people at
Tennessee and pleased the people at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols got singed again when running back Santonio Beard, a
6-foot, 185-pound prospect from Nashville, opted for Alabama
instead of the home state university.
</P>
<P>
   Another shocked and disconsolate suitor was Notre Dame, which
shored up its offensive line in anticipation of landing quarterback
C.J. Leak of Independence, N.C. Instead, Leak signed with Wake
Forest, a school he did not even visit officially.
</P>
<P>
   Such things are common. And so is a recruiting class labeled as
the best turning into something less than that.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to keep score, using a Top 100 consensus list of
high school prospects as a guide, Texas was the clear-cut winner
with eight such signings, while Texas A&AMP;M, Michigan, LSU, and UCLA
tied for second with five.
</P>
<P>
   All those schools have been mentioned constantly in the Top 20
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   BC, a newcomer in the ``also receiving votes'' list, would seem
to have hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's simple. All Eagle coach Tom O'Brien has to do is keep
them in school, keep them healthy, and hope they are as productive
as their reputations would seem to indicate.

NBA SEEKS TO SALVAGE A TARNISHED SEASON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's now up to Larry Bird's team and Shaquille O'Neal's smile.
Maybe Grant Hill's daring and Kobe Bryant's ``do'' can pick up the
slack. Karl Malone and John Stockton better have a few
pick-and-rolls left in them, too.
</P>
<P>
   The job of resurrecting the National Basketball Association's
image _ and of purging the taint of a destructive lockout from the
public's consciousness _ is no longer Michael Jordan's
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the league works to regain its identity,
Jordan will be busy planning a golf outing this June. The
retirement three weeks ago of the game's best player and premier
attraction not only ended the championship run of the Chicago
Bulls. It sent aftershocks through NBC and every luxury box,
producing a genuine feeling of trepidation about where the NBA goes
from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to sell basketball,'' said Lenny Wilkens, the Atlanta
coach who has won more games than any NBA coach. ``Michael was
great for our league, but the league will survive and it will
survive when all of us are gone. Whomever emerges as the torch
bearers, let them emerge on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens echoes the general perception among players, coaches and
league officials, who believe there is no one player waiting to
take Jordan's place. Instead, a handful of young stars and a return
to team rivalries are seen as important toward renewing fan
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The first gauge may be this unpredictable, seat-of-the-pants
season beginning Friday. Like a lot of desperate teams after the
lockout ended, it was thrown together in three weeks. Fifty games
will be played over 90 days, a grind that raises concern over
injuries and quality of play.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Jordan was kind enough to depart with a going-away
present: Twenty-eight other franchises now have a chance to win a
title, which only accelerates the healing process in runner-up
cities like Indianapolis and Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers and the Jazz, on talent and experience alone, seemed
headed for a finals showdown. Bird, in his second year, is relying
on the same core group _ Reggie Miller, Rik Smits and Mark Jackson
_ that came within a game of knocking off the Bulls last season.
The same goes for Jerry Sloan in Utah, where Malone and Stockton
are still shaking their heads over the last 40 seconds of Game 6,
when Jordan stole Utah's soul and led Chicago to its sixth title in
eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Since that summer night in Salt Lake City last June, the league
has undergone a striking transformation:
</P>
<P>
   _ Scottie Pippen left Chicago to team with Hakeem Olajuwon and
Charles Barkley in Houston to form a legends-in-their-own-time
frontline
</P>
<P>
   _ Latrell Sprewell went from a suspended, troubled Golden State
Warrior to a rejuvenated Knick, expected to help Patrick Ewing get
a championship ring before the 36-year-old center's knees crumble
to dust.
</P>
<P>
   _ Indicative of tough times, Dennis Rodman is still looking for
a job, although Miami, Orlando and the Lakers have shown interest.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere will the changes be more evident than on Friday night at
the Delta Center in Utah, where the where Jazz host the Bulls on
opening night in what hardly amounts to a rematch between last
season's conference champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael and Scottie aren't in those uniforms anymore,'' said
Tim Floyd, who takes over for Phil Jackson in Chicago and is one
seven new coaches along with Paul Westphal in Seattle and George
Karl in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd is not presiding over the defending champions as much as
he is figuring out how to stay out of the Central Division basement
along with Toronto. With Jordan, Pippen, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley
and Rodman gone, the forecast is grim in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper and Toni Kukoc are the only returning starters, and
Bill Wennington was the lone free agent offered a contract. Though
they acquired Brent Barry, the Bulls' banner days are far behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers seemed poised to take over. Yet with so many Eastern
Conference teams undergoing facelifts, parity might kill the
Indiana's chances of securing the best record in the league, and
thus, homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Save Ewing, the Knicks finally gave up on the old guard of
Charles Oakley and John Starks and wagered on the talent and
baggage of Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, who has yet to play a regular season game in 14 months
because of his suspension for choking P.J. Carlesimo in December of
1997, became the most controversial acquisition of the off-season.
Other than adding depth, Indiana and Miami decided to pass and let
the Knicks gamble on the three-time All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets were beset with preseason injuries to Kerry Kittles and
Rony Seikaly, but still have enough talent to contend for the
Atlantic Division title.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta still has its nucleus in tact, and the Hawks acquired
the former Nugget LaPhonso Ellis through free agency. Anfernee
Hardaway is finally healthy again in Orlando, where the Magic
acquired Isaac Austin and still remain in the hunt for Rodman.
Young legs in Cleveland give the Cavaliers hope. And now that
Washington has re-signed Rod Strickland, the Wizards appear
playoff-bound.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Out West the competition is not as keen. The Lakers, who are
still searching for a complement to O'Neal in the post (Rodman is
still a possibility), appear all grown up. But then, that's what
everyone said last year before the Jazz swept them away in the
conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, Seattle and San Antonio represent the only other great
threats to Utah's chances of a third straight trip to the finals.
So-so backcourts hurt the Spurs and Rockets, while the soft Sonics
are in desperate need of a rebounder with a nasty disposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are predicting Utah and Indiana because of
their experience and being there in the past, but I honestly think
Los Angeles, San Antonio and maybe Miami have as good a chance as
anybody,'' said Karl, who has resurfaced in Milwaukee after being
fired by Seattle. ``When May comes around I think we are going to
have at least one surprise hanging around in the playoffs and I
think it is going to be a toss-up more than a favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, there is mystery over who will win the title
again. And that in itself is almost as tantalizing as, well,
watching Jordan play.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the league pine for the days of Bird's Celtics and Magic
Johnson's Lakers, the last NBA team rivalry that captured the
country's imagination. The personality-driven league that has
emerged over the last decade make those halcyon times seem all but
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the pressure is on players like Hill,
Bryant, Tim Duncan, Keith Van Horn, Stephon Marbury, Kevin Garnett,
Allen Iverson and especially O'Neal to take the league into the
next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It is an arduous task. You not only have to lead your team to a
title, but you have smile wide for the cameras and be amenable to
the marketing possibilities. You not only have to perform mid-air
artistry with the basketball, you need to care enough about the
sport to work out during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we should drop the burden on them that they
have to carry the NBA because they don't,'' Wilkens said. ``People
forget when Michael came in his first couple of years, no one
dubbed him as a torch bearer, but he emerged into it, based on what
he did. I think we need to let Kobe and we need to let Grant mature
into those positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Commissioner David Stern, ``The challenge is each for them
to push their team to victory, that's the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   As to what kind of season to expect, no one is sure. For the
first time in 10 years, teams will occasionally be playing three
games on three consecutive nights _ a fact that eliminates many
practice sessions. Worse, players like Shawn Kemp ate too much in
the extended off-season. He is one of several players trying to
frantically shed pounds before the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Overweight All-Stars. Conditioning and chemistry kinks. And,
finally, no Jordan to bail out his team, the networks and,
basically, the league.
</P>
<P>
   Some new era.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do win a championship, I don't think anyone should put
an asterisk on the side and say it was not a full season and
Michael wasn't playing,'' Karl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a great opportunity for every team now to say,
`Michael's not in there now. It's wide open.' ``

FELICITY LOTT: OPERATIC ARTISTRY FROM A BRITISH SOPRANO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - MUSIC-REVIEW-NYT 
(ATTN: Great Britain)  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The British soprano Felicity Lott never has quite won
the visibility and renown in the United States that she has long
enjoyed in Europe. Her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1990, as the
Marschallin in Strauss' ``Rosenkavalier,'' under the conductor
Carlos Kleiber, was a remarkable achievement. Last fall she was a
vocally refined Countess in several performances of the Met's new
production of Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night with the New York Philharmonic, the third of
four performances of an all-Richard Strauss program that mark Ms.
Lott's debut with the orchestra, it was clearer than ever what a
superior artist she is and what American audiences have been
missing.
</P>
<P>
   With the conductor Andre Previn providing musically supple
support, Ms. Lott sang the final scenes of ``Arabella'' and
``Capriccio,'' two Strauss operas she has long been identified
with. Though she may not have a deluxe soprano sound, her voice is
attractive, warm and vibrant. But it's what she does with it that
makes her artistry special. Her singing here had arching lyricism,
technical finesse, musical grace and alive, idiomatic diction.
</P>
<P>
   In the floating high phrases of the Countess' soliloquy in
``Capriccio,'' her almost seamless breath control was a marvel. As
the worldly-beyond-her-years Arabella, she produced a fullness of
sound with seeming effortlessness, serving as a bit of a
chastisement to the talented young American bass-baritone Richard
Bernstein, who sang the few lines for Mandryka, Arabella's wealthy
suitor, in this final scene. Bernstein has a naturally robust
voice, but, perhaps trying to make an impact with not much to sing,
he pushed his voice ineffectively.
</P>
<P>
   It was an interesting idea to begin the program with the
introduction to ``Capriccio,'' a string sextet, played winningly by
six members of the orchestra. This led effectively to the next
work, Strauss' delicately scored, genial Duet-Concertino for
Clarinet and Bassoon, with String Orchestra, a late work composed
in 1948. Two principals from the orchestra, the clarinetist Stanley
Drucker and the bassoonist Judith LeClair, were the marvelous
soloists.
</P>
<P>
   The concert concluded with the orchestra suite from ``Der
Rosenkavalier,'' and for the first time in my experience, this work
did not seem just the composer's shameless concoction of the
opera's hit tunes thrown together to provide a moment-making
concert piece. Previn's spacious and unmannered performance made
the difference. There was no attempt to sell the work, to milk it;
the orchestra's playing was vital, but in a refreshingly relaxed
way.

ECONOMIC SCENE: HERE A SPOONFUL, THERE A SPOONFUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's budget includes dozens of new spending
programs. It also includes dozens of new tax credits and other
subsidies. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, mockingly declares ``the
era of big government is back'' three years after Clinton declared
it over.
</P>
<P>
   But charges of extravagance are unconvincing. Even if Congress
passed Clinton's entire plan, the relative size of the federal
government would continue to shrink, budget analysts point out.
Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal research organization, estimates that government spending,
while continuing to grow modestly in absolute dollars, will fall by
2004 to about 18.5 percent of total economic output. That level,
down from the current 19.7 percent, would be the lowest in 34
years.
</P>
<P>
   Nonmilitary discretionary spending _ the part of the budget that
excludes Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security but includes nearly
everything else outside the Pentagon, from the FBI to basic
research _ would fall by 2004 to 3.1 percent of economic output,
the lowest level in at least four decades. Besides, the fundamental
feature of this budget is its fiscal prudence; it uses trillions of
dollars of surplus revenue to drive down federal debt rather than
spend it immediately or give it away in across-the-board tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, simply because overall spending levels would hardly budge
does not mean that Clinton can so easily escape the serious charge
that his shotgun approach to spending and tax incentives is missing
the target. The proposed budget sprinkles new spending across a
huge array of programs, hardly missing a constituency or
congressional district. Rather than concentrate the scarce funds
and do a few things well, the administration has chosen to do
dozens of things on a small scale, in a way that amounts to
``budget patches,'' says C. Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposes to spend about $17 billion more next year on
discretionary programs than current budget rules anticipate. The
litter of initiatives is breathtaking: $600 million on community
learning centers and after-school programs here, $600 million for
states to help child-care programs there, $2 billion for states to
protect open spaces and water quality, $50 million to demolish
blighted buildings, and on and on with a host of undoubtedly worthy
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the initiatives, such as reinstating food-stamp
and Medicaid benefits to recent immigrants, are widely praised,
especially by Democrats. The National Science Foundation gets a
sizable boost, as does an effective tax credit for building housing
for low-income families. But Rudolph Penner of the Urban Institute
takes a look at the panoply of new spending program and asks,
``Where's the theme?''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bass of OMB Watch, a liberal advocacy group, would have
preferred that Clinton focus the $17 billion of extra spending on a
few programs aimed at the needy. Research shows that the most
effective way to prepare workers for the future is to educate them
when they are young. Clinton's administration understands this, and
his budget would put $600 million more into Head Start, the
effective preschool program, and other education and training
initiatives. But the investments fall far short of enrolling every
eligible child.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a budget that used the $17 billion to tackle two or
three pressing needs. For example, there are millions of families
qualifying for subsidized rental housing, but there are no vouchers
for them. The White House proposes to create another 100,000
vouchers, a large increase by historical standards but not nearly
enough to meet the need. Robert Reischauer, former director of the
Congressional Budget Office, supports the fiscal prudence of the
overall budget, but would prefer piling up more of the available
money for training elementary and secondary teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also accuse the administration of cluttering the tax
code with dozens of new credits and subsidies, declaring an end, if
not to big government, at least to an era of tax simplification
that culminated in the estimable Tax Reform Act of 1986. The White
House proposes, among pages upon pages, a $1,000 long-term-care tax
credit, a $1,000 credit to offset expenses of disabled workers, a
credit for small businesses that join coalitions to purchase health
insurance, and a credit for parents who stay home to care for a
newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these tax credits are too small to do much good. Take
the credit for caring for the chronically ill. It almost entirely
excludes the poor, who do not pay taxes and cannot take advantage
of a tax credit. It provides, compared with the annual costs of
$60,000 or more, small relief to middle-class families. Is this the
most effective use of the limited money Clinton carves out for new
initiatives?
</P>
<P>
   Besides making the tax code bewilderingly complex, the layering
of credits creates other problems. Each credit, to avoid unduly
running up costs and benefiting the rich, must be phased out as
family incomes rise. So each credit that is phased out amounts to a
tax on work.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons the administration backed into nit-picking
tactics. Congress has imposed tight caps on discretionary spending,
virtually forcing Clinton to tackle problems with tax subsidies.
Lacking the will to go after waste that riddles discretionary
spending and the political muscle to eliminate the caps and start
fresh, Clinton resorted to doling out spoonfuls of money where
shovels were needed.

 &HT;    The lowly iceberg lettuce makes a comeback
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Being a salad snob used to be so easy. Romaine was
good. Radicchio was good. Mixed baby greens were the height of
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   And iceberg was the pits. If you made the faux pas of professing
a taste for head lettuce, it was like saying you craved Bac-O-Bits
or preferred crunchy tomatoes over vine-ripened.
</P>
<P>
   But now people who consider themselves very sophisticated indeed
are taking knife and fork to iceberg with renewed gusto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a retro thing,'' says restaurant consultant John
Imbergamo. ``That wedge of lettuce with blue cheese dressing and
blue cheese crumbles. We're seeing it in all the top restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   This salad has been a big seller at dick &AMP; harry's, an upscale
American bistro in Roswell (Ga.), since Richard and Harold
Marmulstein opened the restaurant in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother claims he brought it to Atlanta,'' says Richard.
``I think the comfort foods of the time we were growing up are
coming back. We grew up in upstate New York, and when Harold was 8
or 9 he'd always order it in restaurants. People thought it was
bizarre for a kid his age. But he's always loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Catherall of Prime _ the fancy steak and sushi place in
Lenox Square (Atlanta)_ also claims a long association with the
wedge salad, having served it for years during his tenure as chef
at the Cherokee (Ga.) Town and Country Club. But now he has the
quarter-head of lettuce dressed for steakhouse success in Tony
Maytag blue cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Catherall also serves it at Indigo Coastal Grill, the
trendsetting Atlanta bistro he acquired late last year. ``I sell
the iceberg salad there as much as the fancy field greens,'' he
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, what about those frilly, leafy greens?
Weren't they supposed to be the non plus ultra of salad chic? ``The
mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette?'' asks Imbergamo. ``Oh no,
they're everywhere. They've been dumbed down.''

 &HT;    Emory University mummified at the prospect of acquiring 80
pieces of Egyptian art
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Museums know that the next best thing to a Monet is a mummy.
</P>
<P>
   So the folks at Emory University's Michael C. Carlos Museum are
understandably excited about the prospect of acquiring 80 pieces of
Egyptian art, the stars of the group being 10 painted coffins and
10 mummies.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of these artifacts, perhaps the finest collection of
Egyptian art still in private hands _ and the fact that a little
more than half of the $2 million price tag must be raised in the
next few days _explain why museum director Tony Hirschel has
abandoned the secrecy usually surrounding such acquisitions. He's
gone public to appeal for funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality (of the collection) is such that it would put the
Carlos on par with the great collections of the Metropolitan Museum
in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in the area of
Egyptian funerary arts _ not in quantity, of course, but in
quality,'' Hirschel said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this would make great study material at the university,
our interest in the collection is about fulfilling our civic
mission,'' he said. ``We feel that this is something that the
broader public would respond to. Egyptian art is rivaled only by
impressionism in popularity among museum-goers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a group, they will rival any key collection of coffin
ensembles (coffins of diminishing size placed within another) in
North America,'' said Boston egyptologist Joyce Haynes. ``Several
of the coffins are of very high quality. Just in terms of quantity,
10 is a huge number.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To have this many mummies and coffins available on the market
at one time is virtually an unheard of occurrence,'' said Carter
Lupton, curator of ancient history at the Milwaukee Public Museum.
``You don't get them out of Egypt anymore, and they're not on the
market. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to convince our director here to try for them,''
Lupton said, but the Milwaukee museum decided it had other
priorities and the price was too high.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes bronzes, clay figurines and Canopic jars
_ which hold the entrails of the mummies. It has been in the hands
of only two families since it was formed in the mid-19th century.
Though now owned by an anonymous dealer, it has occupied since the
1950s the second floor of a museum in Niagara Falls, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lacovara, the Carlos' new Egyptian art curator, got wind
of its availability through a curator friend and went to see it in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard rumors about this collection for years, but no one
had ever gone to see it because it's such a weird, out-of-the-way
museum,'' he said. ``It was full of odd stuff, much like the old
Emory Museum. It was dark and dank, but it was amazing to see how
many artifacts there were, and how beautiful they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Lacovara saw it first, the Carlos has been given the
first shot at acquisition. After this week, however, there will be
open competition for the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike special exhibitions, we have the potential now to
secure, at a similar cost, a collection that would remain here
permanently, a source of pride for the people of this region and
envy by those from elsewhere,'' Hirschel said.

<P>
   Pop some fresh batteries into the remote, 'cause you're going to
need that little device during the next four weeks. It's sweeps
time again, when Nielsen measures local stations' demographics so
they can set their ad rates worth millions.
</P>

motorcycle between two buildings on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Big deals: ``The '60s'' (9 p.m. Sunday and Monday on NBC) is a

more perks to his achievement than he imagined, as he gets romantic
in a fantasy with Helen Hunt on ``Mad About You'' (8:30 p.m. Feb.
22 on NBC). . . . Woody Harrelson is back playing ``Cheers''
bartender Woody Boyd on a visit to ``Frasier'' (9 tonight on NBC).
. . . Brian Dennehy returns as Finch's dad in a two-part ``Just
Shoot Me'' (9 p.m. Tuesday and 16 on NBC).
</P>

MARION BOYARS, PUBLISHER OF ECLECTIC BOOKS, DIES AT 71 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., England, Switzerland)  By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Marion Boyars, an independent publisher whose eclectic
and internationally minded list of authors included work by at
least four Nobel Prize winners, died on Monday at her home in
London. She was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry increasingly populated by conglomerates with deep
pockets and a penchant for books that appeal to as wide an audience
as possible, Mrs. Boyars was rare in her insistence on publishing
only what she liked, whether the book was likely to sell or not.
``Most of my publishing is out of enthusiasm,'' she told The New
York Times in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, often working on a shoestring and struggling to
stay afloat, she published some 500 books by such writers as Eudora
Welty, Julio Cortazar, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Georges Bataille, Tim
O'Brien, Pauline Kael and Ingmar Bergman, works translated from
more than 20 languages. Among the Nobel Prize winners on her list
were Heinrich Boell, Elias Canetti, Kenzaburo Oe and Eugenio
Montale. She was born Marion Asmus in New York, and grew up there
and in Switzerland. After graduating from Keele University in
Staffordshire with a degree in politics, philosophy and economics,
she married George Lobbenburg, an American who ran a successful
clothing company in Britain. The couple had two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced in her early 30s, she answered an advertisement in The
Bookseller, a London trade magazine, and ended up buying a 50
percent stake in a firm run by the independent publisher John
Calder. The two set up business in London, publishing works by such
authors as Samuel Beckett, Marguerite Duras, Henry Miller, Eugene
Ionesco and William S. Burroughs. They also specialized in the
writings of modern composers, publishing works by Cage, Ives and
Stravinsky, and social commentators including Ivan Illich and
Robert Heilbroner.
</P>
<P>
   In an international cause celebre, the company was brought to
court here and charged with obscenity in 1966 after publishing
``Last Exit to Brooklyn'' by Hubert Selby Jr. It lost the original
case in the Old Bailey but won on appeal two years later.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Boyars, who by then had married her second husband,
Arthur Boyars, fell out with her business partner. Taking along the
firm's big money-maker, Ken Kesey's ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest,'' among other things, she eventually set up Marion Boyars
Publishers, with offices in London and Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She published about 25 new books a year, becoming a fixture at
the annual Frankfurt Book Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boyars formed close friendships with many of her authors.
When Michael Ondaatje _ who by then was published by another
company _ won the Booker Prize for ``The English Patient'' in 1992,
he publicly thanked her for helping to start his career.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by Boyars and her two daughters, Susan Quateman
of Beverly, Mass., and Catheryn Kilgarriss of London, who is now
managing her publishing house.

understandably excited about the prospect of acquiring 80 pieces of
Egyptian art, the stars of the group being 10 painted coffins and
10 mummies.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of these artifacts, perhaps the finest collection of
Egyptian art still in private hands _ and the fact that a little
more than half of the $2 million price tag must be raised in the
next few days _explain why museum director Tony Hirschel has
abandoned the secrecy usually surrounding such acquisitions. He's
gone public to appeal for funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality (of the collection) is such that it would put the
Carlos on par with the great collections of the Metropolitan Museum
in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in the area of
Egyptian funerary arts _ not in quantity, of course, but in
quality,'' Hirschel said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this would make great study material at the university,
our interest in the collection is about fulfilling our civic
mission,'' he said. ``We feel that this is something that the
broader public would respond to. Egyptian art is rivaled only by
impressionism in popularity among museum-goers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a group, they will rival any key collection of coffin
ensembles (coffins of diminishing size placed within another) in
North America,'' said Boston egyptologist Joyce Haynes. ``Several
of the coffins are of very high quality. Just in terms of quantity,
10 is a huge number.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To have this many mummies and coffins available on the market
at one time is virtually an unheard of occurrence,'' said Carter
Lupton, curator of ancient history at the Milwaukee Public Museum.
``You don't get them out of Egypt anymore, and they're not on the
market. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to convince our director here to try for them,''
Lupton said, but the Milwaukee museum decided it had other
priorities and the price was too high.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes bronzes, clay figurines and Canopic jars
_ which hold the entrails of the mummies. It has been in the hands
of only two families since it was formed in the mid-19th century.
Though now owned by an anonymous dealer, it has occupied since the
1950s the second floor of a museum in Niagara Falls, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lacovara, the Carlos' new Egyptian art curator, got wind
of its availability through a curator friend and went to see it in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard rumors about this collection for years, but no one
had ever gone to see it because it's such a weird, out-of-the-way
museum,'' he said. ``It was full of odd stuff, much like the old
Emory Museum. It was dark and dank, but it was amazing to see how
many artifacts there were, and how beautiful they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Lacovara saw it first, the Carlos has been given the
first shot at acquisition. After this week, however, there will be
open competition for the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike special exhibitions, we have the potential now to
secure, at a similar cost, a collection that would remain here
permanently, a source of pride for the people of this region and
envy by those from elsewhere,'' Hirschel said.

WISDOM IN A GLOBALIZED WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By H.D.S. GREENWAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ As they have for 30 years, heads of state,
finance ministers, politicians, and business leaders _ with a
sprinkling of scientists, musicians, artists, and writers _ have
been meeting in this Alpine resort made famous by Thomas Mann as
the magic mountain of his novel. Then it was for tuberculosis that
people came. Now it is for economic ills that people come to the
World Economic Forum _ ills that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
calls ``the most serious financial crisis of the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the matter is ``globalization,'' which has the
capacity to lift countless millions out of poverty and backwardness
but can also do harm, as the crises in Asia, Russia, and Brazil
have so amply demonstrated. How to reap the benefits of
globalization while limiting the damage has dominated the
conversation here. Reforming the global architecture has been on
the books for years, but no one can agree on the blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the answer is to devise a world system of safeguards.
Britain's finance minister, Gordon Brown, spoke of a ``global
standing committee of international and national regulators to
conduct the regular and systematic surveillance of our world
financial system.'' He talked of an ``early-warning system'' that
could prevent financial meltdowns before they happened.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, however, warned that there are ``no easy answers or magic
wands'' and said an early-warning system could provoke what it
sought to prevent. The answer, he said, lies less in unwieldy
control machinery than in adherence to sound business practices by
both borrowers and lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge-based society of the next century will founder if
knowledge runs too far ahead of wisdom. Societies with banking
systems that are open and aboveboard and that have the
self-discipline to put their houses in order _ to stamp out
corruption, cronyism, and unproductive and inefficient state
controls _ are likely to prosper. Those that do not will not, and
no international regulatory system is likely to save them.

</P>
<P>
   ORGAN-MUSIC (New York) _ Western music has generally moved far
from its origins in plainsong and other kinds of religious chant,
but one instrument, the organ, has never been able to heave itself
out of the church. Taking place in church, organ music has to
behave with a certain respect, and few composers have been able to
maintain that posture for long. Bach, of course, was one. The only
other outstanding example is the French composer Olivier Messiaen,
whose complete organ works are to be played in six concerts at
Riverside Church on the Upper West Side of Manhattan by the
American organist Jon Gillock, starting on Tuesday. By Paul
Griffiths. (Moved). Photo. &QL;

<P>
   DEATH-OF-SALESMAN-REVIVAL (Undated) _ A half century after its
premiere, ``Death of a Salesman'' has become an American classic _
a perennial produced around the world, from Baltimore to Beijing,
and routinely taught in high school English classes and mounted in
community theaters. The play has become an institution, part of the
accepted theater canon, and today even boasts its own website
(www.deathofasalesman.com), where, in an ironic twist on its
central theme, you will be able to purchase souvenirs. The new
production of the Goodman Theater's ``Salesman'' will open
Wednesday at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on Broadway _ 50 years to
the day from the play's 1949 world premiere. By Michiko Kakutani.

   OSCAR-SUPPORT-NOMINATIONS (Undated) _ Robert Rehme, president of
the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, says
``the supporting categories are very arbitrary. There is a book of
rules, but they don't really mean anything. The nominations are
based largely on where the studios and the actors' representatives
choose to place them.'' By Michele Willens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SUNDANCE-FILMS-ADS (Park City, Utah) _ Where else but in Park
City in late January would a 7-year-old girl be handing out Satanic
postcards on Main Street? Her name was Kathleen and what she was
doing, she said sweetly, was helping to advertise a film made by a
friend of her family's. She was one more sign of how anything goes
during the Sundance Film Festival, and of how desperate anyone who
has a film there is liable to be. By Janet Maslin. (Moved).

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA-REVIVAL (Undated) _ Despite the downpours of a British
summer, it was a ``beautiful morning' '' for the choreographer
Susan Stroman when she woke to the enthusiastic reviews of the
revival of ``Oklahoma!'' at the Royal National Theater in London
last July. Almost everyone declared that the show really deserved
its exclamation mark and that Ms. Stroman, a two-time Tony Award
winner, was a prime participant in making this new version a hit.

<P>
   VOGEL-DRAMA-PRIZE (Providence, R.I.) _ Winning a Pulitzer Prize
can mean many things. First and foremost is the recipient's sense
of justice, and for Paula Vogel, 47, who won the prize for drama
last year, the moment was especially sweet: not only had she been
rejected by the Yale School of Drama; she had also been turned away
by the prestigious Eugene O'Neill Playwrights Conference _ 12
times. The play for which she won the Pulitzer, ``How I Learned to
Drive,'' about the incestuous relationship between a girl and her
uncle, had a successful run Off Broadway and was the most produced
new play in America last year, with 26 regional productions. By
Alex Witchel. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   OUR-YOUTH-THEATER (New York) _ The play, ``This Is Our Youth,''
a dark comedy by Kenneth Lonergan, which reopens Sunday night at
the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on Theater Row, follows three
post-adolescents on the Upper West Side through a bungled cocaine
deal. As bleak as that synopsis sounds, the play's warm heart lies
in the awkward romance of Warren Straub and Jessica Goldman: he, a
pot-smoking toy collector with an abusive father, and she, a
teen-age philosopher with a jaded view of love. By Jesse McKinley.

<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC (Undated) _ Like pop, rock and jazz, classical
music has been suffering a drought in creativity; and the way it
presents itself, though chereshed by an older generation, is being
resisted by a younger one. By Bernard Holland. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUM-MONTEVERDI-MUSIC (Undated) _ Only princes spoil guests
like this. To an exhibition of rare splendors at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, we may, for one night only, add enchantments for the
ear. The show in question is ``Dosso Dossi: Court Painter in
Ferrara,'' on view through March 28. The complementary concert,
``Monteverdi and His Contemporaries: Music and Poetry of the Late
Renaissance,'' on Friday evening, features the glamorous Italian
soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci in her New York debut, with
instrumentalists of the early-music group Accademia Bizantina of
Ravenna. By Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-FOLK-MUSIC (Kashgar, China) _ Traditionally, Uighur music
deals with love, morality and criticisms of misconduct. But
Abdurahim Heet _ known as the ``Rooster of Xinjiang'' because of
his voice _ is the first Uighur musician to write about life under
Chinese rule. As a result, he has to pay extra money to the private
manufacturers of his cassettes to compensate them for the risk they
are taking. He distributes these tapes for free. A master of folk
tradition with a fire for protest and poetry, he has become a local
Bob Dylan, spurring many musicians to follow in his footsteps (and
in at least one case to get arrested for a politically charged
performance). Songs like ``Stubborn Guest'' and ``Silk,'' a paean
to Uighur culture, have become anthems and sources of pride in
Kashgar, where donkey carts are still the main mode of
transportation. By Neil Strauss. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BAROQUE-JAZZ-CONCERT (Boston) _ Two enduring and vibrant musical
institutions came together here for the first time, on Friday
evening, to explore the common threads of musical styles born more
than two centuries apart: Baroque and jazz. In a concert to be
repeated Sunday afternoon, the Handel and Haydn Society, founded
here in 1815 and still a leading American Baroque chorus and
orchestra, joined forces at Symphony Hall with the jazz fusion
pioneers Chick Corea and Gary Burton, who serendipitously hooked up
in 1972 and have played together every year since. By Susan
Diesenhouse. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The country boom of the early 90s has
leveled off, and now, to regain the momemtum, country has to figure
out _ again _ what it is. Recent albums by Trisha Yearwood and Alan
Jackson, point in a promising direction. The two singers grew up
within 100 miles of one another in Georgia, and their careers have
spanned the ups and downs of country this decade. Perhap's that's
why Ms. Yearwood's ``Where Your Road Leads'' (MCA 70023) and
Jackson's  &UR; `` &LR; High Mileage'' (Arista 07822-18864-Z) sidestep the
confusion. They rely on an almost classical sense of country form
that still leaves room for innovation. By James Hunter. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIC-MILES (Undated) _ Critics and musicians have come to
regard the electric Miles Davis as remarkably prescient of forms
like trip-hop and electronica. Last year, Bill Laswell's remix of
the electric Miles, ``Panthalassa,'' was released to wide acclaim.
The Fender Rhodes electric piano, first introduced by Miles on his
stunning 1968 album, ``Filles de Kilimanjaro,'' has been heard in
decidedly Milesian arrangements on recent albums by the
saxophonists Greg Osby and Mark Turner. Wada Leo Smith and Henry
Kaiser's ``Yo Miles!'' (Shanachie 5046) is notable for being the
only homage to the electric Miles among recent album-length
tributes to the trumpeter. By Adam Shatz. (Moved).

   &UR; ART  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EAST-GERMANY-PHOTOGS (Boston) _ Most Americans probably have
very little idea how East Germans, for instance, saw themselves, or
how their culture asked them to. Some insight can be gained from
``Recollecting a Culture: Photography and the Evolution of a
Socialist Esthetic in East Germany,'' a show of more than 120
photographs at the Photographic Resource Center at Boston
University through Feb. 19. The photographs are from Fotografie,
one of the two state-sanctioned photographic magazines in the
German Democratic Republic (GDR) after World War II; it was
published in East Germany from 1947 on. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-SPORTS-NIGHT (Undated) _ ABC's new prime-time comedy ``Sports
Night'' is this season's critical darling, a chance to gush and
bubble for television reviewers everywhere. It gets the Golden
Local Double-Thumps-Up or the National Platinum Five-Star A-Plus in
everything from The Denver Post to Elle to The New Yorker. By Jeff
Macgregor. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CARNIVAL-GLASS-ANTIQUES (subslug) (Undated) _ About 20 years
ago, Floyd Whitley, a glass collector and retired oil executive
from Houston went to an auction in Kansas City, Mo., to buy a rare
vase. Called a Peoples vase by collectors, it was amethyst-colored
and depicted dancers celebrating the harvest. Made between 1909 and
1911, the vase is only one of five known to exist. ``I paid $5,000
for that vase, which had sold for $250 in the 60s, and everyone in
the auction room wanted to give me a Breathalyzer test,'' he said.
But those who thought Whitley foolhardy were wrong. Last fall, he
sold the vase to a private collector for $50,000. On April 24, at
an auction in Kansas City, 250 items from Whitley's collection are
expected to fetch more than $250,000. By Elisabeth Hayt. (Moved).

U.S. MAY SEND UP TO 4,000 TROOPS TO KOSOVO

By ELIZABETH BECKER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen told a Senate
committee Wednesday that President Clinton does not need
congressional approval to send U.S. troops as peacekeepers to
Kosovo, and Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said that preliminary Pentagon plans call for a force of
2,000 to 4,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, which are being refined in advance of this
Saturday's peace talks in France, envision U.S. troops serving as
the smaller part of a contingent that would include about 8,000
British soldiers and as many as 5,000 French soldiers. Germany,
Italy and other nations are also expected to commit troops,
according to administration and diplomatic officials.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials emphasized that the president has not
made a final decision on committing troops. U.S. representatives to
the peace talks expect to leverage that fact to extract the best
agreement possible from both parties, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's senior national security advisers returned
Wednesday to Congress for consultation with key senators. The
administration officials, including Cohen, Shelton, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger, appeared at two confidential briefings. They described the
stakes the United States had in preserving peace in Kosovo and the
Balkans, and the dire consequences if the United States did not
take part in preserving any peace attained at the upcoming
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants said they were left with the ``clear
impression'' that the United States intended to make available
2,000 to 4,000 troops for the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday that
several aspects of the Kosovo crisis are propelling a U.S. role in
a peacekeeping operation, and cited the long history of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic refusing to end conflicts without
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear from the past that Milosevic will not respond
unless he understands there is a very real threat to him and to his
forces, `` Cohen said. ``In order for there to be a credible NATO
threat, the NATO countries have indicated they won't participate in
that military operation unless the United States also participates.
``
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, whose
autonomous status within Yugoslavia was revoked by Milosevic 10
years ago, and who have been victims of Serbian repression and
massacres in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said these Kosovo Albanians `` would not feel confident of
having a NATO force that doesn't have some representation by the
United States,'' believing that U.S. troops would insulate them
from attacks by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   The administration continued drawing up details for a possible
air campaign should the warring parties fail to reach a ceasefire
agreement, and for Americans to join a peacekeeping force should a
ceasefire be negotiated and Clinton orders in troops.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the Kosovo Albanians agreed to take part in the peace
talks while the United States and its NATO allies continued to
pressure Serbia to join the talks. Already NATO has threatened to
use airstrike against Serbia if an agreement is not achieved by
Feb. 19 at the talks sponsored by the United States and five
European nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have to be a real agreement, not something that is
illusory,'' Cohen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is to make an address Thursday outlining the diplomatic
and military strategy underway.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the president must see the final agreement
and then is expected to consult Congress again before he would send
in ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   During consultations and in testimony Wednesday, administration
officials emphasized how Europe is taking the larger role in the
proposed Kosovo settlement. In this regard, Cohen said, ``more
responsibility should be shifted to the Europeans to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever contribution we make to NATO in this regard should be
relatively small by comparison because we have been carrying a very
large load as far as the Air Force components. And should there be
any airstrikes ordered, we would be the ones carrying the load on
that,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said that instead of having an American
lead the peacekeeping force, he would recommend that a British
officer head it. ``This will send a signal that Europe and Great
Britain are beginning to assume a greater role and responsibility
for this regional conflict in the Balkans,'' he said in a later
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congress will eventually support the president in this
conflict. We're not there yet, but I think we're getting there,''
Warner said.

THIS GUY IS FUNNY, MARK MY WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This interview had to happen. I needed to prove to my co-workers
that Mark Lowry, the Baptist storyteller/singer, is indeed NOT the
same human being as Mark Lowry _ that would be me _ the Pentecostal
preacher's kid who often tells stories and thinks he can sing.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry, who will appear this weekend at gospel singer Bill
Gaither's Homecoming Texas Style at the Fort Worth Convention
Center, has been mixing comedy and the faith for nearly 20 years.
His shtick: telling stories sated with nudge-nudge, wink-wink
in-jokes. He performs about 80 times in any given year, won a Dove
Award for his long-form video ``Mouth in Motion,'' and has written
several books, including a children's series called ``The
Adventures of Piper the Hyper Mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   His latest album, ``But Seriously,'' is indeed a serious piece,
so to speak, but count on him to sprinkle his comical parables
throughout his concert of original and standard gospel tunes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark Lowry Web site (www.marklowry.com) is filled with
irreverent bits such as ``classic church bulletin bloopers'' and
``you might be a Southern Baptist ...'' (No.4: if the first
complete sentence you uttered was ``We've never done it this way
before.'')
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``fun things to do during boring sermons'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Slap your neighbor. See if they turn the other cheek. If not,
raise your hand and tell the preacher'' and ``Start from the back
of the church and try to crawl all the way to the front, under the
pews, without being noticed'' are two that have come to my mind
many times _ especially when visiting churches whose services are
less, um, hyper, than those he, Lowry, and I, Lowry, were raised
with (for example, those that actually list the order of the
service on a program, as if they already know that the spirit is
not going to move.)
</P>
<P>
   I should probably also mention Lowry's favorite Bible verse,
just because. It's 1 Chronicles 26:18: ``At Parbar, westward four
at the causeway, and two at Parbar.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough about him. To prove that Lowry and I are not one and
the same, I picked up the phone and called him, and I offer this
question-and-answer session as irrefutable proof.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I guess the most obvious question is, Mark, what's your
middle name?
</P>
<P>
   A: Alan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You didn't get a double dose of New Testament names like I
did _ Mark Timothy.
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I guess I didn't. Do you have a brother, Mark?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yes: David Joseph. My sisters didn't get biblical names at
all, though. But enough about me. How did you get involved with
Christian comedy?
</P>
<P>
   A: I started out just singing. And I'd talk about things that
had happened to me and my family, and the people would just laugh.
I never set out to be a comedian. I don't like that word. I'm a
storyteller. Like Bill Cosby; he's a storyteller. People like Jay
Leno are comedians. You don't get to know anything about them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you just talk about my, I mean, your life.
</P>
<P>
   A: If I haven't lived it, I don't tell it. To me it isn't funny
if it isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of things do you talk about?
</P>
<P>
   A: For one, I like to shoot down those sacred cows. I don't deal
in politics, or in pulling down other individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you don't pick on fallen Christian icons?
</P>
<P>
   A: Once I used the phrase ``cried like Tammy Faye at a yard
sale.'' But that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your most recent story?
</P>
<P>
   A: One I'm calling ``From Toilet Plungers to the Resurrection,''
which is about when I recently bought a new house and discovered
Home Depot. I went looking for picture hangers and left with a
Jacuzzi. Later I had a party and ended up talking to an atheist who
was so interesting.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting atheist? Wait. Is that a punch line?

THIS GUY IS FUNNY, MARK MY WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This interview had to happen. I needed to prove to my co-workers
that Mark Lowry, the Baptist storyteller/singer, is indeed NOT the
same human being as Mark Lowry _ that would be me _ the Pentecostal
preacher's kid who often tells stories and thinks he can sing.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry, who will appear this weekend at gospel singer Bill
Gaither's Homecoming Texas Style at the Fort Worth Convention
Center, has been mixing comedy and the faith for nearly 20 years.
His shtick: telling stories sated with nudge-nudge, wink-wink
in-jokes. He performs about 80 times in any given year, won a Dove
Award for his long-form video ``Mouth in Motion,'' and has written
several books, including a children's series called ``The
Adventures of Piper the Hyper Mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   His latest album, ``But Seriously,'' is indeed a serious piece,
so to speak, but count on him to sprinkle his comical parables
throughout his concert of original and standard gospel tunes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark Lowry Web site (www.marklowry.com) is filled with
irreverent bits such as ``classic church bulletin bloopers'' and
``you might be a Southern Baptist ...'' (No.4: if the first
complete sentence you uttered was ``We've never done it this way
before.'')
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``fun things to do during boring sermons'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Slap your neighbor. See if they turn the other cheek. If not,
raise your hand and tell the preacher'' and ``Start from the back
of the church and try to crawl all the way to the front, under the
pews, without being noticed'' are two that have come to my mind
many times _ especially when visiting churches whose services are
less, um, hyper, than those he, Lowry, and I, Lowry, were raised
with (for example, those that actually list the order of the
service on a program, as if they already know that the spirit is
not going to move.)
</P>
<P>
   I should probably also mention Lowry's favorite Bible verse,
just because. It's 1 Chronicles 26:18: ``At Parbar, westward four
at the causeway, and two at Parbar.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough about him. To prove that Lowry and I are not one and
the same, I picked up the phone and called him, and I offer this
question-and-answer session as irrefutable proof.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I guess the most obvious question is, Mark, what's your
middle name?
</P>
<P>
   A: Alan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You didn't get a double dose of New Testament names like I
did _ Mark Timothy.
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I guess I didn't. Do you have a brother, Mark?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yes: David Joseph. My sisters didn't get biblical names at
all, though. But enough about me. How did you get involved with
Christian comedy?
</P>
<P>
   A: I started out just singing. And I'd talk about things that
had happened to me and my family, and the people would just laugh.
I never set out to be a comedian. I don't like that word. I'm a
storyteller. Like Bill Cosby; he's a storyteller. People like Jay
Leno are comedians. You don't get to know anything about them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you just talk about my, I mean, your life.
</P>
<P>
   A: If I haven't lived it, I don't tell it. To me it isn't funny
if it isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of things do you talk about?
</P>
<P>
   A: For one, I like to shoot down those sacred cows. I don't deal

</P>
<P>
   Q: So you don't pick on fallen Christian icons?
</P>
<P>
   A: Once I used the phrase ``cried like Tammy Faye at a yard

</P>

   Q: What's your most recent story?
</P>
<P>
   A: One I'm calling ``From Toilet Plungers to the Resurrection,''
which is about when I recently bought a new house and discovered

IT'S COMING-OF-AGE FILM, BUT NO ONE GROW UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Take dead aim on the rich boys, get them in the cross hairs
and take them down,'' bored, out-of-it millionaire Herman Blume
(Bill Murray) lectures the benign, indifferent students of
``Rushmore,'' the elite boys' school that is the setting for Wes
Anderson's new comedy. (The picture had its debut at last season's
inaugural Fort Worth Film Festival.) One of the students, Max
Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) takes particular notice of Blume's
speech. Max, the protagonist of ``Rushmore,'' is a nervy, ambitious
nerd who sports his Rushmore blazer as if he spends his entire life
in it. He recognizes a kindred spirit in Herman and attaches
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Max has shoehorned himself into every after-school club and
extracurricular activity available and has created a few activities
that Rushmore didn't have before he got there. He writes
grandiloquent plays about big events from a perspective that he
must've gleaned from movies, dramas complete with onstage special
effects, like explosions. He has thrown himself into every aspect
of Rushmore, except his studies. ``He's the worst student we've
got,'' drawls Dr. Guggenheim (Brian Cox), the headmaster.
</P>
<P>
   When Max develops a crush on one of his teachers, Rosemary
Cross, (Olivia Williams, who seems far more human here than she did
in ``The Postman),'' his life goes off track. In his attempts to
impress, he gets himself expelled. And his mentor, Herman, becomes
his rival for Rosemary. Murray, with his contemplative shrewdness,
takes over the movie. For years, he has done startlingly good work
in pictures that have no place for him, going all the way back to
the restive spirit he brought to his portrayal of Hunter S.
Thompson in ``Where the Buffalo Roam.'' In ``Rushmore,'' Murray
finds just the place for his insinuating corrosiveness, sporting
pinstripe suits and matching shirt-and-tie ensembles that make him
look as if he aspires to be Matt Lauer or Johnny Cochran. In this
boys-will-be-boys tableau of Olympian pettiness, Max and Herman are
pitted against each other, with Max's aggressiveness impressing
even Herman.
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting that Max is an aspiring actor-writer-director,
because he has a capacity for turning everything into melodrama,
and his cheesy self-dramatizing arrogance is funny. He has to make
himself the constant center of attention. He's a spoiled brat of
his own making, and the expectation that Anderson and co-writer
Owen Wilson set up is that Max will come to some realization about
himself. Or that Herman will grow up. Neither happens, so
``Rushmore'' is like an overly vivid cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson turns ``Rushmore'' into a handsomely mounted, grasping
pastiche that is part ``The Graduate,'' part Charles Schultz's
``Peanuts,'' with a liberal dollop of British popular culture from
Lindsay Anderson to ``Quadrophenia.'' It has a rangy, scavenger's
spirit, right down to rescuing Williams and Dirk Calloway (who
plays Max's best friend Mason Gamble and made his debut as the star
of ``Dennis the Menace)'' from their history of misuse in other
movies. It's as if the movie was written by Max, whose brain is
constantly ticking off opportunities to seize. (In interviews,
Anderson has the ingratiating, slightly untrustworthy quality of a
grown-up Max.)
</P>
<P>
   Every frame is presented like a painting, with burnished reds
and golds and yellows; the colors seem heartfelt. And the picture
has an autumnal melancholy, the understated yearning quality of the
'60s and '70's British pop music that fills the soundtrack.
``Rushmore'' has the sprawling ambition of British pop, a coil of
displaced anger, that makes the picture feel as if it is all over
the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' also has the excitement of Brit-pop, brooding
smarts that churn things up, even when not much is going on in the
movie. The music generates energy, maybe doing some of the work
that we'd expect the movie to accomplish. ``Bottle Rocket,'' the
previous picture by Anderson and his co-writer, Owen Wilson, has a
loose, scattered feel that holds together because of the peculiar
ambitions of the wannabe petty hood Dignan (Wilson). There's also a
warmth in the midst of all of the bizarre enthusiasms in
``Rocket,'' brought to the picture by brother Luke Wilson (who has
a cameo in ``Rushmore).'' Even when ``Rushmore'' is clicking, it
has an anecdotal feel, and all the anecdotes don't mesh into a
whole as they did in ``Bottle Rocket.'' Eventually, the movie just
rolls to an end. But Anderson creates such an endearing mess that
you find yourself pulling for the movie. Part of that desire to see
the picture succeed is that Anderson has found a way get a major
studio _ Touchstone, the home of ``Armageddon'' _ to underwrite his
specific vision.
</P>
<P>
   The film often has a magnificent silliness that makes you laugh
right out loud, such as when ``Rushmore'' makes one of its direct
quotes from some other movie, like ``Heat.'' But that's also what
hampers ``Rushmore;'' after a while, it begins to feel as if it has
no life of its own, as if it's all quotes and homages. That is,
with the exception of Murray's courageous honesty. His performance
has a life, a reality, all its own. He brings the floating whimsy
down to Earth and gives it flesh and blood. He also helps you
forgive a lot of ``Rushmore's'' scattered feel. He definitely knows
what he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' is rated PG-13 for adult language and mild
violence.

FED KEEPS HANDS OFF INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trapped between conflicting pressures at home and
abroad, the Federal Reserve voted Wednesday to leave interest rates
unchanged, keeping its hands off an economy that is either
gratifyingly robust or too strong for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   The decision had been almost universally expected by economists
and investors and caused barely a ripple on Wall Street. But it
highlighted the dilemma facing the central bank just months after
it cut rates three times to insure that financial turmoil in much
of the rest of the world would not derail the long American
business expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than slowing, the economy grew at a torrid 5.6 percent
annual rate in the fourth quarter, putting back on the agenda the
possibility that inflation, long dormant, could resurface. One
faction within the Federal Reserve is also concerned about rapid
growth in the money supply, a cause or signal of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, analysts said, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, and his colleagues on the central bank are almost
certainly considering whether they will need to reverse course and
raise rates later this year if growth does not slow markedly on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the continued fragility of global financial markets, a
rapidly expanding trade deficit, concern about causing a big
sell-off on Wall Street and the almost total absence of any hard
evidence of inflation have combined to create a strong case for
leaving rates alone or even cutting them further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed cannot lower interest rates because of eye-popping
economic strength,'' said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells
Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot raise rates because of the stock market bubble and
what's going on overseas and because politically it's impossible to
raise rates given the very low inflation rate right now,'' he said.
``So the best course for them is to stand pat and see how the U.S.
and the global economies unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision left the benchmark federal funds target
rate on overnight loans among banks at 4.75 percent and the
discount rate on loans from the Federal Reserve system at 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's usual terse announcement Wednesday afternoon
that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee had adjourned
with nothing to report belied the fundamental nature of the debate
that has reemerged within the institution in the last few months:
Has the economy entered a new era in which heavy investments in
technology allow rapid growth to coexist with low inflation? Or is
the United States merely enjoying a remarkable but temporary string
of good economic luck that will end with inflationary forces
reasserting themselves?
</P>
<P>
   The evidence in favor of a fundamental change includes some of
the most recent economic statistics. The fourth-quarter growth rate
of 5.6 percent brought growth for all of 1998 to 3.9 percent, the
third consecutive year in which the economy has expanded at nearly
a 4-percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional economic theory holds that the economy cannot grow
more than about 2.5 percent a year over the long run without
igniting inflation. But the broadest measures of price changes
suggest that inflation last year was 1 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the absence of meaningful inflation came despite
falling unemployment, which has left the jobless rate, currently
4.3 percent, hovering near 30-year lows. And heavy investments in
computers and other cost-saving technology has allowed many
companies to improve productivity, setting off a debate about
whether the United States has reversed a two-decade-long slide in
productivity growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of the Fed wake up every morning and look out at a
booming economy and ask themselves whether it's a result of
computers or of interest rates being low,'' said Brian S. Wesbury,
an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens &AMP; Thompson, a Chicago
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Wesbury comes down on the side of those who think technology has
increased the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth. He
said that relative to inflation, the short-term interest rates
controlled by the Fed are still high and could be cut to further
stimulate growth without any danger of overheating.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has been sympathetic to the argument that productivity
growth is accelerating, but he has also warned, as recently as last
month, that the recent pace of growth is unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Economists who think growth is flirting with danger levels said
part of the reason is that the Fed cut rates one too many times
last fall in reaction to the global financial turmoil. In their
view, inflation could accelerate this year, especially because some
factors that tamped it down last year _ particularly falling oil
and food prices _ are unlikely to be replicated this year. If money
supply growth continues at double-digit rates, they said, the
danger will be compounded.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever they come down in the debate, though, most economists
think the Fed will hold steady for months unless there is some
clear change in the economy's course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed's policy debate is rich with cross currents and is
characterized by uncertainties,'' said Mickey D. Levy, an economist
at Bank of America. ``They will remain on hold until something
breaks one way or another.'' &QL;

AMID CONTROVERSY, LYNX REINTRODUCED IN COLORADO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   (dal) 
 By MINDY SINK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH FORK, Colo. _ After a few minutes of terrified hesitation,
a lynx, a cat not seen in Colorado in over 25 years, was
reintroduced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-pound, 3-year-old female was the first of two lynx
released on private property in the Weminuche Wilderness area of
the San Juan Mountains, and the first of about 50 lynx to be
reintroduced this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're back,'' hollered Gene Byrne, a wildlife biologist with
the Colorado Division of Wildlife, as a second tuft-eared cat
darted across the sunlit snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never left,'' another wildlife official, Bill Andree, said
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these elusive cats were ever really gone from Colorado
has been a subject of much speculation in recent years. The Earth
Liberation Front, for example, a radical animal-rights group, was
so certain of the Lynx's presence in Colorado that last October it
claimed responsibility for a major fire at a ski resort the group
believed was threatening a habitat for the animals.
</P>
<P>
   The last known sighting of a lynx in Colorado was near Vail in
1973. But there is no doubt that the lynx once roamed this state
freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a relatively common species in Colorado before the
20th century,'' said Todd Malmsbury, a spokesman for the Colorado
Division of Wildlife. ``We can't say if their decline was caused by
human settlement and all its impacts _ mining, pollution,
agriculture, recreation _ or something else.'' The Lynx's
disappearance may also have been the result of a decline in their
primary prey, the snowshoe hare, or of trapping.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of development in the Vail area prevented officials
from releasing the mountain cats there. Instead, they settled on
this site next to San Juan-Rio Grande National Forest, about 200
miles from the popular ski resort area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many people, too many dogs, too many everything
up there,'' said Malmsbury. ``It doesn't mean they can't repopulate
there though.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their entryway into 6,500 square miles of
wilderness,'' said Cal Joyner, a supervisor for the U.S. Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The lynx released Wednesday, which were brought 1,700 miles from
British Columbia last week, are part of a $2 million, 5-year
program by the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The reintroduction sparked a lawsuit by local cattlemen and
back-country tour groups anticipating that the animal would bring
about restrictions on land use. Their primary concern is not the
lynx, itself, which is not a natural predator of livestock, but the
restrictions that may result if the cats are later declared to be a
``threatened'' or ``endangered'' species.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on whether to include the lynx, which is thriving in
Canada and Alaska, on the federal Endangered Species List is
expected by summer. A handful of states _ Montana, Idaho, Maine and
Washington _ are believed to have lynx populations. It is currently
on the Colorado Endangered Species List.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just assumed they were here before, but once they're
legally listed, we don't know what falls after that,'' said Freeman
Lester, a 63-year old rancher and president of the Colorado
Cattlemen's Association. ``Recreational people might be affected,
and some grazing.''
</P>
<P>
   But others note that there are already restrictions since it was
assumed the lynx still existed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every action we take _ whether it's grazing allotment or
recreational use _ we plan as if they were present,'' said Joyner.
``To have the animals suddenly here shouldn't change our management
style.''

PULP FICTION, FOR REAL THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the goofy trailers for ``Payback.'' This is
one tough movie. It signals the return of Mel Gibson's ``Mad Max''
meanness, which appeared to have vanished after his increasingly
clownish turns in the ``Lethal Weapon'' series and an over-the-top
sputter-fest in 1997's ``Conspiracy Theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and director Brian Helgeland reportedly clashed during
``Payback's'' filming. If so, the end product is a sign of the
rookie director's confidence, because it's more his movie than
Gibson's. This is real pulp fiction, devoid of Tarantino-influenced
pop-culture references and giddy ironies. Instead, its ironies and
gallows humor are its own, rooted in detective magazines and
especially the fiction of Donald E. Westlake, who wrote the source
novel ``The Hunter'' under the pseudonym Richard Stark.
</P>
<P>
   From the first scene, which shows a back-alley doctor removing
bullets from the barely alive, single-named Porter (Gibson),
Helgeland shows that he's in touch with Westlake/Stark's darker
side. Porter caught the bullets when his faithless wife and his
scheming partner set him up after a heist. They didn't make sure
they finished the job, though, and Porter wants his $70,000 share
of the take.
</P>
<P>
   Getting it won't be easy. Porter not only has to track down the
wife and partner, he has to deal with corrupt cops, Asian gangsters
and a syndicate called the Outfit, which is so
close.MDBU/d.MDNM/-ranked that it houses its thugs in its own
hotel. Mean isn't necessarily lean, and the movie's nefarious
characters also include Ally McBeal's Lucy Liu in a scene-stealing
turn as a sado.MDNM/masochistic hooker and former ``ER'' player
Maria Bello as a more benevolent hooker. The movie's portrayal of
women isn't enlightened, but then, no character here is on a guest
list for lunch with the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The overpopulation is a switch from 1967's ``Point Blank,'' John
Boorman's stripped-down, martinis-meet-acid adaptation of the same
material. But the added characters help ``Payback'' feel like its
own movie instead of another pointless remake. A recent article
referred to Gibson as a 43-year-old kid, which was cause for
concern for those familiar with ``Payback's'' story. Its vengeful
protagonist needs to be played by a determined man, not an
overgrown boy (Lee Marvin, steely and obsessed, was perfectly cast
in the '67 version).
</P>
<P>
   Gibson pulls it off, though, with a gravel-voiced intensity he
seems to have borrowed from Nick Nolte; it's easy to imagine that
Gibson screamed himself hoarse before every take to get that rasp
in his throat. One story going around is that Gibson came to
Helgeland worried that his character wasn't ``heroic''
enough..MDNM/ Helgeland .MDBR/either .MDNM/set Gibson straight or
wisely stood his ground, because Gibson shows a no-nonsense
maturity that he seldom shows in his crime-drama roles, and he
gives the movie a gutsy center. He may not be heroic enough, but
he's antiheroic enough.
</P>
<P>
   Helgeland, who wrote the screenplays for the dazzling ``L.A.
Confidential'' and the whacked-out ``Conspiracy Theory,'' makes a
sharp directorial debut here. He smartly has Gibson underplay his
role, surrounding the star with scenery-chewing turns by Gregg
Henry, David Paymer and William Devane. They fuel Porter's
off-kilter universe, as does the timeless retro look that Helgeland
and cinematographer Ericson Core give the movie. The filmmakers
leach out the color, so that even the daffodils look gray, adding
to the cold-blooded feel.
</P>
<P>
   The director's only missteps are keeping a few lines of
'90s-esque dialogue. which vitiate the movie's pulpy veneer, and
wasting the deliciously watchable John Glover in a small part as a
henchman. Why isn't Glover, instead of a dubious actor like Kris
Kristofferson, playing the baddest bad guy? Although Kristofferson
ekes out something resembling a performance, Glover would have
relished such a role, giving the movie more gritty panache.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a nice movie, and the easily offended should take
heed: The violence is brutal, the characters unpleasant. If its
treatment of women is disturbing _ Bello and Liu'.MDBR/s.MDNM/
characters take some vicious shots, but they give as good as they
get _ then it's even more unsettling to hear scattered audience
laughter during these scenes, which aren't played for comedy. But
as a genre piece, it works. Maybe it's not in a league with the
assured sexiness of last year's ``Out of Sight,'' but it has a
personality of its own _ or at least that of a growling, volatile
pit bull. It's a relief knowing that Gibson can still star in
something with this much teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' is rated R for harsh violence, strong language and
sexual content.

BRADLESS COMES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Bradlees Inc. be like Ames Department Stores, a retail
phoenix that now flourishes, or like Caldor, which recently
announced plans to close all its stores and go out of business?
</P>
<P>
   After 3 1/2 years of doing business under Bankruptcy Court
protection, Bradlees emerged Wednesday from Chapter 11, but the
future of a chain of discount-department stores that sell
everything from clothing to kitchen gear and consumer electronics
may still be up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   With a new three-year financing facility of $270 million from
BankBoston Corp., Bradlees chairman and chief executive Peter
Thorner is optimistic even as Target, a much larger national
discount chain, prepares to invade New England.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years Bradlees has managed to ``carve out its
own niche'' with ``contemporary'' apparel, a niche less ``upscale''
than Target's and different from Ames', he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enormously upbeat,'' said Thorner, who noted that Bradlees
has been holding its own at 17 locations, many in New Jersey, where
the two chains go head to head.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston is not only upbeat about Bradlees, but ``delighted''
to ``assist in the preservation of this leading New England
retailer,'' said Ward K. Mooney, president of the bank's retail
division.
</P>
<P>
   Under its reorganization plan, about $165 million will be
distributed among Bradlees' creditors; that includes the issuance
of new common stock with an estimated value of $85 million,
Bradlees said. Those new shares began trading Wednesday on Nasdaq,
opening at 10 and closing at 9 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   While in bankruptcy, Bradlees, based in Braintree, Mass., was
delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization plan provides ``no consideration for old
shareholders,'' said one of Bradlees' attorneys, Stuart Hirshfield
of Dewey Ballantine LLP, a New York law firm. The old shares have
been ``rendered valueless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thorner has been part of remarkable retail turnarounds before,
most notably in helping Connecticut-based Ames get out of
bankruptcy in the early 1990s. Today Ames is enjoying great success
under chief executive Joseph Ettore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Thorner is widely respected in the retail industry,
especially among vendors,'' said Stewart L. Cohen, chief executive
of Paragon Capital LLC, a Needham company that lends to retailers
but has had no business with Bradlees.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy offers a struggling retailer a chance to get out of
expensive leases and close unprofitable stores. And that's pretty
much what Bradlees did as it slashed expenses.
</P>
<P>
   While in bankruptcy, Bradlees closed about 33 stores and shed
6,000 jobs in a bid to become lean and mean. Other cost-cutting
measures initiated by Thorner allowed Bradlees to reduce losses.
</P>
<P>
   Bradlees now operates 103 stores, including 36 in Massachusetts,
and projects annual sales of $1.4 billion, down from $1.9 billion
in 1994. It now employs about 10,000 in seven Northeastern states
from Maine to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Bradlees exiting Chapter 11 while Caldor is liquidating?
The answer may hinge as much on the realities of filing for
bankruptcy in the 1990s as on retail acumen.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, creditors of a bankrupt retailer were its
vendors and lenders, and they often had a vested interest in the
retailer's long-term survival.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays a retailer's debt can be sold to Wall Street
investment firms. Sometimes these firms conclude that the
retailer's liquidation is the best way to maximize their
investment. As a result, a retailer's fate may depend as much on
having patient creditors as on having a sound business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Tough competiton was one factor that forced Bradlees to take
refuge in Chapter 11, and tough competition hasn't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   With its recent acquisition of Hills Stores Inc. of
Canton, &UR;  &LR; Mass., Ames has gotten stronger. Target is moving into New
England, and some Wall Street analysts are predicting Target will
take over some of Caldor's best store locations. Wednesday a Target
spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Bradlees could also be hurt by Caldor's
going-out-of-business sales, which in theory could siphon away many
of its customers over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bradlees found it difficult to compete against a rapidly
sinking rival like Caldor, can you imagine the outlook once the
(Caldor) stores are bought by Target or Kmart?'' asked Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1958, the first Bradlees opened its doors in New
London, Conn., in an era when discount department stores flourished
by providing consumers with one-stop shopping.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1980s, superstore chains such as Staples and Home
Depot began to emerge. With a larger size and a narrower focus,
they gave shoppers one less reason to visit regional discounters.
Then rapid expansion by national giants such as Wal-Mart and Kmart
offered more discount shopping choices.
</P>
<P>
   All this competition would seem to make an endangered species
out of the regional discount chain. But the success of Ames proves
that a smaller player can still thrive among giants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a ``somewhat sluggish third quarter,'' Thorner is upbeat
about Bradlees, noting that a sharp increase in January sales was
only one of many recent improvements.

GAY MARINE FEATURED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES ACTED IN PORNO FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Advocate, a biweekly magazine about gay issues, reports that
a gay Marine who was the subject of a profile in The New York Times
Magazine last year appeared in several gay pornographic films while
he was on active duty.
</P>
<P>
   The profile, ``The Shadow Life of a Gay Marine,'' published on
June 28, 1998, in The New York Times Magazine, explored the
difficulties of living a clandestine homosexual life within the
``don't ask, don't tell'' structure of the U.S. military. The
Marine in the article, who insisted on remaining anonymous, was
identified in The Times by his first initial, ``R.'' He did not
inform The Times about the films.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of his film activities came when Capt. Rich
Merritt revealed that he is the Marine in an interview in the Jan.
19 issue of The Advocate. A reader who recognized Merritt from
several films contacted The Advocate, said Judy Wieder, its editor
in chief.
</P>
<P>
   About the disclosure, Adam Moss, editor of The Times Magazine,
said: ``Would we have liked to have known? Of course. But this is a
story about the complications of living under `don't ask, don't
tell,' and this revelation doesn't alter the story's truths.''

ZENGA THINKS HARKES IS WORTH THE RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution have acquired the Major
League Soccer rights to John Harkes, but his concerns are elsewhere
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes will join the Revolution by mid-March if his current
club, Nottingham Forest, fails to exercise an option to buy his
contract from MLS. And Harkes has understandably placed his English
Premier League career above other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Nottingham Forest is preparing for Saturday's match against
Manchester United, and Harkes was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Revolution player-coach Walter Zenga is apparently satisfied
with the possibility of Harkes joining other newcomers such as Dan
Calichman, Kris Kelderman, and Giovanni Savarese, also acquired
from MLS teams, and free agents Brian Bliss, Unisa Conteh, Paulo
Dos Santos, and Ze Rodrigues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter is getting the players he wants,'' assistant coach Sid
Mazzola said. ``They fit the criteria of having leadership
qualities, they are strong players, and they will give the team a
lot on and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, who is in Italy preparing for the team's preseason
training, is comfortable with players whom others consider castoffs
and players who have clashed with coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``These problems can happen with anybody, any player,'' Mazzola
said. ``It's a matter of managing the situation. You can't get
along with everybody, but these are all good guys and they all want
to be winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach has to be in charge,'' Mazzola added. ``Everyone
says Walter did whatever he wanted as a player, but he did whatever
he wanted within parameters. He is a professional. He has a strong
personality and he voices his opinion. But he was not a rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes, 32, has a reputation for being outspoken and potentially
disruptive. But Revolution defender Richard Goulooze, a former
Harkes teammate at Derby County in England, is surprised at the
label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there, he was one of the guys, he did the job, and he
played well,'' Goulooze said. ``A lot of things get blown out of
proportion. He was kicked out of the national team and replaced as
captain at D.C., but those are choices a coach makes. Walter
doesn't worry about someone's reputation as long as you do the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes has mostly been able to produce. He joined Sheffield
Wednesday in 1990 and became the first US player to have success in
the Premier League, scoring a goal in the 1993 League Cup final at
Wembley. In MLS, he helped D.C. United win the 1996 and '97 MLS Cup
championships.
</P>
<P>
   But his reputation suffered when former US national coach Steve
Sampson left him off the team after qualifying for the World Cup
finals last year. Sampson, who had once promoted Harkes as the
team's ``captain for life,'' cited Harkes's hesitancy in changing
positions and accused him of being insubordinate. Harkes, who had
played in two World Cup finals and had a six-year career in Europe,
clashed with Sampson, who had not played professionally and was in
his first major coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different attitude in Europe,'' Goulooze said. ``There
are not a lot of outspoken people in this league, but there are in
Europe. It can bounce back on you if you don't play well. John is
outspoken, but that's not a problem. We all know John and he's won
two championships in D.C.''

TIME WARNER PROFIT DROPS   BY MORE THAN HALF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday that improvements in its
publishing, cable network, entertainment and music divisions during
the fourth quarter helped offset a loss from its satellite
broadcasting business.
</P>
<P>
   The media giant reported a fourth-quarter profit of $90 million,
down from $216 million in the period a year earlier. Per share
earnings were a loss of 17 cents a diluted share after preferred
dividends, better than analysts' expectations. Wall Street had
expected a loss of 19 cents a share. In the fourth quarter of 1997,
Time Warner had an 11 cent profit.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the quarter rose to $4.2 billion from $3.84 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the quarter had been depressed by two unusual
events: the redemption of preferred stock at a premium and
writedowns related to the sale of PrimeStar, its satellite
business, to DirectTV. At the same time the 1997 quarter was
inflated by a one-time sale of assets: Time Warner's investments in
Hasbro and E: Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin continued to emphasize the
company's growth in all its divisions, its ability to generate
cash, to pay down debt and to keep key ratios of debt to cash flow
at low levels. (Cash flow is earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization.)
</P>
<P>
   ``By growing its cash flow and shrinking the amount of capital
invested, Time Warner can generate higher returns on investments,''
said Christopher Dixon, an analyst at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Levin was careful to promise analysts Wednesday that the
company's capital spending would grow only in line with inflation,
so that key ratios would continue to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has been pleased with the company's performance.
Shares of Time Warner rose $2.8125, to $64.0625. The stock has
risen from a 52-week low of $31.59375 on Feb. 6 to a Jan. 20 high
of $67.0625.
</P>
<P>
   The stock's performance has also been helped by Monday's news
that Time Warner had completed a long-rumored joint venture with
AT&AMP;T Corp. They will jointly sell local telephone service over Time
Warner's cable television lines.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that cash flow at its music business, which had
been having severe problems, rose 34 percent, to $205 million for
the quarter. Warner Music had 23 of the year's top 100 best-selling
albums, including releases from Madonna and Alanis Morissette.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing division's cash flow rose 18 percent, to $234
million. Time Warner said the results were bolstered by gains at In
Style, People and Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Levin also noted that the new Teen People magazine had an
extremely successful debut.
</P>
<P>
   At the Entertainment Group, which is 75 percent owned by Time
Warner and 25 percent owned by Media One, cash flow rose 20
percent, to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Turner cable networks reported a 21 percent increase in cash
flow, to $201 million.

BIRDS   OF   PREY COURSE IS NOT FOR SHRINKING VIOLETS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., France, Norway, Japan)  By BARBARA LLOYD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVER CREEK, Colo. _ It has been in use for only a year. But
already the Birds of Prey downhill course in this resort town has
gained a worldwide reputation. Not unlike facing a grizzly bear in
the West, to have skied Birds of Prey is to regale others with a
tale of encounter.
</P>
<P>
   David Kelly, a bartender here, speaks with a certain reverence
about the time last March when he and a buddy sneaked up a side
trail early one morning, then snowboarded down the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were mischievous,'' Kelly said. ``But we agreed, come on,
let's do it. So we hiked up, climbed under the ropes that blocked
it off, and went down in knee-deep powder. Our legs were burning at
the end, but we were just glad we had all that powder to help us
get down the steeps.''
</P>
<P>
   For the men competing here in the downhill and super-G
competitions this week in the world Alpine ski championships, Birds
of Prey is a sheet of near-vertical ice sprayed down with hoses
before race time.
</P>
<P>
   For the likes of Hermann Maier and Lasse Kjus, the two skiers
who tied for gold medals here Tuesday in the super-G, Birds of Prey
is a run to be conquered. But to Bernhard Russi, a gold medalist in
the 1971 and 1972 Olympic downhills who designed the course, it is
a personal triumph. The Birds of Prey course for the two men's
events here is essentially the same, with the downhill starting at
the top of 11,427-foot Beaver Creek mountain and the super-G a
little lower at 10,948.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw Birds of Prey,'' Russi said during an
interview here, ``I told others, I don't want to change the
mountain. But I want to listen to the mountain and see what it
tells me. I could see this was a well-balanced mountain with all
the features you need to ski it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than many of the other famous ski runs Russi has designed _
at Calgary, Alberta, for the 1988 Olympics; Albertville, France,
for the 1992 Games; Lillehammer, Norway, in 1994, and Nagano,
Japan, in 1998 _ Birds of Prey already had a strong personality.
</P>
<P>
   When Vail Resorts, which owns Beaver Creek, received the
go-ahead to stage the 1999 world championships here, Russi walked
the mountain with personnel from the U. S. Forest Service, which
leases the land to Vail. Along the way, he tagged trees with
different colored ribbons to see where the main trail might follow
the fall-line best. Then he watched to see where the snow fell.
</P>
<P>
   Not much more had to be done when he designed the course.
</P>
<P>
   At Screech Owl Jump, a point two-thirds of the way down the
1.6-mile downhill course, Russi thought the runoff was too short
for a decent landing. ``I like to have the possibility of letting
people fly at least 180 feet, and still land on a steep hill and
not on a flat,'' Russi said.
</P>
<P>
   Racers know that their speed is likely to start building at the
Brink, three sharp turns over a natural step in the mountain near
its peak. With a 65 percent incline _ 90 percent is straight up and
down _ the area is steep.
</P>
<P>
   Near Russi's Ride, a spate of open terrain just below the
halfway mark, a racer is likely to reach a speed of 90 miles an
hour. Around the bend at Golden Eagle, about three-quarters of the
way down, a skier is swept into the air for at least 200 feet. He
then heads into the Abyss, a left-hand turn that hurtles him into a
final jump before the finish.
</P>
<P>
   After the races here are over next week, Birds of Prey will be
open to the public, albeit, for experts only. &QL;

JOANN GRILLO, A MEZZO-SOPRANO WITH THE METROPOLITAN OPERA , DIES AT
59 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joann Grillo, a mezzo-soprano who sang in nearly 300
performances with the Metropolitan Opera over a career of some 20
years, died on Monday at Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn. She
was 59 and lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   She had been recuperating from recent surgery when she suffered
a heart attack, said a friend and associate, Samantha La Viale.
</P>
<P>
   Born on May 14, 1939, in New York, Ms. Grillo first won
attention as a singer with the Brooklyn Opera Company in the early
1960s. Reviewing her portrayal of Azucena in Verdi's ``Trovatore''
in 1961, Eric Salzman wrote in The New York Times, ``She showed a
voice of size and quality, and she knew how to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   She made her Met debut as Rosette in Massenet's ``Manon'' in the
fall of 1963. Though she sang occasional leading roles at the Met
(Carmen and Azucena among them), her value to the company was as a
dependable, dramatically involving singer of supporting roles, like
Maddalena in Verdi's ``Rigoletto.'' With other international
companies she was heard in major mezzo-soprano roles, including
Massenet's Charlotte and Verdi's Eboli.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, she and her husband, Richard Kness, a dramatic tenor,
founded the Ambassadors of Opera and Concert Worldwide, an
independent company that brought opera, musicals and vocal concerts
to places as distant as Guam, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Fiji
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The tours were filled with adventure, Ms. Grillo once said in an
interview. As singing actors, she and her husband had to die
standing up on tiny stages, and they once had to pry a member of
their company from an Asian sewer. When they performed in Beijing
one month after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, they drew
criticism in the international press.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grillo is survived by her husband and a son, Jonathan, a
tenor.

 &HT;    By Melissa Turner

<P>
   ATLANTA _ With one-third of Americans claiming that their
impression of the Olympics has been damaged, the International
Olympic Committee is moving swiftly to regain the confidence of the
deep pockets that are affected most by what the public thinks about
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars are at stake. Corporate support has become
the lifeblood of the Games, and organizers of the upcoming Sydney
and Salt Lake City Olympics are worried that the widening scandal
will staunch their corporate fund-raising and force them into
staging cut-rate Games.
</P>
<P>
   They have reason to worry. Roughly one-third of the public is
``totally disgusted'' by the worst corruption scandal in the IOC's
105-year history, according to a new study conducted by Performance
Research, an independent market-research firm in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the respondents to the survey conducted Feb. 1-5 said
they were aware of allegations that Salt Lake City Olympic
officials gave lavish gifts, scholarships and cash to IOC members
in exchange for favorable votes the bid process that decided where
the Games will be held.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the Americans surveyed blame the IOC, rather
than the Salt Lake organization or corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   But while approximately one-third of the 200 respondents say
their overall impressions of the Olympic sponsors have been hurt,
relatively few indicated they are less likely to support those
companies.
</P>
<P>
   That finding could create some cautious optimism among sponsors
who say they are holding on to their checkbooks until the IOC
repairs its reputation and produces credible evidence that the
Olympic brand is not permanently damaged.
</P>
<P>
   If the IOC is to allay the concerns of its corporate
benefactors, it will have to do it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is still $130 million short of the $455 million it need
from sponsors. Salt Lake City needs $245 million more to meet its
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a big challenge for both Sydney and Salt
Lake to reach their financial goals,'' said Bob Heisner, senior
vice president for strategic planning at Advantage International, a
Washington, D.C., marketing consultant that represents Olympic
sponsors. ``And if they don't, the IOC bears some responsibility
for making them whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more important to the Olympic movement, NBC is in
the market now to sell commercial time for its broadcast next fall
of the Sydney Games. NBC is halfway to its estimated $900 million
break-even goal. But even in the best of times, the last half is
twice as hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   The Games' biggest sponsors _ multinational companies such as
Coca-Cola and Eastman Kodak, which are investing as much as $500
million _ have pressed the IOC to conduct its own research to
determine what, if any, damage the scandal has wreaked on the
Olympic image.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the IOC's marketing agency, Meridian Management, is
planning a survey that it hopes will reassure sponsors and
encourage them to sign on for the 2002 and 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure consumers are still excited about the
Olympic Games and they draw a distinction between all this other
stuff and the Games,'' said Terence Burns, senior vice president at
Meridian in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the 11 companies paying an average $50 million each
to sponsor the current 1998-2000 Olympiad have renewed their
sponsorships for the Salt Lake City Winter Games and the Athens
Summer Games: Coca-Cola and Time/Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the IOC and Meridian we wanted that research,'' said
Susan Rosenberg, Olympic spokeswoman for Atlanta-based United
Parcel Service, which has yet to renew its sponsorship. ``We still
are not (subscribing) to the theory that the product is tainted.
We're not going to do a knee-jerk, but we will take a hard look at
what the research tells us.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the U.S. Olympic Committee released the
results of its own national market survey, which it says shows
support for Olympic athletes and the corporations that pay their
way.
</P>
<P>
   But the USOC's survey also showed that the public wants major
changes in the way Olympic host cities are selected and greater
oversight of organizers. The survey found that 73 percent said
``significant changes'' were needed in the host-city selection
process and that 83 percent said Olympic organizing committees
should be watched more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is legitimately concerned,'' said Stephen Disson,
whose Washington, D.C., consulting firm represents several Olympic
sponsors. ``No one is talking about bolting, but they want to get
the thing resolved and behind them as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies will use the current scandal to negotiate lower
prices for sponsorships and seek escape clauses in contracts if the
near-daily embarassing revelations don't stop, Olympic sponsor
consultants say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect sponsors to try to use it to their advantage,''
Heisner said. ``This will potentially affect the price... . My
sense is it will delay things, and that always works ... to the
sponsor's advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports, which has invested $3.5
billion in the next five Olympics, said Wednesday he hasn't felt
the pinch yet. He's made nine Olympic presentations in the last
seven days to potential advertisers for his network's 161-hour
broadcast of the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All nine expressed sentiment they want to enter into
negotiations,'' Ebersol said. ``The Olympics, in terms of viewers
and advertisers, are the athletes and competition. At no reasonable
level does anyone think that has been impacted.''
</P>
<P>
   However, all but two of NBC's signed advertisers are current IOC
and USOC sponsors _ companies that have already paid the
multimillion-dollar entry fee for the Sydney Games. They have to
advertise to protect their investment.
</P>
<P>
   And some media buyers contend their clients who have not yet
bought sponsorships are balking at buying commercial time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this scandal has a long way to go, I would think a
number of advertisers are at the very least going to hold back
now,'' said Gene DeWitt, whose media-buying firm counts several
sponsors among its clients. ``Nobody wants to go to their board of
directors and say they have put $100 million into something that is
embarrassing the company.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWitt and others say there's no doubt the Olympic brand is
tainted _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question there is a value assigned in an Olympic
sponsorship to the wholesomeness and completely uncontroversial
positive quality of what an Olympics has stood for and what an
advertiser stands for,'' DeWitt said. ``And this has been
lessened.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Payne, the IOC's director of marketing in Lausanne, said
this week he too expects sponsors to use the controversy to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When advertising agencies negotiate the prices... they look
for every opportunity to argue that the price should be lower,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Payne contends the public differentiates between ``the backhouse
problems they've been reading about and the Games themselves.
Normally, the IOC doesn't even register on their radar screens, but
now it's out there, and people are aware that there are some
problems. But they're also seeing that steps are being taken to
respond to the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Four IOC members have resigned in disgrace, five others face
expulsion and revelations continue to pour in about questionable
activities.
</P>
<P>
   However, the IOC cleared Sydney of any wrongdoing in connection
with $70,000 in inducements offered to two African IOC members in
1993, on the eve of the Australian capital's selection as host of
the 2000 Summer Games. Initially, the IOC said it would launch a
full investigation, but after reviewing documents of Sydney's bid
with Australian Olympics chief John Coates, it determined the
organizers did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That potential fog had to be lifted in a hurry; they've got to
move,'' observed A.D. Frazier Jr., the former No. 2 official at the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. He is spending next week
in Sydney advising organizers on Games operations.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier said he will suggest areas where Sydney can cut back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have the opportunity,'' he said, ``to reset the
expectations for hospitality surrounding an Olympic Games, which
might be a very good thing driven by these financial challenges _
to set a standard that is appropriate for the Games for the
future.''

 WASHINGTON: on Congress. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On one side in the fight are the formidable lobbying forces of
AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc., two of the most powerful players
in Washington. The companies have an impressive roster of lobbyists
and lawyers who once worked in the federal government and Congress.
They include Cicconi, a former top White House official in Reagan
and Bush administrations and now the general counsel of AT&AMP;T;
Philip L. Verveer, a leading telecommunications lawyer and close
friend of Bill Clinton since their days together at Georgetown
University, whose wife is the chief of staff to Hillary Rodham
Clinton; and Kevin Joseph, who recently stepped down as senior
counsel to Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Tansportation.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition on the other side is being led by Greg Simon, the
former domestic policy adviser to Vice President Gore, and Richard
Bond, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing what Microsoft is accused of doing - building a
system where they say you can't separate the transmission from the
actual content,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the
Washington office of Consumers Union, referring to the government's
antitrust suit filed against the software company. ``They're saying
if you want AOL, we'll let you have it but you have to pay At Home
first. This is precisely what telephone companies can't do. The
request from our side is, Let's open up access to cable wire the
same way we require them to open up for programming.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Federal Communications Commission has
declined to step into the fight but has said it will watch the
situation closely. Officials there say they do not want to do
anything that might impede the progress of upgrading the cable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But cable regulators in a growing number of cities, including
San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, have held hearings and
vowed to consider the issue as franchise licenses are renewed this
year. And one city, Portland, Ore., has blocked AT&AMP;T's cable
venture from moving in without first opening its proposed new
broadband pipeline to rival gateways like America Online. The move
by the city's cable regulators recently prompted the telephone
company to file a lawsuit in federal court there.

DOW UP 92.69 AFTER FED OPTS NOT TO CHANGE RATES
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paced by renewed vigor in technology companies, stock
prices marched higher Wednesday as Federal Reserve policy-makers
left interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed's decision was widely expected, analysts said the
meeting created some early nervousness and then touched off some
late-session profit taking.
</P>
<P>
   In between, however, most major gauges moved steadily higher,
despite the close balance between the number of advances and
declines, 1,645 to 1,391, respectively, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gains have been concentrated, but while we're very narrow, I
still think there is a bias to the upside,'' said Steven Goldman, a
market strategist at Weeden &AMP; Co. And he said there was little
chance of a significant skid. Except for 1981-82, he said, the
market has never in modern times dropped more than 7 percent within
six months of two cuts in the Fed's discount rate, which happened
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.69
points, or 1 percent, to 9,366.81. The technology-laden Nasdaq
composite index rose even more, 29.99 points, or 1.22 percent, to
2,493.41, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index edged up
10.08 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,272.07.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics and computer-component stocks were among the day's
standouts, along with oil drilling and some financials, notably
Chase Manhattan and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which were rumored
to be merger partners. Morgan Stanley rose 2], to 91}, after
trading as high as 95, while Chase rose 2 9/16, to 79].
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, upgraded to ``outperform'' by Morgan Stanley, jumped 2|,
to 36 13/16. It was the second-biggest contributor to the Dow after
AT&AMP;T, which climbed 3 1/16, to 95.
</P>
<P>
   But while hefty gains were posted by an assortment of technology
stocks _ Intel, up 4 1/16; Micron Technology, up 6~; Texas
Instruments, up 4 11/16; Ebay, up 24, and Amazon.com, up 15{ _
others faltered. These included Cisco Systems, which disappointed
some investors with its announcement late Tuesday of earnings just
a penny better than the consensus forecast with no stock split. It
fell 1 17/64, to 111[. Another casualty was 3Com, which fell 6}, to
37].
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking profits in some of the blue-chip technologies,''
said Alan Hoffman, a senior portfolio manager at Value Line Asset
Management. ``It's mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber, which announced a complex alliance with
Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries, gained 1|, to 52. Gains for oil
service companies included Schlumberger, up 2 13/16, to 52 7/16,
and Halliburton, up 2, to 30}, with Exxon, Texaco and Chevron all
gaining more than a point.
</P>
<P>
   Perot Systems, which went public Tuesday at 16, surged 18], to
61~. Berkshire Hathaway A shares rose 2,700 to 76,500, bringing its
gain to 16.5 percent over the last five sessions; Paine Webber
circulated a bullish report on the holding company last week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the analysts pointing to lack of breadth and liquidity in
the market was Kenneth Safian of Safian Investment Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very leveraged economy,'' he said, one implication
being that ``people have to sell stock A to buy stock B.''

WITNESSES TELL JURY OF MURDER DEFENDANT'S TROUBLING EXPLANATIONS

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN AUGUSTINE, Texas _ For years, Marjorie Nugent, an aged,
wealthy widow from Carthage, was virtually inseparable from her
unlikely best friend, one-time mortician Bernie Tiede, a man half
her age.
</P>
<P>
   Ever solicitous, he squired her about town, hired limousines on
her birthday and _ at her expense _ traveled the world.
</P>
<P>
   But after mid-November 1996 a strange thing happened. Nugent
vanished. Prosecutors say that's because Tiede had blasted Nugent
four times in the back with a .22-caliber rifle and stashed her
body in a freezer.
</P>
<P>
   For the next nine months, friends and relatives who asked about
her welfare, were offered Tiede's believable, but vaguely troubling
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   As testimony in Tiede's trial on murder charges entered its
second day Wednesday, witnesses told jurors that a variety of clues
led them to believe something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One of Nugent's neighbors, Sherry McNeely, testified unusual
events took place at Nugent's showplace home during the winter of
1996. The once-fastidiously maintained lawn grew weedy and wild;
the back yard wasn't mowed at all. For the first time, ``there was
a lot of coming and going.''
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, Nugent's pet dog, a black chow, appeared outside
in the dead of winter with all its hair shaved.
</P>
<P>
   But strangest of all were the Christmas decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Nugent publicly celebrated the season by placing
``a couple of soldiers'' on her front porch. At Christmas 1996, the
neighbor testified, the Nugent house was ablaze with lights and a
giant Christmas tree was visible through the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very out of character,'' she said. ``And the tree was
up until the last of March.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Pollard, who was active in the Methodist church at which
Tiede was a lay preacher and sang in the choir, testified she asked
Tiede about Nugent's welfare on a number of occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he told her Nugent was visiting a sister who lived out of
state. Another time he said Louisiana friends had taken her to
their home for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people asked,'' Pollard said, ``and I understood that
she was very ill. This probably was in the spring of '97. Once he
said she was very ill and he was afraid he was losing her.''
</P>
<P>
   Nugent's sister Merrill Rhodes testified that Tiede told her the
older woman had suffered a stroke and been hospitalized at the
Scott and White Hospital in Temple in Bell County. ``He said she
was doing fine and he would bring her home as soon as he
established a staff,'' she said. ``He said he was tired of driving
back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you comfortable with that explanation?'' asked Panola
County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Rhodes said. ``I didn't know what else to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Nugent's cousin, Ruth Cockrell, said she often spent sleepless
nights worrying about Tiede's truthfulness. Her cousin's friend,
she said, had offered a variety of explanations for her absence.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the spring of 1997, Tiede told her Nugent had been
admitted to the Temple hospital for surgery. ``I'll be right with
her,'' Cockrell testified he told her. ``The next day he called
with all the details. He said she was out of surgery and in
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked Cockrell for a favor. He asked her to meet
repairmen who were scheduled to repair a gate at Nugent's house. He
would remain with Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   Cockrell readily agreed, but later realized she didn't have a
key to the gate. She called the Temple hospital to ask Tiede about
the key's whereabouts, but was told Nugent wasn't registered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep a wink that night,'' she recalled from the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   When she queried Tiede about the discrepancy, he replied that
Nugent had been lodged in an old part of the hospital and didn't
have a telephone in her room.
</P>
<P>
   Cockrell said she often felt uneasy about Tiede's stories, but
when she questioned him further, he always allayed her fears. ``He
could give such detail,'' she said. ``Oh, he was convincing, yes,
sir. But too many things just didn't add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid to go to anyone. If I was wrong, I would be
laughed out of Carthage. ... (Still) I just had the feeling that
something was not right.''
</P>
<P>
   About four months later, in mid-August 1997, a Carthage banker
notified Nugent's son, Rod, an Amarillo medical examiner, about the
woman's absence. He authorized law officers to enter the family
home, where they found Nugent's sheet-wrapped body beneath the
vegetables in a chest-style freezer.
</P>
<P>
   If Tiede, 40, is convicted of the 81-year-old woman's slaying,
he could be sentenced to as much as 99 years in prison and fined
$10,000.

THREE BOSTON POLICE OFFICERS FAIL DRUG TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL VASQUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston police department, which began drug testing
of all patrol officers for the first time a month ago, confirmed
Wednesday that three officers have tested positive for illegal
substances in hair analysis taken last month.
</P>
<P>
   Testing began Jan. 4, and so far 197 out of approximately 1,500
patrol officers have been tested for cocaine, marijuana,
amphetamines, morphine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   If the three officers who tested positive flunk a second test,
which they have the option of taking, then they will be suspended
for 45 days, forced to attend drug rehabilitation classes, and
subject to unannounced spot drug tests for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Paul Evans vowed to crack down on any
officer who flunks the second test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have some people who will be suspended
shortly,'' he said. But he acknowledged that such suspensions won't
come immediately. ``It's a lengthy process where there's a likely
to be some false positives.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Detective Margot Hill, the department spokeswoman, would
not discuss the cases specifically but said the three officers,
whom she would not identify, ``have all opted for the second tests
at their own expense.'' The test costs $125; results are known in
about 10 days, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill would not say which drugs were found in the initial tests
of the three officers.
</P>
<P>
   The department won the right in August to test police officers
on their birthdays after a prolonged contract battle with the
Boston Police Patrolmen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat in the corruption area for a police
department _ any police department _ is drugs,'' Evans said earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said that in the past four years, only three officers have
been suspended for drug use. He said the low numbers reflected the
fact that before the patrolmen's union accepted hair analysis
testing, department officials were able to test officers only when
they had a reasonable suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, reasonable testing was not getting it,'' Evans
said. ``I don't think we were dealing with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Nee, president of the patrolmen's union, said he had
not heard that any officers had tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, there are reputations at stake here, and mistakes can
be made,'' Nee said. ``It's just too soon to convict anybody, and
right now I can tell you we stand behind all of our officers.''

FORMER N.H. GOVERNOR HOPEFUL WINS TOP MOCK REGIONAL POST

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ She was never able to make it to Congress. She couldn't
get herself elected governor of the Granite State. But former New
Hampshire state representative Deborah ``Arnie'' Arnesen won a much
higher _ albeit hypothetical _ office Wednesday: She was elected
Governor of the State of New England.
</P>
<P>
   The mock election was part of a conference in Boston to explore
ways for New Englanders to cooperate on common issues, like
education, transportation, and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It coincided with the release of a survey by the New England
Board of Higher Education and the McCormack Institute showing that
New Englanders are eager for more regional cooperation on common
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's candidates for super-governor were eager to give
cooperation a try.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Arnesen, candidates for the fictitious office were
former Massachusetts state senator and gubernatorial candidate
Patricia McGovern, Maine Senate majority leader Chellie Pingree,
former Rhode Island governor Bruce Sundlun, Vermont State Treasurer
James Douglas, and Connecticut Senate President Kevin Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   They had some novel ideas for a new New England.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern argued for pooling all six states' pension funds for
higher returns. Sundlun said the states should remain separate
entities, but join with Quebec and secede from the union.
</P>
<P>
   And New Hampshire's Arnesen came up with a new slogan for a new
state of New England: ``Think Regionally or Die.''

BAY STATE LAGGING IN PREPARING FOR `MILLENNIUM BUG' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State government is slightly behind schedule in
preparing its computer systems for the year 2000 bug, and
Massachusetts as a whole does not have a plan to deal with a
worst-case, crippling loss of power and services.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message delivered Wednesday to a joint legislative
committee gauging where the state stood 238 days before the dawn of
a new millennium that could confound computers from Massachusetts
to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Calling increasing uneasiness over the Y2K problem an issue of
great public concern, David P. Magnani, a Democrat from Framingham,
asked the Cellucci administration to set a deadline for a
contingency plan to deal with a statewide disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people would feel comfortable knowing that if there were
no heat, no light, they could go to the local armory,'' Magnani
said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator told Administration and Finance Secretary Frederick
Laskey that the state's residents deserve an emergency plan that is
``thorough, well-organized, fully ready'' and includes the National
Guard and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although Magnani, cochairman of the Science and Technology
Committee, acknowledged that the chance of disaster might be as
slim as .001 percent, he added that one way to quell panic is to
``get the message out'' that the state is prepared for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts residents need to know, Magnani said, that ``if
the .001 percent happens, we'll have trucks available to pick you
up and take you to a local armory or school, and that we'll clothe
and feed you.''
</P>
<P>
   Laskey, flanked by state officials working on the Y2K bug, said
no serious problems are expected, and the state is engaged in
aggressive outreach to offer help to smaller communities that do
not have the resources and expertise to prepare themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, the Y2K problem centers on the confusion that
many computers could experience on Jan. 1, 2000. Instead of
correctly recognizing the year _ identified by most systems by the
last two digits _ many computers, if unaltered, could read the date
as 1900 and break down or malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to agreeing to develop an emergency plan, Laskey
told legislators that 57 percent of state government's
``mission-critical'' computer systems have been made ``Y2K
compliant.'' The goal had been 65 to 70 percent, said Val Asbedian,
director of a strategic planning group that has been dealing with
the problem since summer 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be made Y2K compliant, Asbedian said, are such critical
agencies as the State Police and the departments of Transitional
Assistance, Corrections, and Revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the slight lag in overall compliance, Laskey said the
``backbone'' of state government is prepared for 2000, including
systems that deal with payroll, the Registry of Motor Vehicles, the
Lottery, and the Department of Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to panic,'' Laskey said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the fiscal year on June 30, Laskey continued, 95
percent of state government computer systems are expected to be
compliant. However, the Department of Public Health and the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which supplies water to
2.5 million residents, are not expected to be ready until late
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Any agency whose ``mission-critical'' systems are not compliant
by the end of the fiscal year will be required to draft worst-case
contingency plans, Laskey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they'll make it, but we want to prepare for the
worst,'' the secretary said. ``But the fact that we're building
contingency plans doesn't mean people should start stockpiling food
and candles.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's major utilities appear ready, officials said.
However, many municipal electric companies do not appear to have
taken the warnings seriously, which could result in isolated power
outages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to turn up the heat on them,'' Laskey said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire safety systems across the state, including call boxes and
alarms, appear to be fine, officials said. And of 10,000 traffic
lights in Massachusetts, 97 percent appear immune to the Y2K bug.
The remaining lights will be fixed or removed before the new year,
lawmakers were told.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci filed a $15 million supplemental budget
last week to help meet Y2K needs. Laskey said the state probably
will need more funds, and that access to the money is needed soon.
</P>
<P>
   Magnani said the Ways and Means chairmen will be approached soon
to determine if the money can be separated from the overall budget
and approved for use quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds, if not thousands, of state employees are grinding
away at this thing,'' Laskey said. ``It's really a full-scale
assault.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no less partisan issue than this one,'' Magnani said,
noting that a lawyers' group has estimated that $1.6 trillion will
be spent nationally on Y2K legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to putting on a full-court press for the next
11 months,'' Magnani said with a smile, ``so we can all enjoy next
New Year's Eve.''

RUSSIAN SPACE STATION TESTING MIRROR THAT DIRECTS BEAM OF LIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday night, a thin beam of light will flash down from outer
space to illuminate dark parts of North America, Europe and Asia if
a Russian space test succeeds _ and if clouds don't get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Many astronomers are protesting the experiment, saying such
developments threaten to produce new kinds of light pollution that
could blind telescopes exploring the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   In the test, astronauts aboard the Russian space station Mir are
to bounce sunlight off an 82-foot mirror and direct the rays toward
the ground, producing beams up to 10 times brighter than the full
moon.
</P>
<P>
   The test is sponsored by a team of Russian companies known as
the Space Regatta Consortium, which foresees swarms of space
mirrors as wide as 650 feet and orbiting up to 3,000 miles high.
The mirrors would be used mainly to light cities. The team also
envisions spaceships with no fuel other than sails of the same
reflective material that would catch sunlight to send the craft
hurtling toward the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror plan and test come as the Russian manned space
program faces severe financial woes. In the past few years NASA has
repeatedly bailed Moscow out. Last month the Russian government
approved a plan to extend the life of the Mir station if private
investors could be found, and the mirror consortium is eagerly
trying to win financial backers as well.
</P>
<P>
   If no funding is found, Moscow plans to bring the Mir down this
summer and focus resources on building a new International Space
Station with 16 nations, led by the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror test is known as Znamya, Russian for banner. It is to
begin Thursday at 5:04 a.m., eastern time, when a progress supply
ship undocks from Mir carrying the mirror. While orbiting more than
200 miles up, its thin metal and plastic parts are to unfurl like
the pedals of a flower to reflect sunlight and produce a beam of
light on the ground a few miles wide. At least eight cities are to
be illuminated.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:12 a.m., the beam is to fall on Karaganda, Kazakhstan; at
1:56 p.m., on Frankfurt, Germany; at 6:56 p.m., on Quebec City; and
at 8:32 p.m. on Devil's Lake, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   The Mir astronauts will try to keep the beam trained on ground
targets for one or two minutes at a time. A ground map of the
beam's path and an article on the Znamya project can be found at
the Sky &AMP; Telescope Web site, at www.skypub.com. The February issue
of Sky &AMP; Telescope has an article on the mirror venture.
</P>
<P>
   During the program's debut in 1993, Russian scientists sent a
narrow beam of reflected sunlight flashing across the darkened side
of the Earth. That beam, however, was dimmer than planned because
of difficulties in assembling the thin mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiments have been criticized by many astronomers,
including those at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   The project's architects make no apologies, however.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to astronomers on the consortium's Web site
(src.space.ru), they say that such ``extremist experiments'' will
someday give scientists ``unique tools for real exploration of the
farthest corners of the universe.''

SBC TO OPEN ASSAULT ON BOSTON MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bell Atlantic Corp.'s monopoly on local phone service
is coming under fresh assault on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications Corp., the nation's second-largest regional
phone carrier, is expected to announce Friday plans to enter the
Boston market, initially offering business customers local and
long-distance service. It would mark the first time a Bell company
is invading the turf of another regional Bell company in local and
long-distance services.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MCI Worldcom Inc. said Wednesday it will immediately
begin offering residential local phone service throughout New York
state by leasing phone lines from Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Baby Bells, Bell Atlantic, the New York-based carrier
that serves the East Coast, faces increasing competition from
rivals eager to offer local and long-distance phone service.
Competition has been unleashed following passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both MCI Worldcom and SBC are among a growing number of
telecommunications companies pursuing Bell Atlantic's most
lucrative customers. Each plans to offer a combination of local,
long-distance and high-speed Internet services that will be
packaged in a single customer bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic wants to grow by offering long-distance service in
the 13 states its serves, but cannot do so until it demonstrates to
federal and state regulators that it has opened up its local phone
market to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In a new sign that local competition is emerging, San Antonio,
Tex.-based SBC _ the most acquisitive of the Baby Bells _ says it
plans to enter the Boston, Miami and Seattle markets. SBC could
begin offering a combination of local, long distance and high speed
Internet service over phone lines as early as year-end, said David
R. Lopez, vice president of regulatory affairs for SBC's ``national
group'', which plans to enter a total of 15 new markets around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   SBC is the only Baby Bell pursuing a national strategy for
conventional local and local distance calling.
</P>
<P>
   The company is hedging its plans to enter Boston, Miami and
Seattle by saying the expansion depends on gaining federal and
state regulatory approvals by the summer for its proposed
acquistion of Ameritech, the Midwest regional Bell company
headquartered in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If the SBC-Ameritech deal fails to gain regulatory approvals,
SBC would halt its expansion plans, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, once known as Southwestern Bell Co., has grown by acquiring
Pacific Telesis Group, which serves California and Nevada, and
Connecticut-based Southern New England Telephone Co. SBC's
immediate goal is to sign up 174 large corporate customers _ all
Fortune 500 companies _ headquartered in either SBC or Ameritech
states that collectively have 2,267 locations in greater Boston. It
also is targeting another 50 big companies with operations in Miami
and Seattle. Together, the 224 corporations spend nearly $125
million annually with SBC and Ameritech in local and long-distance
telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   After establishing itself with business customers outside its
home territory, SBC plans to pursue residential customers, Lopez
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we have our network aligned and completed, we could,
perhaps, provide service to a Fortune 500 client and a few miles
away to Aunt June and her family,'' said Lopez, adding that the
recently formed SBC national group, expects to expand to 8,000
employees within three years from a dozen now.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, MCI Worldcom is focused on selling to residential
customers in New York immediately. It expects to sign up a maximum
of 200 Bell Atlantic customers per day. The limit is based on Bell
Atlantic's ability to process the large volumes of customer service
orders it receives from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic is confident that the long distance giant's
decision to work with us rather than against us will produce new
growth opporunities for both companies,'' said James G. Cullen,
Bell Atlantic's president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think MCI's entry into the New York market should go a long
way to give us a good idea of exactly where we are and what we
still need to do to get competition really cranking.,'' said Jeff
Kagan, an Atlanta-based telecommunications analyst.

 PATIENT HOME CARE INADEQUATE, STUDY SAYS
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS

<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BOSTON _ Many Massachusetts doctors say their chronically ill
patients aren't getting the home care they need because of
insurance and government cutbacks, and they complain that
communicating with home service providers is often frustrating and
bogged down in paperwork, a pioneering survey has found.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, commissioned by the Massachusetts Medical Society,
painted a picture of an increasingly crucial system of medical care
_ centered in the home, not the hospital _ that needs significant
improvement, officials said in releasing the results Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurers are using it more often, in part because of the
pressure to get patients out of the hospital sooner,'' said Dr. B.
Dale Magee, chairman of a society committee that carried out the
study. ``But one of our concerns is that in trying to get control
of budgets, some cuts have been made across the line'' _ both in
hospital and in home care services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of the physicians felt that on occasion they
thought their patients didn't have enough home health coverage,''
he added. The survey sought opinions of from 6,500 physicians in 21
specialties. Ninety percent said they prescribed home health care
services.
</P>
<P>
   Federal budget cuts have slowed a move to have Medicare cover
more home care for the aging population, said Patricia Kelleher,
executive director of the Home Health Care Association of
Massachusetts, which she said represents 85 to 90 percent of the
approximately 150 home health agencies in the state.
</P>
<P>
   She said in an interview that the survey will be nationally
important because Massachusetts physicians ``have made a statement
that the availability and quality of home health care is an
essential part of their ability to practice medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Home care includes everything from nursing visits to infusing
drugs to wound care to meals, homemaking and social work. Insurers
like Medicare may cover home care if it is to help acutely ill
patients recover, but are less likely to cover care for people who
are simply ``aging in place,'' said Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   The medical society survey showed that many physicians were
frustrated by the difficulty of getting information about the
condition of patients receiving home care, said Magee. Some of that
information is contained in paperwork that doesn't reach the doctor
until it's well out of date, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be connected more, to work with the home health
care agencies to improve timely communications,'' said Magee.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said her association and the medical society have
agreed to work together to ``streamline paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed that doctors usually choose a home health
agency because of its affiliation with a hospital. They said they
were, in general, ``less than moderately involved'' with the choice
of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new federal mandate, home health care agencies must
report the success of their handling of various types of medical
problems, to be compiled into a database. Ultimately, that
information will be available to individual consumers, said
Kelleher.

SENATE FACES CRITICAL IMPEACHMENT VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The impeachment storm intensified Wednesday as the
Senate braced for a series of pivotal votes Thursday, and Democrats
vowed to wage a potentially protracted war next week on a
Republican plan to formally cite President Clinton for wrongdoing
before his trial ends.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their cry for an immediate end to the saga, Senate
Democrats threatened to stall the trial with a blizzard of
parliamentary maneuvers if GOP leaders pursue their plan to
sanction Clinton during the proceeding rather than convicting him.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, which dashed Republican hopes of crafting a
bipartisan punishment, came as House impeachment managers completed
questioning White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal in their third
and final deposition. The managers plan to ask the Senate Thursday
to call all three witnesses, including Monica S. Lewinsky, to
testify in person, as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The request for witnesses, which faces opposition in both
parties, was considered as endangered as the Republican bid for a
bipartisan ``finding of fact'' of Clinton's wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assailed the finding of fact plan in a dawn-to-dusk
barrage of news conferences, press releases, and a scathing opinion
piece in The Washington Post by the dean of Senate Democrats,
Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-backed findings would state that Clinton falsely
testfied before a federal grand jury and wrongfully impeded a
sexual harassment lawsuit that Paula Corbin Jones filed against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are findings of fiction,'' said Senator Edward M.
Kennedy. ``This is really a desperate attempt by the Republicans to
save face. It's a desperate attempt to further embarrass the
president of the United States. And it's an attempt to save their
own political positions in preparation for the final votes on the
articles of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Senate Republicans, who met Wednesday night in their
ongoing struggle to unify their members behind the alternative
sanction, conceded the ``finding of fact'' plan could wither in the
heat of Democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Without Democratic backing, ``it's not worth it,'' said Senator
Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican and key proponent of the plan.
``It's not what we are trying to achieve _ another party-line
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans also made a formal request Wednesday night
for Clinton to testify voluntarily at the trial, which the White
House has rejected. ``Your knowledge, intent, actions and omissions
are central to the charges,'' the GOP senators wrote in a letter to
Clinton. ``Personal answers from you should prove beneficial in our
efforts to reconcile conflicting testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``finding of fact'' showdown, several key Republicans
Wednesday voiced opposition to the plan, further threatening its
chances of reaching the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, said the
``finding of fact'' proposal ``may not be unconstitutional,'' as
Democrats have charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a mistake,'' Gregg said. ``It creates a new path
where the legislative branch can discipline the executive branch
inappropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said the plan
remained viable, and he disputed the assertion by Senator Thomas A.
Daschle, the minority leader, that no Democrats would supprt it.
Lott also downplayed GOP concerns about the apparent lack of
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has to be'' bipartisan, he said. ``You need
over 50 votes for it to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The slowing momentum for the Republican plan gave some impetus
to a Democratic-sponsored proposal to censure Clinton after the
trial. Daschle appointed Senators Dianne Feinstein of California
and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York Wednesday to develop
language for a censure resolution that could appeal to both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared to have a `finding' after we finish the
constitutional process,'' said Senator John F. Kerry. ``But don't
bastardize ... the constitutional process itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish over how to sanction Clinton unfolded as the 13
House Republican impeachment managers ended the deposition phase of
their search for new evidence against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A source said Blumenthal did not stray from his previous sworn
testimony that Clinton had lied to him about the president's sexual
affair with Lewinsky, telling Blumenthal that Lewinsky stalked him
and he rebuffed her.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lewinsky and Clinton's friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr. also
gave the House team little more to go on in their depositions the
previous two days, the managers vowed to ask senators to call the
three witnesses to testify before the Senate _ and the network
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to have a verdict that will withstand the
test of history, these witnesses should come forward, and they
should be put under oath live on the Senate floor,'' said
Representative James F. Rogan of California, who led the
questioning of Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   But the House managers, sensing their request could be rejected,
also were crafting a ``fall-back'' request to show portions of the
videotaped depositions on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough to make that case'' for witnesses
testifying in person, said Representative Asa Hutchinson of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe, for example, Wednesday joined several other Republicans
who have expressed opposition to calling the witnesses.
``Personally, I am not going to support appearances of witnesses
before the US Senate,'' Snowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the trial rules, which the Senate's Republican majority
pushed through last week on a party-line vote, the proceedings will
resume Thursday, with a series of motions, including the witness
question.
</P>
<P>
   The session is scheduled to begin with the Senate taking up any
objections that were left unresolved during the depositions. A
source said the only objection that was not resolved arose
Wednesday, when a House manager, Representative Lindsey O. Graham
of South Carolina, asked Blumenthal whether he had made statements
about Kathleen E. Willey, a former White House volunteer who
claimed Clinton groped her in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A White House lawyer objected on the grounds that the Willey
case is not under consideration by the Senate. However, Clinton's
lawyers, who posed no questions in Blumenthal's deposition, are not
expected to press the objection on the Senate floor because they do
want to attract additional attention to the Willey allegation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, House managers are expected to file the first
motion Thursday, asking the Senate to make public the videotapes
and transcripts of the depositions. Lott's spokesman, John
Czwartacki, said the motion could call for keeping the material
under seal for a brief ``cooling off'' period.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing the videotapes would likely produce a new chapter of
Lewinsky lore and drive up some television ratings. Lewinsky has
never been seen publicly discussing the circumstances stemming from
her affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Democrats will fight releasing the videotape until
the trial is over. ``I don't think it would serve Ms. Lewinsky or
the Senate or the trial to release it to the public until after the
trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote on releasing the material, the witness question
is likely to be debated. If the Senate rejects witnesses and the
videotaped alternative, closing arguments could begin by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The ``finding of fact'' motion would follow the closing
arguments and precede the final deliberations on the two articles
of impeachment. With Clinton expected to be acquitted, members of
both parties said they want an alternative sanction to condemn
Clinton for his actions and dampen the president's enthusiasm for
reacting gleefully to an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   The White House addressed part of the concern. ``In a
post-impeachment era, this is a gloat-free zone,'' said White House
spokesman Joseph Lockhart.

GOVERNOR WEIGHS DEATH-ROW INMATE'S APPEAL FOR CLEMENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Those who want to see the life of Jaturun
Siripongs spared include his former prison warden, the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Sacramento, a juror who voted to convict him and
the husband of one of the two people Siripongs was sentenced to
death for murdering 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of how long or influential the list of people
asking for mercy for Siripongs, a former Buddhist monk, it will
make little difference if the name of Gov. Gray Davis is not on it.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a stay, the last thing standing between
Siripongs and execution is the word of Davis, and that has put the
new governor and his administration under tremendous pressure from
both sides of the emotionally and politically charged debate over
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs, who is 43, is scheduled to be executed next Tuesday.
He has asked California's first Democratic governor in 16 years for
mercy, or at least for time for his lawyers to pursue evidence of
innocence. Davis' Republican predecessor, Pete Wilson, last year
denied a request for clemency from Siripongs, whose life was saved
by a stay. But experts in the politics of capital punishment say
that Davis also seems likely to deny clemency. no matter the merits
of Siripongs plea or the recent actions of Missouri governor, Mel
Carnahan, a supporter of capital punishment, who granted clemency
to a condemned triple murderer after a request from Pope John Paul
II. Davis is a practicing Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the political cost to Gray Davis would be enormous if
he grants clemency,'' said Gerald Uelman, a law professor at Santa
Clara University. ``We're in a state where death penalty politics
has a heavy hand in gubernatorial politics, and we've seen
Democratic candidates, again and again, become vulnerable to the
issue. But Davis got past it by taking a very strong position in
favor of the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to help stave off his Republican opponent in last year's
campaign, the staunch death penalty proponent and state attorney
general, Dan Lungren, then lieutenant governor. Davis frequently
stated his support for capital punishment and his willingness to
carry it out. To do otherwise now, the experts say, appears to be
too great of a political risk for the famously cautious politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' said Franklin Zimring, a law professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, ``no one has ever been
defeated for election by allowing an execution to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Siripongs is Davis' first life-and-death decision as
governor and it probably will not be his last. With more than 500
men and women on its death row, California has more condemned
inmates than any other state. And although just five inmates have
been executed in California since the nation resumed executions 23
years ago, the frequency of executions here appears to be on the
verge of speeding up. The case of the Buddhist and the governor is
being watched closely for any clues into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the pipeline is loosening up,'' said Michael
Rushford, the president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a
California group that advocates enforcement of the death penalty,
``and this governor is probably going to have more opportunities to
review more capital cases than any governor since the '60s and
probably more than any governor in the history of California.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rushford calls Siripongs ``a poster boy for capital
punishment,'' because ``he killed two people without giving it a
second thought,'' Siripongs' supporters say that he is an ideal
candidate for clemency. He has been on death row since 1983 and has
a spotless prison record. According to his clemency petition,
several prison guards and a former warden support mercy for the
soft spoken native of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   And from the day he was locked up shortly after the murders in
1981, his supporters say that Siripongs has been filled with
remorse about the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his supporters say there is another important reason why
he should be granted clemency. Siripongs, they say, has never
killed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In recent court filings, Siripongs' lawyers, Linda Schilling and
Michael Laurence, contend that Siripongs had an accomplice who
committed the murders in Garden Grove, Calif. In fact, the lawyers
say, Siripongs was cut on his arm and hands trying to stop the
killing, a contention he has held since the beginning of the case.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers want Siripongs' execution to be at least postponed
so blood found at the scene can be tested to determine if it
matches a second possible suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Rushford said the case has been reargued for years and
Siripongs' sentence should be carried out without further delay.
Lance Lindsey, of Death Penalty Focus of California, a group
opposed to capital punishment, said that there are still too many
unanswered questions and that ``the case of clemency is
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of people most deeply affected by the killings, the
family members of the dead, are divided. At Siripongs' clemency
hearing on Tuesday, Vitoon Harusadangkul, the son of one of the
victims, Packovan Wattanaporn, said he wanted the execution to go
forward. But his stepfather, Mrs. Wattanaporn's husband, Surachai
Wattanaporn, supports clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Buddhist,'' he wrote in a letter last year to Wilson, ``I
do not seek revenge for my wife's death and ask you to please
consider exercising mercy in this case.''

 &HT;    Proposal for anti-doping agency eludes officials
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Olympic guardians conceded Wednesday
that they won't be able to push through a proposal to create an
international anti-doping agency and impose uniform penalties for
drug use when the World Conference on Doping in Sport ends today.
</P>
<P>
   What they will produce probably will be called the Lausanne
Declaration on Doping in Sport, little more than a written
consensus from the invited delegates to seek formation of the
agency. Everything else is open to debate over the next several
months _ from control and directorship of the agency to funding and
location.
</P>
<P>
   The only likelihood is, IOC vice president Dick Pound said, ``We
want this up before the Sydney Games (in 2000).''
</P>
<P>
   The action will fall short of the pre-conference proposal,
written by the International Olympic Committee, which called for
the IOC to assume almost total control and put president Juan
Antonio Samaranch at the head of the agency. But the IOC has been
caught in a scandal over the selection of cities that has led to
the resignation of four members, with expulsions likely to come. So
the idea of it overseeing such an ethically touchy issue as doping
in sport stirred vigorous opposition from national leaders,
athletes and the scientific community during the first two days of
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Pound refused to answer whether plans were scrapped because of
the lack of confidence demonstrated in the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he expressed surprise at the level of interest voiced
by public authorities in the proposed agency, saying it moved the
IOC to play a lesser role while broadening the influence of
governments and outside groups. The involvement of the United
Nations might be sought, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became increasingly clear that the public authorities
really wanted to be involved,'' Pound said. ``That was the element
of surprise. I thought it might be one of these arrangements where
we would do our thing with an agency, then hope the public
authorities would either work with the agency or come along
later.''
</P>
<P>
   The original proposal called for a one-sixth role on the
agency's council by international governments. Pound suggested that
it could end up a 50-50 split with the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's level of control will hold great sway over the
agency's credibility. Because the IOC initially planned to pay the
$25 million start-up cost, Samaranch wasn't eager to put it outside
his domain, and he endorsed Prince Alexandre de Merode, head of the
IOC medical commission, to run the agency. The proposal met with
considerable opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Another unsettled issue is the minimum penalty for a doping
offense. While most individual sports federations generally back a
strict two-year ban, leaders of soccer, cycling and tennis have
resisted. Under consideration is a proposal requiring a two-year
ban for an athlete caught using steroids, although officials
acknowledge that special circumstances with selected federations
and national laws might take precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Olympic movement stridently oppose a
watered-down proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (soccer) can't accept the rules of the IOC, then they can't
be part of the IOC,'' said Roland Baar of Germany, silver-medalist
in rowing at the Atlanta Games and an elected member of the IOC
Athletes' Commission.

EDITORIAL:   FEDERAL LEADERSHIP ON EDUCATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 4:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread anxiety about crumbling schools and
incompetent teachers, Republicans have argued for years that the
federal government has only a limited role in public education. The
Clinton administration has countered the ``local control''
philosophy with a series of fiscally modest but symbolically
important initiatives aimed at public school problems endemic to
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the administration pushed through the preliminary
phase of an initiative to hire 100,000 new teachers _ to enable
districts to bring crowded classes down to a manageable size.
President Clinton now wants Congress to finance the second phase of
hiring and has proposed additional measures to help end social
promotion, rebuild crumbling public schools and insure that as many
classes as possible are led by qualified teachers. The policies
call for modest funding _ and are appropriately targeted at the
poorest communities.
</P>
<P>
   The most misunderstood provision calls for an end to social
promotion, the process of passing children on to the next grade
even if they have failed academically. Clinton deliberately couched
it as a proposal for making children repeat grades, to please the
most conservative listeners. But the fine print calls for ending
social promotion ``in a way that gives students who need it
substantial extended learning time'' to help them succeed. Clinton
wants to triple federal funding, from $200 million to $600 million,
for after-school and summer school programs.
</P>
<P>
   The package contains an additional $200 million in federal aid
to help the states reform failing public schools and requires
failing schools to adopt explicit discipline policies and
performance examinations for all new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office announced a few years ago that
crumbling schools around the country would require a minimum of
$112 billion just to be put in safe working order. The Clinton
administration wants to prime the pump with a novel plan that would
pay the interest on up to $22 billion in school construction bonds
for the poorest communities. The states and localities would be
responsible for repaying the principal. But the federal government
would issue tax credits to individuals who purchased the bonds in
lieu of interest on the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   There will be pressure in Congress to drop these projects as
liberal big-government programs or to defang the income
restrictions so that rich communities could raid the fund. But
these proposals astutely leverage small amounts of federal dollars
to spark construction and school reform in the areas that most
desperately need it.  &QL;

EDITORIAL:   SIZING THE POLICE FORCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 4:
 &UR;  &LR;  New York City has the largest police force and one of the lowest
crime rates for major cities in this country. The question is
whether those two facts are related, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is
banking that they are. His latest budget expands the force by 1,500
officers at a cost of $32 million because, as he puts it: ``The
strategy is working. Why back away from it now?''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also argues that these new officers would be added six
months later anyway. He is merely accelerating the addition of
police academy graduates, he says, to help curb property crimes and
to replace officers expected to retire next year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts seem conflicted about whether more police are always
better. The city's Independent Budget Office noted in a recent
report that Washington D.C. has the highest number of police
officers per capita yet has the third-highest crime rate in the
country. Eli Silverman at John Jay College of Criminal Justice told
Dan Barry of The Times that while the mayor deserves support for
adding police, ``The truth is, I don't know when we'll hit
diminishing returns until we hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the mayor's success rate, it makes sense to support a
winning streak. However, adding police officers should mean adding
people to patrol streets or to help fight crime, not to keep books
or answer phones or write letters.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller Alan Hevesi released a report this week arguing that
New York City could save $36.2 million by freeing 1,257 officers to
return to crime-fighting and replacing them with civilians. The
report cites such examples as an officer earning $82,800 while
performing a bookkeeping job that would earn a civilian only
$34,000. The mayor says that more civilians are being added and
that the Hevesi report is out of date.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are still too many uniformed officers
working as clerks, secretaries, custodians and telephone operators
_ a far higher percentage of officers working in such jobs than in
other cities.
</P>

   Given the importance of safety to New York's revival, it is
worth giving Giuliani a chance to accelerate the addition of more
police. But he should replace officers who retire from or leave
support jobs with civilian workers _ to help hold down costs and
keep police strength steady.

EDITORIAL:   NEW HOPE FOR EAST TIMOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 4:
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's forcible annexation of East Timor 23 years ago has
brought death and devastation to the territory's people and has
been criticized by most of the world's governments. So it is
encouraging that Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, now says he
would consider granting the territory independence later this year
if his offer of autonomy under Indonesian rule is not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing and manner of any Indonesian exit must be
carefully planned. After nearly a quarter-century of repression,
East Timor needs a chance to regain its balance and disarm the
warring parties. East Timor's people should be allowed to determine
their own future through an internationally monitored referendum.
This should be held after Indonesian-backed paramilitary fighters
as well as pro-independence guerrillas have been disarmed and most
Indonesian troops withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor was a Portuguese colony until Indonesia grabbed it
after Portugal's 1974 revolution. The territory's history, culture
and religion make it unlike the rest of the Indonesian archipelago.
Jakarta's efforts to subdue the territory have been vigorously and
persistently resisted. A third of East Timor's population died from
war, famine or disease in the early years of Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbon and Indonesia's leadership are now engaged in talks
sponsored by the United Nations over the territory's future.
Portugal's role has been positive, trying to compel Indonesia to
take more account of Timorese concerns. But the people Jakarta
really needs to negotiate with are Timorese leaders themselves.
Having refused to budge for two decades on the question of East
Timor's political status, Jakarta must now move carefully and
responsibly toward a referendum.  &QL;

IT'S AT&AMP;T VS. AOL IN LOBBYING WAR OVER HIGH-SPEED INTERNET
CONNECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Calif., Ore., Wash.) 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (fe) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As AT&AMP;T Corp. aggressively enters the cable
business, with plans to offer high-speed Internet connections to
millions of American homes, a growing group of rivals and consumer
groups has begun a nationwide lobbying effort to force the
telephone giant to open its system to Internet competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The fight pits AT&AMP;T, which has struck cable deals in recent
months that will give it access to nearly half of the nation's
homes, against a coalition led by America Online, the world's
largest internet service provider with 15 million customers. It has
also drawn a large group of companies that are the Internet
gateways for millions of Americans, as well as some prominent
former Washington officials who are now lobbyists working for the
telephone industry, the cable industry and the Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest issue in the whole technology
communications realm,'' said Charles M. Brewer, chairman and chief
executive of MindSpring Enterprises Inc., an Internet service
provider with about 340,000 subscribers, which has joined with
America Online, US West, MCI WorldCom and others on Wednesday in
formally announcing their coalition, called OpenNet.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is expected to receive approval from federal regulators as
early as this month to complete its $31 billion acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., a leading cable company. Earlier this
week, AT&AMP;T also reached an agreement with Time Warner to offer
local telephone service through that company's cable systems, which
serve 12 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   By marrying cable and the Internet, AT&AMP;T will be able to offer
consumers throughout the nation the ability to navigate through the
World Wide Web at speeds up to 100 times as fast as those provided
by ordinary telephone lines. With high-speed service delivered over
cable modems, images on personal computers appear so fast that they
resemble television screens, a prospect that holds the promise of
significantly expanding commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch. AT&AMP;T intends to require that any customer
who subscribes to its high-speed cable modem service must also pay
a monthly fee of $40 or so for the Internet access that will be
provided by At Home Corp., of which AT&AMP;T will be the largest
shareholder after it completes its acquisition of TCI.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted protests by other Internet providers, who fear
they may be frozen out and who complain that AT&AMP;T will control the
computer standards on the Internet for video, audio and other kinds
of transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say the outcome of the battle _ which is just
beginning before regulators and Congress here and in courts and
municipalities around the nation _ may determine whether the
Internet will continue to be a free-wheeling technology or will be
dominated by a handful of large corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   And both say the fight will determine the speed with which the
Internet develops into a more accessible force in commerce,
entertainment and research, as well as which companies survive the
shakeout of the nascent industry and which profit the most as the
Internet matures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet would not be happening but for the fact that
consumers can now choose their service provider in an unimpeded
way,'' Brewer said. ``If we had to rely the owners of the last mile
of transmission, it's unquestionable that the Internet would not
have developed as it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at AT&AMP;T and the cable companies respond that America
Online and other competitors are trying to muscle in and make use
of technological improvements to the cable systems that are
requiring investments of billions of dollars. They say there will
be plenty of other providers of high-speed access to the Internet,
such as digital telephone technology and satellites. Moreover, they
say, customers will be able to use other Internet providers on
their system, although the customers will have to pay extra.
</P>
<P>
   The executives of AT&AMP;T and its cable allies contend that
revenues from At Home will help to defray the huge capital costs
associated with upgrading the cable system and that the cable
companies did not develop the technology simply to provide what
they call a ``dumb pipeline'' for competitors to take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the fight is over the most valuable real estate of the
Internet, the desktop, which holds the promise of delivering
advertising, commerce and entertainment on an unparalleled new
scale. Consequently, the struggle is as much over pixels as it is
over pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain arrogance to their position, which confuses
what's good for AOL with what's good for the Internet,'' said James
W. Cicconi, general counsel and head of government relations at
AT&AMP;T. ``It's certainly disingenuous and borders on hypocrisy to say
for years that the government should stay out of regulating the
Internet and then suddenly invite the government in when their
business interests change. This is just a very big competitive
player trying to disadvantage a smaller player that came up with a
better idea.''
</P>
<P>
   While scores of companies are trying to develop higher-speed
Internet service through telephones and satellites, some experts
believe that cable modems ultimately hold the greatest promise of
making the World Wide Web much faster, and therefore much more
attractive to computer users and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   At least 350,000 homes _ some estimates run as high as 700,000 _
now have some kind of high speed Internet service, according to a
study released on Wednesday by the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts like Forrester Research Inc. estimate that by the
end of 2002, 16 million American households will have high-speed
computer connections to the Internet, and nearly 80 percent of
those will be through cable-based providers like At Home and its
top competitor, Road Runner, a unit of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Although some analysts and executives involved in the fight
believe the regulatory war is simply a sideshow to a possible
commercial settlement, both AT&AMP;T and AOL are prepared to spend
millions of dollars for lobbying and legal expenses and have
retained a number of the biggest lobbying and press relations firms
in Washington and around the nation. The fight is being waged on
four fronts: in Congress, at the Federal Communications Commission,
before local cable regulators in cities around the country, and in
the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have lined up with AOL, contending that AT&AMP;T and
the cable companies are attemping to control the content of what
passes through their wires, just as they tried to control what
programs appeared on their channels before that practice was
prohibited by an act of Congress.

   &UR; BC-CABLE-TV-INTERNET-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: on Congress. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On one side in the fight are the formidable lobbying forces of
AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc., two of the most powerful players
in Washington. The companies have an impressive roster of lobbyists
and lawyers who once worked in the federal government and Congress.
They include Cicconi, a former top White House official in Reagan
and Bush administrations and now the general counsel of AT&AMP;T;
Philip L. Verveer, a leading telecommunications lawyer and close
friend of Bill Clinton since their days together at Georgetown
University, whose wife is the chief of staff to Hillary Rodham
Clinton; and Kevin Joseph, who recently stepped down as senior
counsel to Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition on the other side is being led by Greg Simon, the
former domestic policy adviser to Vice President Gore, and Richard
Bond, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing what Microsoft is accused of doing - building a
system where they say you can't separate the transmission from the
actual content,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the
Washington office of Consumers Union, referring to the government's
antitrust suit filed against the software company. ``They're saying
if you want AOL, we'll let you have it but you have to pay At Home
first. This is precisely what telephone companies can't do. The
request from our side is, Let's open up access to cable wire the
same way we require them to open up for programming.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Federal Communications Commission has
declined to step into the fight but has said it will watch the
situation closely. Officials there say they do not want to do
anything that might impede the progress of upgrading the cable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But cable regulators in a growing number of cities, including
San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, have held hearings and
vowed to consider the issue as franchise licenses are renewed this
year. And one city, Portland, Ore., has blocked AT&AMP;T's cable
venture from moving in without first opening its proposed new
broadband pipeline to rival gateways like America Online. The move
by the city's cable regulators recently prompted the telephone
company to file a lawsuit in federal court there.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER:   SOMETIMES FOLDING IS THE BETTER PART OF

<TEXT>
<P>
   Good legislators generally make bad presidential candidates, and
politicians who try to ignore this rule have a way of winding up
unemployed. Wednesday, the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt,
officially came to grips with both realities by dropping out of
contention for the Democratic nomination. That leaves Bill Bradley
with the responsibility of giving Democrats someone to turn to in
desperation when they experience inevitability panic over the
ascendancy of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a sad moment for Gephardt, one of the many
50-something members of Congress whose political clocks are
starting to tick alarmingly. But it made a lot of other people
happy. Gore, who has been relentlessly placating the minority
leader for more than a year, was of course relieved. The House
Democrats, who are just six seats short of a majority, are
delighted that Gephardt is going to lead their campaign effort in
2000. But Gephardt's friends and family must be happy as well. You
don't want to see a loved one wandering around New Hampshire
shopping malls and morphing into Lamar Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Gephardt has shown every sign of becoming very good at
his current job. During the impeachment debate he rounded up all
but five of the Democrats for Bill Clinton, a man who enjoys the
personal loyalty of approximately half a dozen members of his
party. The recent example of Newt Gingrich has taught Congress that
a party is better off if its top Congressional leader does not have
a whole lot of personality, and on that count Gephardt certainly
fits the bill.
</P>
<P>
   American history is full of stories about legislative leaders
who set their sights on the White House and came to grief, from
Henry Clay to Bob Dole. The qualities necessary to pass bills _
attention to detail, love of the artful compromise, the inclination
to keep promises _ get in the way during a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The characteristics that are important in a run for president _
star quality, willingness to abdicate control of your life to
handlers, an agile attitude toward facts _ are not much use in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Al Gore is absorbing campaign contributions the way
the Titanic took on water, the news that Gephardt had decided to
pass up the chance to challenge him was not exactly earth-shaking.
Still, Gephardt got a few days' mileage out of the announcement,
which proceeded from probably-not to aides-say-not to a speech in
the Capitol where he conclusively demonstrated that he had made the
right career move. It was a stately march of non-candidacy, much
like Colin Powell's, except Gephardt lacked a book to flog.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much of a history of great declarations of
non-candidacy, mainly because the population of people who might
conceivably be asked to run consists almost entirely of men and
women who have been dying to be president since they were elected
to student council in junior high.
</P>
<P>
   The big decliners have almost all been generals. William
Tecumseh Sherman gave his name to the ultimate refusal when he
telegraphed the Republican nominators in 1884 that if nominated he
would not run, and if elected he would not serve. (The Republicans
went instead with Sen. James Blaine, a legislative guy, and lived
to regret it.) Until we have another hero-producing war, Colin
Powell probably will be the last of the general refusers.
</P>
<P>
   It took a very bad campaign to convince Ted Kennedy that he was
actually a legislative guy at heart. The most colorful
non-candidate was Mario Cuomo, who let the national press corps sit
waiting on the floors of New York State's Capitol as planes revved
on the runway to fly him to New Hampshire on the last day of
filing. Cuomo finally emerged from the governor's mansion to
announce that he couldn't run for the White House because State
Sen. Ralph Marino of Muttontown had refused to approve a state
budget. It was a psychodrama to remember, but one Gephardt wisely
declined to imitate.

SENATE DEMOCRATS THREATEN PARTISAN FIGHT OVER IMPEACHMENT
DECLARATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats warned Wednesday that President
Clinton's impeachment trial will be turned into a partisan fight if
Republicans go through with plans to push through a declaration of
wrongdoing by the president.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican-controlled Senate reconvening Thursday as a
court of impeachment, House prosecutors finished closed-door
depositions of three witnesses and prepared to argue for summoning
them to testify during Clinton's trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Republicans persist in demanding live witnesses and
demanding more depositions, and demanding extra legal devices like
findings of fact, the more it becomes a Republican trial,'' said
Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 28 Republican senators sent a letter to the president
urging him to voluntarily answer questions under oath to resolve
discrepancies in evidence supporting the two articles of
impeachment charging him with lying to a grand jury and obstructing
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your knowledge, intent, actions and omissions are central to
the charges the House of Representatives have made against you,''
said the letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who cannot be compelled to testify, declined last
week to answer written questions posed by the GOP-controlled Senate
and was expected to turn down the request for him to submit to live
questioning by House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by polls showing the public growing more weary of the
trial and more angry with Republicans, Daschle renewed calls for a
quick end to only the second impeachment trial of a president in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, D-S.D., said his Democratic colleagues are opposed to
live testimony during the trial and want the videotaped depositions
kept secret for now. However, what rankles Democrats most, Daschle
said, is the Republican plan for pushing through a finding of fact
that would declare Clinton a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Democratic senators are prepared to ``offer an
array of amendments'' to the GOP proposal ``as long as it appears
that a finding of fact resolutions could pass.''
</P>
<P>
   With 45 of the 100 votes in the Senate, the Democrats can block
conviction and removal of Clinton, which requires a two-thirds
vote. However, unless a half-dozen of the 55 Republicans switched
sides, the Democrats would be unable to stop passage of a so-called
``finding of fact'' pushed by several GOP senators.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the GOP resolution would formally declare that
Clinton ``willfully provided false and misleading testimony'' to
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury. The document also
would say that the president engaged in a course of conduct
designed to ``alter, delay, impede, cover up and conceal the
existence of evidence and testimony,'' in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against him.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the likelihood they will not muster the two-thirds
vote to terminate Clinton's presidency, Republicans are pushing the
``finding of fact'' to keep him from claiming a total vindication
when the final votes are cast, as currently scheduled, on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do this, then history will have the wrong
interpretation'' of Clinton's effort to cover up his affair with
Monica Lewinsky, said Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a partisan fight, which could tie up the Senate
past the Feb. 12 target date for ending the trial, shook some
Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what we're trying to achieve, another party-line
vote,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, one of the advocates for
pushing through the finding-of-fact resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the Senate's Republican ranks, a finding of facts
was viewed skeptically. Among the GOP senators who have raised
questions about the resolution's constitutionality are Mike DeWine
of Ohio, Phil Gramm of Texas, Richard Shelby of Alabama and Gordon
Smith of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   After a closed-door meeting of Republican senators late
Wednesday, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, indicated the popularity of
the proposal might have peaked. ``It's still up in the air. It's
not soaring, but it's not falling either. It's up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews throughout the day, Democrats argued
that the Constitution gives the Senate only one option _ guilt or
innocence _ on articles of impeachment. At the same time, several
Democrats said it was possible to censure the president's behavior,
but not in the context of an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constitutional scholars on the left and right think it's
wrong. That should tell you something,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unconstitutional. You can't have it both ways. Either you
convict or don't convict,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle on Wednesday named Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and
Pat Moynihan, D-N.Y., to head a group to draft a resolution
condemning Clinton's behavior and cover-up attempts in the White
House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, House prosecutors interrogated White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal, the last of three witnesses, as more senators
said they have seen enough of the prosecutors' witnesses and want
no more.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal repeated Wednesday his grand jury accounts of Clinton
telling him that Lewinsky, a former White House intern, was known
as a ``stalker'' and ``threatened'' him unless he agreed to a
sexual relationship. Blumenthal also repeated that first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton told him that her husband was merely
``ministering'' to Lewinsky, according to sources familiar with his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Like the depositions of Lewinsky on Monday and presidential
confidant Vernon Jordan on Tuesday, sources said, Blumenthal's
closed-door session provided little new grist to support the GOP
contention that live witnesses are critical to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, a Chicago-area Republican and lead prosecutor
for the House, said he would continue pushing to bring Lewinsky,
Jordan and Blumenthal to the Senate floor to testify. However, he
conceded, ``I haven't received a world of encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a strategy session with his fellow prosecutors,
Hyde said the course seems set for the Clinton case. ``There's a
general feeling that it's too late to pursue other avenues in this
proceeding,'' Hyde said. ``The time has come to pull our case
together and argue it'' before the Senate votes.
</P>
<P>
   After viewing videotapes of the Lewinsky deposition Tuesday,
five Republican senators said they see no reason to summon her to
testify on the Senate floor. On Wednesday, after viewing the
Lewinsky and Jordan depositions, two others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I am not going to support appearances of witnesses
before the U.S. Senate,'' Snowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said she had learned so
``few new things'' from viewing the videotapes that ``I would not
say that we need to have them on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby, a former Democrat who switched to the GOP in 1993,
dismissed the Lewinsky and Jordan depositions as ``more of the
same, nothing explosive, no dynamite.''

 SEAVER FOR McCARVER: IS IT WORTH IT? 
 (sw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you were a baseball general manager during the
late 1960s or early 1970s, you would surely consider swapping Tim
McCarver to get Tom Seaver in return.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to shed McCarver as your team's television analyst,
only peers like Joe Morgan and Jim Kaat would be worthy
replacements. But would you fire McCarver and hire Seaver as your
top analyst?
</P>
<P>
   That was precisely what the Mets did on Wednesday, choosing the
rah-rah glory of bringing a prodigal son back over keeping one of
baseball's best and most outspoken analysts who had called Mets
games for 16 years on WWOR-TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time moves on,'' said McCarver, who will keep calling network
games at Fox Sports. ``I'm not shocked. It was already February, so
there was cause for concern. But if I were to say this wasn't
emotional, I wouldn't be telling you the truth. I saw them through
the great times of the 1986 World Series and the tough times in the
early '90s. I always tried to give fans the honest truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver's hiring is the only personnel change expected in the
Mets' local broadcast booth with the team's games moving to WPIX-TV
(which bought the rights to 50 games this year and 40 next year
from Madison Square Garden, which bought them from the Mets). The
team wants to rehire Gary Thorne and Ralph Kiner, who would
continue on the Mets' cable games on Fox Sports New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets must anticipate that the long hoped-for return of a
Hall of Fame pitcher to the Mets' organization will make fans
forget that he is replacing a future Hall of Fame broadcaster.
Remember, Seaver never distinguished himself as one of WPIX's
Yankee announcers from 1989 to 1993, although there were lots of
chuckles in the booth when he worked with Phil Rizzuto.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective is to do the best job I can possibly do,'' Seaver
said. But, he added, ``I'm not going to be as good as the person
I'm replacing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, critics can get caught up in the Seaver-McCarver
comparison and underestimate how important Seaver is to Mets fans.
And if Seaver is merely OK, but doesn't dazzle with the kind of
intricate analyses McCarver is known for, well, maybe that will be
enough for the hard-core viewer.
</P>
<P>
   But Seaver will step into the job with a full set of baggage,
which he seems gladly to schlep. He was hired to be more than a
broadcaster; he will also be a pitching adviser, team marketer and
promoter. It is common for an announcer to be a club employee, as
McCarver was, and for announcers to make appearances for the club.
But the formal list of club roles is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to see how a person would not find conflict in these
multiple roles, although such a combination was the only way to
bring Seaver back. But if he's helping Al Leiter with his leg kick
or Paul Wilson with his fastball, how candid will he be if they
don't follow his advice during a game?
</P>
<P>
   If Seaver is the Mets' supreme icon, he should feel great leeway
to speak freely without fretting about upsetting anyone in the
Mets' hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is to to be critical when it's time to criticize
players and applaud players when it's time to applaud players,''
Seaver said. ``In their heart, the home broadcaster roots for the
home team.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said: ``I think he's
a strong enough guy that he'll be able to say what he wants without
looking over his shoulder.'' But viewers and critics will wait to
see if he is a homer, to see if, as he said, ``the old homer
broadcaster is a reality and inescapable.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's acknowledge that the home announcer feels a tug for the
home team. But pure homers like Rizzuto, Harry Caray and Bob Prince
were idiosyncratic enough for their excesses to be forgiven because
they defined the viewing or listening experience. Seaver never
showed a predilection for such outrageousness.
</P>
<P>
   One can only surmise that McCarver's departure will please the
touchy Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, assuming that the type of
critiques that came naturally from McCarver will be tempered
because of Seaver's range of roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I get along with Valentine?'' McCarver said. ``I tried to
do my job. I wouldn't say we were cordial, but he never said, `Be a
fan.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bingham, the club's senior vice president for marketing and
broadcasting, said the Mets contemplated teaming McCarver and
Seaver. But both are analysts, and Seaver wanted the platform that
came with broadcasting. ``Once Tom was a given, we looked at what
constituted the best team,'' Bingham said. Which would be Seaver
and Thorne.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets pushed hard for Seaver, hiring him even though the WPIX
deal has not been signed. It's hard to believe that MSG, which will
likely produce the games for WPIX, wanted Seaver over McCarver. In
a statement, Mike McCarthy, MSG's executive producer, said, ``It's
easy to see the value the Mets identified in bringing Tom Seaver to
the broadcast booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, McCarver will most likely work only the national telecasts
for Fox Sports, in a schedule that begins in June, and hook up with
another team next season. He voiced some interest in the 50-game
Yankee package at Fox-owned WNYW, but there may be too many
conflicts with his Fox schedule. ``Who knows what may happen?''
said Michael Wach, general manager of WNYW, which has been eyeing
Kenny Albert and Rick Cerone. &QL;

 &HT;    U.S. taken to task for own doping troubles
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ In a solemn, statesman-like tone,
two-time Olympic gold medalist Sebastian Coe of Great Britain
challenged American sports leaders to deal with their own doping
problems at home before lecturing the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   His piercing speech registered with many delegates Wednesday
attending the World Conference on Doping, a day after Barry
McCaffrey, the White House drug czar called on international sports
to reform its drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   Although not identifying sprinter Dennis Mitchell by name, Coe
upbraided the U.S. track-and-field federation for recently clearing
a high-profile American athlete on the defense that he consumed
alcohol and engaged in sex the night before an unannounced drug
test. Mitchell failed the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ban that is overturned because somebody is able to say that
elevated levels of testosterone are due to sex and beer the night
before is a decision that does lack credibility,'' said Coe, a
former member of the British Parliament and chief of staff to
Conservative Party leader William Hague. ``You know it, and I know
it, and more importantly the competitors that are out there _ that
you need on board for this whole process to work _ lack confidence
(in the process).''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, bronze medalist in the 100 meters at the 1992
Barcelona Olympics and leader of his sport's athlete advisory
committee, tested positive for high levels of testosterone last
spring. He argued successfully before a U.S. Track and Field panel
that his elevated testosterone was the result of having consumed
five beers and having sex four times the previous night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he found the panel's acceptance of such a defense
comical, Coe said: ``Well, it's not the touchstone of grace and
elegance, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Alexandre de Merode, head of the International Olympic
Committee medical commission, characterized the Americans as
laggards in the fight against doping and said he, thus, was amused
by the get-tough tone of McCaffrey and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode said he found it absurd that a U.S. federation could
have accepted the defense offered by Mitchell, which he said has no
basis in science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't say drinking a beer and (having sex with) a girl changes
the level of testosterone,'' de Merode said. ``I can understand
when people try to escape. That's the game. But, please, do it
seriously.'' Coe is a respected spokesman against the use of
performance-enhancing drugs. A former world-record holder in the
1,500 meters, he is the only man to win successive Olympic titles
at the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm genuinely not unloading on the Americans,'' Coe said
later. ``It is the (Mitchell) case which has caused as much anxiety
among the athletic fraternity that I speak to regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to all countries, you have a contribution to make to
this debate, but it is a better contribution when you have actually
cleared up your own back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   The international track federation is investigating the Mitchell
case and will hold a hearing before ruling on his reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Schultz, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, took no public
offense to Coe's comments, although he denied that the United
States is trying to dictate a drug policy for world sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that is a bizarre case,'' Schultz said, referring to
Mitchell. ``But if you do some research, you can probably find
something like that in almost every country.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He was supposed to have been the most hostile
witness of all, the one who wouldn't check his grudges at the door,
despite the setting.
</P>
<P>
   But Sidney Blumenthal, the opinionated journalist-turned-White
House adviser who is reviled by Republicans, walked into the
Senate's national security briefing room to be deposed Wednesday
and immediately blunted those sharp edges, prompting one House
prosecutor to go so far as to call him a ``gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, both sides agreed that no new ground was
broken, but the House managers of the impeachment case called
Blumenthal's testimony ``productive'' and said it would help them
to bolster the official record on their accusations that Clinton
obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers did try to raise issues outside the articles
of impeachment, beginning to question Blumenthal about Kathleen
Willey, congressional officials said. Ms. Willey has accused
Clinton of groping her, an allegation he denies. The incident and
allegations that she was subsequently harassed by an unidentified
person after her testimony in the Paula Jones case are under
investigation by the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers, led by Lanny Breuer, objected to the
questions delving into the Willey matter. Blumenthal was permitted
to answer, but said he knew nothing about Ms. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   During one objection on an undisclosed issue, the five presiding
senators in the room, led by Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and John
Edwards, D-N.C., asked that the room be cleared as the senators
decided what to do.
</P>
<P>
   During the one hour and 15 minutes of the deposition, Blumenthal
testified, as he had before the grand jury on three different
occasions, that in a conversation with President Clinton on Jan.
21, 1998, Clinton described Monica Lewinsky as a mendacious
``stalker'' who sought an intimate relationship with him. But
Blumenthal said he never repeated it to reporters, congressional
officials said. And he added that Clinton never instructed him to
spread the story or perpetuate the lie, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never leaked any conversations,'' Blumenthal is reported to
have said to prosecutors. ``I never spoke to any reporters about
any personal conversations with the president about Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton lied about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, Blumenthal replied, ``Yes,'' the officials said. And he
noted that Clinton never apologized to him for the lie.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., the leading questioner for the House
on Wednesday, asked sharp, precise questions that required short
answers, the officials said. He was joined by Rep. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., who inquired mostly about the ``politics of personal
destruction'' that he believes dominates White House strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Through their questions, the two House prosecutors hoped to
illustrate that Clinton had used Blumenthal to try to destroy Ms.
Lewinsky's reputation by engaging in a smear campaign. The term
``stalker'' later showed up in some news reports. They also
maintain that Clinton intentionally gave false information to
Blumenthal so that it would be passed on to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the president was talking about preparing, if
necessary, to disparage her reputation,'' said Rep. Ed Bryant,
R-Tenn., one of the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal is long despised by Republicans as the man behind
Hillary Rodham Clinton's accusation that a ``vast right-wing
conspiracy'' was out to get the president. Blumenthal has also been
accused of masterminding the disclosure last year that Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., had a long adulterous affair nearly 30 years ago.
Blumenthal has denied that accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said, ``I found him to be a gentleman, and I hope he felt
the same way about us.''

FOES OF SCHOOL VOUCHERS TAKE CASE TO TEXAS LEGISLATURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Munoz) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The superintendent of Edgewood schools _ where a
privately funded school voucher program has lured away 700
schoolchildren and $4 million in tax dollars _ said Wednesday that
Texas already has all the school choice experiments it needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important for legislators, as well as the whole
state of Texas, to know that vouchers are not the answer,'' said
Dolores Munoz, superintendent of the low-income, mostly Hispanic
district in San Antonio. ``Edgewood is a pilot voucher program, not
by choice, but we are. So we right now are experiencing the
problems that go with vouchers. So let's not go on a bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz and several dozen Edgewood parents briefed a handful of
lawmakers on the impact that a controversial $50 million voucher
program funded by the private Children's Education Opportunity
(CEO) Foundation, a pro-voucher group based in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 students left Edgewood schools this year on a CEO
scholarship, resulting in a loss of $4 million in state funding,
Munoz said, and another 500 children left the district after a
public housing development was closed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Additionally, Munoz and several mothers said, many of those who
left were among the best students academically, while the program
turned away disabled special education students. And some of those
students who left for private schools are facing kindergarten and
first-grade class sizes of 30 to 35 students.
</P>
<P>
   She said the proof that ``public schools are doing an excellent
job'' is reflected in the recent national recognition Texas got
from a education goals panel as one of the top two states in terms
of improvements in student academic achievement. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Many would argue whether Edgewood is doing an excellent job.
While the district's passing rate on the state's basic skills test
has improved, it still lags behind the state average, despite above
average spending per student.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about one-third of Edgewood's eighth-graders passed
the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test, compared with a
statewide average passing rate of nearly twice that. And barely
half the district's 10th-graders passed the mandatory high school
exit test.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher proponents have argued that the competition will force
public schools to improve, but Munoz said the improved student
scores occurred before the CEO voucher program was begun.

CONSERVATIVE LEADERS QUESTIONGOP HOPEFULS FOR PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Ohio   (dal) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Republican presidential prospects for 2000
compete with one another to demonstrate their conservative
bonafides, it can sometimes be difficult to decipher the genuine
article.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, a coalition of conservative leaders including
Paul Weyrich and Phyllis Schlafly, called the Committee to Restore
American Values, tried to do just that. They interviewed a half
dozen possible candidates in closed-door meetings at a Washington
hotel, and asked them to fill out a detailed questionnaire in the
next several days.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders were quizzed on matters small and large,
including whether the words ``In God We Trust'' should remain on
U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you normally call games of chance `gambling' or
`gaming?'''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Would you support a removal of the words `under God' from
the Pledge of Allegiance?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Should a Constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to
life be enacted?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``What commitments relative to abortion would you require from
appointees to the Supreme Court or lower federal judiciary
positions?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you believe gun control reduces crime?''
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to a creche, or Nativity display, the contenders
were asked, ``Would you place a creche on the White House lawn if
ordered to refrain from doing so by the Supreme Court?''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, the executive director of the Christian Coalition
who was at the meeting, said it was more important for candidates
to win over conservatives at the grassroots level. Still, he said
the session was useful for him and others to ``size up candidates
and get to know them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several candidates sought the group's support. They included
Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio; Steve
Forbes, the publishing magnate; Gary Bauer, the former head of the
Family Research Council, and Alan Keyes, a former State Department
official. Former Vice President Dan Quayle spoke to the group by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign that the two dozen or so conservatives at the
meeting have coalesced around a preferred candidate.

 &HT;    Low-fare MetroJet flies into the fray
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Quick. Name the most prominent new airlines of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   If you said AirTran, Frontier and Kiwi you'd be right. But the
list also includes Delta Express, MetroJet and United Shuttle _ all
offshoots of major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   They operate as separate ``airlines within airlines'' and are
designed to counteract low-fare competition in different areas of
the country. They're structured for lower costs that enable lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   And they're growing into competitive forces in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that came Wednesday at Hartsfield International
Airport, where MetroJet, a US Airways unit, began new service
between Atlanta and Dulles International Airport outside
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   MetroJet will fly the route seven times daily at initial fares
of $154 round-trip, its planes bearing a modified US Airways paint
scheme with MetroJet in big type and the parent carrier's name in
small print.
</P>
<P>
   The new route is part of an expansion by MetroJet, begun last
year in an attempt to protect US Airways' market share along the
Eastern seaboard against low-fare competitors.
</P>
<P>
   MetroJet now flies to 22 cities, with primary operations at
Dulles and Baltimore-Washington Airport and other destinations from
Florida to New England.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and AirTran have 18 daily Atlanta-Dulles flights between
them, but Michael Scheeringa, a US Airways vice president who
oversees MetroJet, sees room for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very large market with heavy ridership and great
demand for high-quality, low-fare service,'' Scheeringa said,
adding MetroJet could eventually make up 25 percent of US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   MetroJet's buildup prompted United to announce plans for its own
expansion this spring at Dulles, and it may put operations there
under the Shuttle banner. United will boost its Atlanta-Dulles
flights from two to seven on May 1, bringing total flights on the
route to 32. And that doesn't count the 15 daily flights Delta
offers between Hartsfield and Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to look like the Schweinfurt raids, the sky black
with airplanes'' said aviation consultant Michael Boyd, referring
to an epic air battle of World War II. ``Somebody's going to wind
up carrying sailboat fuel instead of passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not those flights prove too many for the
Dulles-Hartsfield market, the surge reflects a building dogfight
for low-fare travelers in the East.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran's predecessor, ValuJet, started the fight with its
out-of-nowhere emergence from Atlanta in 1994 and 1995. Meanwhile,
Texas-based discounter Southwest Airlines was dominating the Far
West and laying plans to enter Florida and the Northeast, which it
has since done.
</P>
<P>
   Continental was the first major carrier to counter with a
low-cost division, but the so-called Continental Lite flopped
because of poor routes and a confused market identity.
</P>
<P>
   United started its Shuttle division in 1995, using it mainly to
fight Southwest in California. The unit now has 462 daily
departures and 59 planes.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Delta started Delta Express, based in Orlando,
Fla., and flying between several cities in Florida and the
Northeast. It has grown to 37 planes, adding 12 in the past year.
It serves 22 cities with 170 daily flights.
</P>
<P>
   It does not fly to Atlanta, because its goal is to serve
point-to-point routes rather than feed Delta's mainline hub
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Paulette Corbin, managing director of Delta Express, views
MetroJet's creation and the possible eastward expansion of United
Shuttle as the sincerest form of flattery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is heating up, and we take it as a compliment
because we've shown this concept can operate very successfully,''
Corbin said. ``We feel we have the upper hand in the low-fare
industry right now.''
</P>
<P>
   MetroJet and Delta Express are both structured on the Southwest
model, using all-coach Boeing 737s. Thanks to tight scheduling and
rapid turnarounds, Delta Express planes fly an average 11.6 hours a
day vs. nine for Delta as a whole. In-flight service is limited,
and pilots are paid less under a negotiated agreement with their
union.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, that means lower costs and higher profits despite
reduced fares. Delta, US Airways and United, however, all decline
to release specific financial information for the units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been profitable since we started,'' Corbin said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd believes Delta Express is the most successful of the lot at
this point because its strategy is the simplest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta Express is a nice clean concept. They take Florida
passengers who used to connect in Atlanta and fly them straight to
Florida. That's not high-fare traffic to begin with, so with a
lower-cost operation you make more off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheeringa said that reality was one of the factors driving
MetroJet's creation as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``US Airways lost millions flying low-fare traffic to Florida,
and with MetroJet we've created the ability to do that
profitably,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, a potential obstacle to the continued growth of any of
the major airline offshoots is labor contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's pilot union contract, for instance, limits the airline
to using one type of older jet, the 737-200. Most of Delta's
already have been dedicated to the Express unit.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the reduced pay scales that contribute to lower costs
must be renegotiated with each new contract. Delta and its pilots
start talks later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reduced pay scales were agreed to during concessionary
times,'' union spokeswoman Karen McGuffey said Wednesday. ``Times
are now different, and it will be up to the pilots whether they
want to keep contributing to Delta Express.''

   &LR; Television's February sweeps begin today and run through March
3. And dead in the middle of this month of hype, you'll find one of
the biggest events of the period, ``Stephen King's Storm of the
Century.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's three-part scare-a-thon (Feb. 14, 15 and 18) comes from
the mighty pen of the king of horror himself, his first stab at
writing specifically for television. Viewers soon discover that the
worst snowstorm of the century has fallen upon a small Maine town,
bringing with it an evil stranger and murders galore.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just part of the havoc bad weather will wreak on ABC
shows during this sweeps period, one of the four times per year
that television viewership is measured and used to set advertising

   During the two days between ``The Storm's'' Monday and Thursday
airings, ABC will include stormy story lines on sitcoms ``Home
Improvement,'' ``The Hughleys,'' ``Spin City,'' ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,''
``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place'' and ``The Drew Carey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ABC's daytime dramas ``Port Charles,'' ``All My Children,''
``One Life to Live'' and ``General Hospital'' get hit with the
nasty storm.
</P>
<P>
   The network leaps from fictional storm to real-life weather
disasters with ``World's Deadliest Storms: Caught on Tape'' on Feb.
18 as a lead-in to the third stanza of the King thriller. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FOX &QL; 
That kind of sensationalistic reality programming is proof positive
that the Fox network's success with cops on the beat, dangerous car
chases and attacking animals is enough to get other networks to
come up with their own facsimiles. Three of the Big Four networks
are borrowing that format this February.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is still the leader in this type of programming; Thursdays
during sweeps &UR;  &LR; will be shock night. It kicks off at 8 tonight with
``Robbie Knievel Building-to-Building Death Jump Live,''
chronicling the daredevil's attempt to jump 180 feet from one Las
Vegas building to another _ without a net. Knievel's stunt will be
followed by ``The World's Most Shocking Moments 2: Caught on
Tape.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, the network will air ``World's Wildest Police
Videos,'' on Feb. 18 it will be ``The World's Most Shocking Medical
Videos,'' and, on Feb. 25, Fox will show ``Surviving the Moment of
Impact 3'' and ``Busted Everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's big-name guest stars will include Matthew McConaughey as
Luanne's new boyfriend on ``King of the Hill'' (Tuesday) and Sir
Elton John as a cartoon version of himself on ``The Simpsons''
(Feb. 14). Ed Begley Jr. will also play his own voice Sunday on
``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox wraps up its sweeps month with a two-hour special, ``Opening
the Lost Tombs: Live From Egypt'' (March 2), television's first
live archeological excavation. The network will take viewers to the
previously unopened pyramid of Queen Khamerernebty II. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
NBC
</P>
<P>
   NBC is joining the reality TV bandwagon, despite West Coast
president Don Ohlmeyer's previous criticism of the same. They're
marching out ``Confirmation: Hard Evidence of Aliens Among Us?''
(Feb. 17) and ``Dave Barlia: Extreme Stuntman'' (Feb. 24).
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger draw may be the return of many familiar faces to
the Peacock network.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson will reprise his ``Cheers'' character on
tonight's episode of ``Frasier''; another ``Cheers'' alum, Rhea
Perlman, will appear on ``Mad About You'' (Monday). ``Mad About
You'' also will get a visit from home run king Mark McGwire, who
will play himself on the Feb. 22 episode.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Reynolds will play Grace's mother on ``Will &AMP; Grace''
(Tuesday), Cheryl Ladd will appear on ``Jesse'' as a former
classmate of the lead character's father (Feb. 11), and
Tiffani-Amber Thiessen will play office assistant Foxy Jones on
``NewsRadio'' (Feb. 16).
</P>
<P>
   Other NBC series events include the rest of the gang finding out
about Monica and Chandler's trysts on ``Friends'' (Feb. 11), and
George Clooney's final episode as a series regular on ``ER'' (Feb.
18).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's big miniseries will be ``The '60s'' (Sunday and Monday)
and ``To Serve and Protect,'' starring Craig T. Nelson, which will
head into the eye of ABC's ``Storm'' on Feb. 14 and 15. Producer
Robert Halmi Sr., the energy behind such gems as ``Gulliver's
Travels'' and ``Merlin,'' will add ``Alice in Wonderland'' to his
list of hits on Feb. 28. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CBS &QL; 
Stunt-casting, of course, is a staple of sweeps, so get ready to
watch some special guests on your favorite shows.
</P>
<P>
   Skating sensation Tara Lipinski will make three appearances on
CBS, including on daytime's ``The Young and the Restless'' (Feb.
9), prime time's ``Touched by an Angel'' (Feb. 14) and her own
special, ``Tara Lipinski: From This Moment'' (Feb. 17).
</P>
<P>
   On the network's ``The King of Queens,'' Jerry Stiller's comedy
teammate and real-life wife, Anne Meara, will guest star on ``The
King of Queens'' (Monday) as an intoxicating stranger who Arthur
(Stiller) meets at a single's dance. Their daughter, and Ben
Stiller's sister, Amy Stiller also appears.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Van Dyke will play ``Becker's'' father (Feb. 15) and Trisha
Yearwood will play a Navy reserve pathologist on ``JAG'' (Feb. 16).
</P>
<P>
   CBS will add to the miniseries game with a two-parter, ``Too
Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke'' (Feb. 21 and 23), and to the
award-show glut with ``The 41st Annual Grammy Awards'' (Feb. 24).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ABC &QL; 
Besides the storm of the century, ABC's got some other typical
sweeps-period stunts up its sleeve. Bringing on name brands to get
viewers to tune in, for one. Singing sensations 'N Sync will appear
on ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' (Friday), and World Figure Skating
Champion and Olympic silver medalist Michelle Kwan makes her acting
debut on the same show Feb. 26; Johnnie Cochran will play himself
on ``The Hughleys (Tuesday); Thiessen will play a single mother on
``Cupid'' (Feb. 11); and Christopher Lloyd will be Michael
Flaherty's (Michael J. Fox) political mentor and Priscilla Presley,
back as Aunt Marie, will guest star on ``Spin City'' Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WB &QL; 
Begley, who once played a doctor on TV (``St. Elsewhere''), will do
it again on the WB's ``7th Heaven,'' delivering twins on a special
Valentine's episode (Monday). The WB is packing its month with
two-part episodes of its hit teen dramas, ``Felicity'' (Tuesday and
Feb. 16) and ``Dawson's Creek'' (Wednesday and Feb. 17). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
UPN &QL; 
UPN will pitch in with guest stars such as Jerry Springer on both
``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie'' and ``Between Brothers'' (both Feb. 23). It
will also air a couple of original science-fiction movies,
``Roswell: The Aliens Attack'' (tonight) and ``Escape From Mars''
(Feb. 25).

 INCREASING NUMBER OF SENATORS FAVOR PUBLIC DELIBERATIONS IN
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL  (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-BLUMENTHAL,(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Support is growing in the Senate to suspend its
19th-century impeachment rules and allow public viewing of the
final deliberations on whether to remove President Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Senate rules require impeachment deliberations to be conducted
behind closed doors, and senators have soundly rejected two
attempts in the trial to open debate on procedural motions.
</P>
<P>
   But backers of a bipartisan measure say an increasing number of
Republicans and virtually all Democrats recognize the importance of
opening the final debate on acquitting or convicting the president.
</P>
<P>
   It would take two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 senators, to
change procedures drawn up in 1868 for the impeachment trial of
President Andrew Johnson. Both sides say a vote to suspend those
rules, which will likely happen next week, is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the mounting support, traditionalists like Sen.
Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a Democrat, and Sen. Ted Stevens
of Alaska, a Republican, both of whom voted to close debate on the
procedural motions, now favor opening the final deliberations. ``I
don't think the final arguments will change anyone's mind, so I see
no reason to close them,'' Stevens said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has
expressed skepticism about the proposal, but a senior Republican
aide said on Wednesday that Lott is now reconsidering the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say opening the final deliberations would set a bad
precedent, violate the American trial tradition of having jurors
deliberate privately, and unnecessarily prolong the trial because
all 100 senators would feel obliged to use their alloted 15
minutes. ``I don't believe the public would be denied anything
essential if the sessions are closed,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   This debate illustrates a clash between age-old Senate
traditions and contemporary public demands for openness in
government and the realities of late 20th-century communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have come to expect more knowledge of their
government's decision-making process,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, who is the proposal's main author.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison noted that her plan would not overturn Senate
precedent, but actually return to the tradition of open trials that
began with the impeachment of Samuel Chase, an associate justice of
the Supreme Court, in 1804 and ended with Johnson's proceedings 64
years later.
</P>
<P>
   The American public has been clamoring for a speedy end to the
trial, but there has been scant focus outside the Capitol about how
to conduct the senators' closing debate. In a Gallup poll last
month, those surveyed were equally divided on whether the Senate
should debate the impeachment issue in public or private.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the trial, Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone
of Minnesota, both Democrats, asked the Senate to suspend its rules
and allow open deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The first vote, to open debate on whether to dismiss the
charges, failed, 57 to 43. The second vote, to open debate on
whether to take depositions from three witnesses, was defeated, 58
to 41.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, senators said the closed sessions permitted a
candid and constructive discussion that allowed the Senate to forge
ahead with trial procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, when you have the prying eye of the
camera and the outside world looking in, that affects the
dialogue,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who supported closing
the debate on the procedural motions, but now wants to open the
final debate.
</P>
<P>
   Many other senators are undecided on the issue, having focused
this week on more immediate questions of whether to allow live
testimony or videotaped depositions in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made up my mind,'' said Sen. James M. Jeffords,
R-Vt. ``My instincts would say open it up, but tradition is to keep
it closed. The propensity of senators to want to maximize their
time adds a lot of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of an open debate are pressing their case.
Hutchison has sent a letter to all her colleagues, reminding them,
``We are making history, and future generations, as much as our
own, deserve to know how we did so.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, CNN asked the Senate and Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, who presides over the trial, to open all proceedings,
arguing that to do otherwise violated the First Amendment. The
18-page brief was laced with references to the ways in which the
First Amendment and the media had evolved since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only during this century has our commitment to the principle
that debate on public issues should be open become not merely a
nationally shared philosophy but an element embedded in
constitutional law,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society in 1868 _ and more significantly still, our law in
1868 _ was far different than it is today,'' the brief said.
``First Amendment jurisprudence as we know it _ as it governs and
binds the Senate _ is essentially a creature of the 20th century.
That jurisprudence assures public scrutiny, not public ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has changed, too: senators who voted on the 1868
impeachment were selected by state legislatures; since 1913 they
have been elected by popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of opening the debate dismissed the notion that
senators should be treated like normal jurors. The identities of
these 100 jurors are well known, as their votes will be. The
senators face no constitutional protections against public reaction
to their votes. Senators face the approval or rejection of the
voters the next time they seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be a mistake to close the final debate,'' Hagel said.
``It would cast too much of a cloud of suspicion. I say, throw the
doors open and let the American people hear it. Maybe it would be a
little cleansing tonic to run through the gears here.''

JUDGE QUESTIONS MICROSOFT VIDEO EVIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
who is hearing the Microsoft antitrust case, on Wednesday openly
questioned the reliability of video evidence the company had
presented in court and called the situation ``very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   In a tense, packed courtroom, Microsoft Corp. suffered its
second embarrassing setback in two days, stumbling Tuesday and
staggering Wednesday. A few minutes after the judge's criticism,
Microsoft tossed in a white towel for the day. A Microsoft lawyer
asked to approach the bench, and the judge agreed to end
proceedings for the day to let Microsoft regroup and try again
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At issue on both days has been a videotape that Microsoft has
showed in court to try to demonstrate a key defense point _ that
its Windows operating system and Internet browser are not, as the
government contends, separate products bundled together to stifle
competition, but a single product blended seamlessly to benefit
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department attacked the video Tuesday as misleading,
saying that one portion seemed to be altered to make Microsoft's
point. Wednesday, the Department's lawyers focused on a different
set of seemingly misleading portions of the videotape. Much of the
video concerns the arcane inner workings of software programs, but
the more lasting damage to Microsoft's defense could be to its
credibility rather than its technical arguments. And that could be
crucial to the outcome of the case, especially because so much of
the government's case focuses on private meetings between Microsoft
and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has to weigh the unverifiable recollections of
self-interested parties on both sides,'' said William Kovacic, a
professor at the George Washington University Law School. ``That is
why the credibility of the spokesperson in each case is so
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft spokesman on the stand, James Allchin, a senior
vice president, took a drubbing for a second consecutive day. The
Microsoft videotape was intended to show that its browsing
technology could not be removed from Windows 98 without damaging
its operations, contrary to earlier testimony by Edward Felton, a
Princeton University computer scientist and a government witness,
who said he could disable the browser without harm to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that its videotape showed that the Felton
approach would cause Windows 98 to slow down and crash when it
tried to do certain things. Yet David Boies, the Justice
Department's lead lawyer in the case, showed in court that the
video showing a computer screen was actually spliced together,
presenting at least two different machines as if it were one
machine being put through its paces. The number of icons on the
desktop screen varied at different points in the video, indicating
different programs loaded on different machines.
</P>
<P>
   Any kind of software incompatibility could cause the problems
Microsoft noted, Boies pointed out, and not necessarily Felton's
browser-disabling program.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Jackson, who will decide the case in this trial without a
jury, stepped in. While he has asked pointed questions of
witnesses, especially Microsoft witnesses previously, he was more
direct than he had been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I rely on this?'' Jackson asked Allchin. ``It's very
troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This casts doubt,'' Jackson added, ``on the reliability of the
entire videotape demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, white-haired and soft-spoken, Allchin allowed that the
tape had problems, but not ones that fundamentally undercut his
testimony that removing the browsing software hurt Windows. ``I'd
be glad to bring in a machine and show you,'' Allchin told the
judge. ``This demonstration hasn't turned out very well.''
</P>
<P>
   After the court session, Microsoft admitted that it was at fault
for producing a flawed tape, but insisted it was an honest mistake.
``We make very good software, but we didn't make a very good
videotape,'' said William Neukom, the Microsoft senior vice
president for corporate and legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   To straighten things out, Jackson agreed to let Microsoft remake
the demonstration videotape _ with Justice Department
representatives monitoring the taping _ and allow them to show it
Thursday morning in court.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said he did not know whether Microsoft made its tape
misleading intentionally. ``But the main point was that the
videotape was not reliable,'' he said. ``This is not public
relations. This is not sales. You have to submit accurate evidence,
not just something that makes your side look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the afternoon session of the trial, the government
pointed to several internal Microsoft e-mail messages, trying to
show that the company had folded its software for browsing the
World Wide Web into Windows mainly to undermine competition from
Netscape Communications Corp., the browser pioneer. Microsoft
replies that since 1994 it was always the company's intention to
put browsing software in its operating system to benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the e-mail messages are cast in terms of tactics intended to
help Microsoft ``win'' the browser battle ``against Netscape.'' In
one e-mail written on Dec. 26, 1996, Allchin wrote, ``I don't
understand how Internet Explorer is going to win,'' adding ``my
conclusion is that we must leverage Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   In another sent to Allchin in March 1997, Jonathan Roberts, a
Microsoft marketing executive, wrote that tightly integrating
Windows with the browser would make ``Netscape a non-issue _ a
superfluous product for all but the most committed Netscape user.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about such messages, Allchin said that Microsoft
certainly did compete with Netscape, but the main way it did so was
to innovate and improve its leading product, the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Allchin noted that words like ``tie'' and
``leverage'' are terms used loosely at the company _ not with the
legal implications of a monopoly case in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson pointed out playfully that ``tie'' was a term ``we use
too,'' though more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly got us in a lot of trouble,'' Allchin said of
the e-mail language. ``This is my first time in court. I'm learning
a lot.''

4TH-QUARTER EARNINGS ROSE 5.7 PERCENT AT NEW YORK TIMES CO. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York Times Co. reported a 5.7 percent rise in
fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday on steady increases in newspaper
advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The results matched analyst estimates. But the initial reaction
from investors was negative; company shares fell $1.50, to $32.50,
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding non-recurring items, the company earned $87.4 million
in the fourth quarter, compared with $82.7 million in the
corresponding quarter a year earlier. The results translated to 47
cents a diluted share, up 11.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1998, the company posted net income of $282.6
million, up 13.5 percent from $249.1 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue at The New York Times newspaper rose 7
percent to $1.06 billion, the first time revenue surpassed the
billion-dollar level. The rate of increase, though, declined from
more than 9 percent in the first half of the year, compared with
the corresponding period in the previous year, to about 4.6 percent
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation revenue at the company's flagship newspaper _ which
represents about 25 percent of total revenue _ moved in the
opposite direction. The fourth quarter's gain of 4.5 percent was
the strongest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Barlow, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, noted
that several other newspaper companies, including Gannett Co., had
reported earnings in line with Wall Street forecasts recently only
to see their share prices dip on the day of their announcements.
Most of these stock prices recovered soon after, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But two analysts _ Lauren Rich Fine of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and
Douglas Arthur of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter _ said the company's
revenue did not match their projections, though the slight 2.7
percent rise in costs kept overall results in line with
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in on track for the bottom line, but the revenue was
lighter than we were looking for,'' Ms. Fine said. At The Times
newspaper, Arthur said, ``There seems to be somewhat of a
disconnect between the size of the paper, the number of new color
ads and advertisers and the revenue numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   When non-recurring items are included, the company's net income
for the quarter and the full year both rose 6.3 percent, yielding
45 cents a diluted share for the quarter and $1.45 a diluted share
for the year. Including these charges, quarterly net income was
$84.3 million, up from $79.3 million, and annual net income was
$278.9 million, up from $262.3 million.

 &HT;    State computers behind federal schedule
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's Medicaid program is behind the federal
government's schedule to ready its computer system for the year
2000, state officials acknowledged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the state maintained that the Department of Medical
Assistance was on track to meet the the state's own timetable for
Y2K compliance by May 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees the
federal-state Medicaid programs for the poor, raised questions
about the Georgia program's preparedness in a recent visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some concerns,'' said Mike Hale, project manager for
Year 2000 project for the state of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA's concerns, he said, include Georgia Medicaid's having no
plan for independent verification of the computer testing program,
and no contingency plan if the corrected system doesn't perform as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The state does not require independent testing, but Hale insists
the state's testing policy is very rigorous. Medicaid's contingency
plan is being formulated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have a new set of eyes, you learn something,''
Hale said, but added: ``I don't see anything now that will cause us
to change our schedule.'' Hale said HCFA's timetable to be ready
was March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid's computer system is a leading priority for the state.
The program covers about 1 million Georgians. It processes more
than 40 million medical claims a year for more than 25,000 doctors,
hospitals and other health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been actively testing codes,'' said Dr. William
Taylor, commissioner of DMA. Even under a worst-case scenario,
Taylor said, the computer system ``should not interfere with the
actual care people get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem threatens because computer programmers as a
shortcut used a two-digit code to represent the year. Thus, unless
software is adjusted, a OO date could mean 1900, not 2000. If not
corrected, experts say, those computers could shut down or produce
incorrect information.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA, which is assessing states' Medicaid programs, has not
issued a report on the Georgia system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. Roy Barnes said that he would hold state
department heads personally responsible for the success or failure
of their agencies to make their computer systems ready.
</P>
<P>
   The state has spent $152 million on fixing the computer bug,
with a bill pending to spend $170 million more.

<P>
   Thursday night, a thin beam of light will flash down from outer
space to illuminate dark parts of North America, Europe and Asia if
a Russian space test succeeds _ and if clouds don't get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Many astronomers are protesting the experiment, saying such
developments threaten to produce new kinds of light pollution that
could blind telescopes exploring the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   In the test, astronauts aboard the Russian space station Mir are
to bounce sunlight off an 82-foot mirror and direct the rays toward
the ground, producing beams up to 10 times brighter than the full
moon.
</P>
<P>
   The test is sponsored by a team of Russian companies known as
the Space Regatta Consortium, which foresees swarms of space
mirrors as wide as 650 feet and orbiting up to 3,000 miles high.
The mirrors would be used mainly to light cities. The team also
envisions spaceships with no fuel other than sails of the same
reflective material that would catch sunlight to send the craft
hurtling toward the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror plan and test come as the Russian manned space
program faces severe financial woes. In the past few years NASA has
repeatedly bailed Moscow out. Last month the Russian government
approved a plan to extend the life of the Mir station if private
investors could be found, and the mirror consortium is eagerly
trying to win financial backers as well.
</P>
<P>
   If no funding is found, Moscow plans to bring the Mir down this
summer and focus resources on building a new International Space
Station with 16 nations, led by the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror test is known as Znamya, Russian for banner. It is to
begin Thursday at 5:04 a.m., Eastern time, when a progress supply
ship undocks from Mir carrying the mirror. While orbiting more than
200 miles up, its thin metal and plastic parts are to unfurl like
the petals of a flower to reflect sunlight and produce a beam of
light on the ground a few miles wide. At least eight cities are to
be illuminated.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:12 a.m., the beam is to fall on Karaganda, Kazakhstan; at
12:56 p.m., on Frankfurt, Germany; at 6:56 p.m., on Quebec City;
and at 8:32 p.m. on Devil's Lake, N.D. All times are Eastern
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   The Mir astronauts will try to keep the beam trained on ground
targets for one or two minutes at a time. A ground map of the
beam's path and an article on the Znamya project can be found at
the Sky &AMP; Telescope Web site, at www.skypub.com. The February issue
of Sky &AMP; Telescope has an article on the mirror venture.
</P>
<P>
   During the program's debut in 1993, Russian scientists sent a
narrow beam of reflected sunlight flashing across the darkened side
of the Earth. That beam, however, was dimmer than planned because
of difficulties in assembling the thin mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiments have been criticized by many astronomers,
including those at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   The project's architects make no apologies, however.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to astronomers on the consortium's Web site
(src.space.ru), they say that such ``extremist experiments'' will
someday give scientists ``unique tools for real exploration of the
farthest corners of the universe.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the impeachment trial of President Clinton set
to reconvene on Thursday for what is likely to be its final phase,
House prosecutors favor bringing Monica Lewinsky to the Senate
floor, even though their chances of prevailing look dim.
</P>
<P>
   But several influential Republicans made it clear on Wednesday
that they were reluctant to call witnesses to appear in person in
the well of the Senate, amid signs that a number of Senate
Republicans were no longer rallying around the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors interviewed the last of three witnesses behind
closed doors on Wednesday, questioning Sidney Blumenthal, a senior
White House aide, for about an hour and fifteen minutes, excluding
breaks. They questioned Ms. Lewinsky for several hours on Monday
and Clinton's close friend Vernon Jordan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The way is now clear for several decisive votes, confronting
Senators with decisions as early as Thursday on whether to make the
videotapes of the depositions public and whether to allow the three
witnesses to be questioned once again, this time in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to have a verdict that will withstand the
test of history, these witnesses should come forward,'' said Rep.
James E. Rogan, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But even Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., head of the House
prosecution team, sounded pessimistic about the chances that the
Senate would approve the request to question Ms. Lewinsky,
Blumenthal and Jordan in the well of the Senate. ``I haven't
received a world of encouragement, but I'm ever hopeful,'' Hyde
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were strong signs that a number of Senate
Republicans would oppose witnesses. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
said: ``I'm not really for live witnesses. I think we took the
depositions for discovery, and I don't think anything's been
added.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said, ``I lean very very strongly
against any appearance by Monica Lewinsky.'' And Sen. Olympia J.
Snowe, R-Maine, said, ``I cannot personally forsee circumstances in
which we would call Monica Lewinsky or the other witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said: ``My inclination is to
support what the House finally requests. But I think the votes are
probably not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night 28 Republican senators wrote to Clinton to ask
him to voluntarily testify in the trial. ``Your knowledge, intent,
actions and omissions are central to the charges the House of
Representatives have made against you,'' the letter said.
``Personal answers from you should prove beneficial in our effort
to reconcile conflicting testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has steadfastly said Clinton would not take such
a step.
</P>
<P>
   Already looking toward the trial's conclusion, Senate Democrats
and the White House began a concerted campaign against a Republican
proposal to approve ``findings of fact'' accusing Clinton of
misconduct before taking the final vote on the two articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic efforts last week to end the trial showed that there
are not the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton on the charges of
perjury and obstruction of justice. But the statement of facts
could be approved with as few as 51 votes. Democrats contend that
the idea is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution gives the United States Senate the
opportunity to convict, remove or to acquit,'' said Sen. Robert G.
Torricelli, D-N.J., after a closed-door party caucus. ``The Senate
is not free to rewrite the Constitution and draw its own
conclusions because Republicans need to choose between an element
of their constituency that wants conviction and an American public
which wants acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader from South Dakota,
threatened that the Democrats would use the right of ``unlimited
amendment'' to keep the proposal from ever coming to a vote. ``If
Republicans persist in demanding live witnesses and demanding more
depositions and demanding extra legal devices like findings of
fact, the more it becomes a Republican trial,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House echoed the theme. Joe Lockhart, the White House
press secretary, said of the senators, ``As they move toward the
exits, they shouldn't try to trample on the Constitution in the
process.'' He also tried to allay the fears of Senate Republicans
that Clinton will celebrate his acquittal as a political victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a certain sense of relief here at the White
House if this process were to end quickly and go away,'' Lockhart
said. ``But I don't think that there's anybody here who thinks
anything out of this process constitutes a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe, who is a proponent of the fact finding, said the
procedures do pass constitutional muster. ``The significance of
finding of facts is it would be part of the permanent record of the
court of impeachment,'' she said. ``That would be, in my opinion,
indelibly etched in that record, and it could not be be erased and
it could not be revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I think we do owe it to the American people to
inform them of the facts as we know them to be with respect to
misconduct or wrongdoing on the part of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear that Republicans would coalesce around the
plan. Republicans said there was vigorous debate about it in a
closed door caucus Wednesday night, and they plan another meeting
Thursday morning. Some Republicans, too, have constitutional
concerns about the proposal, and some say they are worried that
such a finding would create a precedent that would encourage the
use of impeachment trials as political weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point at least, Republicans are not unified in favor
of that,'' said one Republican senator, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. ``If that is still the case tomorrow, we probably
will not offer it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats favor a censure of the president after the trial
is concluded, and Daschle named Sens. Dianne Feinstein of
California and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York to develop the
language. Some Republicans are open to the idea, but other
Republicans have said they consider censure meaningless or
constitutionally suspect.

</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's questioning of Blumenthal, a communications aide who
is a bete noire of conservatives, took place in a secure room on
the fourth floor of the Capitol and was videotaped. Officials said
Blumenthal repeated his prior testimony to a grand jury that the
president had described Ms. Lewinsky to him as a ``stalker.'' Only
this time he had to concede that the president had lied to him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the session said Blumenthal stated that
he had never spread that description of Ms. Lewinsky to reporters
and that the president had not instructed him to do so. Blumenthal
was the last of three witnesses whom the House Republicans had
questioned in hopes of bolstering the article of impeachment
charging Clinton with obstruction of justice in his effort to cover
up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. A second article accuses him of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things the Senate will consider when the trial
resumes on Thursday is whether to put all or part of the three
witness depositions, on paper or on videotape, into the Senate's
public trial record. Hyde said the managers would ask that the
videotapes be publicized in a ``presentation'' to the Senate rather
than used in snippets on closing arguments. ``I think for
continuity's sake, we would like to have a presentation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the videotapes would probably result in another media
blitz about the case since Ms. Lewinsky has never told her story in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I think that it would be better left not
released to the public,'' said Daschle, questioning what the
release would add to the trial. But he said that if any part of the
tapes were to be made public, then the entire tapes should be
released. ``Our view is that if you're going to air a deposition,
you better air the whole thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the vote count was uncertain, the Senate seems more likely
to approve public release of the videotapes than to approve calling
witnesses to the Senate. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, suggested that the
Senate could approve the public release of the depositions but keep
them under seal for a period of time.

 By BRENDAN M. CASE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Jose Cespedes has a telephone line, the lucky one
of every 11 Mexicans who have a phone. But he wants more. After
all, this is the age of the Internet, and the 29-year-old junior
marketing exec is online. Trouble is, he can't surf the World Wide
Web very long before everyone else in his house complains about the
phone line being blocked. ``It's easy at work, but at night there
are still a lot of sites on the Internet I want to look at,'' says
Cespedes. ``We're going to get a new line as soon as we can afford
it.''
 &HT;    New lines can be had from Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the
former state monopoly provider, but only at a price: they go for
between US$180 and $210 apiece, and can take months to install,
especially in rural areas.
 &HT;    But there is hope for people like Cespedes. By early this year,
several companies will be offering basic telephone services,
meaning Telmex will not be the only choicefor consumers eager to
have their own dial tone.
 &HT;    Mexico's second wave of telecom liberalization has begun, and a
host of companies are at the starting gate. After spending a total
of $1 billion on local service licenses for frequencies to offer
services using cutting-edge technologies, they are poised to
pioneer a huge advance in the telecommunications industry. ``It's a
privilege to be in this business at this time,'' says Rodrigo
Sandoval, the marketing director of Amaritel, one of the most
ambitious of the new local service companies. ``It means building a
business from scratch, we have the opportunity to do it well and to
create a good service. And we think this market has tremendous
potential.''
 &HT;    Mexico now has about nine lines per 100 people, a low
penetration even compared with other Latin American countries.
Chile and Argentina have almost 20, for example, and Brazil has 10.
The U.S. and Canada have about 55 lines per 100 people, according
to U.S. consultancy Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton. Even so, the local
service market, is already worth about $4 billion per year, about
the same size as the long-distance market, which was deregulated in
1997. But unlike long distance, Telmex controls nearly the entire
market.
 &HT;    The long-distance opening is already a success for customers.
Real prices have fallen since early 1997, by as much as 40 percent.
But the benefits of competition have been weighted towards
corporate clients and relatively well-off residential customers, in
short, to those who already had a phone. New local lines are the
key to the industry's development beyond the elite customers who
have enjoyed telephone service for most of Mexico's history.
 &HT;    While prices for basic telephone service are unlikely to fall as
drastically, service availability should become more democratic.
Industry analysts forecast that penetration will grow quickly in
the next five years, fueled by pent-up demand for telephone lines,
the growth of the Internet, as well as business demand for
value-added services such as video conferencing and high-speed data
transmission. Government officials hope that local service
competition will boost teledensity to 20 lines per 100 people by
the year 2000. Private sector analysts say that goal is probably
overly optimistic. But they stress that in this day and age,
telecom growth is crucial to the overall economy's development.
 &HT;    With investments ranging from $70 million to $600 million over
the next five years, the upstarts expect to find a huge unserved
market of customers who either do not have telephone lines or want
more. To play for a piece of the pie, they have pledged total
investments of $8 billion between now and 2003.
 &HT;    To be sure, there are obstacles. Telmex has become a very tough
competitor since being privatized back in 1990. Then, it was one of
Mexico's most-hated companies, generating more complaints than any
other firm at the offices of the Attorney General for Consumer
Protection.
 &HT;    Times have changed. Line installations can still take up to six
months in some parts of the country, but company technicians have
cut the wait to just a couple weeks in much of Mexico City. Telmex
has started to treat telephone users like valued customers and
consumer complaints involving its service have fallen drastically
during the last few years. ``Telmex has made a lot of progress in
the customer care area, with their service, their quality, (and)
the diversification of their services,'' says Santiago Gutierrez,
vice president and telecom specialist at Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton.
``Competitors will need a lot of creativity to compete successfully
with Telmex.''
 &HT;    The new telecom players will also have trouble getting past a
regulatory environment that became much more complicated at the end
of 1998. Facing a slump in the price of oil, the Mexican government
slapped a 15 percent tax on local and long-distance telephone
service on top of the 15 percent value-added tax customers already
pay.
 &HT;    After spending millions of dollars on their concessions in last
spring's frequency auction, executives at the new telecom companies
were beside themselves with anger. Officials at the Federal
Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) were unhappy as well, since
expanding Mexicans' access to local service is one of their key
goals. ``This tax goes against the spirit of openness in the
telecommunications sector, and is incongruent with the promotion of
investment in the industry,'' says Carlos de la Isla, the finance
director at Grupo Hermes, which won a local service license in last
spring's auction. ``The tax will cut telephone use, with all its
consequences.''
 &HT;    Another big question telecom companies face is what kind of
treatment they will get from regulators. Cofetel's only track
record comes from the long-distance market, where the Mexican
affiliates of the U.S. telecom giants _ AT&AMP;T's Alestra and MCI's
Avantel _ have wrested 30 percent of the roughly $4 billion in
total long-distance revenues from Telmex since launching their
operations. But they also complain of high interconnection fees and
international settlement rates, and charge that Telmex still
behaves like a monopoly. Whatever the reason, Telmex has defied
original expectations that it would fold against the foreign
competition, and proven it will remain the industry giant in both
long-distance and local service for the foreseeable future.
 &HT;    Local-service providers face their own challenges: finding
market niches they can serve better than Telmex. Low-income
customers are one possibility, particularly if companies can offer
a phone line more cheaply than Telmex. Other niches could involve
particular regions of the country or services aimed at business
clients. The new companies are all planning a mix of these,
although their exact strategies won't be entirely clear until they
launch. ``The broader the market these companies consider, the less
chance they have of succeeding,'' says Gutierrez. ``The key thing
is that they need to differentiate themselves from the competition:
from Telmex and from each other.''
 &HT;    But given Telmex's dominance in the local market, companies will
have to design their strategies very carefully. Analysts say there
is no room for a direct competitor to Telmex, since the cost of
duplicating the company's national network would be exorbitant.
 &HT;    Technology is one area that sets the newcomers apart, as they
seek to skirt the heavy investments associated with traditional
landline basic telephony. Executives at Amaritel, Telinor and
Miditel say they will use a mixture of microwave, fiber-optic and
wireless local-loop technology to provide service in different
regions of the country, while Unefon will rely mostly on wireless
local-loop. MCNI Telecom, a subsidiary of Guadalajara-based cable
television company Megacable, is completing a fiber-optic ring
around Mexico City, and plans to do the same in Guadalajara and
Monterrey. And Pegaso PCS and Grupo Hermes will use personal
communications services (PCS) wireless technology.
 &HT;    One of the grandest plans belongs to Amaritel. Backed by U.S.
investors, Amaritel is putting the finishing touches on a $120
million microwave and fiber-optic network between Mexico City and
Puebla.
 &HT;    In early 1999, the company plans to extend the network to Vera
cruz and the rest of the Gulf Coast, a total five-year investment
of $560 million between mid-1998 and the 2003. By that time, the
company's service should be available to a quarter of Mexico's
population. ``Our objective is not to fight Telmex toe-to-toe, but
to grow by serving markets it hasn't served sufficiently,'' says
Sandoval. ``There are many people who don't have telephone lines
and want one. There are also many people and companies that have
service but want more capacity, for the Internet, for more calls,
whatever. Telmex can't serve them fast enough.''
 &HT;    The key to Amaritel's success will be finding business customers
who need more capacity or want better service, although they will
actively court residential customers as well, Sandoval says.
 &HT;    Amaritel's small size in relation to Telmex could actually help
with many business customers. Except for the biggest corporate
clients, Telmex tends to treat all customers the same, offering the
same services and the same level of attention. By contrast,
Amaritel plans to provide to coddle its clients. ``Our very size
will allow us to get out of the office, meet with customers, design
custom solutions and install them rapidly,'' says Sandoval, adding
that Amaritel expects to have 40,000 lines installed by the end of
1999.
 &HT;    Another company that could do a lot to boost teledensity is
Unefon, an affiliate of electronics retailer Grupo Elektra. But
Unefon is also experiencing the most problems in getting off the
ground.
 &HT;    As a subsidiary of Elektra, Unefon has a built-in customer base
among the working-class consumers who frequent Elektra's 550 stores
around the country. Even better, Elektra already has a detailed
database of credit histories and long years of profitable
experience selling goods on credit to people ignored by commercial
banks. ``We already have a lot of synergies to work with,'' says
Javier Sarro, Unefon's director general. ``If you want to be in
this business, you need distribution, promotion, credit and
collection. And we know that Elektra has more than a million credit
customers who want a phone, don't have one, but who are able to pay
for one.''
 &HT;    But Unefon is having trouble finding financing. Last year's
market turbulence spoiled Unefon's plans to place high-yield bonds
abroad. It now plans to use a mix of debt and equity financing, but
unlike most of the other local service companies, its needs are not
yet fully financed. Miditel, another local hopeful, is in the same
boat as Unefon, and for similar reasons. One of its main backers,
Korea Telecom, pulled out of Mexico last July because of the severe
problems in Korea due to the Asian economic crisis. Miditel is now
looking for a new equity partner.
 &HT;    The early PCS leader seems to be Grupo Pegaso, a start-up
telecom company that belongs in part to Alejandro Burillo
Azcarraga, one of media conglomerate Grupo Televisa's principal
shareholders, and Qualcomm, the U.S. communications equipment
company. With its coffers full and a PCS license in hand, the
company is one of the favorites to grab a share of the higher end
of the market. Pegaso PCS, as the joint-venture is known, will
start by offering mobile PCS service, which would sound and feel to
customers like a sort of deluxe cellular service.
 &HT;    But it would take only a bit more investment to provide fixed
PCS service, which would compare to land-line service in quality
without the infrastructure investment costs. Analysts expect the
company to branch out into fixed service soon after launching.
``Pegaso is very well-positioned. The company has an interesting
technology and seems to be committed to the market,'' says Booz,
Allen's Gutierrez. ``Of course, Telmex and Grupo Hermes also have
PCS licenses, so there will be competition.''
 &HT;    As the local service companies fight to establish themselves
over the next few years, some predictions can safely be made.
 &HT;    One is that not all will survive. Ten companies originally
planned to offer long distance service, but that number that has
been cut to four, including Telmex. A similar shakeout is expected
among local service companies. Since their initial investments are
so high, so is the pressure to meet with early success _ those that
don't might quickly disappear.
 &HT;    Moreover, successful local companies could band together with a
long-distance partner. Rumors of such a deal are flying throughout
the country. Such common U.S. practices as reselling _ in which a
company without a telecom network buys time at wholesale rates on
another company's network, then markets its own service to retail
customers _ are also expected to take shape in Mexico as the market
develops.
 &HT;    All of which points to a promising, and much more complicated,
future. Gone are the days when Telmex was the only game in town. It
will now be merely the biggest in what is already one of Latin
America's most competitive telecom markets.
 &HT;    Which is all to the good for people like Cespedes, the marketing
exec who likes to surf the Internet. ``To be honest, I want to get
a new line as quickly as possible,'' he says. ``But I don't care if
it's from Telmex or another company, as long as it works.''

AFTER LOSING GUARANTEE OF SAFETY, U.N. ORDERS AMERICANS TO LEAVE
IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
 (dal) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations ordered its remaining
American staff in Iraq to leave Wednesday after Baghdad warned that
it could not guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
   The order, in practice, affects only two Americans among 420
non-Iraqis working in the country to provide food and medicine.
Another 12 to 15 British and American employees working for the
program already had left the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, said he could recall no
precedent for such a move in the relief program. He said the
decision was made by Benon Sevan, the U.N. undersecretary-general
who oversees security and coordinates the Iraq ``oil for food''
program.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in the wake of sustained U.S. air strikes on
Iraq and after a month-long effort by U.N. officials failed to
elicit a pledge from Baghdad to honor its obligation to protect all
U.N. personnel, irrespective of nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Sevan recommended the ban to Kofi Annan, the secretary-general,
after Baghdad did not provide written assurances that U.N.
employees would be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Sevan's decision contrasts with that of Richard Butler, the
beleaguered chairman of the U.N. Special Commission charged with
disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. When Iraq threatened
to bar entry to U.S. inspectors on teams in 1997, Butler decided to
stop inspections rather than permit Iraq to dictate the composition
of U.N. inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Sevan did not make a similar decision, Eckhard said:
``I don't want to compare Benon Sevan's judgment with Richard
Butler's judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Several U.N. officials said that the organization sometimes
informally refrained from sending staff of certain nationalities to
places where they might be in particular harm's way, but that they
were unhappy about Sevan's decision, calling it troubling.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they added, Sevan was primarily motivated to
provide assistance to the people of Iraq, one million of whom are
said to be suffering from the effects of food shortages and other
results of economic sanctions and Saddam Hussein's reluctance to
buy the vital food and medicine he is permitted to import through
oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   The two Americans who have been ordered to leave Iraq are the
secretary to Prakash Shah, Annan's special envoy in Iraq, and the
deputy director of the World Food Program, which on Wednesday
announced a $21 million appeal to help the hungry in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad had offered to make an exemption for these two
Americans, plus a third who was working in Baghdad, but Sevan did
not think that any Americans and British should be singled out to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Both the British Foreign Office and U.S. officials in Washington
expressed ``regret'' about the decision, but added that the safety
and security of its citizens required such a move. They blamed the
government of Iraq, saying that its unwillingness to guarantee the
employees' safety had ``forced'' the United Nations to take the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the U.N. employees in its ``oil for food'' program are
in northern Iraq, in three Kurdish provinces not directly under
Baghdad's control.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations distributes food in the north and monitors
its distribution by the Iraqi government in the rest of the
country. The program permits Iraq to sell almost $5.3 billion worth
of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and basic goods.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been slowly building. Iraq warned in early January
that it might expel U.S. and British relief workers, saying in an
unsigned diplomatic note that their safety could not be assured
given public anger over air strikes which, Iraq charged and the
United States and Britain denied, had targeted ``schools,
universities, hospitals, grain depots, means of communications and
factories.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, U.N. officials have tried unsuccessfully to secure
safety guarantees from Baghdad. While all U.N. members are required
to assure such protection, there is no automatic penalty in the
group's charter for failing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is likely to be raised when the Security Council,
deeply divided over the 8-year-old economic sanctions on Iraq,
discusses policy towards Iraq at future meetings.
</P>

 Por BRENDAN M. CASE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO D.F. _ Jose Cespedes tiene una linea telefonica. Es
afortunado: solo uno de cada once mexicanos tiene telefono. Pero
quiere mas. A fin de cuentas, esta es la era de la Internet, y el
ejecutivo de mercadeo de 29 anos esta en linea. El problema es que
no puede navegar mucho tiempo en la World Wide Web sin que alguien
en su casa se queje de que lleva largo rato usando el telefono.
``En el trabajo es facil, pero por la noche quiero entrar en muchas
paginas de la Internet,'' dice Cespedes. ``En cuanto podamos,
pediremos otra linea.''
 &HT;    Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), el antiguo monopolio estatal, pone
las lineas nuevas pero a un precio elevado: entre US$180 y US$210
cada una y hay que esperar varios meses para la instalacion, sobre
todo en las zonas rurales.
 &HT;    Pero hay esperanzas para las personas como Cespedes. A
principios de este ano, varias empresas ya estaran ofreciendo
servicios telefonicos basicos, lo que significa que Telmex no sera
la unica opcion para los consumidores en busca de una segunda
linea.
 &HT;    La segunda ola de la liberalizacion de las telecomunicaciones en
Mexico ya ha comenzado, y una legion de companias esta lista para
saltar al agua. Despues de invertir un total de US$1.000 millones
en licencias de servicio local para frecuencias, con el fin de
ofrecer servicios con la tecnologia mas avanzada, estan preparadas
para dar un gran impulso al sector de las telecomunicaciones. ``Es
un privilegio estar en este negocio en este momento,'' comenta
Rodrigo Sandoval, director de mercadeo de Amaritel, una de las mas
ambiciosas entre las nuevas empresas de servicio local. ``Significa
que como vamos a hacer un negocio a partir de cero, tenemos la
oportunidad de hacerlo bien y de crear un buen servicio. Y pensamos
que el potencial de este mercado es enorme.''
 &HT;    Mexico tiene nueve lineas por cada 100 personas, un indice de
penetracion bajo aun comparado con el de otros paises
latinoamericanos. Por ejemplo, Chile y Argentina tienen 20 y Brasil
10. Estados Unidos y Canada tienen unas 55 lineas por cada 100
personas, segun la firma consultora norteamericana Booz, Allen &AMP;
Hamilton. Aun asi, el mercado del servicio local ya tiene un valor
de unos US$4.000 millones anuales, mas o menos el mismo volumen del
mercado de larga distancia, que se desregulo en 1997. Pero a
diferencia de lo que ocurre en el sector de la larga distancia,
Telmex controla casi todo el mercado del servicio local.
 &HT;    La apertura del mercado de la larga distancia ya es un triunfo
para los clientes. Los precios reales han bajado desde principios
de 1997 hasta en el 40 por ciento. Pero los beneficios de la
competencia favorecen mas a las empresas y a los clientes
particulares de alto nivel economico, es decir, a los que ya tenian
telefono. Las nuevas lineas locales son la clave de la extension
del sector mas alla de las fronteras de la elite que ha disfrutado
historicamente del servicio telefonico.
 &HT;    Aunque es improbable que los precios del servicio basico bajen
radicalmente, el acceso al servicio debe ser mas democratico.
Analistas del sector pronostican que la penetracion aumentara
rapidamente en los proximos cinco anos, impulsada por la demanda
reprimida de lineas telefonicas, el crecimiento de la Internet y la
demanda comercial de servicios de valor agregado como las
videoconferencias y la transmision de datos a alta velocidad.
Funcionarios de gobierno esperan que la competencia del servicio
local incremente la teledensidad a 20 lineas por cada 100 personas
para el ano 2000. Analistas del sector privado dicen que la meta
quiza sea demasiado optimista. Pero subrayan que en estos tiempos,
el crecimiento de las telecomunicaciones es vital para el
desarrollo de la economia en general.
 &HT;    Con inversiones que van de US$70 millones a US$600 millones en
los proximos cinco anos, los recien llegados esperan hallar un
mercado vasto y desatendido de clientes que no tienen lineas
telefonicas o que quieren mas. Para conseguir un pedazo del pastel,
han prometido un total de inversiones de US$8.000 millones entre
ahora y el ano 2003.
 &HT;    No cabe duda que hay obstaculos. Telmex se ha convertido en un
competidor muy fuerte desde que se privatizo en 1990. En aquel
momento era una de las companias mas odiadas de Mexico y generaba
mas quejas que cualquier otra firma en la Procuraduria Federal del
Consumidor.
 &HT;    Los tiempos han cambiado. La instalacion de las lineas todavia
puede tardar hasta seis meses en ciertas zonas, pero los tecnicos
de la compania han reducido el tiempo de espera a un par de semanas
en la mayor parte de Mexico D.F. Telmex ya trata a los usuarios
como clientes valiosos y las quejas de los consumidores sobre el
servicio han disminuido notablemente en los ultimos anos. ``Telmex
ha avanzado mucho en el area de atencion al cliente en servicio,
calidad y diversificacion,'' afirma Santiago Gutierrez,
vicepresidente y especialista de telecomunicaciones en Booz, Allen
&AMP; Hamilton. ``Los competidores necesitaran mucha creatividad para
enfrentarse con exito a Telmex.''
 &HT;    Las nuevas empresas de telecomunicaciones tambien afrontaran
problemas en un ambiente de regulaciones que se complico mas aun a
fines de 1998. Ante la caida del precio del petroleo, el gobierno
mexicano fijo un impuesto del 15 por ciento al servicio telefonico
local y de larga distancia, encima del impuesto al valor agregado
del 15 por ciento que los clientes ya pagan.
 &HT;    Despues de gastar millones de dolares en sus concesiones en la
subasta de frecuencias de la primavera pasada, los ejecutivos de
las nuevas companias de telecomunicaciones estaban furiosos. Los
funcionarios de la Comision Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel)
tampoco estaban felices, ya que ampliar el acceso del publico al
servicio local es uno de sus principales objetivos. ``Este impuesto
conspira contra el espiritu de apertura en el sector de las
telecomunicaciones, y es incongruente con la promocion de las
inversiones en el sector,'' senala Carlos de la Isla, director de
finanzas del Grupo Hermes, que obtuvo una licencia de servicio
local en la subasta de la primavera pasada. ``El impuesto reducira
el uso del telefono, con todas las consecuencias que trae.''
 &HT;    Otra cuestion importante que afrontan las companias de
telecomunicaciones es la clase de trato que recibiran de los
reguladores. El unico historial de Cofetel proviene del mercado de
la larga distancia, donde las filiales mexicanas de colosos
estadounidenses de las telecomunicaciones _ Alestra, de AT&AMP;T, y
Avantel, de MCI _ le han quitado a Telmex el 30 por ciento de los
ingresos totales de US$4.000 millones en el sector de larga
distancia desde que iniciaron sus operaciones. Pero tambien se
quejan de las altas cuotas de interconexion y de las tarifas de
liquidacion internacional, y acusan a Telmex de actuar como un
monopolio. Por la causa que sea, Telmex se ha burlado de los
pronosticos de su derrota frente a la competencia extranjera, y ha
demostrado que sera el gigante del sector, tanto en el servicio
local como en la larga distancia, por el futuro previsible.
 &HT;    Los proveedores de servic io local encaran sus propios retos:
encontrar nichos del mercado donde puedan dar un servicio mejor que
el de Telmex. Otros nichos podrian ser regiones particulares del
pais o servicios dirigidos a clientes comerciales. Todas las
companias nuevas planean una combinacion de lo anterior, aunque sus
estrategias exactas no se veran claramente hasta que las
implementen. ``Mientras mayor es el mercado que estas empresas
consideran, menores son sus probabilidades de triunfo,'' apunta
Gutierrez. ``La clave es que deben diferenciarse de la competencia:
de Telmex y entre ellas.''
 &HT;    Pero ante la hegemonia de Telmex en el mercado local, las
empresas tendran que trazar sus estrategias con gran cuidado. Los
analistas dicen que no hay espacio para un competidor directo de
Telmex, ya que el costo de duplicar la red nacional de Telmex seria
exorbitante.
 &HT;    La tecnologia es un aspecto que distingue a los recien llegados
mientras intentan eludir las fuertes inversiones asociadas con la
telefonia basica tradicional. Los ejecutivos de Amaritel, Telinor y
Miditel dicen que usaran una combinacion de tecnologia de circuito
local inalambrica, de fibra optica y de microonda para dar servicio
en distintas regiones del pais, mientras Unefon usara mayormente el
circuito local inalambrico. MCNI Telecom, subsidiaria de Megacable,
compania de television por cable de Guadalajara, termina su
circuito de fibra optica alrededor de Mexico D.F. y planea hacer lo
mismo en Guadalajara y Monterrey. Y Pegaso PCS y el Grupo Hermes
usaran la tecnologia inalambrica de servicios de comunicaciones
personales (PCS).
 &HT;    Amaritel tiene uno de los planes mas ambiciosos.
 &HT;    Con el apoyo de inversionistas estadounidenses, Amaritel le da
los toques finales a una red de microonda y fibra optica de US$120
millones entre Mexico D.F. y Puebla.
 &HT;    A principios de 1999, la compania planea extender la red a
Veracruz y al resto de la costa del Golfo, con una inversion total
en cinco anos de US$560 millones entre mediados de 1998 y el 2003.
Para esa fecha, una cuarta parte de la poblacion de Mexico tendra
acceso a los servicios de la firma. ``Nuestro objetivo no es
enfrentarnos con Telmex a brazo partido, sino crecer mediante la
atencion a mercados donde el servicio es insuficiente,'' dice
Sandoval.
 &HT;    El menor tamano de Amaritel frente a Telmex podria ayudar a la
empresa a captar muchos clientes comerciales. Excepto en el caso de
las grandes companias, Telmex suele tratar igual a todos sus
clientes: les ofrece los mismos servicios y el mismo nivel de
atencion. En cambio, Amaritel planea acomodarse mas a las
necesidades individuales. ``Nuestro tamano nos permitira salir de
la oficina, reunirnos con los clientes, crear soluciones exclusivas
e instalarlas rapidamente,'' dice Sandoval. Agrega que Amaritel
espera tener 40.000 lineas instaladas para fines de 1999.
 &HT;    Otra compania que podria incrementar la teledensidad es Unefon,
filial del Grupo Elektra, minorista de productos electronicos. Pero
Unefon tambien experimenta problemas en su intento de despegar.
 &HT;    Como subsidiaria de Elektra, Unefon ya cuenta con una base de
clientes entre los consumidores de la clase trabajadora que
frecuentan los 550 establecimientos de Elektra en el pais. Mejor
aun: Elektra ya tiene una detallada base de datos de historiales de
credito y muchos anos de experiencia en la venta de productos a
credito a personas que los bancos comerciales ignoran. ``Ya tenemos
una gran cantidad de sinergias para trabajar,'' dice Javier Sarro,
director general de Unefon. ``Si uno quiere estar en este negocio,
necesita distribucion, promocion, credito y cobro. Y sabemos que
Elektra tiene mas de un millon de clientes a credito que quieren un
telefono, que no tienen telefono pero que si tienen los medios para
pagarlo.''
 &HT;    Pero Unefon tiene dificultades para encontrar financiamiento. La
turbulencia de los mercados del ano pasado arruino los planes de
Unefon de situar bonos de alto rendimiento en el extranjero. Ahora
planea usar una combinacion de deuda y capital, pero a diferencia
de la mayoria de las demas companias de servicio local, no cuenta
con el financiamiento necesario para todas sus necesidades. Uno de
sus principales respaldos, Korea Telecom, se retiro de Mexico en
julio del ano pasado debido a la crisis economica de Asia. Miditel
anda ahora en busca de un nuevo socio capitalista.
 &HT;    El lider en la tecnologia PCS parece ser el Grupo Pegaso, una
recien formada empresa de telecomunicaciones que pertenece en parte
a Alejandro Burillo Azcarraga, uno de los principales accionistas
del Grupo Televisa, y de la empresa estadounidense de equipos de
comunicaciones Qualcomm. Con las arcas llenas y una licencia de PCS
en la mano, la compania es una de las favoritas para obtener una
participacion en el extremo superior del mercado. Pegaso PCS, como
se ha dado en llamar a la empresa conjunta, comenzara ofreciendo
servicio movil con tecnologia PCS, que a los clientes les parecera
una especie de servicio celular de lujo.
 &HT;    Pero solo haria falta un poco mas de inversion para proporcionar
servicio fijo de PCS, cuya calidad seria comparable al servicio de
linea terrestre sin los costos de inversion en infraestructura. Los
analistas esperan que la compania se ramifique hacia el servicio
fijo poco despues de su lanzamiento. ``Pegaso esta en una posicion
excelente. La compania tiene una tecnologia interesante y parece
volcada al mercado,'' dice Gutierrez, de Booz, Allen. ``Desde
luego, Telmex y el Grupo Hermes tambien tienen licencias de PCS,
asi que habra competencia.''
 &HT;    Mientras las empresas de servicio local luchan por establecerse
en los proximos anos, se pueden hacer varios pronosticos sin gran
temor a equivocarse.
 &HT;    Uno es que no todas sobreviviran. Al principio, 10 empresas
planeaban ofrecer servicio de larga distancia, pero ese numero se
ha reducido a cuatro, entre ellas Telmex. Se espera una reduccion
similar entre las companias de servicio local. Como la inversion
inicial es tan alta, hay una gran presion por obtener ganancias con
premura, y las que no consigan esa meta probablemente desaparezcan
rapidamente.
 &HT;    Ademas, las empresas locales exitosas podrian unirse con un
socio de larga distancia. Hay rumores de ese tipo de acuerdo por
todo el pais. Tambien se espera que a medida que el mercado
mexicano se desarrolle, se impongan practicas habituales en Estados
Unidos como la reventa, en la que una compania sin una red de
telecomunicaciones compra tiempo al por mayor en la red de otra
compania, y luego mercadea su propio servicio a clientes
minoristas.
 &HT;    Todo eso apunta a un futuro prometedor y mucho mas complicado.
Han quedado atras los dias en que Telmex monopolizaba el servicio.
Ahora seria solamente la empresa mayor en lo que ya es uno de los
mercados de telecomunicaciones mas competitivos de America Latina.
 &HT;    Lo cual es conveniente para personas como Cespedes, el ejecutivo
de mercadeo aficionado a navegar en la Internet. ``Para ser
honestos, quiero otra linea lo antes posible,'' comenta. ``Pero no
me importa si es de Telmex o de otra compania, siempre que
funcione.''

ABOUT-FACE IN WASHINGTON IN FUROR ON MISUNDERSTOOD WORD
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: LEDES with 3 grafs to recast, remove quotes.) 
 (DW) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bringing an end to the latest incident exposing
racial tensions in the nation's capital, Mayor Anthony A. Williams
on Wednesday asked a white aide who resigned last week for using
the word niggardly in a conversation with a black colleague to
return to his post.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not apologize to the aide, David Howard, Williams
conceded that he should not have accepted the resignation without
knowing what was said and how it was heard. Williams said in a
statement, ``I believe I acted too hastily in accepting David's
resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard, 44, who had worked on the mayor's election campaign, met
with him for 20 minutes Wednesday and told him he would like to
return to a city government job, but not the one he left, director
of the Office of the Public Advocate.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Howard said that he was satisfied with the
resolution of the matter but that it was ``really not about me or
the use of the word niggardly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about feelings underneath the surface that a lot of
people in Washington and the whole nation wanted to talk about.''
he said. ``This was just the flashpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he believed the city would benefit from the
incident. ``A lot of good came of this,'' Howard said. ``It has
fostered a discussion, not about racial tensions but about racial
perceptions. It can only help us to understand each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' decision follows a swirl of events that began on Jan.
15, when Howard used the word, a synonym for miserly with
Scandinavian origins centuries older than the similar-sounding
racial slur, in a budget discussion with two co-workers. One of the
co-workers said later that he thought he heard Howard use the
racial epithet. Howard had said, ``I will have to be niggardly with
this fund because it's not going to be a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   After rumors of the misunderstanding and news of hurt feelings
reached Howard, he acknowledged that he had used ``bad judgment''
in selecting such a word and offered his resignation on Jan. 26. It
was immediately accepted by Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But that only led to a bad situation's turning worse, prompting
waves of protest around the city _ from language purists, arguing
that niggardly is a perfectly acceptable word; from homosexuals,
defending Howard as the mayor's first openly-gay appointee, and
from many blacks who already have questioned Williams' loyalties to
fellow blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the incident became the latest example of the
difficulties District leaders have in navigating issues of race in
a city that, despite its black majority, has no voting
representative in an overwhelmingly white Congress that ultimately
runs Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the city's former chief financial officer, who was
educated at Yale and Harvard, is perceived by many in the city as a
less forceful representative of his fellow blacks than his
predecessor, Marion S. Barry Jr., a veteran of the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who initiated an investigation of the matter after
Howard resigned, said in his statement that he had concluded that
Howard did use the word niggardly and had not used a racial
epithet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The review also showed that an employee of the Office of the
Public Advocate did misunderstand Howard to have used a racial
epithet,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was inaugurated on Jan. 2, also said that he had
learned a lot through this incident. ``While it is important for a
mayor, or any leader, to act decisively, make bold decisions and
create a sense of urgency,'' he said, ``it is not always necessary
to act hastily.''

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the future of small-business banking? At least one person
had answers a full decade ago, and he wore T-shirts, not pin
stripes.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the actor-comic-director Robert Townsend
financed part of his independent film ``Hollywood Shuffle'' with a
fistful of credit cards. Despite punitive interest rates, the
gamble paid off when the movie became a hit. These days, some
small-business people never set foot in their local banks.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, the two top bankers for small businesses were not
banks at all, but the credit card issuers Mountain West Financial
and American Express. A third, the Advanta Corp., which provides
credit cards and other forms of business financing, was in the top
five. Together, the three accounted for a third of all corporate
loans up to $100,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Falling regulatory barriers have prompted a free-for-all among
companies that want to provide small and not-so-small businesses
with loans and other services that were once the province of
traditional banks. Many new nonbank contenders say they have caught
the big banks napping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banking is essential, banks are not,'' said Richard
Kovacevich, chief executive of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co., one of the
bluntest bankers in assessing the plight of big banks.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the country's largest brokerage house, as
well as American Express and Boston Financial Network, an Internet
upstart, are just a few of the nonbanks that see themselves as the
business bankers of the future. They and many others say they have
links to business people through brokers, credit cards and
accounting software that offer as much of a draw for customers as
bricks-and-mortar branch offices.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way the nonbanks are making their own rules and
ignoring some old ones. Most have scrapped separate savings and
checking accounts, a tradition they call anachronistic. The
nonbanks boast of lending policies that are friendlier to
entrepreneurs who often don't have large inventories or other
assets to use as collateral. And with the help of the Internet,
some finance companies offer such banking-related services as
issuing paychecks, paying bills, preparing accounts and taxes and
juggling credit lines, all with a single online account.
</P>
<P>
   The competition brings to business banking the simplicity and
lower costs that banks and nonbanks alike have begun offering
individual consumers. But the struggle to win loyalty from business
has higher stakes, because banks earn far more profits from small
and medium-size businesses than from individuals, and little
businesses sometimes become large ones, with still bigger profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks have not been well focused'' in creating products for
small businesses, said Nick Winter, a financial services specialist
with Mercer Management Consulting. ``The banks have left themselves
open to being cherry-picked by people who don't have to carry the
costs of a branch network.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, even some sizable young companies are declaring
themselves bank-free. Take Professional Modification Services, an
aircraft repair and conversion company based in Miami. With 500
employees and $40 million in sales, it is an obvious target for
Florida's leading banks. But it turned instead to Merrill, which
also serves as the personal broker of several company executives.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's opportunity came when the company had trouble
borrowing enough to pay salaries during fallow periods between
aircraft overhauls. Local bankers extended credit only when it had
a full order book. But Merrill came through with a $750,000 credit
line that was not directly tied to accounts receivable or
inventory, said Aviv Tzur, chief financial officer at Professional
Modification Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regular banks only want to lend money when you least need
it,'' Tzur said, echoing an old complaint. He spoke over the whine
of drills boring into metal at the company's hangar at Miami
International Airport as workers were pulling apart a Boeing 727
passenger plane to turn it into a cargo transporter. ``Our business
is a good one,'' he said, ``but it's not always steady. We have to
pay these people even when there are no aircraft here.''
</P>
<P>
   The credit line gave Merrill an opening to provide other
services as well. Tzur said the firm beat out First Union, the
banking powerhouse, to set up an employee stock-ownership plan.
Merrill also manages Professional Modification Service's working
capital. The Merrill checking account pays interest at rates pegged
to Treasury bonds, and it has automatic links with the company's
credit line. Local banks, Tzur said, did not offer a
cash-management package with as many features.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship is a good illustration of the threat to
traditional banks that was envisioned at least two decades ago with
the first hint that Depression-era laws separating banks from
brokerage and insurance companies might be relaxed. Merrill has
been at the forefront of nonbank financial companies that see those
boundaries as minor hurdles now, though it and other companies are
still lobbying hard to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, which
separates commercial and investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, of course, are leaping into previously forbidden
territory, too. Citigroup, for example, which was born of the $70
billion union of Travelers Group and Citicorp, obliterates the old
walls dividing banking, brokerage and insurance. But nonbanks
appear to be making headway on banking turf faster than banks are
gaining ground elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Banks face challenges in nearly every area of their business.
Twenty years ago, the typical American household stashed more than
a third of its money in a local bank. Now the average is close to a
sixth. Businesses have also reduced their reliance on commercial
bank loans, turning regularly to the bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, for one, is not passively accepting its fate. The
bank, newly merged with Norwest, calls its branches ``stores.'' It
also pioneered Internet banking and has aimed an array of new
products at small businesses. Its response is not surprising, for
it has the most to lose. With $16 billion in loans outstanding,
Wells Fargo ranks as the largest national lender to companies with
less than $20 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Michael James, who heads the Wells Fargo small-business team,
argues that a vast majority of business people still have bank
accounts, giving banks a leg up in offering true one-stop shopping.
But he acknowledges having to scramble to fend off nonbanks. ``A
decade ago no one was paying attention,'' he said. ``Now it's
becoming extremely competitive.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Merrill has plotted how to break into banking since the late
1970s, when it was run by Donald Regan, who went on to become
Treasury secretary and White House chief of staff for President
Reagan. In the 1980s it developed its ``working capital management
account,'' which pays money market interest rates and offers some
services that are still novelties for banks, like having extra cash
swept periodically into customized interest-bearing securities. But
only recently has Merrill, which faces a slew of new online
competitors in its own core brokerage business, tried to become a
full-service banker.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill executives now say they plan to challenge Wells Fargo
and other banks that focus on the small-business market. Merrill
has hired 100 commercial bankers and plans to add 25 more this
year. Stationed at regional offices around the country, the bankers
work closely with the firm's 14,000 brokers. Last year its loans to
companies with less than $100 million in sales doubled, to roughly
$4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a great deal larger than people realize,'' said John C.
Qua, a Merrill senior vice president and director of the firm's
business financial services division. ``When you consider all the
services we provide, no one is close to us nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has also challenged banks' dominance of the lucrative
trust business. With little public attention, it bought a failed
Florida savings and loan, giving it a license to offer trust
services in all 50 states. The operation, which manages custody
accounts as well as personal and charitable trust assets, is not
yet profitable, in part because Merrill is still poaching scores of
trust officers from commercial banks. The trust subsidiary now has
$80 billion in assets, including $8.4 billion that generate
management fees.
</P>
<P>
   David Chambers, chief executive of Merrill's trust subsidiary,
said many traditional banks had squandered their lead in trust
services by rushing to merge and distancing themselves from
customers. ``We are moving in the opposite direction,'' he said.
``They are consolidating their operations. We are moving people
into the local market.''
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders are building a business on the once
quirky-sounding notion that it was possible to make movies with
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, for example, has set its sights on luring
businesses with fewer than 100 employees away from banks. Some 2
million small businesses use the company's corporate cards, and
that gives American Express a target list for direct-mail
campaigns. It has recently pushed a range of banking services like
equipment financing, tax and accounting help, and short-term credit
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest rates are high, and you have to pay it back
fast,'' said David Reisner, who owns a household appliance store,
Allwell Supplies in Brooklyn, and borrowed from American Express
four or five times in the last year when his store's revenue
sagged. ``I would describe it as a quick fix, not a long-term
solution. But it's done instantly and no hassles.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers like that show that American Express can leverage its
brand name into a range of banklike services, said Steve Alesio,
president of the company's small-business services division.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago these kinds of people were getting
services from traditional community banks,'' he said. ``They had
too much paperwork, and some had cash-flow problems. We are
offering a simpler service that's national in scope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has also taken away one of the traditional banks'
key advantages: geography. Boston Financial Network, the new online
banking service, has no branches or tellers. But it says it can act
as banker, broker, bookkeeper and bill payer for small businesses
anywhere in the country _ through a single Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Like some other new banking companies, Boston Financial Network
is just the middleman. Electronic bill payments are contracted out
to the Checkfree Corp. Computing Resources Inc. handles payroll
services. The mutual fund company Scudder Kemper manages cash in
money-market funds. And if negotiations are successful, credit
lines will come from American Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran a small business for a while, and I could not get
support from banks and brokerage firms,'' said Barry Star, chairman
of Boston Financial Network and a former Fidelity Investments
executive. ``I built this service for myself.''

WWII HERO WALLENBERG MAY GET THAT SPOTLIGHT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   family fortune, a great education, a secure and unlimited
future. In 1944, he risked everything to save Hungarian Jews from
Nazi extermination.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks as one of the greatest _ and least known _ heroes of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A Swedish businessman and diplomat, he volunteered to go to
Budapest, Hungary, where the Nazis were moving to wipe out the last
large European community of Jews. His relentless, courageous
efforts prevented Adolf Eichmann from deporting tens of thousands _
estimates reach as high as 100,000 _ to the death camps.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Raoul Wallenberg. Or should I say ``is'' Raoul
Wallenberg?
</P>
<P>
   During his months in Budapest, he lived in constant danger.
Eichmann called him ``Jewdog Wallenberg'' and ordered his murder.
He survived partly because he slept in a different place every
night.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, his humanitarian efforts were ignored by the
Soviets who thought he was a spy and took him prisoner. While the
Russians said he died many years ago in detention, some people
believe he could still be alive. They include Morris Wolff of
Phoenix, who has spent 15 years researching the life and
disappearance of this extraordinary man.
</P>
<P>
   A Yale law graduate and ex-professor, Wolff moved here a year
ago and worked briefly for the Arizona Corporation Commission. He's
now finishing a book on Wallenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff taught human rights law and was practicing in Philadelphia
when he was asked by Wallenberg's family in Sweden if he could help
them. He filed a federal lawsuit in 1984, alleging the Soviet Union
had violated international law.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., found the Soviets
liable for violating Wallenberg's human rights, imposed a fine of
$39 million and ordered them to produce him. The ruling was
appealed, however, and set aside for lack of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The official Soviet line is that he died of a heart attack in a
Moscow prison in 1947. Others speculate that Josef Stalin had
ordered his execution. But freed Soviet prisoners reported
Wallenberg had been seen into the 1980s, and no credible evidence
of his death has been provided.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1981 book ``Righteous Gentile _'' Wallenberg was a Lutheran
_ John Bierman concluded that he might still be living. He cited
the Soviet tradition of keeping well-known people, from Feodor
Dostoyevsky to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in confinement for long
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, whose research draws on both American and Soviet
intelligence reports, is optimistic that Wallenberg survives.
Conversations with two Russian Orthodox priests in 1993 strengthen
his belief. He's hopeful that his book will ``ignite a clamor and
lead the United States to demand an honest accounting of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   America's efforts on behalf of Wallenberg have been shamefully
slight, especially in light of his U.S. ties. He was an honor
student at the University of Michigan and went to Budapest at the
request of the American War Refugee Board.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War's onset, tense Soviet relations apparently
figured into U.S. apathy. Wallenberg's fate wasn't regarded as
important enough to risk stirring up more diplomatic trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A Free Wallenberg Committee was formed in 1980, and for only the
second time in history, Congress granted him honorary U.S.
citizenship (the first honoree was Winston Churchill). But that
campaign and Swedish efforts produced nothing new from the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to overstate how much Wallenberg gave up in 1944.
Being a Wallenberg in Sweden is akin to being a Rockefeller in this
country, only bigger. Companies under Wallenberg family control
last year accounted for 40 percent of the Swedish stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff said one reason for writing the book is so more Americans
will know of the sacrifices made by ``one of the most selfless
citizens of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope the book will acquaint more people with a prodigious
hero. And wherever he may be, I hope Wallenberg has found peace. He
would be 86 today. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is perhaps one good thing to say about the exuberant
frenzy in Internet stocks: It is opening up the Silicon riches
beyond the young boys' club that has hoarded it until now.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Internet billionaire, for example, is not some lucky
Stanford grad student or nocturnal Seattle programmer barely past
shaving age.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's billion-dollar lottery ticket was in the hands of
Muriel Siebert, a veteran of breaking through glass ceilings for
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Siebert, as she is known to those old enough to remember
when electronic trading meant calling your broker on the telephone,
caused quite a few waves in 1967 as the first woman to buy a seat
on the New York Stock Exchange. Later, she was the first woman
banking superintendent of New York state.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the shares of the Siebert Financial Corp., the
holding company for Ms. Siebert's brokerage firm, soared $23.50, or
90.4 percent, to $49.50. A week ago, the shares traded at $11. The
stock's ascent places Ms. Siebert's paper wealth slightly over $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Siebert Financial has benefited from investors' interest in
online trading, which has turned out to be the hottest business on
the Internet. In the fourth quarter of 1998, one in every seven
stock trades in this country was entered over the Internet,
according to Bill Burnham, electronic commerce analyst and trading
guru at Credit Suisse First Boston. And in January, he estimates,
online volume rose by a third.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the shares of any company that offers stock trading
on a World Wide Web site has been surging. Even shares of JB Oxford
Holdings, a Beverly Hills brokerage firm being investigated on
charges of market manipulation, rose 153 percent Wednesday, to $12.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the electronic trading business is hardly easy.
E(STAR)Trade Group Inc., despite a $100 million investment in
technology, suffered significant system problems Wednesday and was
unable to accept trades in two periods during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say E(STAR)Trade will suffer no long-term damage from
the incidents because most of the other online firms have also had
occasional computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500,''
Burnham said. ``You can pull over whoever you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   In this fast field, Siebert Financial had been something of an
also-ran. The brokerage firm has offered online trading for the
last several years. But Burnham says it is a minor player in this
market, with no more than a few thousand online trades a day.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the firm hardly has a blue-chip pedigree. It went
public in 1996, not through a traditional offering, but by buying a
defunct Brooklyn furniture company, a tactic looked down upon by
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped stock traders from seizing on Siebert as
potentially a cheaper way to bet on electronic brokerage than by
buying the already expensive leaders: E(STAR)Trade, Ameritrade and
Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that many people actually believe that Siebert will be
the next E(STAR)Trade, but that enough people are willing to bet
that someone else will think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a group of marauding traders who are doing this with
their eyes wide open,'' Burnham said. ``There is talk in the chat
rooms; then there is takeover speculation, and finally the stock
starts to move, bringing in the momentum players.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are only 710,000 shares of Siebert Financial that the
public can trade, as Ms. Siebert owns 92 percent of the company.
Since 10.4 million shares of Siebert Financial traded on the Nasdaq
stock market Wednesday, the average share changed hands seven times
during the day. (Nasdaq counts each trade twice).
</P>
<P>
   What that means, of course, is that the real price of Siebert
Financial, should Ms. Siebert choose to sell it, will likely be far
less than the value ascribed to it by the market Wednesday.
</P>

 &HT;    Witch denied chance to sponsor baseball team
 &HT;    By Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE _ A local witch could have a legal battle brewing
after a youth baseball league turned down her offer of $250 to
sponsor a team this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Ygraine, who calls herself a witch and owns a store that
peddles items linked to the occult, didn't get it when the
president of the Babe Ruth Bambino Baseball League returned her
money. She was especially perplexed since league representatives
sought her out as a donor, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying, `Is this going to be a problem?' and I was
assured that all they wanted to do was help the kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ygraine says her religion doesn't involve animal sacrifices, nor
does it promote hate. In fact, she says, the Church of Satan
stresses responsibility, self-empowerment, and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   But after visiting Pandora's Box, Ygraine's shop on Port St.
Lucie Boulevard, league president Dave Bowman cited league
guidelines that forbid sponsorship by groups whose practices are
``inimical to the welfare of youth'' and backed away from the
arrangement. The new league, which has its first games Feb. 20,
serves children ages 5 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most disturbing thing,'' Bowman said, is that the shop was
selling daggers without keeping them under lock and key. The
religion had nothing to do with his decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that we felt we don't need,'' he said. ``I
don't know what she is. I don't know if she's a Baptist or
Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ygraine could face a legal battle. Sieg Christman, president
of the Treasure Coast chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union, plans on calling the organization's attorneys today, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little league, being a private organization . . .
basically has the right to discriminate,'' Christman said.
``However, the problem you run into is that they use public lands
to be able to have their baseball leagues on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman seemed unfazed by the ACLU interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be bullied,'' he said. ``I'm going to stick
up for this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone share's Bowman's concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Pierce Central High School baseball program on
Wednesday happily accepted $170 from Ygraine, who when she was 17
named herself after King Arthur's mother, a figure in Celtic
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   And last week Port St. Lucie High School's baseball program
accepted $220 from Ygraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's money they're giving, it's no problem,'' Port St.
Lucie High School athletic director Danny Ninestine said. ``That's
different from them donating Budweiser shirts.''

SPORTS COLUMN: IOC ARROGANCE IS OUR OWN FAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (Eds: See also OLY-DRUGS) 
(mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is out in the open now. We are back to 1776 and 1789 and all
those memorable years. In the foolish little world of sport, the
lords are trying to tell the rabble what is good for them, and they
are answering back.
</P>
<P>
   The lords of sport ride in limousines instead of liveried
coaches, and the monarch of the ``Olympic family'' prefers a
private railroad train when he travels in Japan. When they hold
their sporting events, they reside behind barbed wire and armed
guards, while the people mill in the tawdry streets.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland, the United States and 15
members of the European Union demanded that the International
Olympic Committee not even try to manage a proposed agency to
monitor drugs. And in the face of a mushrooming bribery scandal,
some IOC delegates even balked at giving up their rights to vote
for host cities.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly leaders of the IOC responded by taking off their
polite masks and snarling at the plebians. Of course, we contribute
to this by fluttering over soppy Olympic sagas, creating our own
soap-opera royals.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, we take all sports too seriously, giving platforms to
blithering jocks like Glenn Hoddle, who was sacked on Tuesday as
coach of the English national soccer team. Hoddle's loopy blend of
Christianity and Hindu reincarnation says that disabled people are
victims of bad karma in a previous life.
</P>
<P>
   It's our fault for letting sports figures think they can babble
like this. Eugene Robinson, the self-styled prophet of the Atlanta
Falcons, ran around a victorious locker room a few weeks ago saying
God had favored his team over Minnesota. On the night before the
Super Bowl, the prophet was arrested for allegedly propositioning a
plainclothes police officer for sex. I suspect that people would
feel far less vindictive about one man's disgrace if we had not
been subject to his ranting about divine intervention in a stupid
football game.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, we invest too much moral authority in Juan Antonio
Samaranch, who is essentially an autocratic deliverer of expensive
sporting events. Last week Samaranch made an apology for the
corruption in the bidding process for Olympic host cities.
</P>
<P>
   This week the IOC grappled with another scandal _ the
sophisticated use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes.
During a summit on drugs in Lausanne, much of the public criticism
of the IOC has come from the Colonies. Hey, it's in our rebellious
genes.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, director of the U.S. Office of National Drug
Control Policy, called for an independent drug agency that was not
tied into the IOC. He also called for a 365-day-a-year drug-testing
policy rather than the current slapdash system.
</P>
<P>
   The lords of the IOC did not like being told what to do. Jacques
Rogge, an IOC executive board member from Belgium, criticized all
American professional sports because Mark McGwire had hit 70 home
runs last year while admittedly taking a body-building substance,
androstenedione, that is forbidden under Olympic rules but not by
baseball rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go on the moralizing and lecturing tone, you must be
sure your own house is in order,'' Rogge said. Rogge may not be
aware that McGwire was indeed criticized in the news media and by
some medical authorities who feared he might be harming himself,
and surely setting a bad example to younger athletes. Besides, who
is Jacques Rogge to criticize poor schnooky baseball? That's our
job.
</P>
<P>
   Another candid exposure of arrogance came from Prince Alexandre
de Merode, the IOC official overseeing the drug epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take offense that politicians don't trust me to chair this
agency,'' de Merode said. ``Why should I trust politicians?''
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that the prince must be sneaking looks at the
congressional impeachment process on CNN. Nevertheless, I would
trust our buffoons more than just about anybody with the word
``prince'' in front of his name. At least politicians have to run
for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The arrogant patricians and corrupt delegates of the IOC
obviously cannot keep their castle in order. This would all be a
comic opera except that communities around the world must scurry to
buy favor with the IOC. Salt Lake City will be forever tarnished by
reasonable suspicions that every friend of the Olympics _ every
sponsor, every municipality, every advertiser, every network _
diverted company and public resources and our tax dollars to
purchase the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we've been through that before _ No Taxation Without
Representation. Samaranch and his henchmen are not amused at the
criticism. We share the blame for treating these people like
athletic royalty in the first place.

FROM TRASH TO TREASURE: MEXICAN SEA WASTE BECOMES U.S. FERTILIZER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fish guts.
</P>
<P>
   GOODYEAR, Ariz. _ Shrimp heads.
</P>
<P>
   Crab shells.
</P>
<P>
   What for generations has been trash to Mexico's fishermen has
turned to treasure for Hector Tirado.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found a niche nobody else wants,'' said Roger Blotsky,
founder of BioFlora Systems in Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   BioFlora, the largest maker of organic fertilizer in the United
States, buys much of the fish-based ingredients for its products
from Tirado's company.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of Phoenix-based Marlindo Products, Tirado brokers fish
products from five Mexican suppliers to U.S. feed and fertilizer
manufacturers like BioFlora. He also buys them outright and resells
them in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Marlindo's products include a thick brown liquid called
condensed fish solubles, made of fish guts and waste but nearly
one-third protein.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tirado's cousin, manager of a fish-meal processing plant
in Guaymas, who turned him on to the strong-smelling, neglected
items. Processors had previously thrown the waste back into the
ocean, but as Mexico's environmental rules tightened, the cousin
asked Tirado to find a market for the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Tirado, an agronomist who worked in sales and marketing at
Ralston Purina Co. for 17 years, realized that the high-protein
content meant it could be mixed with hay to enrich animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   After two misadventures getting railroad tanker cars out of
Mexico to feed lots in Iowa, Tirado found a new market in companies
that make feed for farms growing trout, salmon, shrimp and catfish.
The fish like the solubles' powerful taste, but again Tirado ran
into problems.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers wanted a consistently high level of protein in the
feed, but the Mexican processors didn't particularly care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make their money on fish meal, and this was a nuisance to
them,'' Tirado said.
</P>
<P>
   Re-analyzing the solubles, ``I realized all that a plant needs
is in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he started calling manufacturers of organic fertilizers,
sending them samples and soon he began receiving orders for a
barrel here and a tanker load there.
</P>
<P>
   Today, BioFlora buys more than half a million gallons of fish
solubles from Marlindo and uses its products in all of its 500
formulations, Blotsky said. Smaller makers of products for home
gardeners also buy Marlindo ingredients, Tirado said.
</P>
<P>
   Blotsky said he first began working with Tirado about eight
years ago, when BioFlora needed a licensed broker to buy fish
products in Ensenada. Tirado's family background in the fishing
industry and his language skills make him unique in the business,
Blotsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a passion for stewardship. Most people wouldn't
monkey with that kind of material,'' he said of Tirado.
</P>
<P>
   BioFlora also has started buying another Marlindo product _ crab
meal, made from the shells discarded by crab processing plants. The
meal will go into organic fertilizers, but Tirado thinks it also
has possibilities among health-food manufacturers who believe the
chitin in the shells absorbs fat and carries it out of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Tirado and Blotsky also have gone into partnership in a venture
to dry shrimp heads into an intense smelling, high-protein meal to
be used in feed and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   From his family's years in the Guaymas shrimp business, Tirado
knew sailors were selling the shrimp tails but throwing away
thousands of tons of heads a year. Getting the product is a
challenge, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel it's not worth the time to save them and bring them
to port,'' he said. The next move may be hiring a boat to ferry the
product from ship to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Large commodity companies are starting to get involved in fish
byproducts, but Tirado says his small firm has a couple of
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest, he says, is that he knows every processing
plant manager in Guaymas so well that he can walk in without an
appointment. Also in his favor is the fact that large companies
aren't innovators willing to spend the time he does developing new
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in December gave
Marlindo its 1998 Hispanic Business Award for Innovation, citing
Tirado's unique products and constant font of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlindo name, which means ``pretty sea'' in Spanish, was
one of the brand names Tirado's father used in his shrimp business.
</P>
<P>
   The son's namesake grew slowly at first.
</P>
<P>
   Annual sales totaled a meager $11,000 eight years ago, topped
$70,000 four years ago, ``then all of a sudden took off,'' Tirado
said. Last year the five-employee company generated nearly $4
million in sales, the bulk of it from fish meal, and Tirado says $6
million is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the rapid gain to customers finally getting
comfortable with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot had been buying tentatively, trying me out,'' he said.
``When they saw I could deliver when they wanted it and at the
quality, word started spreading around.''
</P>
<P>
   Tirado's long road to success did take a personal toll.
</P>
<P>
   When he quit Ralston Purina after various jobs in sales and
marketing, he started a company where he acted as the American
sales force for midsize Mexican companies with high-quality
products.
</P>
<P>
   He took on products ranging from shoes to flowers, leather goods
to glass chandeliers, things he knew little about. The two or three
tough years he expected stretched to 12. His wife divorced him,
friends and family thought he was crazy, and there were times he
doubted he'd have money to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had to keep on going,'' he said. ``I never wanted to be
subject to a steady income. I wanted to not have limits.'' &QL; 
Maybe now, Tirado says, they don't think he's crazy after all. &QL;

CHINESE LEAD WOMEN'S POLE-VAULT FIELD   AT MILLROSE GAMES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 1987, and Cai Weiyan was performing acrobatics at a
Chinese sports school.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coach who was doing well with men in the pole vault asked me
if I liked track and field and did I like pole-vaulting,'' she
recalled Wednesday. ``I was 14. I didn't know anything about it. He
said: `Are you afraid? Try it.' I did. The first day, I couldn't
clear the bar. By the end of the year, I did 3.15 meters'' _ 10
feet 4 inches _ ``and it was exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, at another Chinese sports school, Sun Caiyun was
playing many sports, including basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that,'' she said through the same translator, Zhou
Xinmin, the manager of the Chinese track team now in New York, ``I
had no idea about the pole vault. A pole-vault coach saw I had a
tall body. He asked me to try the pole vault. I tried it and liked
it, but I lacked strength. The first time I cleared the bar, I did
2.80 meters,'' or 9-2\.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, in the 92nd annual Chase Millrose Games at Madison
Square Garden, Cai and Sun will compete in the women's pole vault.
Last year, when America's leading indoor track meet introduced the
event, it became one of the competitive highlights of the night.
This year, with Cai, Sun and Daniela Bartova of the Czech Republic,
there is great potential again.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 world ranking by Track and Field News, Cai is third
and Sun is eighth. They are the pioneers of a relatively new sport,
which met wide resistance when it was introduced in the United
States. Too unladylike, critics said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same in China,'' Cai said. ``When I start to vault,
some teammates said this is a dangerous sport. I wasn't afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun found the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some friends said it wasn't an Olympic event,'' she said.
``Some friends said this is a men's sport not fit for women. Now
they think I made the right choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thinking. Sun became the first official world record-holder
at 13-3}, and five weeks later Cai raised the record to 13-4\. In
all, Sun has set world records 11 times indoors and six times
outdoors. Their career bests are 14-3\ for Cai and 14-{ for Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The world records are now held by Emma George of Australia _
15-} outdoors and 14-11 indoors. The progress is amazing in an
event for which world records were first recognized only five years
ago and which has not yet been contested in a world outdoor
championships or Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Women's pole-vaulting is still an esoteric sport. Cai said that
perhaps 100 women in all of China are pole-vaulters. But last year
alone, 17 women from nine nations cleared 14 feet outdoors, led by
George (15-}), Bartova (14-9{) and Stacy Dragila (14-8\), the
American record-holder and last year's Millrose winner. Dragila is
injured now. Sun said that if men can clear 6 meters (19-8\), which
eight men have done in the last decade, then women can clear 5
meters (16-4}).
</P>
<P>
   But as the bar gets higher, the expectations do, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a little easier,'' Cai said, ``because China
started the event. But now it's everywhere and it's high pressure,
but it's also an encouragement for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Cai and Sun are the first Millrose athletes to come from
mainland China. Li Tong ran in the men's hurdles at Millrose in the
1980s, but at the time he was a student at Washington State, where
his name was Americanized to Tony Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese pole-vaulters are a little Americanized, too. When
Sun was asked if she knew she would be competing on the same floor
where Michael Jordan had performed wonders, her eyes lighted, then
saddened. ``It's a pity,' she said, ``that he is retiring from
basketball.''  &QL;

IRISH STRUGGLING WITH BIG TEN DECISION
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie knows he has a reliable spiel when he
sits in living rooms across the nation with potential recruits and
their parents. He tells them about his program's national
television contract and how, through 111 years of winning football,
the Catholic university has been one of the few and certainly the
most famous independent team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Davie, along with the rest of the Notre Dame
community, will find out how much longer that might be true. The
university president, the Rev. Edward A. Malloy, will present a
recommendation to the Board of Trustees on whether or not Notre
Dame should seek an affiliation with the Big Ten Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win situation, though I'm glad I'm not making the
decision,'' Davie said. ``There is a concern about the unknown.
Would Notre Dame remain as unique as Notre Dame is, if it were
aligned with a conference? We're in an enviable position as an
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to join Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State, as
well as eight Midwestern institutions, is as much about academics
and the fate of its less-famous sports teams, which are now
affiliated with the Big East, as it is about football. The Big Ten
has not invited Notre Dame to join, but the conference has engaged
in months of what its commissioner, Jim Delany, calls
``comprehensive information exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that they would be a great addition to our
conference,'' Delany said, acknowledging that the Big Ten had
previously approached the Fighting Irish. ``But that's far short of
offering an invitation or coming to a membership agreement. We have
some heavy lifting to do if they are interested in moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Notre Dame community appears split on the decision. Its
Faculty Senate has endorsed the alliance because it would allow
Notre Dame to share information and research materials with
conference schools, and the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But students appear less eager, as demonstrated by the chants of
``No Big Ten'' at basketball games as the Board of Trustees'
meeting draws near. Alumni are concerned that the university might
lose its identity as an independent Catholic university.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Notre Dame keeps its gate receipts from football, its
bowl payouts and the $7 million a year from its television contract
with NBC, a contract that will reap $8 million annually in the
years 2000 to 2005.
</P>
<P>
   If it joined the Big Ten, however, Notre Dame would have to
share its gate receipts, television revenue and other earnings with
member schools.
</P>
<P>
   This past bowl season, according to Delany, the conference
grossed about $25 million, with $19 million divided among 11
members.The other $6 million was shared by the five schools that
played in bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our revenues have grown from $18 million 10 years ago to over
$70 million today,'' said Delany, who expects to reach $100 million
in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's biggest concession would be giving up the
independent television contract that has helped spread its mystique
and has aided Davie's recruiting pitch. Instead, the team would be
included in the Big Ten contract with ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wadsworth, the Notre Dame athletic director, has said a
deal with the Big Ten would be a wash economically because of
factors like reduced travel time. The nearest rival for its teams
playing in the Big East Conference is more than 350 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Tranghese, the Big East commissioner, said his office
has not been privy to Notre Dame's negotiations, but says his
conference would survive if the Fighting Irish defected. ``If they
think they should go, then they should go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davie said talk of joining the Big Ten did not come up among
players in the recently concluded recruiting period, but it wasn't
far from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to sit in a young man's home and sell them on the
uniqueness we have,'' he said. ``But I understand, it's just not a
football question.'' &QL;

A LITTLE OF JORDAN GOES WITH BURRELL
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The first question that John Calipari
posed to Scott Burrell on Wednesday had nothing to do with his jump
shot or his conditioning. It was about Michael Jordan. While
Burrell, the newly acquired small forward, warmed up for his first
practice with the New Jersey Nets, Calipari asked loudly and in
earshot of his entire team, ``How hard did Michael practice?''
</P>
<P>
   When Burrell began speaking reverently about how Jordan never
coasted through a workout and challenged teammates who did to
fistfights, Calipari perused the gymnasium and was pleased to find
his players listening intently.
</P>
<P>
   Experiences like that, lessons learned from playing for the
National Basketball Association champion Chicago Bulls last season,
are part of the reason the Nets signed Burrell to a one-year, $1
million contract Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that guys started huddling around him to hear about
how hard Michael Jordan practiced,'' Calipari said. ``It's nice to
have a guy who knows how hard they've worked and what they've done
there to get to where we're trying to go here.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Burrell can do more for the Nets than share inspiring
tales of Jordan and the Bulls. The 6-foot-7-inch small forward
known for his long-range shooting and chest-to-chest defense fills
one of the biggest voids on this young Nets squad: he is a true
small forward, not a shooting guard with strength or a power
forward with quickness.
</P>
<P>
   As has been Calipari's custom, he would prefer not to work
Burrell in slowly. Last year, he signed Sherman Douglas on the
first day of the season and played him 19 minutes that evening
against Indiana. With Kerry Kittles due to miss the first two weeks
of the season with a bruised right knee, Calipari would like to
move Kendall Gill to shooting guard and start Burrell at small
forward in Saturday's opener at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Burrell is not ready. Afraid of injuring himself during the
lockout, he played little five-on-five and took part in a training
regimen that consisted mainly of shooting jumpers, riding a
stationary bike and working on a stairmaster. Ten pounds heavier
than his playing weight of 225 pounds and visibly worn down after
Wednesday's practice, Burrell estimated that he is playing at only
30 percent of his capacity. Calipari concurred and, and although he
said he was not disappointed, said he would not start Burrell on
Saturday. Instead, shooting guard Lucious Harris will take Kittles'
spot in the first five.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind I'm ready to start, but not physically,'' Burrell
said. ``If that's on their mind, tell them to hold up a little bit
longer. Out of my whole game, confidence and everything, I'm not
even close to halfway there. yet. But if I stay within myself, I
can definitely contribute right away. But I'm not going to try to
dunk on anyone because I know I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rust will be evident early on, Burrell should become a
key contributor. His defense is his biggest strength, and with
Calipari emphasizing better play on that side of the court, he is
sure to get major minutes. And while he rarely got to showcase his
offensive skills as a Bulls reserve _ he averaged just 5.2 points
in 12 minutes a game last season _ Burrell is capable of putting up
points in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   As a starter for Charlotte in the 1995-1996 season, he averaged
a career-high 13.2 points before injuries cut his season to 20
games. And in Game 3 of last year's first-round Bulls sweep of the
Nets, he scored 23 points on 9 of 11 shooting, including 3 of 5
from 3-point range. One of the reasons Burrell chose the Nets over
Houston, Miami, Phoenix and Portland (which offered him $750,000
more than the Nets) was because he felt he would get more of an
opportunity to have nights like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've started before in this league and I know I can start
again,'' Burrell said.
</P>
<P>
   There are already rumblings that, when Kittles returns and
Burrell gets into shape, Gill, always the subject of trade rumors,
will be moved to the bench or traded. Calipari disputed that today,
saying that in a 50-game season, you can never have enough quality
players. But he did leave room for competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Scott is better? Obviously,'' Calipari said, referring to a
lineup change. ``But Kendall is absolutely secure in how he plays
and what he'll do for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrell showed Wednesday that he already thinks the way his new
teammates do. Joining the chorus of Nets players that has declared
the team an Eastern Conference contender, he said: ``New Jersey has
a great basketball team. I don't see why we can't be one of the two
or three best teams in the East this year.'' &QL;

SEAVER TO REPLACE MCCARVER IN METS' TV BOOTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball history books do not readily show that during their
playing careers Tim McCarver ever knocked Tom Seaver out of a game.
But Wednesday Seaver knocked McCarver out of the Mets' broadcast
booth.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that Seaver said was long overdue, the Mets brought
back their Hall of Fame pitcher to serve in a variety of roles,
most visibly as one of their announcers for the 50 games this
coming season and the 40 games next year that will be televised by
WPIX-New York. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under a two-year contract, Seaver will also work for the Mets in
uniform, beginning with a 10-day period in spring training and
continuing throughout the season as an organization-wide pitching
guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the general manager, the manager or the
pitching coach,'' Seaver cautioned during a conference call with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I wonder why it didn't happen five or six years ago.
I'm just glad we've been able to get me back and get me involved. I
feel I can help the organization in many aspects. I think I'm
capable of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   But in bringing back the greatest player in their 37-year
history, the Mets dumped perhaps the best television analyst they
have ever had. McCarver said only last week that he was prepared to
return for his 17th season with the Mets ``f I'm wanted,'' but he
found out Wednesday that he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to do your job from a journalistic standpoint,''
McCarver said, ``and I can walk away knowing that I exercised every
bit of my journalistic integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that Seaver was replacing McCarver instantly prompted
speculation that manager Bobby Valentine had a hand in the change.
McCarver is rarely shy about offering on-air opinions and has been
critical of Valentine at times. In turn, the manager hasn't been
fond of the comments. But the Mets denied any link.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a front-office decision,'' General Manager Steve Phillips
said. ``Bobby didn't do anything to push this one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bingham, the club's senior vice president for marketing and
broadcasting, said: ``This didn't start as Tim. It started as Tom.
It started as a desire to bring Tom in. Tim was here for many, many
years. He had a long and very good career here. It was not a desire
to get Tim out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingham said the Mets considered having Seaver and McCarver work
together but decided both did their best work as analysts, not as
play-by-play broadcasters. He said the Mets hoped to keep Gary
Thorne and Ralph Kiner, the other two members of the over-the-air
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver's path of return to Shea Stadium, where he has not been
since August 1992, began last summer when his agent, Matt Merola,
called Nelson Doubleday, the Mets' co-owner, and, according to
Seaver, asked, ``Why isn't Tom involved in your ball club one way
or another?''
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday, Seaver said, talked to Phillips, and Phillips
contacted the former pitcher. (The Mets' acquisition of Mike Piazza
last season came about in the same way.) The broadcasting element
of his employment, Seaver said, ``came from both sides talking
about how to best utilize Tom Seaver working for the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   His dual role as club employee and broadcaster raised the
objectivity issue, but both Seaver and club officials asserted he
could comment and analyze with integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue we thought about and discussed,'' Bingham said.
``We addressed this issue with Tom. I think anyone who knows Tom
knows he's going to be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver said he didn't want to be just a broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would find it somewhat hollow,'' he said, ``if I wasn't
allowed to use my expertise, what I know about pitching, in helping
this organization. I insisted that be part of the deal. It would be
silly not to have me do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his role in the organization will develop ``as we go
along, as we find out what is needed and what they feel I have to
offer. I don't think they know, and I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he felt he could help pitchers with ``the mental
part, the physical part, the mechanical part, all the nuances that
pitching is about. I feel I can help the whole spectrum of
pitchers, from the rookie coming into camp to the veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Seaver back is part of the Mets' attempt to correct an
oversight. They basically have ignored their past. Former Met
Mookie Wilson, one of their coaches, is a rarity in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do need to connect more with our history,'' Bingham
said. ``We wanted to reconnect with Tom. He's an icon of our
club.''

 &HT;    President to honor Aaron, his feat
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hard to imagine now how little that Hank Aaron
liked to talk or think about The Record in the years after he
surpassed Babe Ruth as baseball's home-run king.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had 755 reasons to feel he was on top of the world, he
often just wanted to get away from the world and the racial hatred
that marred his climb to break Ruth's career mark of 714 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things went on back then you want to erase,'' Aaron
said. ``That's one of the reasons I don't talk about it as much as
I should. But it's over with, done with. Now maybe some good things
can come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Aaron is ready to embrace that time,
place and accomplishment and the sport that allowed him to achieve
it. And the feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a 65th birthday gala on Friday night in Atlanta,
Major League Baseball will pay tribute to Aaron this season and to
the 25th anniversary of the year he broke Ruth's career record.
Friday's expected guests at the Hyatt Regency Hotel include
President Clinton, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Gov. Roy Barnes, former
Gov. Zell Miller, Mayor Bill Campbell, former Mayor and U.N.
Ambassador Andrew Young, Larry King, Bob Costas, Frank Robinson,
Ernie Banks, Al Downing, Sammy Sosa and baseball commissioner Bud
Selig.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably going to be the happiest moment of my life,''
Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, it will help make up for what should have been one of
the happiest times of his life, when he hit his 715th home run off
Downing on April 8, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of nearly 54,000 in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and
countless fans watching on TV saw the two fans jog alongside Aaron
on his home-run trot, the embrace between Aaron and his mother at
home plate and the joy of his Braves teammates. But what they
couldn't see was Aaron's overwhelming sense of relief and the
lingering pain, pounded into his memory by a barrage of racially
charged hate mail and threats.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Billye, knew it well. She knew that her husband felt
the rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to be the ultimate in their field,'' Billye
Aaron said, ``and once you get it, it's downgraded, no longer
important, based on reaction and remarks from a society that wasn't
ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron watched Pete Rose break Ty Cobb's hit record in 1985. Last
season, he followed Mark McGwire's and Sammy Sosa's chase of Roger
Maris. He watched how much they enjoyed what they were going
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the opposite of what I had gone through when I was
chasing the record,'' Aaron said. ``That's the reason I'm looking
forward to (the tribute this season). When you think what might
have been, what could have been, if things had been a lot different
25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said it was 10 years before he could begin to put it in
proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the longer it stayed, the more people started saying,
'Hey, that's something to be reckoned with,' `` Aaron said. ``The
record was talked about more. And it was talked about not
negatively, (but) more in terms of saying, 'You know, I never was
given my just (reward).'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I guess people say it's time for us to realize that this
was something very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron concedes that, at the time he broke the record, he had a
hard time grasping how and what it meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had an agenda,'' Aaron said. ``I always had something
I wanted to try to do. In baseball, I always wanted to do the very
best I could do, regardless of whether I was playing with a team
that was on top or whether we were on the bottom. I always thought
my job was to be the very best I could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's goals now center on numbers like 1 million. That's the
number of dollars he hopes to raise for the Hank Aaron Chasing the
Dream Foundation at his birthday gala Friday night. Since he and
his wife established the foundation in 1994, the Aarons have raised
nearly $500,000. Aaron hopes to quadruple it when he travels to 20
ballparks and the All-Star Game this summer to be honored.
</P>
<P>
   By April, 44 children will have benefited from Aaron foundation
awards. He'd like to get that number up to 755.
</P>
<P>
   His also remains a strong voice for minorities in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Aaron was pegged as quiet and withdrawn,
but as he got older he became more outspoken. He's been that way
since, never shying away from voicing his opinion on baseball's
problems through his years in the Braves front office and now in
his position on the board of directors of TBS and the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've made some progress, but we were so far behind,''
Aaron said. ``Is there ever going to be (a minority) that owns a
franchise? When you talk about minority participation, does each
team have minority doctors? Do we go to black banks? Does baseball
itself address the issue of minority participation as far as Little
League? Does baseball address the fact that we have an economic
crunch in this country that has certainly hurt minorities? Do black
kids come out to baseball games?''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said he's tried to put his own racial hardships behind
him. He said his bitterness is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd asked me (if I felt bitterness) three years after I
had retired from baseball, I would have said yes,'' Aaron said.
``(But now) I don't have any. That's all history.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own place in history, there are a few more numbers
Aaron would like to be remembered for, in addition to 715, 755 and
44, his jersey number: They are 2,297, his RBI total, first
all-time; 3,771, his career hit total, third all-time behind Rose
and Cobb; and 2,174 runs scored, tied for second with Ruth behind
Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be remembered as someone who was not only able to
hit home runs but was able to do all of the things that (earned)
the label 'superstar,''' Aaron said. ``I ran the bases, stole
bases, hit home runs, all these things that are necessary _ rather
than, 'Ol' Hank hit 755 home runs, and that was it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, he and his wife Billye welcome the home-run
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived through so many trying times,'' Billye Aaron
said. ``We fortunately didn't let it get us down. We're happy Henry
is finally getting the respect for his accomplishments. ... I'm
very thankful he's lived long enough to be recognized for some of
his accomplishments.''

 &HT;    Change comes easy for Blaylock
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mookie Blaylock has always been able to change for the
better _ in his personal life, in his ability to deal with people
in a public forum, in his offseason training regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a little older, you've got to change,'' Blaylock said
Wednesday. ``Let's face it _ I'm not a young guy anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the only Hawks player to precede coach Lenny Wilkens to
Atlanta _ by one year _ Blaylock turns 32 on March 20. His body
feels it, and his brain tells him he must deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   If anything makes Blaylock think young, it's his teammates _
more good ones, he says, than he has ever seen under one roof in a
Hawks uniform. They will allow him to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play a different game now with these guys,'' Blaylock
said, glancing at a dozen players shooting free throws. ``It's
probably the best team I've ever played with in the NBA, and that's
including the team we had with Dominique (Wilkins) and (Kevin)
Willis, Lenny's first year.''
</P>
<P>
   That team equaled the franchise record for victories, 57, but
went out in the second round of the playoffs. That's as far as
Lenny Wilkens' teams have gone in five years here _ three of them
winning a round, the others crashing in four games or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to question us until we get past that,''
Blaylock said. ``I can say we're a better team, and we might be a
better team, but we've got to win in the playoffs to make people
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Blaylock believes it and because old point guard Wilkens
has a profound impact on the way Blaylock approaches the game, this
aging dog plans to come back with new tricks this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done being a scorer. We don't need me to score (a lot)
anymore. With the talent we have on this team now, with LaPhonso
(Ellis) and Grant (Long) on our front line and with the young guys,
I can be a true point guard, play my usual defensive game,'' said
Blaylock, three-time defending steals champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then (I can) look for guys when we have the ball. I can
distribute the shots; I don't have to take 'em. And I can play hard
because I know I got a legitimate guy (Anthony Johnson) behind me
for the first time since I came here. ``
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the Hawks have come out of training camp thinking
run, run, run. Each year, they've allowed their offense to grind
down into a half-court game. The same thing happened last season
after they started 11-0.
</P>
<P>
   But the way they have worked in training camp this time, they
have reason to believe they won't revert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team likes to practice hard, and I believe it will want
to play hard,'' Blaylock said. ``It's a lot more fun when you're
getting up and down the floor, instead of standing around. A couple
years ago, (Steve Smith) and I were saying we played better when we
played (an up-tempo) Western Conference style _ heck, we beat all
the Western teams _ and we want to get back to that, because we've
got the depth to do it.''

 &HT;    Crowd control plagues Phoenix Open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For years the Phoenix Open has boasted of its giant
crowds, challenging other PGA Tour events to jam 125,000 people per
day through their turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a downside. Create an Animal House atmosphere, and
you can expect a few Blutos to slip through security.
</P>
<P>
   A scary one appeared Sunday at the TPC at Scottsdale. A
spectator identified as Brian K. Murphy of Phoenix, heckling Tiger
Woods, was wrestled to the ground after bragging that he also
carried a gun in his fanny pack. Woods, once robbed and mugged at
knifepoint in college, was unaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' he asked. ``I didn't know it was that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the Phoenix Open has revealed its
rowdiness. Beer sales were cut off this year at the par-3 16th,
where some 60,000 went wacko in 1997 after Woods' ace there. So
much booze filled the area that John Daly, the recovering
alcoholic, said he could smell it from the teebox.
</P>
<P>
   When you hear about things like that at a golf tournament, you
realize that BellSouth Classic officials might be wise in limiting
crowds to 45,000 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely some crazy people out there,'' Payne
Stewart said. ``And there is a black-and-white issue out there.
It's sad, but it's the way it is. As I understand it, Tiger has had
some death threats before, which is why he has so many security
guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the incident this week while preparing at Pebble
Beach, David Duval said, ``It wouldn't necessarily make me remove
(Phoenix) from my schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara cautioned against overreactions. ``I don't think
that there's any need to be overly concerned with the types of fans
that are coming to golf tournaments,'' O'Meara said. ``I still
think it's pretty (high) quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Feds not faked out
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents culminated a two-year investigation Monday by
arresting six golf-club distributors _ two in Atlanta, two in
Savannah and two in Houston _ and four manufacturers who were
illegally selling millions of dollars in counterfeit golf
equipment. Those arrested in Georgia were identified as Albert and
Angie Chung in Atlanta and Mike Cohen and Rob Isola in Savannah.
The PGA Merchandise Show, which concluded Monday in Orlando,
featured 1,401 companies and 603,000 square feet of exhibit space _
an increase of 10 percent over 1998. With industry profits down,
companies are pushing to spread their word. Taylor Made, for
example, brought 110 salespeople to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling a rock
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Open's other bizarre situation involved the
1,000-pound boulder Woods was allowed to have moved by about a
dozen men under the ``loose impediment'' rule. Nick Faldo joked
that he was putting his caddie, Fanny Sunneson, ``on a new steroids
program. ... I think that was stretching the loose impediment rule
a little bit.'' O'Meara said, ``You can't blame Tiger; you can't
blame the rules. You have to look at the (USGA) people who make the
rules.'' ... Tom Lehman, who is recovering from shoulder surgery
and should be playing in about a month, is also working on his
back. He signed a deal with the Select Comfort Corp., which makes
high-tech air beds. ... As things stand now with golf's
much-maligned Official World Golf Rankings, Faldo, No. 64, would
play No. 1 Woods in a first-round match in the $5 million Andersen
Consulting World Match play Feb. 22-28 at LaCosta.

 &HT;    Richardson claims top prize in Wal-Mart
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde and Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Joel Richardson failed to land a big bass early in the
morning during the final round of the Wal-Mart FLW Tour bass
tournament last weekend on Lake Okeechobee, Fla., and it took him
the rest of the day to get over it. But he did.
</P>
<P>
   The Kernersville, N.C., angler kept his mind on the task at hand
enough to win the $100,000 first prize, beating second-place Curt
Lytle of Suffolk, Va., by only 9 ounces. Richardson caught five
fish weighing 17 pounds, 12 ounces on the final day to win the
first of seven events on the 1999 tour.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who qualified for the Wal-Mart FLW Tour Championship
this summer as well as for the Ranger Millennium Tournament next
fall, qualified for the semifinal round of 10 with a weight of 30-8
the first two days, and for the final round of five with a 20-1 on
the third day.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's top finishers were Mickey Bruce of Buford, who was
15th with a two-day total of 28-1, and Mark Hardin of Canton, who
was 16th with a 27-9 total. Bruce won $5,000; Hardin took home
$4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart FLW Tour hosts its third tournament of the season
on Lake Lanier March 17-20. The second event will be Feb. 24-27 on
Lake Murray near Columbia, S.C.

   Scientists at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., have
concluded _ after research that must have been fun _ that having
sex can reduce one's risk of catching cold.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Effect of Sexual Behavior on Immune System
Function,'' which will be presented at a psychologists convention
in April, ``Individuals engaging in sexual activity once or twice a
week have substantially higher levels of the antibody
Immunoglobulin A than individuals reporting no sexual activity or
less than one occurrence a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the maximum benefit was reaped from
sex once or twice a week; levels of the antibody were lower in
people who went at it more often. Psychologist Francis Brennan also
said there was no link between the antibody and either ``length of
relationship or sexual satisfaction.''
</P>

JOHN SERVICE, PURGED `CHINA HAND,' DIES AT 89
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ohio, W.Va., Wis., Md., Ariz.)   (jw) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Service, the first of the ``old China hands'' purged from
the State Department in the McCarthy era, died Wednesday in
Oakland, Calif. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   As a young Foreign Service officer in World War II he filed
prescient reports on the rival forces battling the occupying
Japanese _ Chiang Kai-Shek's nationalists and Mao Tse-tung's
Communists, and observed the corruption and weakness of the former.
But after the war, as what became known as the China lobby swung
U.S. policy strongly behind the failing Chiang government _ the
Communists gained full control of the mainland in 1949, driving the
remaining nationalists to Taiwan _ much of the blame fell on what
was said at the time to be a pro-Soviet conspiracy in the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who lost China?'' became a major election slogan that shaped
U.S. political life for many years. It helped make the careers of
Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon and, according to some
historians, helped shape U.S. involvement in the Korean and Vietnam
wars.
</P>
<P>
   He once predicted wryly that although he never used his middle
name, only the initial, his obituary would identify him not only as
an official once accused of espionage, but as `'John Stewart
Service.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusers of those men spelled out their full names, and so
they went down in history: John Stewart Service, John Carter
Vincent, John Paton Davies, Oliver Edmund Clubb. All were forced
out of the Foreign Service. All were eventually vindicated but
neither they nor, some thought, the Foreign Service itself, ever
fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Their ordeal actually began during World War II in the efforts
of a U.S. mission led by Gen. Joseph ``Vinegar Joe'' Stilwell to
expand the Chinese war effort against Japan. The China experts
traveling through the areas controlled by various warlords reported
that Chiang's Nationalist party, the Kuomintang, was dragging its
feet, reserving its U.S.-supplied arms for an eventual showdown
with the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The old China hands predicted that in such a fight, the
Communists would win. They called instead for American pressure on
Chiang to reform his government and direct his forces against the
Japanese, in cooperation with the Communists and under American
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selfish and corrupt, incapable and obstructive,'' were a few
of the words Service used to describe the Chiang government in a
1944 memo to Stilwell that urged that the United States insist the
general be appointed to lead all the Chinese forces.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his generation of China hands, Service was born in
China of missionary parents. His had founded a YMCA branch in
Chengdu, where he was born on Aug. 8, 1909.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Sichuan province, attended high school in Shanghai
and studied art history at Oberlin College in Ohio, where he also
was captain of the track team. Returning to China in 1932, he
married an Oberlin classmate, Caroline Schulz, the daughter of an
Army officer. After a brief stint in a bank, Service joined the
Foreign Service, and when the Japanese entered Beijing, he escorted
American refugees through the lines to safety.
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned to the new Nationalist capital at Chongqing as a
political officer in 1941. His job was to gather information from
all factions and parties, including the Communists. As political
officers do today, he gave briefings to visiting American
journalists, including Theodore White and Eric Sevareid. Those
activities were later cast in a controversial light.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong amateur runner, Service hiked around China with a
sleeping bag, eating as well as he could off the land. E.J. Khan
Jr. in his book ``The China Hands,'' quotes a State Department
colleague as saying: ``Jack had uncanny instincts. He could walk
along a Chinese street and by the kind of matches sold or the
clothing worn or the food being cooked could analyze the structure
of the local society.''
</P>
<P>
   As the war progressed, Service warned that a civil war was
widely regarded as inevitable, under conditions that would lead to
an undemocratic, probably pro-Soviet Communist government.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1944, assigned as a State Department adviser to
Stilwell, he finally managed to get to Mao's headquarters in Yanan.
He wrote that he felt he had ``come into a different country,'' one
marked by hard work, cooperation and ``the absence of banditry.''
</P>
<P>
   Recording his first impressions, he wrote: ``There is an absence
of show and formality, both in speech and action. Relations of the
officials and people toward us, and of the Chinese themselves, are
open, direct and friendly. Mao Tse-tung and other leaders are
universally spoken of with respect (amounting in the case of Mao to
a kind of veneration).''

</P>
<P>
   This was in sharp contrast to the ``crisis'' of the Chiang
government he described in an crucial memo to Stilwell that Oct.
11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent defeats have exposed exposed its military
ineffectiveness and will hasten the approaching economic
disaster,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But the memo was reportedly leaked to the Nationalist
government. The powerful China lobby back home was furious, and
both Stilwell and Service were recalled to Washington. President
Franklin Roosevelt replaced Stilwell as his personal envoy with
Gen. Patrick Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   Service got back to China as an army adviser, visiting both
sides, but was soon in trouble again. He drafted a letter, signed
by the rest of the diplomatic staff in the Nationalist capital,
Chongqing, urging that the United States provide aid to the
Communists in order to reduce casualties in an expected Allied
invasion from the sea. Hurley charged betrayal and got him
recalled, this time for good.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for reassignment in Washington in April 1945, Service
received a phone call from Mark Gayn a freelance journalist who was
at the time working for Amerasia, a tiny left-wing magazine with
strong views on China, Chiang and Mao similar to Service's own.
</P>
<P>
   Service met several times with Gayn and Amerasia's
editor-publisher, Philip Jaffe, and lent them copies of some of his
reports, a few of which he himself had classified as secret. He
later agreed with his accusers that this was an indiscretion, but
contended that it was common procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Amerasia was under surveillance by the FBI, and agents had
repeatedly entered its offices and several apartments, and had
taken or photographed documents, including those provided by
Service.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury looking into the question of whether documents had
been illegally obtained voted unanimously against indicting
Service. Others were indicted, and as the result of a plea bargain
some were fined and one case was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the case endured, however. The Chinese Communists
treated it as proof of American hostility. To American supporters
of Chiang it was proof of an anti-Nationalist conspiracy in the
State Department. And in the ensuing years, the right would charge
that there was a cover up in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a book, based on recently released FBI files suggested
there had indeed been a fix in the case, but not the kind the right
had charged. In ``The Amerasia Spy Case'' (University of North
Carolina Press) Harvey Klehr and Ronald Radosh wrote that Thomas
(Tommy the Cork) Corcoran, the prominent former New Dealer turned
Washington fixer, had a hand in the case, lobbying the Justice
Department to go easy on Service.
</P>
<P>
   One of Corcoran's clients was Chiang's government, and he feared
that if Service went on trial, like-minded State Department
advisers and, above all, Stilwell _ who was under a presidential
gag order _ would testify about corruption and other failures of
the Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Cleared by a State Department loyalty board _ by his count he
would eventually pass nine such inquiries _ Service was to go to
Gen. Douglas MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo. But as the cold war
sharpened and the Chiang government disintegrated, the search for
culprits intensified. Other espionage cases, the Alger Hiss affair,
the Soviet explosion of an atom bomb and the Korean war made the
dispute even more bitter.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Feb. 9, 1950, McCarthy held up a sheaf of paper
during a speech in Wheeling, W.Va., and declared, ``I have here in
my hands a list of 205, known to the secretary of state as being
members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still
working and shaping the policy of the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed in Congress, McCarthy, R-Wis., eventually produced 14
names, among them that of Service, who he charged was a ``a known
associate and collaborator with Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   He was cleared by a Senate committee, which declared that he
should not be penalized ``by destroying his career and branding him
as disloyal for writing what appears to have been the true facts as
he saw them.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 13, 1951, a Loyalty Review Board named by President
Truman ruled there was ``reasonable doubt as to his loyalty.''
Secretary of State Dean Acheson dismissed him the same day.
</P>
<P>
   He fought the ruling, and in 1956 the Supreme Court ruled 8-0
that the presidential board had no right to review the State
Department's findings and that Acheson had no right to dismiss him.
To the surprise of many, he rejoined the State Department and
retired from an obscure post in the Liverpool consulate in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   At 53, Service enrolled in the University of California at
Berkeley, received a master's degree and became library curator of
its Center for Chinese Studies. With the thaw in Chinese-U.S.
relations in the early 1970s, he was able to revisit China several
times.
</P>
<P>
   He published several books on China, including a volume of his
wartime dispatches, ``Last Chance in China'' (Random House, 1974.).
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three children, Victoria McCormick of Chevy
Chase, Md., Robert of Washington and Philip of Flagstaff, Ariz.;
seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., have
concluded _ after research that must have been fun _ that having
sex can reduce one's risk of catching cold.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Effect of Sexual Behavior on Immune System
Function,'' which will be presented at a psychologists convention
in April, ``Individuals engaging in sexual activity once or twice a
week have substantially higher levels of the antibody
Immunoglobulin A than individuals reporting no sexual activity or
less than one occurrence a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the maximum benefit was reaped from
sex once or twice a week; levels of the antibody were lower in
people who went at it more often. Psychologist Francis Brennan also
said there was no link between the antibody and either ``length of
relationship or sexual satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The man's got amazing powers of recovery.  &UR; Alice Barnes &LR; 
forwards a Denver Post review of  &UR; Mick Jagger &LR; 's performance on
Tuesday night, describing him as ``at the top of his game'' as he
``pranced, danced and strutted. ... Jagger showed no sign of being
slowed by his recent bout with the flu, which forced the
cancellation of two shows in San Jose.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; OF RHYME AND REASON AND POETIC LICENSE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gordon Burns &LR; , a student of modern events and of poetry,
forwards a poem by the British wit  &UR; Hilaire Belloc &LR; , ``Franklin
Hyde Who Caroused in the Dirt and Was Corrected By His Uncle.'' If
you're wondering what this has to do with anything, substitute
``Henry'' for ``Franklin,'' as we have done in this quoted verse:
</P>
<P>
   ``From  &UR; Henry Hyde &LR; 's adventure, learn /To pass your Leisure
Time/ In Cleanly Merriment, and turn/ From Mud and Ooze and Slime/
And every form of Nastiness ...''
</P>
<P>
   _ Opening boxes of donations in preparation for this month's
silent auction at the Friends' Library Store,  &UR; Rod Lowe  &LR; came upon
two books nestled together as their authors largely weren't: ``The
Earth-Owl and Other Moon People'' by  &UR; Ted Hughes  &LR; and ``Ariel'' by
 &UR; Sylvia Plath. &LR;  The volumes will be sold together.
</P>
<P>
   _ And keeping in mind  &UR; Tom Wolfe &LR; 's ``thing with the cup,''
 &UR; Kerry McDermott &LR;  quotes the mystic Persian poet  &UR; Rumi &LR; : ``Agnostic
says little but inside he is full of mysteries, and crowded with
voices. Whoever is served that cup keeps quiet.''
</P>

<P>
   _ Dr.  &UR; Fay Boozman &LR; , an ophthalmologist, has been appointed
director of the Arkansas State Department of Health. Boozman, an
anti-abortion activist who lost in a bid for the Senate last fall,
said during the campaign that women don't become pregnant as a
result of rape because fear releases a hormone that prevents
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   _ A string of pearls that  &UR; Marilyn Monroe &LR;  received from
 &UR; Emperor &LR; 
 &UR; Hirohito &LR;  when she was honeymooning with  &UR; Joe DiMaggio  &LR; in Japan
wound up in the possession of  &UR; Susan Strasberg &LR; , who died recently
at 60. The link between Monroe and Strasberg was the Actor's
Studio, which was run by Strasberg's parents and was where Monroe
studied.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before her death, Strasberg had sold the necklace back
to Mikimoto, the pearl company that (along with the oysters) had
made it. A check from that company for $110,000 was supposed to be
handed over to Strasberg on the day she died, January 21. It went
to her lawyer instead, says New York magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _ The New York Post says that  &UR; Katie Couric  &LR; is worried about
glowing reviews and high ratings for  &UR; Diane Sawyer  &LR; on ``Good
Morning America,'' especially since some praise for Sawyer has been
at the expense of ``Today.'' ``They've become awfully
self-congratulatory over there,'' the Washington Post's  &UR; Tom &LR; 
 &UR; Shales &LR;  wrote of the ``Today'' crew, ``and every day they seem to
be celebrating their success rather than doing a show.''
</P>
<P>
   During a chat on Monday's show with TV's Judge  &UR; Judy &LR; 
 &UR; Sheindlin &LR; , who has a new self-help book out, Couric admitted that
low self-esteem resulted in her tendency to try to seem nice by
suppressing aggressive aspects of her personality.

   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;

week's meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, that ``Jurassic Park'' had made scientists look bad.

 WASHINGTON: on Congress.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On one side in the fight are the formidable lobbying forces of
AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc., two of the most powerful players
in Washington. The companies have an impressive roster of lobbyists
and lawyers who once worked in the federal government and
Congress.They include Cicconi, a former top White House official in
Reagan and Bush administrations and now the general counsel of
AT&AMP;T; Philip L. Verveer, a leading telecommunications lawyer and
close friend of Bill Clinton since their days together at
Georgetown University, whose wife is the chief of staff to Hillary
Rodham Clinton; and Kevin Joseph, who recently stepped down as
senior counsel to Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, the ranking Democrat on
the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition on the other side is being led by Greg Simon, the
former domestic policy adviser to Vice President Gore, and Richard
Bond, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing what Microsoft is accused of doing - building a
system where they say you can't separate the transmission from the
actual content,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the
Washington office of Consumers Union, referring to the government's
antitrust suit filed against the software company. ``They're saying
if you want AOL, we'll let you have it but you have to pay At Home
first. This is precisely what telephone companies can't do. The
request from our side is, Let's open up access to cable wire the
same way we require them to open up for programming.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Federal Communications Commission has
declined to step into the fight but has said it will watch the
situation closely. Officials there say they do not want to do
anything that might impede the progress of upgrading the cable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But cable regulators in a growing number of cities, including
San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, have held hearings and
vowed to consider the issue as franchise licenses are renewed this
year. And one city, Portland, Ore., has blocked AT&AMP;T's cable
venture from moving in without first opening its proposed new
broadband pipeline to rival gateways like America Online. The move
by the city's cable regulators recently prompted the telephone
company to file a lawsuit in federal court there.

   GM SALES WEAKER THAN THOSE OF RIVALS
</P>
<P>
   As many of its competitors reported double-digit sales
increases, General Motors said its sales rose a scant 4 percent in
January compared with exceptionally weak sales in the month a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   GM's car sales rose 11.4 percent, largely on gains from its
newer midsized cars. However, the auto maker's truck sales dropped
3.7 percent. GM continues to be plagued by inventory shortages,
particularly of its new full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC
Sierra pickup trucks, in the aftermath of last summer's two-month
strike, which shut down almost all of its North American assembly
plants.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM URGED FOR MEXICAN UTILITIES
</P>
<P>
   Warning his compatriots that Mexico's energy needs are fast
overwhelming its state-run power plants, President Ernesto Zedillo
urged the nation's Congress to approve an extensive reorganization
of the country's electric power industry, opening it to private
investment. Zedillo proposed two constitutional reforms that would
reverse Mexico's 1960 nationalization of the industry and allow
private companies to invest in the leasing and construction of
power plants and regional transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T PRESSED TO OPEN ITS SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   As AT&AMP;T aggressively enters the cable business, with plans to
offer high-speed Internet connections, a growing group of rivals
and consumer groups has begun a nationwide lobbying effort to force
the telephone giant to open its system to Internet competitors.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOLOGY SHARES LIFT MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Paced by renewed vigor in technology companies, stock prices
marched higher as Federal Reserve policy-makers left interest rates
unchanged. The Dow industrials rose 92.69 points, or 1 percent, to
9,366.81. Nasdaq rose even more, 29.99 points, or 1.22 percent, to
2,493.41, while the S&AMP;P 500 edged up 10.08 points, or eight-tenths
of 1 percent, to 1,272.07.

   GOLDMAN PREPARES OFFERING IN CHINA
</P>

   Because China has lost much of its luster for investors, rivals
of Goldman, Sachs are watching with keen interest _ and no little
relish _ as the investment firm prepares to sell shares in a
Chinese power company.
</P>
<P>
   TIRE DEAL PART OF ACQUISITION SPREE
</P>
<P>
   Few in Japan expect Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.'s deal for
control of most operations of Sumitomo Rubber Industries to herald
a new flood of foreign takeovers, but the agreement comes as Japan
undergoes a surge of mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   TIME WARNER BEATS ESTIMATES
</P>
<P>
   Financial improvements in the publishing, cable network,
entertainment and music divisions of Time Warner helped the media
giant report a less-than-expected loss of 17 cents a share in the
fourth quarter. Wall Street had forecast a loss of 19 cents a
share. The company's stock rose $2.8125, to $64.0625 a share.
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTIVE CHANGES AT TBWA
</P>
<P>
   TBWA/Chiat/Day named a new top administrator and a new creative
director for its New York office. The moves are aimed at halting
the culture clashes between executives since the merger of the New
York operations of TBWA Advertising with Chiat/Day in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET'S SCATTERSHOT APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's proposed budget sprinkles new spending
across a huge array of programs, hardly missing a constituency or
congressional district. Rather than concentrating the scarce money
and doing a few things well, the administration has chosen instead
to do dozens of things on a small scale.

FORT WORTH SHERIFF KEEPS PROFILE SO LOW HE'S INVISIBLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ On Monday, Tarrant County Sheriff David
Williams was not taking calls.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he on Tuesday, Wednesday or any of the other days of the
week. His receptionist said he had ``stepped out.'' His parking
space behind the county's Criminal Justice Center sat empty and the
sheriff was not to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being cause for alarm, however, Williams' absence is
taken in stride by officials in Fort Worth and Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   None of them have had more than a moment's contact with the
sheriff in more than six months and none expect much more in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't imagine I'll be hearing from him,'' said Fort Worth
Police Chief Thomas Windham. The chief, who was unable to reach the
sheriff to discuss jail booking procedures in November, finally
resorted to making a plea on television for Williams to call him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard from him yet,'' Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does anyone seem to have a clear answer to the question of
why the sheriff of the state's fourth-largest county would become
one of Texas' most elusive public officials.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past year Williams, a 45-year-old born-again
Christian and second-term Republican sheriff, has retreated from
contact with most of the public, other elected officials and the
news media. He has become so regularly absent from the courthouse
that brief sightings of him are cause for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' reclusion and reluctance to return phone calls,
however, are only the latest in a string of irregularities in his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1992 Williams has:
</P>
<P>
   _ Attempted to buy an entire fleet of Chevrolet Tahoes, sport
utility vehicles that sell for $29,000 each, while two new trucks,
an automobile and five patrol cars gathered dust in a county
garage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Designed a logo for his patrol cars that omitted the words
``Tarrant County.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Approved a countywide raid of topless bars and adult
bookstores, all of which proved to have valid permits and a number
of whose owners have since sued the county.
</P>
<P>
   _ Filed a $65 million budget, increasing his predecessor's
budget by $33 million and sparking a standoff with county
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   _ Demanded ``sovereignty'' from commissioners' authority under
the 1836 law of the Republic of Texas and claimed common law powers
as the political descendant of the old English ``shire reeve.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first, however, Williams was an uncommon sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   He had never been a political figure. Instead, he had been a
small-town policeman in his native Oklahoma, a drug-enforcement
officer in a suburb of Fort Worth and a worker in the mail room at
evangelist Kenneth Copeland's ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, however, the sheriff at the time was indicted in
connection with several alleged misdeeds. Ed Max, a self-made
millionaire who owns a string of auto parts stores in North Texas
and whose father had been a U.S. marshal, decided to back a reform
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   That candidate turned out to be Williams, whose earnest demeanor
appealed to Max. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I sank a lot of money into it and I made him sheriff,'' Max
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Max put $44,000 into Williams' campaign. Rumors abound
that Max paid for Williams' car and living expenses while the
then-unemployed Williams campaigned. Max's only comment: ``What I
give somebody is my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams attended a two-day school for candidates that was run
by the Texas Christian Coalition and ran on a platform promising
not to hire homosexual deputies and to oppose abortion, though his
office has little to do with the latter.
</P>
<P>
   And, during the campaign, he was a reluctant speaker at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a painfully shy man and every time he made a mistake,
they beat him up over it,'' said Max. ``He just got to where he
didn't want to make an appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Max's money and support from Copeland and the
Christian right, Williams was elected. He made Max his confidant
and gave him a sheriff's badge, a commission as a reserve deputy, a
portable sheriff's radio, shotgun and bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   He also stepped into his new position with some obvious ideas
for change. One of his first acts was to revise the logo for the
patrol cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have spent 50 or 60 hours working on that himself,''
Max said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the revision failed to include the words
``Tarrant County,'' and was ultimately rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Though previous sheriffs had dressed in business suits, and wore
uniforms only for specific functions, Williams preferred a uniform
and he came up with a new design for his own. It included an
additional number of gold stars.
</P>
<P>
   He sought little advice. His round-table included a small circle
of sheriff's officers, contacts in the Christian Coalition and
County Commissioner J.D. Johnson, the court liaison to the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' penchant for privacy included dealings with his
subordinates. It manifested itself in a reluctance to make eye
contact with ranking officers in the department and a habit of
entering his offices through the back door to avoid seeing anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Former sheriff's Capt. Pat Howell said he mentioned to Max that
Williams' refusal to speak with his administrators was causing low
morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just looked at me and I knew I'd made a mistake,'' Howell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams then began entering the building through a back
stairwell. Next, he had an elevator programmed so it could be set
to go from the ground floor to his office without stopping on other
floors.
</P>
<P>
   His administrative meetings began with a lengthy prayer, then,
inexplicably, the sheriff would often show old war movies, several
of them featuring scenes of cavalry skirmishes in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't sure what the purpose was,'' Howell said.
</P>
<P>
   He brought in various speakers, including Craig Roberts, author
of a number of books on Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories
and on police snipers, again without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of interesting, but we couldn't figure out what it
had to do with the sheriff's office in Tarrant County,'' said a
former deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there were the sheriff's helicopters. Williams secured two
military-surplus Bell Ranger helicopters for his drug task force,
making the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department the only such office
in the state with aerial capability.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, one of those aircraft crashed at an airstrip on
the Kenneth Copeland Ministry grounds, killing two deputies and
adding fuel to already spreading rumors that the aircraft were
being used to film commercials for Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not arrive at the scene of the crash for more than
four hours, then didn't explain his delay, prompting even more bad
feelings within the department.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there were Williams' ties to the Christian right and his
belief in conversion. Former deputies cite an instance in which he
brought 600 lay ministers into the jail to proselytize to
prisoners, causing massive security problems. He created a special
office for jail chaplain, with its own budget, further angering
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   When he felt beleaguered by commissioners, Williams sent letters
to area churches, beginning with the greeting, ``True Believers,''
and summoning them to rally behind him.
</P>
<P>
   He created a Christian education unit, nicknamed the ``God
Pod,'' an area of the jail reserved for prisoners who have joined a
Christian group. That prompted a lawsuit by two non-Christian
prisoners. An appeals court recently ruled the case should go to
trial. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; At the same time, Williams' disagreements with county
commissioners were roiling. His $65 million budget proposal was cut
to $52 million and Williams responded by suing the commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Williams cut staffing at the jail, blaming his smaller budget
and creating long delays at the booking desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began keeping a log of the hours officers spent sitting
around, waiting to book in a prisoner,'' said Fort Worth Police
Chief Windham. ``One weekend it would be 33 hours. The next it was
55 hours, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Windham finally made his televised plea in November, asking that
Williams discuss the delays with him, but he got no response.
</P>
<P>
   And, as his relations with other departments deteriorated,
Williams began to withdraw. He was often absent from his main
office and said to be at a satellite jail office, behind locked
doors.
</P>
<P>
   He began skipping scheduled appointments at commissioners'
meetings. He stopped speaking with Commissioner Johnson, a former
supporter. He stopped holding administrative meetings and he
finally stopped speaking to Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard from him since July,'' Max said. ``He was at
my mother's funeral then and offered condolences. Other than that,
nothing. He doesn't return my calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, it seems does he return any others. Williams has repeatedly
refused to speak to Johnson and other commissioners as well as
representatives from the district attorney's office or a number of
his deputies.
</P>
<P>
   In kind, he did not answer requests for an interview from the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it appears that Williams could well be sheriff again
after the 2000 election, even though he is already drawing
opponents. But Williams has name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name is in the news constantly, and he doesn't even have
to speak to anyone to get it there,'' Max said. ``It will take a
lot of money to beat him, and I don't know if anyone is willing to
spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, on the other hand, won't have Max's money behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who I'm going to support next time, if anybody,''
said the parts dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can tell you one thing. It won't be David Williams.''
</P>

GREEK ORTHODOX BISHOPS SEEK OUSTER OF ARCHBISHOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The five presiding American bishops of the Greek Orthodox church
of America are calling for the ouster of Archbishop Spyridon, its
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a level of public discord virtually unheard of in
religious denominations, the five clerics who head local dioceses
across the United States accuse Spyridon of plunging the Greek
Orthodox Church, which has 1.5 million members, into a crisis that
threatens to tear it apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Archdiocese is presently suffocating in an atmosphere of
fear, suspicion, insecurity, lack of trust and vindictiveness,''
states a report by the bishops submitted last month to Ecumenical
Patriarch Bartholomew, who appointed Spyridon in 1996 and is the
spiritual leader of the world's 300 million Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the clergy and laity have lost their trust in
their ecclesiastical leadership, which during the last two and a
half years has not been able to create and promote new visions and
new dreams for the future,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Mark Arey, a spokesman for Spyridon, said the
archdiocese did not have an official response to the report but
added that the issues raised by the prelates were being addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That report is no longer relevant,'' Arey said. ``The
archbishop and the metropolitans may not agree on everything but
they have agreed to work together, and that's what they're doing
even as we speak.'' In the Greek Orthodox Church bishops are
referred to as metropolitans.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in a showdown at the Phanar, the compound in Istanbul
that is home to Bartholomew, the patriarch rebuffed the five
bishops' repeated calls for Spyridon's removal. Bartholomew,
according to reports in the Greek press, expressed his confidence
in his embattled Spyridon.
</P>
<P>
   The report was first published in The National Herald, a Greek
language newspaper in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the day Spyridon arrived in New York to assume his
post, he has been consumed by the allegations of many in his flock
who say he he is an autocrat who does not work well with the clergy
or lay people in this country. The Greek Orthodox Church in the
United States is historically more independent-minded and
democratic than the mother church.
</P>
<P>
   His crtics say Spyridon, who was born in Ohio but spent more
than five decades in Europe, is out of touch with the American
church. Spyridon's conservative views about hierarchical authority,
for instance, are typical of many Orthodox churhes abroad, but have
led to clashes with Greek Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop's defenders say his detractors represent a small
number of disgruntled clergy and laity who are upset about having
lost power and influence after Spyridon arrived. Opposition to the
archbishop has continued to pick up momentum with at least one
major lay group calling for the creation of a separate Greek
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Chicago, and Astoria, N.Y., a Greek enclave, bumper
stickers have started to appear with the Greek word ``Anaxios,''
which means unworthy. In Greek liturgical tradition, when a priest
is ordained it's customary for people in the pews to shout
``Axios,'' which means worthy.
</P>
<P>
   The report to Bartholomew also reveals that the five presiding
bishops disagreed with Spyridon's 1997 decision to fire the
president and three professors at the church's flagship
institution, Hellenic College and Holy Cross School of Theology in
Brookline, Mass. _ a move that launched the firestorm engulfing the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general state of affairs and the atmosphere in the
archdiocese have created such a spirit of unbearableness and
disillusionment that especially our young people no longer feel
proud of their faith, the church and the archdiocese,'' the report
states.

 &HT;    Dogs close fast to join elite
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's football recruiting closed with a flurry
Wednesday, as the Bulldogs landed two of the nation's top
wide-receiver prospects on college football's National Signing Day.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, which defeated Georgia en route to a 10-2 record
last season, signed a group of 26 players, which ranks among the
nation's top 20 classes, according to at least one recruiting
service.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's recruiting class, which was ranked second in the
nation behind Texas according to the Prep Football Report, was
strengthened Wednesday by the addition of wide receivers Reggie
Brown of Carrollton, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution state player
of the year, and Durrell Robinson of Duncan, S.C. The pair capped
off Donnan's class of 25 players, which added highly regarded
running back Bruce Thornton of LaGrange and offensive lineman Kevin
Breedlove of Clemson, S.C., on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia was one of the fastest-closing classes in the
country,'' recruiting analyst Allen Wallace of California-based
SuperPrep Magazine said. ``I thought they'd get Brown, but I didn't
think they'd get Robinson and Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a Parade Magazine All-American, was one of the nation's
most coveted players, despite missing four games of his senior
season with a broken leg. Brown still finished with 62 catches for
1,146 yards and 11 touchdowns last year, leading Carrollton to the
Class AA state title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty close,'' Brown said. ``I just made my decision
(on Tuesday). I had it down to two teams _ Georgia and Ohio State.
It was just about my family being able to see me play.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace ranked Georgia Tech's class 16th nationally and second
in the ACC, behind FSU. The Yellow Jackets' class is highlighted by
defensive back Cory Collins of Egg Harbor Township, N.J.,
linebacker Recardo Wembush of Blakely, wideout Anthony Lawston of
Baltimore and running back William Glover of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Tech coach George O'Leary's group featured 12 defensive players
and recruits from seven states other than Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filled our needs with our first 16 verbal commitments,
which allowed us to go out and recruit the best available
athletes,'' O'Leary said. ``We haven't been able to do that before.

 &HT;    Butler signs for Middle Georgia
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three-inch heels, a black miniskirt, earrings and a
white satin blouse aren't typical attire for an athlete signing a
college football scholarship. Then again, Riverdale High's Tonya
Butler isn't your typical signee.
</P>
<P>
   The female placekicker was one of six Riverdale players to sign
a national letter of intent Wednesday morning. Butler, headed to
Middle Georgia Junior College, is the first female to earn a
football scholarship at a state college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered if this day would ever come for me,'' Butler
said. ``I'm just so thankful that Middle Georgia gave me this
opportunity. And it was so surprising to have so many people here
to see all of us sign.''
</P>
<P>
   A large crowd at the Riverdale Media Center applauded as she
began to write her name on the official papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonya has become a celebrity,'' said Jane Bain, who teaches
English at Riverdale. ``She has broken down a lot of barriers for
girls. She is an inspiration to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's parents, Chris and Polly Butler, and her younger
sister, Haley, watched proudly and posed for photographs with their
famous family member after the ceremony. Older brother Tony, a
rising junior linebacker at Georgia Southern, had college classes
and could not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing for Sissie,'' said Haley, 6. ``Tonya
can score points next year. It's a good thing.'' Other than Butler,
no one was more emotional about the day than technology teacher
Steve Price. As football coach at Pointe South Middle School
several years ago, he encouraged Butler _ then a team manager _ to
try kicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Tonya was the real thing the first time we put her in a
game,'' Price said. ``It was to kick an extra point. Three players
from the other team drilled Tonya in an attempt to show her this
was a male-only sport. We thought Tonya was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came off the field, she was mad as a hornet. Tonya
said the referee had said she could kick again. But a
(roughing-the-kicker penalty) had been called, and we had decided
instead to go for the two-point conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   At Riverdale, Butler was a three-year starter on the varsity.
This season, when the Raiders were 13-1 and appeared in the Class
AAA semifinals at the Georgia Dome, she converted 64 of 65
point-after attempts and seven of 12 field goals, with a long of 39
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-6, 125-pound Butler became so skilled that coaches
and teammates played down the gender difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought of Tonya as nothing else but an outstanding
kicker,'' Riverdale football coach George Spencer said. ``I was
excited to see her sign _ not because she's a girl, but because she
is another one of our players that has the chance to play in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Said quarterback Andreco Hines: ``Tonya is the Ms. Michael
Jordan of college kickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle Georgia expected to sign 30 players for this year's
recruiting class by late Wednesday, but no other signee in the
program's history has generated as much interest as Butler. She
will be honored today as The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Female
Athlete of the Year, as part of National Women in Sports Day. The
Cochran school has been in the national spotlight since Jan. 20,
when Butler committed in hopes of eventually moving on to a major
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 12 kids that I coached and recruited that are now in
the NFL, and none of them ever received as much attention coming
out of high school as Tonya is getting,'' Middle Georgia coach
Randy Pippin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go anywhere without being asked about Tonya,'' Pippin
said. ``I got a call earlier this week from a lady in California
who had read articles about Tonya in the paper out there. This
lady's goal in life is to be a college football coach. She wanted
my advice on how to do it. I told the lady to work hard and, as a
result, good things will happen. It worked for Tonya.

 &HT;    Rich returning talent means wait for signees
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Georgia Southern coach Paul Johnson, the most best
aspect of Wednesday's signings of future Eagles was that the 14
high school seniors signed for a future probably two or three years
away.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has won 24 games in the last two years, returns 13
starters and almost as many other veterans from the team that
advanced to the I-AA national championship game. As a result,
Georgia Southern does not have to look to 18-year-old freshmen for
immediate help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group we signed came highly recommended, and we're excited
about it,'' Johnson said. ``But we won't be able to tell a lot
about it until a couple of years from now. I think we've got a
pretty good group here already.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the returning players who went 14-1, the Eagles
will have 11 players for 1999 who redshirted last season.
</P>
<P>
   Among the group signing letters of intent with Georgia Southern
were eight linemen, including North Cobb High standout Freddy
Pesqueira (6 feet 2, 240); Brian Young (6-2, 265) of Washington
County High; Colby Brown (6-4, 230) of Jesup; Travis Hames, a 6-4,
320-pounder from Madison, Fla.; and Taylor Wheelis (6-0, 245) from
Pelham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't signed very many linemen the past two years, so we
went a little heavy that way,'' Johnson said. ``Some of those guys
played both ways (in high school).''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern's most glaring weakness in 1998 was at
linebacker. The Eagles had so many injuries that freshman Michael
Youngblood of Waynesboro was forced to pass on a redshirt year. The
top linebacker prospect among Wednesday's signees was Parkview High
star Justin Godsey (6-1, 218).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all of those (linebackers from last year's team)
back. Right now, I don't know whether that's good or bad,'' Johnson
said, laughing. ``But it's going to help to get Daryl Morrell back.
He's a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrell, a 5-9, 185-pound sophomore who broke into the starting
lineup as a freshman in '97, sat out most of last season with a
neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   Because starter Greg Hill will be a senior next season, Johnson
expects to a sign another quarterback in addition to Teddie
Cummings (6-0, 180) of Lake Butler, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   None of his signees were fullbacks, however. Georgia Southern
has upcoming sophomore All-American Adrian Peterson, who rushed for
2,606 yards and 34 touchdowns and set or tied nine I-AA national
records. Former Chattahoochee High star Mike Ballisty (6-2, 212),
redshirted last season, is expected to compete for the backup spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed one kid (5-11, 185-pound Phillip Mouzou of
Clearwater, Fla.) who could probably play there if he had to,''
Johnson said.

 &HT;    O'Leary: `Our best class'
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech coaches, saying they have their best
football signing class in a decade or more, got what they wanted
and filled the holes they needed to fill.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, coach George O'Leary was able to get the
players he wanted early and then have the luxury of signing the
best available athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 Yellow Jacket signees are two quarterbacks, four running
backs, three wide receivers, three offensive linemen, four
defensive linemen, three linebackers, five defensive backs and two
placekickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletically and academically, it's a top-10 class,'' O'Leary
said. ``Basically, our goal was to help out the defensive side of
the ball. I think we helped the defense, and we helped our kicking
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also recruited well on the offensive line to replace the
offensive linemen that will be graduating after next season,'' he
said. ``We've now got five quarterbacks on scholarship, and we
signed some great running backs. You can never have enough running
backs. The only area maybe we would have liked more help was at
tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I took over, this is the most quality players we've
signed,'' O'Leary said. ``Judging by the people we were recruiting
against, this is definitely our best class. It's also the most
we've signed from the state of Georgia in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of the top prospects are wide receiver Anthony Lawston of
Baltimore, linebacker Ricardo Wimbush of Blakely, defensive back
Cory Collins of Egg Harbor, N.J., and wide receiver/running back
William Glover of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a half-step behind them are defensive lineman Greg Gathers
of Reserve, La., quarterback Brian Camp of Dulbin, Ohio, and
offensive lineman Raymond Blake of Hinesville.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jermaine Hatch of Baton Rouge, La., might be the
sleeper of the group. Hatch, a 6-foot-2, 200-pounder, injured his
knee during his junior year, and many of the schools that were
recruiting him backed away. He turned down Miami, Arkansas and LSU
to go to Tech, and Tech coaches compare him to senior tailback
Charles Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 26 signees, 14 came from Georgia, four from Florida, two
each from Louisiana and South Carolina and one each from Maryland,
New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Strong finish for Bulldogs
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ While Georgia's 1999 recruiting effort may have
started slowly, it finished fast in what has become a typical
scenario under third-year coach Jim Donnan.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan went into the recruiting season with the express purpose
of finding some wide receivers to become quarterback Quincy
Carter's targets next season. He hit the bull's-eye in the form of
four top-notch pass catchers, including two consensus All-Americans
in Reggie Brown of Carrollton and Durell Robinson of Duncan, S.C.
Georgia also signed wideouts Michael Johnson of Tulsa, Okla., and
Damien Gary of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Brown nor Robinson made their decisions public until
Wednesday, the first day of the national signing period. The
last-day suspense has become a hallmark of Donnan's recruiting
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens when you're recruiting guys who are making
a lot of national visits,'' Donnan said late Wednesday afternoon.
``When your going after that caliber of players, you don't get as
many early commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Kannapolis, N.C., running back Nick Maddox was the coaching
staff's only question heading into signing day as they had not
heard from him since his apparent verbal commitment to Georgia last
week. Maddox, considered the No. 1 tailback in the South, signed
with Florida State on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox was one of two high-profile, big-time tailbacks that the
Bulldogs vigorously pursued, and both had the Bulldogs as one of
their final two choices. Cedric Cobbs of Little Rock, Ark., signed
with Arkansas on Wednesday. Still, Donnan insists even that need
went fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed DeJuan Green, who's the fastest guy in Florida. We
feel like he's got that home-run ability that not many do,'' Donnan
said. ``And Bruce Thornton was the highest priority (running back)
for us in the state. He has the ability to make big plays. We think
these guys give us instant help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are expecting to get more help at running back in
the form of Kenny Bailey, a cousin of the three Bailey brothers who
have played for Bulldogs _ Ronald, Champ and Boss. But Georgia had
not received the signed paperwork on Bailey, a non-qualifier from
the 1998 class who has spent the last year at Hargrave Military
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs also addressed their needs on the offensive line,
in the defensive backfield, at tight end and on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Georgia signed 25 prospects to letters-of-intent on
Wednesday and that number could climb to 26 or 27. The Bulldogs
also will add three players from their 1998 signing class who are
already enrolled in school _ Terrence Edwards, Jamie Henderson and
Regan Torbert. How they will get them all on scholarship remains
unclear. The Bulldogs currently have 47 returning lettermen on the
roster and can carry a total of only 82 scholarships next season
because of NCAA sanctions for rules violations under former coach
Ray Goff. At least four of Wednesday's signees have not yet
qualified academically.
</P>

CONNECTICUT STRIVES TO COMPLETE PATRIOTS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>

 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Desperate to close the deal to bring the New England
Patriots to Hartford, Connecticut officials worked feverishly
Wednesday to convince the team that problems with the proposed site
of a downtown stadium would not delay construction of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals involved in the negotiations said the Patriots
organization was increasingly confident that the state will find a
way to move a steam plant that now sits on what would be the
50-yard line, and will handle any environmental contamination left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   However, Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland told the
Associated Press Wednesday there could be a delay of the scheduled
signing Friday of a development agreement that would legally bind
the team to play there for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signing could be Friday, it could be Saturday,'' Rowland
said. ``We will have agreement on all the issues by Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman said Friday was not a deadline but ``a
goal'' to have all the guarantees in place and problems resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week a breakdown in talks on moving the steam plant
unnerved many involved in the $350 million stadium project, part of
a larger $1 billion downtown revitalization effort. Some team
officials worried that the plant could stand in the way of stadium
construction, the start of which already may be delayed until the
summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland took immediate action, naming a special adviser to
solve the steam plant problem, a move that has contributed to some
newfound confidence on the part of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, we are still working towards a Friday
timetable and there are still some unknowns,'' said team vice
president Andy Wasynczuk. ``But there's more and more information
being put together and everyone is working in good faith to make it
happen. And we believe it will happen on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers continued work around the clock to complete
language in the final development agreement, a document that is
more than 200 pages long and lays out just how the stadium will be
built and when.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from putting the finishing touches on that pact, Rowland's
office pressed forward to assuage the team's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The governor hired Richard D. Gray, executive director of the
Connecticut Health and Educational Facilities Authority, to work as
a third-party deal-broker between CTG Resources Inc., owner of the
steam plant, and the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, a
quasi-public agency that could provide the energy to the stadium
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anyone that can get the job done it's Rich Gray,''
said one Connecticut lobbyist. ``He is very bright, very skilled in
government, very skilled in politics, a tough negotiator.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the team was encouraged by Gray's help and, even if
there is no resolution Friday on how and when to move the steam
plant, the likelihood of signing the development agreement is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of different facets to this parcel that are
being dealt with,'' one person close to the talks said. ``And
between Wednesday's meeting, last night's meeting, and continued
conversations today, it is imminently clear that the state is
moving as aggressively as possible to try to straighten these
issues out.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue: CTG is considering buying steam from the nearby CRRA
plant and running pipes to the stadium site so there would be no
service disruption downtown. If no deal is struck between the two
power producers, however, CTG could face having the state take the
land by eminent domain and reimburse the company for its value.
</P>
<P>
   That is the option of last resort because it could be the most
time consuming, those involved in the negotiations say.
</P>
<P>
   No one could be reached for comment at CTG or CRRA Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cost of cleaning up the dozens of potentially toxic
chemicals that now contaminate the site, John DeVillars, regional
administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, Wednesday
said no one knows for sure how much that would cost because the
last study done on the site occurred years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But, DeVillars added, ``There are ways in which the stadium can
be sited and constructed that can minimize the cost associated with
the environmental cleanup and we've begun those discussions'' with
site consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if the Connecticut deal falls through, Governor Paul
Cellucci would be waiting with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will very happily go back to the table,'' Cellucci said.
``It's a pretty big project. There's always hurdles when you have
big project. The question is, can they overcome the hurdles. We're
obviously watching to see if they do or if they don't.''

CHRIS SIMMS, NATION'S BEST HIGH SCHOOL QUARTERBACK, WILL PLAY FOR 
 TEXAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Tenn., N.J., N.Y., Ohio, Ind., Ill., Conn., Mass.,
Fla.)  By RON DICKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Simms of Ramapo High School, considered the best schoolboy
quarterback in the nation, Wednesday signed a letter of intent to
attend the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5-inch, 218-pound Simms, the son of the former Giants
quarterback Phil Simms, threw for 7,055 yards and 63 touchdowns in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   His signing, after he verbally committed to Tennessee last fall,
bolstered Texas' incoming class. The Longhorns landed eight players
among the top 100 prep athletes and another 12 in the top 250,
according to Jeff Duva, publisher of PrepStar magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at sheer numbers, they're the best,'' said Duva,
who ranked UCLA, Tennessee, Notre Dame and Ohio State behind the
Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State does not announce signees, but, according to
Blue-White Illustrated, a magazine devoted to the school's athletic
program, the Nittany Lions did not use one of their 13 scholarships
to grab a quarterback, perceived as a positional weakness. Penn
State still got its share of skill players, led by running back
Horace Dodd (6-2, 205), the Connecticut player of the year from
Hamden High School.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers signed wide receiver Ryshaun Conover (6-3, 200) of
Lakewood High and linebacker Raheem Orr (6-4, 230) of Elizabeth
High. Both were rated among the top five players in New Jersey by
the McCarthy Report, a scouting service used by major colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is probably the biggest equalizer in college football
today,'' Coach Terry Shea said. `'I wanted to generate that type of
quality with this class. That's something we didn't have enough of
but we are constantly building toward.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse found Donovan McNabb's heir apparent in R.J. Anderson
(6-1, 215), who threw 45 touchdown passes at Milford (Conn.)
Academy despite not starting at the beginning of the season. The
Orangemen also plucked linebacker Clifton Smith (6-2, 240) of
Freeport High on New York's Long Island and shored up the defensive
end position with Josh Thomas (6-7, 230) of Orchard Park High, also
in New York state, and Joe Donnelly (6-3, 208) of Kent High School
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College received commitments from several prominent New
Jersey players, including running back William Green (6-1, 220) of
Holy Spirit in Absecon and linemen Augie Hoffman (6-4, 315) of St.
Joseph's in Montvale and Tom Martin (6-5, 245) of Howell.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College lured from New York City defensive back Will
Poole (6-0, 170) of Christ the King and running back Brian Flores
of Poly Prep. Another Poly star, wide receiver Kunle Patrick (6-1,
205), opted for Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   In other prominent signings nationwide, Notre Dame plucked
safety Jerome Sapp (6-0, 210) from Lamar High in Houston; Ohio
State lured PrepStar's highest-rated lineman, Bryce Bishop (6-5,
310) of Killian, Fla., and Temple recruited Dan Klecko, (6-1, 260),
a defensive lineman from Marlboro High in New Jersey, who is the
son of Joe Klecko, the former Temple and New York Jets star.

GREEK ORTHODOX BISHOPS SEEK OUSTER OF ARCHBISHOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The five presiding American bishops of the Greek Orthodox church
of America are calling for the ouster of Archbishop Spyridon, its
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a level of public discord virtually unheard of in
religious denominations, the five clerics who head local dioceses
across the United States accuse Spyridon of plunging the Greek
Orthodox Church, which has 1.5 million members, into a crisis that
threatens to tear it apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Archdiocese is presently suffocating in an atmosphere of
fear, suspicion, insecurity, lack of trust and vindictiveness,''
states a report by the bishops submitted last month to Ecumenical
Patriarch Bartholomew, who appointed Spyridon in 1996 and is the
spiritual leader of the world's 300 million Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the clergy and laity have lost their trust in
their ecclesiastical leadership, which during the last two and a
half years has not been able to create and promote new visions and
new dreams for the future,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Mark Arey, a spokesman for Spyridon, said the
archdiocese did not have an official response to the report but
added that the issues raised by the prelates were being addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That report is no longer relevant,'' Arey said. ``The
archbishop and the metropolitans may not agree on everything but
they have agreed to work together, and that's what they're doing
even as we speak.'' In the Greek Orthodox Church bishops are
referred to as metropolitans.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in a showdown at the Phanar, the compound in Istanbul
that is home to Bartholomew, the patriarch rebuffed the five
bishops' repeated calls for Spyridon's removal. Bartholomew,
according to reports in the Greek press, expressed his confidence
in his embattled Spyridon.
</P>
<P>
   The report was first published in The National Herald, a Greek
language newspaper in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the day Spyridon arrived in New York to assume his
post, he has been consumed by the allegations of many in his flock
who say he he is an autocrat who does not work well with the clergy
or lay people in this country. The Greek Orthodox Church in the
United States is historically more independent-minded and
democratic than the mother church.
</P>
<P>
   His crtics say Spyridon, who was born in Ohio but spent more
than five decades in Europe, is out of touch with the American
church. Spyridon's conservative views about hierarchical authority,
for instance, are typical of many Orthodox churhes abroad, but have
led to clashes with Greek Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop's defenders say his detractors represent a small
number of disgruntled clergy and laity who are upset about having
lost power and influence after Spyridon arrived. Opposition to the
archbishop has continued to pick up momentum with at least one
major lay group calling for the creation of a separate Greek
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Chicago, and Astoria, N.Y., a Greek enclave, bumper
stickers have started to appear with the Greek word ``Anaxios,''
which means unworthy. In Greek liturgical tradition, when a priest
is ordained it's customary for people in the pews to shout
``Axios,'' which means worthy.
</P>
<P>
   The report to Bartholomew also reveals that the five presiding
bishops disagreed with Spyridon's 1997 decision to fire the
president and three professors at the church's flagship
institution, Hellenic College and Holy Cross School of Theology in
Brookline, Mass. _ a move that launched the firestorm engulfing the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general state of affairs and the atmosphere in the
archdiocese have created such a spirit of unbearableness and
disillusionment that especially our young people no longer feel
proud of their faith, the church and the archdiocese,'' the report
states.

   E(STAR)Trade, an Internet brokerage firm, had computer problems
twice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Its World Wide Web site would not accept trades from customers
for more than an hour in the morning, and sporadically in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   E(STAR)Trade, which handled an average of 42,000 trades a day in
the last quarter, said that its business hardly had been affected.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Levinson, the company's president, asserted that online
trading companies are being held to a higher standard than
brokerage firms have been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the traditional way that people invested,'' she said, ``it
didn't matter if their broker was out to lunch. No one cared if
their trade was placed at 10 a.m. or 11. There is a new breed of
online trader, and higher expectations have been set.''

 Finding a Computer School  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm a computer illiterate who has a 9-to-5 job. I would
like to take some night classes to learn how to navigate Windows,
Microsoft Word, etc. Are there any computer schools you can
recommend?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Lots of private schools specialize in computing
classes, but I wouldn't look at those until I'd exhausted some
other alternatives. First, contact your local community college to
see if it has the classes you want at the times you need. Most JCs
now offer training in basic computing, including Windows, word
processing, spreadsheets and such. College courses usually are a
better bang for your buck than private classes, which typically
last just a few hours and cost up to $50.
</P>
<P>
   You also might try to track down a local computer users' group,
which may be able to steer you to some good classes. One group, the
Golden Gate Computer Society, offers a free Introduction to
Computing course in San Rafael. You can call them at (415)
454-5556.
</P>
<P>
   The Ideas Man
</P>
<P>
   Q: I keep track of my investments using Excel 97 for Windows. Is
there a way to import the total value of each stock to a summary
worksheet showing all my investments? Currently, I copy and paste
the value. I wonder if there's an easier way by setting some sort
of automatic function. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Ideas is my middle name. You should be able to accomplish
your goal by linking the cells of the main worksheet(s) to a table
in a summary worksheet. Here's how: Select the cells whose contents
you want to display in the summary. Choose Copy from the Edit menu.
Then switch to the summary worksheet. Now choose Paste Special from
the Edit menu, then click the button labeled Paste Link. This will
transfer the formulas and content of the cells. After that, any
time you make a change to the original worksheet that affects the
calculation, the results will change on the summary sheet as well.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Just Plain RAM
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the difference between DRAM, SRAM, EDO RAM, SDRAM and
just plain RAM?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Let's start by explaining what RAM is. It stands for
Random Access Memory, which is memory that can be used to store and
retrieve information in a personal computer or other device. The
first generation of PC memory chip was called Dynamic Random Access
Memory, or DRAM. Then came a faster kind used a technique called
Extended Data Output _ hence EDO RAM. For the past couple of years,
most new PCs have come with an even faster kind of chip called
Synchronous DRAM, or SDRAM.
</P>
<P>
   Different kinds of DRAM are incompatible with each other, so if
you're going to upgrade the memory in your computer, find out
what's in there before you buy new chips.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of COMPUTIN (76542 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  That leaves just SRAM. Short for Static RAM, it can be accessed
faster than DRAM, but it's also more expensive and requires much
more space for the same amount of data. It's used in PCs mainly for
the caches that microprocessors look in before they look in the
main RAM.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now that we've got RAM straight, here's one more: SCRAM.
</P>
<P>
   Booking Your Favorites
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do I transfer the Web sites I've saved as Favorites in
Internet Explorer to Netscape's Bookmark folder? I want both my
browsers to have the same information, but the formats seem to be
different.
</P>
<P>
   A: Indeed they are, but fortunately, several shareware and
freeware programs can be downloaded from the Web that let you
convert Favorites to Bookmarks and vice versa. Actually, this
question comes up a lot, so everybody clip out this section of the
column and tape it to the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular converter programs is a freebie called
Navex. To download it, go to &LR;  mach5.ocs.drexel.edu/navex/. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Another free program called Bookmark Converter can be found by
going to PC World's site  &LR; (www.pcworld.com) &LR;  and searching for that
title. And finally, there's a good $21 program called Bookmark
Importer from WebOBJ, which is available at  &LR; www.webobj.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  If you enter exactly the same information in lots of documents,
consider creating a macro to cut down on your typing time. Macros
are recordings of keystrokes that can either be text or a series of
commands telling the computer to carry out an operation. Microsoft
Word makes it easy to create a macro. Just choose Macro from the
Tools menu, then click Record New Macro and follow the
instructions. You can assign a keyboard shortcut to your macro or
create a toolbar button, giving you easy access to it.

IOC GROUP THREATENS SITE FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The palace revolt within the International Olympic Committee
began in earnest Wednesday when several dozen members vowed they
wouldn't give up the right to choose future host cities in the wake
of the Salt Lake City payoff scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Though the IOC's executive board last month recommended that a
15-member group, not the full body, pick the site of the 2006
Winter Games in June, many of the 100-plus rank-and-file members
said it would be an insult to their integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some hurt feelings that we were being classified in
that group of guilty IOC members,'' said Jim Easton, one of the
three US members. ``It's like taking the candy away from the bad
boy _ you won't get the vote anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking host cities is the most cherished privilege of the IOC
members, who meet only once a year. But since more than a dozen of
them allegedly took $800,000 in cash and gifts before and after the
2002 Winter Games were awarded, the IOC has been under severe
pressure to reform the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Besides recommending that a smaller committee with only eight
IOC members select the next site, the executive board suspended six
members pending expulsion at a special full session in Lausanne,
Switzerland, next month. One, David Sibandze of Swaziland, has
since resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have some bad apples, they should be thrown out, but
don't tell us the whole general assembly is corrupt,'' said Mario
Pescante of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Pescante said an ``overwhelming majority'' of 42 members defied
the executive board at a breakfast meeting Wednesday in Lausanne,
where the IOC is staging a major conference on doping issues this
week. ``For the first time in the history of the Olympic
movement,'' he said, ``the voice of the members is very, very
loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the board's recommendations are usually rubber-stamped by
the full body, the host city issue was expected to be delicate and
controversial. ``The members' first reaction will be that they're
being chastised,'' predicted vice president Richard Pound of
Canada, who chaired the IOC's inquiry panel which recommended the
reforms. ``It will be insulting to them. But once that is dealt
with, they'll realize that we face quite a problem and that we have
to do something dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has already banned members
from visiting the six candidate cities for 2006 _ Sion,
Switzerland; Turin, Italy; Helsinki; Klagenfurt, Austria; Zakopane,
Poland; and Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia. But surrendering the right to
choose the host will require a two-thirds vote, which now seems
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible the general assembly will approve this
proposal,'' Pescante said. ``I'm sure the executive board will have
to find a new solution before then. If they lose at the session, it
would be a disaster for the president and the executive board.''
</P>
<P>
   As a compromise, the IOC may decide to let the smaller committee
name two or three finalists 24 hours before the vote, then have the
entire body select the victor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not unreasonable,'' Easton said. ``It's a system that
makes some sense. If (the cutoff) was done very late in the game,
there would be no chance for anyone to go out and abuse any
privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the doping conference, which the IOC had hoped would
produce a global watchdog agency and uniform penalties for drug use
among sporting federations, has been beset by bitter disagreements
and distrust.
</P>
<P>
   Any chance for the IOC-proposed two-year minimum doping ban for
serious offenders appeared dead amid fears that courts would
overrule the penalty. And both the United States and the 15-member
European Union oppose having the IOC control the anti-drug agency.
``An independent organization is required, and independence means
just that _ independence,'' said Donald Vereen, deputy director of
the White House drug control office.

 Print Your Own Stamps   By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Neither rain, snow, sleet nor online bandwidth will stop the latest
form of postage from being delivered to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As early as this summer, &UR;  &LR; Web surfers will be able to download
electronic stamps over the Internet and print them out from a PC,
creating a personalized post office. But you pay a premium for the
service, so small businesses that want an alternative to postage
meters are expected to be the biggest audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about convenience and avoiding paying for pricey
postage meters,'' said Jeff Green, co-founder of Stamps.com
( &LR; www.stamps.com &LR; ), a Santa Monica firm that is one of a quartet of
contenders in the fledgling e-postage field.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps.com, E-Stamp, Pitney-Bowes and Neopost, with the blessing
of the U.S. Postal Service, have developed technology that stores
e-postage online or in a small PC attachment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how e-postage works: You visit a Web site, where you
either register with a service or download free software that
allows you to use a credit card or electronic funds transfer to buy
postage in blocks of $20, $40, $100 and $200. The postage is stored
either on the vendor's Web server or a hardware box you attach to
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   When you're ready to mail a letter, you open the software
program or go to the Web site and type in how much postage you
need. An optional scale that can be connected to a PC weighs small
packages and determines their mailing cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Web server or hardware box ``dispenses'' the postage from
your account. Then you can print the bar-coded postage onto any
envelope, label or letter that fits into your printer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Convenience does come at a price, however. You have to buy or
lease the hardware device, as well as pay transaction fees _
usually about 10 percent of the amount of the stamps purchased.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; E-Stamp offers a dime-size device for about $100 that attaches
to a computer's printer port. Pitney Bowes and Neopost offer
similar products that lease for about $10 to $15 a month.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But don't count on pretty pictures of Elvis, birds and
beaches. Most of the digital stamps show plain bar codes, as
specified by the U.S. Postal Service. In rare instances, an
``advertising area'' next to the bar code allows limited use of
scanned images, such as company logos, as preapproved by the Postal
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The two-dimensional bar codes are crucial, however. They contain
an encrypted ID number and information about the origin of each
piece of mail, making them more difficult to forge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &UR;  &LR; Appearances aside, Sunir Kapoor, CEO of E-Stamp
( &LR; www.estamp.com &LR; ), said digital-postage systems should expedite
operations at an estimated 32.5 million small businesses and
home-based offices in the United States. The other alternative for
these businesses is postage meters, which rent for $30 to $120 a
month, and also include charges for ``resetting'' and
equipment-maintenance that can top $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STAMP04 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Indeed, market research firm Keenan Vision Inc. in San Francisco
predicts spending on electronic postage will vault to $127 million
in 2000 and $1.9 billion in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   E-Stamp and Stamps.com have agreements with America Online to
provide e-postage for a postal center AOL is expected to launch
this year. Both have tested their digital-stamp systems in San
Francisco and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The other pair of competitors in the field _ Pitney Bowes
( &LR; www.pitneybowes.com &LR; ) and Neopost ( &LR; www.neopost.com &LR; ) _ are
extending their well-established postal-meter businesses onto the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney Bowes is particularly well positioned: The Stamford,
Conn., company is the Goliath of the contenders, having served as
the largest supplier of postage-meter services in the United States
since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology is ideally suited for anyone or any company
who does mass mailings,'' said Bill Shannon, director of product
management at Pitney Bowes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely better than going to the post office and
waiting in line. That's a pain,'' said Isobel Bonar, area manager
at IWCC Training in Communications, a San Carlos training and
consulting firm that has beta-tested E-Stamp's product for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Lick-and-stick postage has come a long way since the visages of
Benjamin Franklin and George Washington graced stamps in 1847.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 years later, digital stamps are among the first
electronic goods consumers can buy and receive straight from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They could eventually usher in an era of cyber post offices
offered by Internet service providers and popular Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a post office inside your personal
computer,'' Bonar said. ``We should all be so lucky.''

 E-Trade's Outage Irks Online Traders  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Trading operations of E-Trade Group broke down for more than an
hour yesterday morning, angering customers and showing once again
that computer-based investing remains vulnerable to &UR;  &LR; breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade, the nation's third-largest online broker, said
customers were unable to place orders beginning at 7:15 a.m.
Pacific time because of an error in a computer code it added to its
trading software Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   By taking out the code, the Palo Alto firm was able to restore
voice-activated telephone trading in about 50 minutes and Internet
trading a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the fix, E-Trade said about 5 percent of its clients
still had problems carrying out online trades because it hadn't
removed all pieces of the malfunctioning code.
</P>
<P>
   During the period trading was blocked, E-Trade said its Web site
remained open. Still, at one point, Keynote Systems, a San Mateo
company that tracks Internet usage, said that one out of every four
of its test attempts to get through to the site failed, compared to
a normal failure rate of less than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade apologized to its customers for the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a company official said that expectations of
instant, error-free trading aren't realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I'd love to say technology is 100 percent reliable all
the time, frankly technology is not like that,'' said President
Kathy Levinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be as close to 100 percent as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said she didn't know how many customers weren't able to
carry out trades.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade will consider their claims individually and will make
good on genuine losses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown came at an embarrassing time for E-Trade, which is
in the midst of an expensive advertising campaign to promote its
Web site as an all-purpose source of financial information.
</P>
<P>
   Online stock trading is growing at a frenzied pace.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Credit Suisse First Boston reported that electronic
brokerage rocketed up 34 percent from the third to the fourth
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Amid surging demand, most of E-Trade's rivals have also had
service problems.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leader Charles Schwab, for example, recently said its
Internet site and telephone operations turned clients away on
several occasions in January.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ETRADE04 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  E-trade, which executed nearly 40,000 trades a day in the fourth
quarter, stressed that yesterday's breakdown had nothing to do with
its ability to handle Web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, plenty of investors, especially the hyper-aggressive and
unforgiving ``day traders'' who aim to get in and out of stocks in
the space of a few hours, weren't interested in explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Online message boards at sites such as Yahoo and Silicon
Investor were filled with barbed ``flames'' aimed at E-Trade
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Warned one irate trader on Yahoo's site: ``Get it together
E-Trade or you're going to the E-grave.''

CONNECTICUT STRIVES TO COMPLETE PATRIOTS DEAL

 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Desperate to close the deal to bring the New England
Patriots to Hartford, Connecticut officials worked feverishly
Wednesday to convince the team that problems with the proposed site
of a downtown stadium would not delay construction of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals involved in the negotiations said the Patriots
organization was increasingly confident that the state will find a
way to move a steam plant that now sits on what would be the
50-yard line, and will handle any environmental contamination left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   However, Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland told the
Associated Press Wednesday there could be a delay of the scheduled
signing Friday of a development agreement that would legally bind
the team to play there for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signing could be Friday, it could be Saturday,'' Rowland
said. ``We will have agreement on all the issues by Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman said Friday was not a deadline but ``a
goal'' to have all the guarantees in place and problems resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week a breakdown in talks on moving the steam plant
unnerved many involved in the $350 million stadium project, part of
a larger $1 billion downtown revitalization effort. Some team
officials worried that the plant could stand in the way of stadium
construction, the start of which already may be delayed until the
summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland took immediate action, naming a special adviser to
solve the steam plant problem, a move that has contributed to some
newfound confidence on the part of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, we are still working towards a Friday
timetable and there are still some unknowns,'' said team vice
president Andy Wasynczuk. ``But there's more and more information
being put together and everyone is working in good faith to make it
happen. And we believe it will happen on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers continued work around the clock to complete
language in the final development agreement, a document that is
more than 200 pages long and lays out just how the stadium will be
built and when.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from putting the finishing touches on that pact, Rowland's
office pressed forward to assuage the team's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The governor hired Richard D. Gray, executive director of the
Connecticut Health and Educational Facilities Authority, to work as
a third-party deal-broker between CTG Resources Inc., owner of the
steam plant, and the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, a
quasi-public agency that could provide the energy to the stadium
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anyone that can get the job done it's Rich Gray,''
said one Connecticut lobbyist. ``He is very bright, very skilled in
government, very skilled in politics, a tough negotiator.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the team was encouraged by Gray's help and, even if
there is no resolution Friday on how and when to move the steam
plant, the likelihood of signing the development agreement is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of different facets to this parcel that are
being dealt with,'' one person close to the talks said. ``And
between Wednesday's meeting, last night's meeting, and continued
conversations today, it is imminently clear that the state is
moving as aggressively as possible to try to straighten these
issues out.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue: CTG is considering buying steam from the nearby CRRA
plant and running pipes to the stadium site so there would be no
service disruption downtown. If no deal is struck between the two
power producers, however, CTG could face having the state take the
land by eminent domain and reimburse the company for its value.
</P>
<P>
   That is the option of last resort because it could be the most
time consuming, those involved in the negotiations say.
</P>
<P>
   No one could be reached for comment at CTG or CRRA Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cost of cleaning up the dozens of potentially toxic
chemicals that now contaminate the site, John DeVillars, regional
administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, Wednesday
said no one knows for sure how much that would cost because the
last study done on the site occurred years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But, DeVillars added, ``There are ways in which the stadium can
be sited and constructed that can minimize the cost associated with
the environmental cleanup and we've begun those discussions'' with
site consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if the Connecticut deal falls through, Governor Paul
Cellucci would be waiting with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will very happily go back to the table,'' Cellucci said.
``It's a pretty big project. There's always hurdles when you have
big project. The question is, can they overcome the hurdles. We're
obviously watching to see if they do or if they don't.''

 Airlines Face Early Arrival Of Y2K Today  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
For most of the U.S. airline industry, Jan. 1, 2000, lands today.
</P>
<P>
   That's because February 4 is the first day major computer
reservation systems serving airlines like United, American and
Northwest will start booking flights for next New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Airline computer specialists who spent years and millions of
dollars testing systems to make sure the Year 2000 problem doesn't
bite are cautiously confident.
</P>
<P>
   They will also be holding their collective breaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a command center set up and will have extra people
on hand in case something might happen,'' said Jennifer Hudson,
spokeswoman for the Sabre Group, which operates one of the largest
travel reservation networks used by airlines and travel agents
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   To save data storage space, computer programs used to be written
to recognize only the last two digits of a year. The Y2K problem
could cause computers to interpret 2000 as the year 1900, which
could lead to miscalculations or system crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Today became an early Y2K deadline for the airline industry
since its computer reservations systems were designed to accept
bookings either 330 or 331 days in advance of the travel date.
</P>
<P>
   Any Y2K-related glitches are expected to cause only minor
inconveniences. Travel agents and online customers, for example,
may have to take extra steps to find and book plane tickets and
travel packages if computers fail to recognize the year.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the safety of planes flying on Jan. 1, 2000, is a
separate issue, although the airlines remain confident problems
will be solved by that time.
</P>
<P>
   But Year 2000 observers say what happens to reservations will
provide valuable lessons for programmers working on the Y2K problem
in other industries. The reservation systems' successes or failures
may prove a harbinger of things to come the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of Y2KTRAVE (87813 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``People are keeping their eyes and ears open for any kinds of
problems they missed or things they didn't think of,'' said Robert
Martin, a Y2K director at Mitre Corp. of Bedford, Mass., a
nonprofit corporation that advises federal agencies on Year 2000
remedies. ``We always want reassurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabre Group, the world's biggest computer reservations
system handling about one-third of travel bookings, has been
working on the Year 2000 problem since 1995. The Texas company will
have staff standing by at command centers in Dallas and Tulsa,
Okla., just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tested it dozens upon dozens times, but (today) will be
the first real-time test,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Harm Helm, director of applications systems for
United Airlines, will also be crossing his fingers as the first
results come through and also will have teams of experts standing
by.
</P>
<P>
   Helm has been working with officials from Apollo, the
reservations system used by United, on fixing and testing Y2K
problems since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in good shape, we're pretty confident that we're ready
to go and we don't anticipate any problems,'' Helm said. ``If we
get through the first day, the likelihood is that we will be OK
with booking into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though today is the acid test for U.S. reservation systems,
some systems in other countries have already been put to the test _
and passed. Carriers like British Airways and Quantas Air have
reported no Y2K glitches so far. Galileo International, the parent
firm for the Apollo system, also has already successfully processed
international flight reservations for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Hill, owner of Franciscan Travel Service in San Francisco,
said demand for travel on New Year's seems to be strong since
people want to be someplace special for the new millennium. But
with the crush of extra holiday travel and the uncertainties over
Y2K, Hill is staying on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of Y2KTRAVE (87813 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``I don't think I want to be on a plane,'' she said. ``I think
it's going to be a shambles.''

IN A FAR-FLUNG CORNER OF CHINA, A FOLK STAR  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KASHGAR, China _ Kashgar is a town tangled up in two time zones.
Nestled in the northwest of China, less than 200 miles from the
borders of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan, the
legendary Silk Road oasis is run by the Han Chinese, who follow the
clock of their capital, two time zones away in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Uighurs, Turkic-speaking Muslims who make up more
than 80 percent of Kashgar's population, live according to the
local clock, two hours earlier than Beijing's. This disparity makes
Kashgar a confusing town to navigate _ and it made the task of
tracking down Abdurahim Heet, one of the most important
contemporary Uighur composers and musicians, extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kashgar, Heet leads a double life. On one hand, he is
famous in the region for his performances of traditional Uighur
(pronounced WE-goor) poetry and music. These are sung in a deep,
resonant, nasal voice and accompanied by the dutar, a two-stringed
lute. The music is available as cassettes manufactured and
distributed by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are the privately manufactured
cassettes. These contain Heet's original compositions, pieces like
``Stubborn Guest,'' an old man's plea to a lodger who has
overstayed his welcome _ and a thinly disguised analogy for China's
presence in the surrounding Xinjiang region, which was made a
province of China in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Uighur music deals with love, morality and
criticisms of misconduct. But Heet _ known as the ``Rooster of
Xinjiang'' because of his voice _ is the first Uighur musician to
write about life under Chinese rule. As a result, he has to pay
extra money to the private manufacturers of his cassettes to
compensate them for the risk they are taking. He distributes these
tapes for free.
</P>
<P>
   A master of folk tradition with a fire for protest and poetry,
he has become a local Bob Dylan, spurring many musicians to follow
in his footsteps (and in at least one case to get arrested for a
politically charged performance). Songs like ``Stubborn Guest'' and
``Silk,'' a paean to Uighur culture, have become anthems and
sources of pride in Kashgar, where donkey carts are still the main
mode of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Heet began in Kashgar's busy Sunday market, where
the stalls selling local cassettes had his three-tape series of
traditional tunes, ``Regret,'' on prominent display. There Abdul
Ghenee, a young Uighur who had discarded the traditional skullcap
in favor of a baseball cap worn backwards, promised he could help
track the composer down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying,'' he said, rubbing his bandaged eye, a
result of a fight with a Chinese man who had insulted a Uighur
woman. ``When a Uighur child can walk, he can dance. When a Uighur
child can speak, he or she can sing.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was an open storefront on a dirt road. The shop
belonged to the Emin family, which has been making and selling
instruments there for five generations. The store was a reminder of
Kashgar's duality.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside was a gold-covered plaque designating the shop's
proprietor, Muhammat Emin, as a model member of the local Communist
league. But inside, traces of modern Kashgar disappeared. The walls
were lined with elaborately decorated hushtars, a violin-like
instrument that had disappeared from Uighur music until it was
discovered during an excavation in the nearby Taklaman desert some
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The snakeskin heads of rewap lutes and dop drums were also
scattered around the dusty room. Emin picked and pounded melodies
and rhythms on each, explaining the Uighur oral tradition. There is
no notation in Uighur music, which is perhaps a good thing, since
what little was written about the music was burned along with as
many instruments as could be gathered during the Cultural
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, modern music was very popular,'' Emin said.
``But these days folk music has the most important place in Uighur
society. I think it's because during the Cultural Revolution people
didn't have the freedom to choose what they listened to, and many
famous musicians were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Emin gave Ghenee the phone number of Heet's sister, a music
teacher, explaining that Heet does not have a phone. At Heet's
sister's house, her nephew, Marat, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned
with the logo of the Western heavy-metal band Kreator, offered to
lead us to the small house where the composer lives with his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Heet was dressed in jeans, a neatly pressed white button-down
shirt and a dapper mustache. A finely handled Uighur dagger hung
from a leather sheath hooked to one of his belt loops. He sat on an
elevated, bright red carpet in an otherwise empty room and had his
family bring out flat bread, melon, tea and a bowl for
hand-washing.
</P>
<P>
   He then leaned over and whispered something to Ghenee who
explained, embarrassed, that Heet had never spent time with an
American before.
</P>
<P>
   For the next hour, Heet (with Ghenee serving as translator)
explained the history of the music, the dozens of marathon
four-hour concerts he performs annually and the book he was
completing on classical Uighur music, the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is one of the most important parts of Uighur culture,''
he said. ``People here can wear American T-shirts, but their hearts
stay the same. The music, because it's such a symbol of the heart,
changes slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Heet has been changing the music. Influenced by
Persian, Arabic and Turkish music, Uighur songs are as jubilant as
they are complex, soaring and dipping along the Arabic scale known
as the maqam and helping to give the Xinjiang region the nickname
``the land of song and dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally thought to have been brought to the area in the ninth
century, Uighur music wound up influencing Chinese court music when
it became a favorite among Tang emperors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the highlights of Heet's latest recording and first CD,
``Inheritance,'' is a song called ``Rooster,'' a story about a
rooster awaking his people from darkness to welcome a new dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government hasn't said anything to me about the political
songs yet,'' he said, ``so I don't know if I have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Heet brought us to a local teahouse, where he sat in
the back room, door shut to prevent the sound of the restaurant's
one-man synthesizer band from leaking in.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, Heet found a dutar in the restaurant. It was
warped and out of tune. But when his fingers started sliding and
twiddling with heavy-metal speed up and down the long neck _ nearly
twice the size of a guitar's _ the instrument's defects seemed to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Wailed rooster-voiced lyrics of love reverberated off the walls,
the strings crackled brightly beneath his calloused fingers,
uptempo melodies flowed out of the door. Heet went on for minutes,
or hours; it was hard to tell. For a moment, Kashgar was one,
keeping time to a single clock, the dutar.

VENERABLE MUSICAL INSTITUTIONS COLLIDE, QUIETLY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (af) 
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two enduring and vibrant musical institutions came
together here for the first time, on Friday evening, to explore the
common threads of musical styles born more than two centuries
apart: Baroque and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   In a concert to be repeated Sunday afternoon, the Handel and
Haydn Society, founded here in 1815 and still a leading American
Baroque chorus and orchestra, joined forces at Symphony Hall with
the jazz fusion pioneers Chick Corea and Gary Burton, who
serendipitously hooked up in 1972 and have played together every
year since.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups play their distinctive brands of music in
alternation, choosing pieces that encourage improvisation and
counterpoint, techniques that, they say, help keep them vital and
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvisation brings excitement to what we play,'' said John
Finney, the associate conductor of the Handel and Haydn Society,
who chose the Baroque works in the collaborative program and
directs them from the harpsichord and organ. ``We work in a defined
melodic framework, but you can play a wash of sound around the
notes that will enhance and propel them. It's like when an already
beautiful woman puts on jewelry. It adds glitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Baroque mainstay, counterpoint, has long inspired
the pianist Corea, who was born in nearby Chelsea, Mass., and the
vibraphonist Burton, who has lived in Boston most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When what I'm playing spontaneously intersects with what he's
playing, it sends off the music like a rocket that flies into the
audience and lifts us both off the floor,'' said Burton, who is
also the executive vice president of the Berklee College of Music.
``It's the thrill we live for, and it keeps the music fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part of the concert, Corea and Burton are performing
selections from their album ``Native Sense: The New Duets,'' their
first recording since 1982, which was released last year and has
been nominated for two Grammy awards, for best small ensemble and
best soloists.
</P>
<P>
   They have already won two Grammys, and what keeps the
partnership growing, they suggest, is a quality rarely extolled by
popular musicians: maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, our communication onstage has become almost a sixth
sense,'' Burton said. ``We can read each other's nuances, so what
we each are playing miraculously coincides to create something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   The Handel and Haydn Society, despite being the nation's oldest
continuously performing arts group, also keeps growing and
changing. At the moment, it is searching for an artistic director
to replace the English conductor Christopher Hogwood, who has
announced that he will leave in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival in 1985, Hogwood has introduced 17th- and
18th-century instruments for the orchestra and, critics say, raised
playing standards to a consistently high level.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom holds that collaborative efforts like this
allow classical music to speak more directly to a wider audience.
But there may be another, more problematic side to the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baroque instruments can sound small and pale compared to the
meaty, high-cholesterol sound of modern instruments,'' said John
Gibbons, a harpsichordist and the chairman of the historic
performance department at the New England Conservatory here.
``Success is in the ear of the beholder.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hogwood, who started the society's Baroque and jazz series
10 years ago, is confident that the current program enhances the
stature of both groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a jazz duo whose 20th-century decibel level is not out
of range with our early, 18th-century music etiquette,'' he said
from his home in Cambridge, England. ``It's an experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hogwood's willingness to overhaul the Handel and Haydn
Society has helped it maintain its position at the center of the
early-music scene here, according to William R. Porter, who teaches
organ at the New England Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1800s, the society imbued Boston with a taste for
refined European music. But by the 1960s and 70s, when this city
was a hub of early-music training and performance, the quality of
the society's performances were too often amateurish.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hogwood, Porter said, the society's switch to period
instruments and emphasis on musicianship has ``enriched Handel and
Haydn, and Boston, as a center of early music.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Hogwood, his fellow conductor Finney sees basic connections
between Baroque music and the Corea-Burton wing of jazz, which
finds inspiration in European chamber music, New Orleans jazz,
American rock and Latin rumba.
</P>
<P>
   First, Baroque music encouraged improvisation and originally
taught it as a high art form. ``Bach's improvisational performances
drew audiences from miles around,'' Finney said. ``Today, some
French cathedral organists still improvise on a theme.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Baroque harpsichord part, the bass line is written out for
the left hand, but no notes are given for the right hand. Numbers
supplied by the composer show the character of the chords above,
which the performer may fill out in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvisation keeps Baroque in the here and now,'' Finney
said. ``But jazz improvisations are different, because they play
actual variations of a melody to invent entirely new versions of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ornamentation of music with trills and the like is
important for the harpsichord and other instruments that cannot
sustain a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding lots of little notes creates an effervescent flurry of
sounds that quickly fade away to produce a crystalline clarity,''
Finney said. ``I chose music that has a bright, quick heartbeat,
just short of frenetic, because that's what I heard in Corea and
Burton.''
</P>
<P>
   As its part of the program, the Handel and Haydn Society plays
Bach's Concerto for Two Violins in D minor (BWV 1043), Corelli's
Concerto Grosso in D (Op. 6, No. 1) and Handel's Organ Concerto in
F (Op. 4, No. 4). Corea and Burton play Corea's ``Brasilia,'' ``No
Mystery,'' ``Duende,'' ``Bud Powell,'' ``Tango '95'' and
``Rhumbata.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ornamentation is clear in Rhumbata,'' Finney said. ``Instead
of playing one note, they play a trill that bends around the
note.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, both musical styles rely on counterpoint. ``It's what
makes Corea and Burton's music so engaging,'' Finney said. ``At
times, you hear the vibe and piano clearly playing two different
melodies. Other times, they play in unison, so fast it's amazing. I
still haven't figured out how Burton can play as fast with four
mallets, two in each hand, as we play with 10 fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Burton agrees on what the two genres share. ``They also both
have a lively melodic style, familiar harmony patterns and a steady
stream of eighth notes that create a pulsing beat,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our music is a little darker at this point in life,'' said
Burton, who, like Corea, is 56, ``and our playing has taken on
greater intensity, more focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a string quartet whose ability to play together
reflects their familiarity and maturity. We'd do anything not to
break up.''

   ATLANTIC DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK KNICKS
</P>
<P>
   The wish list is long: Latrell Sprewell wants his reputation
back, Patrick Ewing wants to recapture his timing and wind and
Coach Jeff Van Gundy is begging for anyone to do windows. If Marcus
Camby begins changing trajectories on the defensive end and Dennis
Scott can subsist on grapefruit and good shot selection, the loss
of Charles Oakley and John Starks will not be as devastating. Even
with the overhauled roster, the most important component for the
Knicks to get out of their second-round rut is the continued
ascension of Allan Houston to All-Star. If he is that good and Van
Gundy makes his players jell, the Knicks meet the Pacers for
everything in the Eastern Conference final.

   By June, Keith Van Horn could develop into the New York

Dennis Rodman as the league's rebounding leader and _ heraldic
trumpets, please _ Sam Cassell may think pass before shot.
Preseason injuries to Kerry Kittles and Rony Seikaly will stall the
Nets for a while, but they have too many young legs and supreme
offensive talents not to be considered as a conference finals
contender. A little more grunt work and grit could propel them
farther. The Benoit Benjamin/Yinka Dare jokes are now passe. These
are not your grandfather's Nets.

   ADDITIONS: C Jim McIlvaine (trade with Seattle), G Eric Murdock
(free agent, Heat).

<P>
   KEY LOSSES: G Sherman Douglas (free agent).
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI HEAT
</P>
<P>
   For Pat Riley, it is Year Four with another franchise _ a time
when many strong-willed players often burn out on the motivator's
boot-camp ways. To keep selling the program, Riley has to take the
Heat further than the first round of the playoffs. Alonzo Mourning
and Tim Hardaway need help at shooting guard, where Voshon Lenard
will be out for two months with a broken shin. Riley's refusal thus
far to pull the trigger on any off-season deals means one of two
things: He believes the talent he has will vault the Heat past the
Knicks and Pacers or he is still waiting for the right player to
fall into his lap before the trading deadline. Either way, Miami is
at a crossroads season.
</P>
<P>
   ADDITIONS: F Clarence Weatherspoon (free agent, Warriors), G
Terry Porter (free agent, Timberwolves).
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: G Brent Barry (free agent, Bulls), G Eric Murdock
(free agent, Nets).
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO MAGIC
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Isaac Austin gives Chuck Daly a decent center.
The Magic is still in the hunt for Dennis Rodman. Throw in Bo
Outlaw and Horace Grant, and that's a bona fide front line.
Anfernee Hardaway is finally healthy, Nick Anderson has got his
confidence back and the only real weak link may be depth in the
backcourt. Whether Hardaway is truly still one of the game's 10
best players may mean the difference between the second round of
the playoffs and the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ADDITIONS: C Isaac Austin (free agent, Clippers), G Doug Overton
(free agent, 76ers), C Michael Doleac (draft, No. 12, Utah), F Matt
Harpring (draft, No. 15, Georgia Tech).
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: F David Benoit (free agent), G Derek Harper (free
agent, Lakers), G Mark Price (free agent).
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON WIZARDS
</P>
<P>
   Rod Strickland is back in the fold. With him, the Wizards have
the league's best one-two combination at point guard and shooting
guard. Getting Mitch Richmond in return for Chris Webber was worth
the gamble. As to how Calbert Cheaney will fit in the puzzle
remains to be seen, and the Wizards are still in need of a quality
center to give Juwan Howard help on the blocks. Still, Washington
is much better than the 40-42 team it was a year ago and should
return to the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   ADDITIONS: G Mitch Richmond, F Otis Thorpe (trade with Kings).
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: F Chris Webber (traded to Sacramento), F Harvey
Grant (free agent, Philadelphia).
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON CELTICS
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino's frenetic, push-the-ball pace should create havoc
the first weeks of the season. Antoine Walker recently signed on
for the long haul and Ron Mercer continues to mature as a player.
What the Celtics lack in experience, they make up with in
athleticism and conditioning. Kenny Anderson is healthy and the
Kansas rookie Paul Pierce has already shown he can play in this
league. But half-court execution is still a big question mark _ as
is a trip to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ADDITIONS: F Tony Battie (trade with Lakers), F Paul Pierce
(draft, No. 10, Kansas), C Eric Riley (free agent, Mavericks).
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: C Travis Knight (traded to Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA 76ERS
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson has some decent pieces around him, especially with
the acquisition of Matt Geiger. And bringing three first-round
draft picks to camp, including St. Louis guard Larry Hughes, should
help. But the 76ers still need a year of good chemistry _ and an
impact player _ to compete for a playoff spot. Larry Brown will do
a lot of teaching and a little more winning than a year ago, but
patience still needs to be a virtue for this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ADDITIONS: F-C Matt Geiger (free agent, Hornets), G Larry Hughes
(draft, No. 8, St. Louis), F Harvey Grant (free agent, Wizards), F
George Lynch (free agent, Grizzlies), C Mirsad Turkcan (draft, No.
18, Turkey), C Nazr Mohammed (draft, No. 29, Kentucky).
</P>
<P>

IT'S OPEN SEASON ON `ALIENS'   
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E. J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   someone set off the motion-sensing lights near the front gate of
Jerry Chap's ranch west of Patagonia, about 14 miles from the
Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies from Santa Cruz County later said a smuggler
leading a group of 25 illegal immigrants had tripped the alarm by
opening the gate.
</P>
<P>
   The group ducked for cover when the lights went on, but decided
to cut through the property when it looked as if everything was
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who'd crossed into the United States that day was
25-year-old Oscar Hernandez Pinto. He told friends he'd lost his
job as a bus driver in Mexico City and was headed for Phoenix,
where he hoped to find work.
</P>
<P>
   As the group made its way past Chap's house, the lights went on
inside. According to investigators, the trespassers saw a man in a
wheelchair with a rifle. Chap is paralyzed below the waist and uses
a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   At least five rounds were fired. One of them struck Hernandez
Pinto above the right wrist. Friends bound the wound and carried
him off. Eventually, he made it to a Tucson hospital. He's now back
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days of the shooting, Chap and his wife were picked
up by sheriff's deputies on charges of attempted murder and
aggravated assault. In Arizona, deadly force is permitted only when
there's an immediate threat to someone's life.
</P>
<P>
   `NOT CONFRONTATIONAL'
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we know it was not confrontational,'' Santa Cruz
County Sheriff Tony Estrada told me Wednesday. ``There was no
threat. Of course, having people on your property can be
frightening. But that doesn't mean you can shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a spokesman for the Santa Cruz County prosecutor's
office told me the case is still under investigation and no
indictments have been issued.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oscar Hernandez Pinto, his arm mangled, hired an
attorney and filed a $750,000 suit against the Chaps.
</P>
<P>
   That galls some people. It disgusts them. How could someone who
isn't a U.S. citizen, who was violating U.S. law, turn around and
sue an American?
</P>
<P>
   I understand their anger and frustration. I'd even go along with
them, if it weren't for one small thing.
</P>
<P>
   They're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   What if it had been a group of Boy Scouts who'd wandered off the
trail and onto Chap's property? Or a high school basketball team
whose bus had broken down? Or tourists who'd made a wrong turn?
</P>
<P>
   Trespassing is not a capital offense.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez Pinto's attorney, Fernando Gaxiola, told me, ``When we
were in Vietnam, we didn't call the people there fathers or
mothers, sons or daughters, we called them `gooks,' because it made
it easier to kill them. We call these people `aliens' for the same
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   DISLIKED BUT NEEDED
</P>
<P>
   We don't like ``aliens,'' but we need them. We need them to pick
crops and mow lawns because they're willing to do it for less money
than American workers, and without health care or retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If there were no demand, there'd be no supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live here close to the border, then dealing with
undocumented workers is a fact of life,'' Sheriff Estrada said.
``But it is very rare that there are any confrontations. And the
ones that do occur we don't often hear much about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly because it's the illegals who end up on the short end of
the stick, or the rifle, and they're afraid to speak with U.S.
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Chap had shot an animal, he'd probably be in jail right
now,'' said Gaxiola the lawyer. ``All he shot was an `illegal
alien,' though. Some people think that's OK, that it's like
shooting a deer.''
</P>
<P>
   It's close to that, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Chap, who lives near the border, went out hunting
the other night and bagged a 25-year-old buck in his own back yard.
It was a darn good shot under difficult circumstances. The only
problem is, he doesn't have a license. Nobody does. &QL;

   CENTRAL DIVISION:
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA PACERS
</P>
<P>
   They've been anointed favorites for two essential reasons:
Michael Jordan retired and the Indiana players ran sprints together
during the lockout. So the Pacers have a lot to prove over the next
three months. Reggie Miller is now the game's best clutch shooter
and Sam Perkins was a nice pick-up via free agency. But can Rik
Smits' chronically sore feet and Mark Jackson's aging legs hold up
three nights in a row on occasion during a 50-game, three-month
grind? On paper, the Pacers are on their way to the finals. But
more conference parity may make the road just as difficult as it
was when Michael Jordan stood in their way. Remember, Larry Bird
only coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ADDITIONS: C Sam Perkins, (free agent, Supersonics), F Al
Harrington (draft, No. 25, St. Patrick's High School, N.J.).
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: C Mark West (free agent, Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT PISTONS
</P>
<P>
   They re-signed Jerry Stackhouse and improved their front court
with Loy Vaught and Christian Laettner, who are both still
rehabilitating from injuries. Still, one of last season's
underachieving teams has put itself back in the playoff hunt again.
The main reason the Pistons will be better? Grant Hill and Joe
Dumars, expected to retire at season's end, won't stand for another
losing record.
</P>
<P>
   ADDITIONS: F Loy Vaught (free agent, Clippers), F Christian
Laettner (trade with Hawks), G Jud Buechler (free agent, Bulls).
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: F Grant Long (free agent), F Malik Sealy (free
agent, Timberwolves).
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE BUCKS
</P>
<P>
   George Karl does not have as much to work with as he did in
Seattle, but Terrell Brandon and Ray Allen still make for one of
the league's best young backcourts. Dell Curry's 3-point shooting
off the bench will help. The big question is whether Karl can get
the Bucks to play the same type of trapping, aggressive defense
that the SuperSonics did so well.
</P>
<P>
   ADDITIONS: G Dell Curry (free agent, Hornets), F Robert Traylor
(draft, No. 6, Michigan), F Donald Royal (free agent, Hornets).
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: C Andrew Lang (traded to Chicago), G Litterial Green
(free agent, Cleveland).
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA HAWKS
</P>
<P>
   Like the Bulls, Suns and Rockets, the Hawks had to rebuild on
the fly. The good news for Lenny Wilkens is that the four players
Atlanta already had under contract were starters. The bad news: his
bench is once again corn-silk thin. Steve Smith, Tyrone Corbin,
Alan Henderson, Mookie Blaylock and Dikembe Mutombo will have to
play major minutes for the Hawks to return to the playoffs for the
eighth straight season. The best off-season pickup may have been
the Sacramento shooting guard Anthony Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Additions: G Anthony Johnson (free agent, Kings), F Kebu Stewart
(free agent, 76ers), F Scot Pollard (trade with Pistons), F Roshown
McLeod (draft, No. 20, Duke), C Mark West (free agent, Pacers), F
LaPhonso Ellis (free agent, Nuggets).
</P>
<P>
   Key Losses: F Christian Laettner (traded to Detroit), G Eldridge
Recasner (free agent, Charlotte).
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND CAVALIERS
</P>
<P>
   It's never a good sign when your franchise player reports to
training camp at least 20 pounds overweight, but that's what
happened. The ramifications of Shawn Kemp's girth in a short season
may prove costly for a team that otherwise has all the components
for returning to the playoffs. Derek Anderson and the 7-foot-3
Zydrunas Ilgauskas are two of the league's bright young talents and
the major reasons why General Manager Wayne Embry was named
Executive of the Year. But too many teams on the same rung as the
Cavs last season moved up a notch in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Additions: F Johnny Newman (free agent, Nuggets), F Antonio Lang
(free agent, Heat), G Litterial Green (free agent, Bucks).
</P>
<P>
   Key Losses: Scott Brooks (free agent, Clippers).
</P>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE HORNETS
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Anthony Mason for the season with a ruptured biceps
tendon is a devastating blow. Gone are Vlade Divac and Matt Geiger,
7-footers who can bang and occasionally score. Derrick Coleman was
the major signing, and if he is n shape, there is no telling how
far Charlotte goes. But with Glen Rice lost to elbow surgery for 25
games and now Mason, the Hornets are another of those Eastern
Conference teams that takes a step backward.
</P>
<P>
   Additions: F Derrick Coleman (free agent, 76ers), F Chucky Brown
(free agent, Hawks), G Eldridge Recasner (free agent, Hawks), F
Chuck Person (free agent, Spurs), G Ricky Davis (draft, No. 21,
Iowa).
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO BULLS
</P>
<P>
   In less than a month, they've become the NBA equivalent of the
Florida Marlins, a once-proud championship team unrecognizable by
their new roster. Michael Jordan's retirement set off the most
disturbing domino effect the Bulls have ever seen. Toni Kukoc and
Ron Harper are back, and the acquisition of Brent Barry will make
it entertaining. So they're not world beaters anymore. But, hey,
they can still give Toronto a decent run.
</P>
<P>
   Additions: G Brent Barry (free agent, Heat), F Mark Bryant (free
agent, Suns), C Andrew Lang (trade with Bucks), G Corey Benjamin
(draft, No. 28, Oregon State), F Roy Rogers (trade with Rockets), C
Priest Lauderdale (free agent, Nuggets).
</P>
<P>
   Key Losses: G Michael Jordan (retired), F Scottie Pippen (traded
to Houston), F Dennis Rodman (free agent), G Steve Kerr (traded to
San Antonio), C Luc Longley (traded to Phoenix), F Scott Burrell
(free agent), G Jud Buechler (free agent, Detroit), C Joe Kleine
(free agent, Phoenix).
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO RAPTORS
</P>
<P>
   They have some so-so pieces, but none of them fit together.
Charles Oakley could complement an offensive threat in the post,
but Kevin Willis? The rookie Vince Carter could use a solid,
pass-first point guard to lead the fastbreak; Dee Brown is not that
player. Getting Michael Stewart to block shots in place of Marcus
Camby was smart, yet the Raptors have too many veterans on the
downside of their careers to make a playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   Additions: C Kevin Willis (trade with Rockets), F Charles Oakley
(trade with Knicks), G Vince Carter (draft, No. 5, North Carolina),
C Michael Stewart (free agent, Kings), G Micheal Williams (trade
with Timberwolves).
</P>
<P>
   Key Losses: F Marcus Camby (traded to New York), F Gary Trent
(free agent, Mavericks), C Sharone Wright (retired), G Chauncey
Billups (traded to Denver).

   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST DIVISION:
</P>
<P>
   UTAH JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone and John Stockton often seem closer to retirement
than a championship, but they manage to somehow get the Jazz
peaking by the playoffs. Stockton, who turns 37 in March, will
continue to split minutes with Howard Eisley. Bryon Russell needs
to have a monster start, especially while Greg Foster rehabilitates
a broken ankle. Utah went on an archeological dig for their one
off-season acquisition, digging up former Jazz forward Thurl
Bailey. Jeff Hornacek, like Malone, is 35. They're old, cranky and,
yes, still the best passing team in basketball. Dead quiet after
Michael Jordan stole its soul the last two seasons, the Delta
Center will finally host a championship party for the home team in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   Additions: Thurl Bailey (free agent).
</P>
<P>
   Key Losses: C Antoine Carr (free agent, Houston), F Chris Morris
(free agent).
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON ROCKETS
</P>
<P>
   They lost one Hall of Famer (Clyde Drexler to retirement) only
to bring in another (Scottie Pippen). The Rockets have not rebuilt
as much as they have reloaded. But so much depends on whether
Pippen, Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley can get through the
season injury-free. Losing Mario Elie to free agency was key. Like
the Knicks' Charlie Ward, Matt Maloney is more of a serviceable
point guard than a floor general. But with three of the Top 50
players of all time to complement him, he may be enough to get
Houston back to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Additions: F Scottie Pippen (trade with Bulls), G Michael
Dickerson (draft, No. 14, Arizona), G Bryce Drew (draft, No. 14,
Valparaiso), C Antoine Carr (free agent, Jazz), F Anthony Miller
(free agent, Hawks).
</P>
<P>
   Key Losses: G Clyde Drexler (retired), G Mario Elie (free agent,
San Antonio), C Kevin Willis (traded to Toronto).
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO SPURS
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, they upgraded their roster with Steve Kerr,
Mario Elie and second-year point guard Antonio Daniels, acquired in
a trade with Vancouver. But Tim Duncan and David Robinson still
don't have that offensive-minded backcourt player to alleviate
scoring pressure. They're deeper than a year ago, and Elie brings
the kind of attitude and edge the Spurs need in the playoffs. But
getting past the Lakers and Utah is too much to ask this season.
</P>
<P>
   Additions: G Steve Kerr (trade with Bulls), G Mario Elie (free
agent, Rockets), G Antonio Daniels (trade with Grizzlies), F Jerome
Kersey (free agent, SuperSonics).
</P>
<P>
   Key Losses: F Chuck Person (traded to Chicago), F Carl Herrera
(traded to Vancouver), G Vinny Del Negro (free agent, Milwaukee), G
Jaren Jackson (free agent).
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES
</P>

   Still phenoms after two and three seasons, respectively, Stephon
Marbury and Kevin Garnett are must-see TV. And bringing back the
underrated center Dean Garrett from Denver and getting point guard
Bobby Jackson was a nice off-season move. But the losses hurt. If
it wasn't Tom Gugliotta spurning the franchise for less money in
Phoenix, losing clubhouse sages like Terry Porter and Sam Mitchell
_ veterans who talked to and nurtured the young stars _ was also a
blow. If the kiddie corps T'Wolves have one thing going for them,
it's that they won't get tired playing 50 games in 90 days. The big
question for Minnesota is whether they can re-sign Marbury by
season's end.

   DENVER NUGGETS
</P>
<P>
   In one of the great off-season makeovers of the past decade, GM
Dan Issel put a team with more structural problems than Mir back in
playoff contention. Nick Van Exel and the return of Antonio McDyess
make for one of the most lethal offensive combinations in the West.
The Kansas rookie Raef LaFrentz will help immediately along with
the back-up point guard Chauncey Billups. Overcoming the culture of
losing should not be that difficult. As for making the playoffs,
that's a long shot.

<P>
   DALLAS MAVERICKS
</P>
<P>
   With all Don Nelson's tinkering, the GM's best move may have
been flying to Germany with the owner Ross Perot Jr. and getting a
first-hand look at Dirk Nowitzki, the 6-foot-9 forward who shoots
the 3-point bomb with aplomb. Nowitzki has already impressed in two
preseason games, and will make an immediate impact on a club in
need of help. Steve Nash was another good acquisition. The
Mavericks have more talent, but chemistry will take a while.

   Locking up Shareef Abdur-Rahim through 2005 helped the

   LOS ANGELES LAKERS
</P>

   Tired of the young kids getting uppity, Jerry West finally went
out and acquired veteran leadership. Although ancient by point
guard standards, Derek Harper's maturity could be more vital than
his minutes in the Lakers' continued ascension to the finals.
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant will try and resuscitate NBC's
ratings after the loss of you-know-who, and Eddie Jones is still
great bait for a veteran power like, say, Charles Oakley, at the
trading deadline. Either way, the Lakers acquit themselves much
better in the conference finals than they did a year ago. Whether
they can get past the Jazz is another story.

   SEATTLE SUPERSONICS

<P>
   Hersey Hawkins' consecutive starting string of 431 games _ the
league's longest current streak _ is about to end. Coach Paul
Westphal, back from NBA exile, is more comfortable with Billy Owens
at the shooting guard. Gary Payton is better than anyone at his
position and Vin Baker is not far behind as a power forward. But
the Sonics simply don't have the muscle _ a physical presence to
collect rebounds and fouls _ in order to advance to the conference
finals. Unless they trade for a veteran power forward, like, say,
Charles Oakley.

   They re-signed Arvydas Sabonis and Damon Stoudamire, and for the
most part have rid themselves of their knucklehead image. Rasheed
Wallace and Isaiah Rider can be combustible at times, but their
talent is unquestioned. The real advantage for the Blazers is that

   Quietly, GM Geoff Petrie remade the franchise into a playoff

Vlade Divac and Corliss Williamson give the Kings a formidable
frontline. Throw in `97 draft pick Predrag Stojakovic, whom they
convinced to leave Greece, and the rookie point guard Jason
Williams, and Sacramento may be on their way back to the

team, the second round is not an impossibility.

   So much for the owner Jerry Colangelo's sales pitch, the one
about warm weather, a team that takes care of its players and
always strives for the finals. Scottie Pippen didn't buy it.
Neither did Antonio McDyess. When the top free agents went
elsewhere, Phoenix was forced to pin its hopes on Tom Gugliotta,
whose experience as a franchise player is nil and none. Luc Longley
was a decent pick up, and you can't discount Jason Kidd's
development into one of the game's best all-around players and Rex
Chapman is good for drama. But the Suns don't have the ammunition
to go deep into the playoffs, if they get there.

MIAMI KNOCKS OFF ST. JOHN'S AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ St. John's coach Mike Jarvis had said that an
early-season loss to Miami was the only game which had disappointed
him this season, because his team had shown none of the emotion or
tenacity that has defined its run to the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden, the Red Storm turned
in an eerily similar performance, letting the undermanned
Hurricanes control much of the game _ and the boards _ and allowing
their offense to devolve into Ron Artest bullying his way to the
basket. Even a 14-2 run that briefly showed the familiar St. John's
spark was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Miami beat St. John's, 73-70, and moved into a tie for second
place in the Big East with the Red Storm, both at 8-3. Miami
improved to 14-5 overall, while St. John's fell to 17-6. St. John's
has lost three of its last four games and is 3-5 at the Garden this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Artest had 22 points, but he was miserable from the free-throw
line and missed one of two free throws that could have tied the
game in the closing seconds. Miami was led by Johnny Hemsley who
had 29 points, including a first-half run that seemed to stun St.
John's.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes entered the game needing a good health plan
almost as much as a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Michael Simmons was back at home still suffering
from a concussion sustained against Pittsburgh on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jennings, a point guard-forward who left that Pittsburgh
game after just seconds with back spasms and who had not practiced
since, began the game on the bench. In fact, Miami, ranked No. 25
in the nation, had just eight scholarship players available.
</P>
<P>
   But they were enough to drive St. John's to one of its most
disjointed halves of the season. The Red Storm led, 19-9, with 11
minutes 50 seconds left in the first half, as Miami struggled with
its offense without Simmons, and it appeared that whatever funk
might have lingered after St. John's heartbreaking loss to
Connecticut Saturday would be wiped away by an exercise in revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Artest had claimed that at the end of Miami's victory earlier
this season, he saw players laughing and pointing at St. John's
players, and he vowed that things would be different this time.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis has pointed to that Miami game as the most lackadaisical
effort of St. John's season _ the only game when he has been
disappointed in his team _ and there was little in the rest of the
first half that could have pleased Jarvis. Playing a flat,
disorganized game, St. John's let Miami go on a 12-3 run _ Miami
coach Leonard Hamilton had inserted Jennings at the point with
18:02 left _ highlighted by eight points by Hemsley, who scored 18
in the first half. When Miami's pro prospect, Tim James, who had
been held scoreless for the first 13 minutes of the game by Artest,
finally scored, he tied the game, 27-27.
</P>
<P>
   A three-pointer by Erick Barkley gave St. John's the lead again.
A Lavor Postell steal gave St. John's a 3-on-1 break, but he missed
the layup. Barkley grabbed the offensive rebound _ a shocking
rarity for St. John's in the first half _ and put in the layup.
</P>
<P>
   But St. John's lack of power on the boards _ the Red Storm was
outrebounded, 23-14, in the first half, and even more unusually was
outhustled on the offensive boards, 8-3 _ which contributed to
another Miami run. The Hurricanes ran off nine straight points,
including five of James' 10 first-half points, and Miami took its
first lead of the game, 36-34, with 2:56 left.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a Bootsy Thornton three-pointer with 32 seconds left in
the half _ he had 10 points in the first half _ the Red Storm
trailed by 43-39 at halftime.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   St. John's senior forward TYRONE GRANT, who has not played since
he broke a bone in his right wrist against Seton Hall on Jan. 9,
will have the wrist re-evaluated Thursday. Even if the hard cast
Grant has worn since Jan. 19 is removed, it will likely take
several weeks for Grant to be ready to play again. Entering
Wednesday night's game, Grant was still the team's leading
rebounder, even though he had missed six games before Wednesday's
matchup against Miami. He had been averaging 11.5 points and 8.9
rebounds a game before the injury... . St. John's plays two
straight road games for the only time this season when it visits
Pittsburgh Saturday and West Virginia on Tuesday... . RON
ARTEST &UR;  &LR; was added to the list of 40 candidates for the John Wooden
award as the nation's best player.  &QL;

JEWISH GROUP PICKS CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronald S. Lauder was elected chairman of the largest umbrella
organization of American Jewish groups on Wednesday despite
questions about his close ties to Israel's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Lauder, the cosmetics heir and philanthropist, received the
support of 40 member organizations, with four abstentions and no
votes against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite what people might have read in the press, today's vote
showed the Jewish community's desire for unity and consensus,''
said Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the umbrella
group, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Wednesday's vote, nearly half the group's 55 members
had raised questions about whether Lauder had provided financial
support to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An article published last week by The Jewish Week in New York
and Haaretz in Israel, citing tax records and anonymous sources,
reported that Lauder had assisted Netanyahu in several ways, from
retaining an American campaign strategist to giving money to
right-wing causes in Israel. Foreign contributions to political
candidates are illegal under Israeli law, although indirect
donations are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Lauder denied the allegations, and the conference's nominating
committee held an additional session with him on Monday to question
him about the reports. ``We felt he clearly answered the questions
that were posed,'' Hoenlein said.

DIXON, CAPPS BACK AT WINTERNATIONALS

<P>
   POMONA _ Defending event champions Larry Dixon and Ron Capps top
the list of competitors today when the National Hot Rod Association
begins its 25th championship season with the 39th Winternationals
at Pomona Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   First-round qualifying is scheduled for 2 p.m. The event runs
through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited to go back to Pomona as defending champion,''
said Capps, who teamed with Dixon to give team owner Don ``The
Snake'' Prudhomme a victory in Funny Car and Top Fuel at last
year's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winternationals are an old race, the oldest (track) on the
circuit. It's Snake's home track, so it's a big race for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Capps, who beat Tim Wilkerson in a tire-smoking battle in last
year's Funny Car final, should receive challenges from eight-time
Winston champion John Force, Whit Bazermore and Cruz Pedregon.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Oak High School graduate Randy Anderson is hoping a
successful weekend will allow him to attain sponsorship for the
remaining 21 events on the national tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about the weekend,'' said Anderson, who
recently signed a two-race deal with Oakwood Interiors, an
Ontario-based furniture manufacture. ``This will be, by far, my
strongest team ever. We were able to take some veteran crew guys
from my sister's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have her best guys, so as far as crew and parts, I've never
been stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Anderson, team owner and Randy's father, was unable to
secure sponsorship for his daughter, Shelly Anderson. Brad will
serve as crew chief with help from Gary Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran crew chief Jim Dunn, who also is fielding his own team,
will serve as an advisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be an outstanding team,'' Randy Anderson said.
``Obviously, we don't have a budget like Force, but on the short
term, we should be very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorites in Top Fuel include Dixon, two-time defending series
champion Gary Scelzi and veteran Kenny Bernstein, who won the
Winston Finals on this track this past November.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Yates, who won Winston titles in 1996 and '97, is defending
event champion in Pro Stock.

IOC ROLE ON DOPING IS QUESTIONED
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By PAUL L. MONTGOMERY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Participants at the international
conference on sports doping expressed broad support Wednesday for
creation of a worldwide enforcement agency, but there was
considerable disagreement on its composition and powers as the
International Olympic Committee continued to face attacks on its
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, a Canadian lawyer and IOC vice president who is
drafting a proposal on the agency to be considered by the
conference on Thursday, acknowledged that the IOC has had to scale
back its plans to be at the center of the agency. Pound said
national governments would have a much larger role than
anticipated, a reflection of the widespread skepticism about the
IOC's leadership ability in the wake of the burgeoning bribery
scandals involving host cities.
</P>
<P>
   The contentiousness went beyond just the makeup of the agency.
There was further division over the severity of punishment for
athletes caught cheating, pitting the IOC against some of the
federations that govern individual sports internationally. And the
IOC executive board was challenged on its decision to change the
voting procedure for selecting host cities.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said that even if the new drug agency was approved in
principle Thursday, it would be several months before its
composition could be planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a wonderful opportunity to marry the public side and
the sports side in this agency,'' he said. ``But it will take time
for the governments to work out the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, government representatives from the United States and
most of the countries of Western Europe called for reform of the
IOC so that it can regain credibility to take part in the
antidoping effort. Pound said it was possible the new agency, if
approved, would have as much as 50 percent representation from
public authorities, whereas before the conference the IOC had
anticipated no more than 20 percent. It was an indication of the
increasing inclination of governments to take antidoping
enforcement out of the hands of sports bodies, as happened last
summer in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on behalf of the 15-member European Union, British
Sports Minister Tony Banks rejected the proposal giving the IOC a
leading role in the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Other items also remained to be resolved on the conference's
final day. The IOC and many athletes' groups want a minimum
two-year ban from competition for those testing positive for
performance-enhancing drugs. The international soccer, cycling and
tennis federations, however, have said the ban is too long and have
refused to follow IOC policy. Keba Mbaye of Senegal, a former World
Court judge who heads the IOC group studying juridical aspects of
doping, indicated Wednesday that exceptions would have to be made
to the two-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Coe of Britain, two-time Olympic 1,500 meter champion
and now a Conservative party politician, said authorities should
not accept anything less than a two-year ban.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, a number of IOC members attending the
conference expressed displeasure with new regulations promulgated
by the IOC last week to take away their voting rights for sites of
future Games. Voting by the full membership on sites has been
regarded as the prime cause of the corruption scandal, and the IOC
wants to restrict selection to a 15-member group.
</P>
<P>
   Some members expressed resentment that the whole voting
membership was punished for the actions of a few. The proposal is
scheduled to come up for a vote at an emergency IOC session March
17-18. A two-thirds vote of the 106 members is needed for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for the full membership to go against leadership
positions. But Italian IOC member Mario Pescante was quoted as
saying: ``It's impossible the General Assembly will approve this
proposal. ``I'm sure the executive board will have to find a new
solution before then.''  &QL;

<P>
   As doctors grow angrier over managed care, the effort to
unionize physicians has sharply accelerated in recent months, with
more and more unions scrambling to recruit them and thousands of
doctors signing up.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a dozen unions _ including the International
Association of Machinists and the American Federation of Teachers _
are competing for them. Worried about being left out, even the
American Medical Association, long opposed to doctors' forming
unions, is setting up a unit to do collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians in New York, New Jersey, California, Connecticut and
at least 10 other states are moving to unionize at such a rate that
the number of doctors in unions is expected by labor experts to
grow by 15 percent or more each year. Already, medical experts
estimate, about 35,000 doctors, or 5 percent of the nation's
physicians, belong to unions, up from about 25,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the trend gains momentum, HM0s are often fighting back by
asserting that doctors are independent contractors and therefore
not allowed to unionize. Hospitals that fear lower profits have
also fought unionization, and the Justice Department has opposed
one organizing effort on antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the union activity is among salaried staff doctors at
hospitals, both public and private. Unions for these physicians, as
well as residents and interns, are negotiating contracts with the
hospitals that cover wages, hours and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many doctors in private practice are joining
unions to give themselves more expertise and power when they
negotiate with HMOs. While most of the doctors are seeking help
with their own individual contracts, joining unions to get advice
on specific provisions in HMO agreements, others are pushing
increasingly to have unions bargain with HMOs on behalf of dozens
or even hundreds of practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 90 percent of the nation's physicians having at
least one contract with a managed care company, many doctors cite a
loss in their decision-making authority and a drop in
reimbursements in explaining why they want to join a union. Medical
experts expect the trend to gain further momentum because 80
percent of recent medical school graduates are taking salaried jobs
with HMOs, clinics or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming geometrically accelerated,'' said Barry
Liebowitz, president of the Doctors Council, a union that
represents 3,400 doctors, most of them attending physicians at New
York City's municipal hospitals. ``Medicine has gone from a
mom-and-pop operation to corporatization, which has left the
provider, the doctor, out of medical decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   While a handful of doctors' unions have existed for decades, new
ones have formed in recent years and some have merged with much
larger, nonmedical unions. The Doctors Council is being wooed as a
merger partner by several million-member unions, including the
American Federation of Teachers, and is expected to make its
decision this month.
</P>
<P>
   But the push to unionize tens of thousands of additional doctors
faces several obstacles. One is the federal government. The
Department of Justice has filed an antitrust suit against a group
of doctors in Delaware, accusing them of conspiring to restrain
trade by joining a union and refusing to accept lower reimbursement
rates ordered by a managed-care organization.
</P>
<P>
   Also, under federal labor law, only workers classified as
employees have a right to form unions and bargain collectively.
This has many HMOs battling unionization by insisting that the
doctors who work for them are not employees, but independent
contractors with their own practices.
</P>
<P>
   In one battle, more than 500 New Jersey doctors doing work for
AmeriHealth Corp. say the HMO controls them to such a degree that
they should be declared part-time employees with a right to
unionize. In mid-January, the National Labor Relations Board's
office in Philadelphia completed weeks of hearings. It is expected
to release a decision later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at them as independent businessmen and contractors,''
said James Paynard, senior director for corporate communications at
AmeriHealth. ``They have their own contracts. They have their own
employees, and they run their own business. I don't see what
benefits patients would reap from the unionization of doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle is image: Many doctors believe unions are for
blue-collar workers, not professionals. And, having seen doctors
and interns strike several times in New York City since the early
1980s, many physicians say they believe going on strike would
violate the Hippocratic oath by denying care to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the pressure to do it, but as a physician, I
wouldn't think of joining a union,'' said Sheryl Sun, an internist
who opposes a unionization drive where she works, at the Kaiser
Permanente Clinic in Santa Clara, Calif. ``With a union, the
ultimate weapon is striking and that's something as a physician,
ethically, I'm never going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors like Brian J. Moore, an internist in Bernardsville,
N.J., who supports the machinists in their push to organize 700
doctors in northern New Jersey, defend the role of unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way medicine is going right now and the way patients are
being treated by managed care is just terrible, and someone has to
stand up for proper health care,'' Moore said. ``I don't see a
physicians' union particularly like unions of the past, where we're
going to strike and carry placards. It's primarily to get the
message out that we have to improve health care.''
</P>
<P>
   One California doctor who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said he was considering joining a union because his HMO wanted him
to see eight patients an hour, limiting him to 7{ minutes per
visit. The doctors at 46 primary care clinics in the Medalia
HealthCare system in Washington State decided to unionize after the
HMO ordered many of them to schedule 36 hours of appointments each
week, up from 32 hours. The doctors said they did not have enough
time left for essential backup work, like completing paperwork,
analyzing lab results and calling HMO officials for various
approvals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care is bad for people, and it's bad for doctors, but
it's good for us as a union,'' said Robert Weinmann, president of
the Union of American Physicians and Dentists, a union with 5,000
members that is based in California. ``For us, it's the chief tool
for organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One bitter unionization struggle is taking place at Lincoln
Hospital in the Bronx. The unionization drive took off in July
1997, when hospital management laid off several dozen doctors and
the remaining physicians complained about shabby treatment and
being overworked. Tensions worsened when the hospital dismissed
four doctors. The union involved in the drive, United Salaried
Physicians and Dentists, said the doctors were fired for backing
the union; management said they were dismissed for insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Lincoln's 250 doctors voted to unionize, but the
ballots have been impounded pending the hospital's appeal to the
labor board, which is based on the premise that many doctors are
supervisors without a right to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   In their turn, unions are turning to Congress to pass
legislation that could accelerate unionizing by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbed by the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the
doctors in Delaware, the American Medical Association and
traditional unions are pressing Congress to enact an antitrust
exemption that would let doctors band together to negotiate with
HMOs even when the doctors are considered independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In Delaware last August, the Justice Department charged most of
the state's orthopedic surgeons with an illegal boycott and
conspiring to raise health care prices after they joined a union.
The doctors had dropped out of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware,
saying they would not accept its reduced reimbursement rates. The
Justice Department asserted that their action forced consumers to
pay more for orthopedic services.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Seddon, executive director of the Federation of Physicians
and Dentists, the union the Delaware doctors joined, said, ``Here
you have an antitrust law that was passed to control Rockefellers
and Carnegies, but is being used against doctors trying to hold
onto their practices.''
</P>
<P>
   To skirt the antitrust barrier, many doctors are forming
independent practice associations, essentially large group
practices that allow physicians to bargain together with HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to tap doctor discontent over managed care, several
large, nonmedical-unions have moved aggressively over the past two
years to persuade doctors' unions to merge with them. Some smaller
doctors' unions have agreed to the mergers to take advantage of the
deep pockets the big unions have to finance organizing drives.
</P>
<P>
   The 9,000-member Committee of Interns and Residents, the
nation's oldest doctors' union, which was founded in 1957 in New
York City, merged with the 1.3 million-member Service Employees
International Union in 1997. And the Union of American Physicians
and Dentists, a 26-year-old, 5,000-member organization based in
Oakland, Calif., joined up in 1997 with the 1.3 million-member
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Other major unions have joined the fray. In addition to the
machinists' union, which is trying to organize doctors in northern
New Jersey, the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which
normally represents supermarket workers, is recruiting the
AmeriHealth doctors in New Jersey. The Office and Professional
Employees International Union now has 10,000 podiatrists around the
nation as well as the 2,000 medical doctors from the MDNY health
maintenance group on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   And the AMA wants a piece of the action. ``We're moving full
speed ahead,'' said Dr. Donald Palmisano, a New Orleans surgeon on
the association's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA, which has about half the nation's 700,000 doctors as
members, is warning them not to sign up with other groups, saying
that if other members of those unions, like nurses' aides, strike
at a hospital, the doctors might be forced to honor the picket
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AMA believes it is preferable for physicians to form
independent bargaining units that are not affiliated with
traditional trade unions.'' Palmisano said. ``Physicians must not
engage in strike or any other tactic that interferes with patient
care.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Goodwin, who is the president of the office
employees union, said doctors should not look to the AMA for help
in bargaining: ``The AMA has not delivered for them and allowed
this managed care thing to get out of their control. Their fees
have dropped so tremendously over the last eight years, so now
they're reaching out to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors share the AMA's fears about strikes by physicians.
Such strikes are rare, but they have happened, for the most part in
New York City. In 1991, attending doctors at Woodhull Hospital in
Brooklyn walked out for a week, while the Committee of Interns and
Residents staged a nine-day strike in 1990 at Bronx-Lebanon
Hospital and a weeklong walkout in 1981 against seven city-owned
hospitals and two private hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The union said patient care hardly suffered because other
doctors covered or patients were moved to other hospitals. But
hospital officials said care was hurt badly and that the strikers
had violated their oaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of violation is it when the employer creates
conditions when you cannot take care of patients as best you can,
but can only pretend to do so?'' said Weinmann, president of the
Union of American Physicians and Dentists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that cause doctors to violate the Hippocratic oath? And
what about the insurance companies who don't take the oath and are
often cutting corners on providing appropriate care?''

JUDGE'S RULING FAVORS PEPPERIDGE FARM'S GOLDFISH OVER NABISCO'S 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bottom line: the Goldfish won.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision that could have broad ramifications for children's
lunches everywhere, a U.S. District judge in Manhattan ordered
Nabisco Inc. Wednesday not to sell a new line of crackers worth
millions of dollars because some of its shapes too closely
resembled Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Shira A. Scheindlin also blocked Nabisco from beginning
its campaign next week to sell and promote the new product, called
CatDog, which included cheese crackers in the shape of fish, bones
and an unusual half-cat, half-dog character called CatDog, all part
of a tie-in with the Nickelodeon program of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco, which already has manufactured $3.4 million worth of
the CatDog brand crackers, said it would immediately appeal the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, Pepperidge Farm's attempt to keep our product off the
market smells rather fishy to us,'' said Hank Sandbach, a Nabisco
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   No CatDog crackers have been shipped to retailers yet, Nabisco
says.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperidge Farm, a division of the Campbell Soup Co., has sold
more than $500 million worth of Goldfish cracker products in the
United States over the last four years, the decision said. The
Goldfish product, measured in sales dollars, is the No. 1-ranking
cheese snack cracker in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperidge Farm said in a statement that the decision recognized
that it ``has carefully built the Goldfish shapes cracker into an
icon brand which consumers of all ages recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Pepperidge Farm told the judge that while adults buy
the Goldfish, it is usually at the urging of children. They argued
that Nabisco had chosen a fish-shaped product that would confuse
children and would also dilute the power of Pepperidge Farm's
famous brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many shapes around,'' Ethan Horwitz, a lawyer
for Pepperidge Farm, told the judge, and many ways in which Nabisco
could ``properly go after us within the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, they could not choose ``a fish that's almost
identical to ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco, which also makes Ritz, Cheese Nips, Triscuits and
Oreos, contended that it had not infringed on the Goldfish brand
and that Pepperidge Farm's fish shape should not be legally
protectable.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Scheindlin decided that Pepperidge Farm had not proven
that Nabisco's CatDog product would confuse Goldfish devotees, but
she concluded that CatDog would blur and harm the Goldfish brand.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case turned on modern-day principles of
intellectual property law, in court last week Judge Scheindlin
allowed lawyers for Pepperidge Farm to introduce evidence the
old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to pour it into a bowl, if that's all right with
you, Your Honor,'' Horwitz said, holding a box of Goldfish
crackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, pour it into a bowl,'' the judge ordered.

LAWYERS ASSAIL GUN COMPANIES IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS OF TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for relatives of six people killed with
illegally obtained handguns presented closing arguments Wednesday
in a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, saying that 25 gun
manufacturers were liable for the slayings because ``negligent
marketing'' practices ``put the guns into the hands of the
shooters.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers held that it did not matter which companies actually
made the guns used in the killings, because the distribution
practices of all the companies fostered widespread illegal
trafficking in their products, creating a ``toxic waste flow'' of
illicitly available guns.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the manufacturers presented a sharply different
view of the month's worth of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to hold manufacturers of legitimately produced products
responsible for the acts of these outlaws'' _ those who trafficked
illegally in guns and those who pulled the triggers _ is ``simply
wrong,'' one of the industry lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Contending that the plaintiffs' case was built on ``smoke and
generalities,'' the lawyer, James Dorr, told the jury that the
plaintiffs had presented ``no evidence that negligence by any
manufacturer was the proximate cause of these shootings.'' And he
asserted that their collective-liability theory was the equivalent
of holding all automakers liable for an injury caused by a drunken
driver in one car.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought by the slaying victims' relatives and a
seventh person who was severely wounded with an illegally obtained
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it is the first suit to come to trial that
charged that industrywide negligent distribution by the nation's
gun producers made them collectively liable for shootings with guns
that they had legally made and sold but that ended up in the hands
of criminals, youths and others not authorized to have them.
</P>
<P>
   The jury was expected to begin deliberating Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being watched across the country because the
plaintiffs' argument is similar to contentions in lawsuits that
Chicago and other cities have recently filed, or plan to file,
against the gun industry, much as states have sued the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The seven shootings at issue in the Brooklyn trial took place in
the New York City area in 1993 and 1994 and involved robberies,
disputes and, apparently, one accident. A lawyer for the
plaintiffs, Denise Dunleavy, suggested varying amounts of damages
for the plaintiffs, should the jury find the companies liable. The
suggestions ranged from several hundred thousand dollars for the
mother of one victim to as much as ``7, 8, 10 million'' for Steven
Fox, a Queens teen-ager who survived the apparently accidental
shooting with a bullet still in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   In only one of the seven shootings was a gun recovered, but
another plaintiffs' lawyer, Elisa Barnes, told the jurors that ``it
simply doesn't matter because in this illegal market, all the guns
are the same.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that economic and statistical consultants for her
side had testified that 90 percent of handguns used in crimes in
New York state in recent years had originally been sold in other
states, often Southern states with weaker gun control laws. She
held that the manufacturers had regularly oversupplied dealers in
the states with weak gun laws and that many of the excess guns
ended up in the hands of illegal traffickers, who resold them in
states with strong laws, like New York.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Dorr, the defense lawyer, recalled testimony in
which an economist had charged that the oversupply argument was
based on flawed statistics. He told the jurors that ``there is no
oversupply'' of guns to various states and that the criminal
trafficking across state lines ``is not connected to anything in
the lawful marketing'' by the gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, he said, cooperate as much as they can with law
enforcement agencies in fighting illegal trafficking.

A FRELINGHUYSEN FOR EVERY IMPEACHMENT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   History won't leave the Frelinghuysens alone.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Rep. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, a
moderate Republican, voted to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, his father, Peter H.B. Frelinghuysen, who was also a
moderate Republican representative from New Jersey, called for the
resignation of Richard M. Nixon as the president faced certain
impeachment by the House.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1868, Rodney Frelinghuysen's great-great-grandfather,
Sen. Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen, a radical Republican from
New Jersey, voted to convict President Andrew Johnson in his Senate
trial after Johnson was impeached by the House.
</P>
<P>
   In short, if a president faces impeachment, a Frelinghuysen is
on hand, although no doubt Johnson, Nixon and Clinton wished the
Frelinghuysens had been somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been around a long time,'' said Rodney Frelinghuysen,
the present heir of one of America's most enduring political
dynasties. Although each impeachment case was different _ and only
Peter went against his party _ both Rodney and Frederick spoke of
the process as duty.
</P>
<P>
   (Frederick, 1868: ``Walking along this narrow pathway, with
perils on either side, one is only secure as he rests his hand on
the firm support of duty.'' Rodney, 1998: ``Members of Congress
have a duty to consider President Clinton's conduct . . . we should
not change course now simply because we are all tired of the
scandal or because polls reflect the president as popular and
impeachment as not.'')
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen said he didn't consult his ancestor's speech
before making his own, meaning that the common theme of duty could
be the result of the family Zeitgeist, standard political rhetoric,
or both. In any case, it was probably inevitable that three
Frelinghuysens should judge three trouble-prone presidents, given
that there have been Frelinghuysens in Congress for 50 of its 210
years.
</P>
<P>
   The family produced four U. S. senators, although no major
legislation with the family name. One of the senators, Frederick
Theodore, became secretary of state under President Chester A.
Arthur. Another, Frederick, was a colonel in the Revolutionary War
and fought at the battles of Trenton, Princeton and Monmouth. The
first Frelinghuysen in America was Theodorus Jacobus, a Dutch
Reformed Church evangelist who in 1720 settled in what is now the
horse country of Somerset County, N.J. _ a part of Rep.
Frelinghuysen's district today.
</P>
<P>
   Does the current Frelinghuysen in Congress feel burdened by the
family legacy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't,'' he said on Tuesday in his office on Capitol Hill.
``Either I would have embraced it, or I would have rebelled. And I
chose to somewhat embrace it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen is 52, agreeable and cautious, and you might not
hear him come into a room, although on Tuesday he had on a bright
red tie with skunks and badgers that was given to him by his wife.
His voting record in favor of mass transit for commuters and
wetlands preservation puts him exactly where most New Jersey voters
want him. He was first elected in 1994, is on the Appropriations
Committee and has a low profile on Capitol Hill. He has wanted to
be a member of Congress since he was 6, when he sat on his father's
lap on the floor of the House and campaigned with him in the
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father could never remember anybody's name,'' Frelinghuysen
said. ``And he used to say, `You go over there and get something to
eat, and when you come back I'll have figured out who everybody is,
and I can introduce you.' So my first job was to get something to
eat, and give my father some elbow room.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frelinghuysens have their roots in what is now the affluent
suburb of Morristown _ Frelinghuysen has known a fellow moderate
Republican from the neighboring horse country, Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman, all his life _ but Frelinghuysen himself grew up largely
in Washington during his father's 22 years in Congress. He lived in
the heart of the city's establishment in Georgetown, in the large
1799 federal brick house now owned by Sally Quinn and Benjamin C.
Bradlee, the former editor of The Washington Post. Frelinghuysen
went to school at St. Albans along with Vice President Al Gore,
then to boarding school at St. Mark's and to Hobart College.
</P>
<P>
   His main departure from the traditional path came after college
graduation, in 1969, when he was drafted. He served with the Army's
93rd Engineer Battalion in the Mekong Delta, and remembers it with
bitterness: ``We were the group that built the roads by day that
the Vietcong traveled at night.'' He also formed clear opinions
about his commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember when President Nixon basically said, `All
troops have been withdrawn from the delta.' And I said, `Wait, I'm
still here.' I had never had a particularly warm feeling about
Richard Nixon, and it didn't get any warmer after my service.''
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen said he voted to impeach President Clinton not
under pressure from the Republican leadership, but because he
thought the president had lied to the grand jury.

   NEW YORK _ For several months, administrators, teachers,
students and alumni of Polytechnic University in Brooklyn have been
debating a pleasant problem: how to spend $175 million. There are
proposals for 25 new professorships and plans for a new dormitory,
or a new academic building, or both. The graduate program may be
radically changed.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is final, and there is plenty of disagreement, but for a
university that once faced bankruptcy, the possibilities are
stunning. Maybe too stunning. Echoing a concern shared by many at
Polytechnic over how best to spend the millions, provost Ivan
Frisch said simply: ``Now comes really the hardest part. Where does
the money go?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a question reverberating across the borough. Like a heavy
snow in an unexpected place, money fell on Brooklyn last month, a
whole lot of it. Five institutions, none accustomed to lavish
donations, will receive almost half of the $750 million estate of a
Brooklyn Heights couple whose quiet lives gave no hint of their
enormous wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Othmer, a Polytechnic professor who died in 1995, and his
wife, Mildred, who died last April, began investing in the 1960s
with a hometown friend from Omaha named Warren Buffett. Buffett is
now one of the world's richest people. The Othmers did nicely, too.
</P>
<P>
   Without children and with few relatives, the Othmers bequeathed
most of their fortune to the institutions that shaped their lives,
in Brooklyn and beyond. Their alma mater, the University of
Nebraska at Lincoln, will receive $133 million. Planned Parenthood
in Manhattan, where Mrs. Othmer sat on the board, will get $65
million. The Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia will
receive more than $100 million to build a library in Othmer's
field, chemical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   But no place will feel the money as much as Brooklyn. The bulk
of the donations arrived in January at the five beneficiaries, all
important institutional pillars of the borough and all financially
needy. Consider that the five _ Polytechnic, Long Island College
Hospital, the Brooklyn Historical Society, the Plymouth Church of
the Pilgrims and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden _ will receive more
than $340 million. By comparison, if Brooklyn's application to
become an empowerment zone is approved, the federal benefits will
total $330 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the institutions realize that such a large donation
will probably never come again, so the challenge is to turn the
money into what Polytechnic officials call ``a transforming gift.''
Officials of Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims simply consider it a
gift from God. Once the church where Henry Ward Beecher preached
against slavery, Plymouth Church is now one of a dwindling number
of Congregational churches in New York. The Othmers sat in the same
pew every Sunday, and Mrs. Othmer left the church $10.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, all of the
recipients knew they were included in Mrs. Othmer's will. Some,
like Polytechnic and Long Island College Hospital, had already
received large chunks of money when Othmer died four years ago.
Judith Zuk, president of the botanic garden, said Mrs. Othmer had
volunteered at plant sales, but had done nothing more. Ms. Zuk
confessed she had never heard of Mrs. Othmer until she learned
about the $9.9 million she left the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're absolutely elated,'' Ms. Zuk said. The money will be
placed in the botanic garden's $20 million endowment, generating
additional interest income that should increase the annual
operating budget by $400,000. Among the ideas for the money are
school-based gardening programs and training for public-school
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   If the other four institutions knew that money was on the way,
they were still pleasantly surprised when they learned how much.
Long Island College Hospital, the Brooklyn Historical Society and
Polytechnic all needed money.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Othmers had donated $1 million toward
construction of the Othmer Cancer Center at Long Island College
Hospital, where Othmer had been on the board. But John Wren, the
hospital's board chairman, said Long Island College had had several
budget deficits. Taking bequests from both of the Othmer wills, the
hospital will receive about $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   Its interim president, Peter Kelly, said interest income from
the Othmer money will pay for technological upgrades. Money is also
intended for the nursing program and the operating rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In its landmark building in Brooklyn Heights, the historical
society has a vast, cluttered archive of maps, books and real
estate records, as well as exhibits about Brooklyn past and
present. But if the building is the society's treasure, it is also
a problem: the roof leaks, the elevator doors open between the
first and second floors, and the heating system was last upgraded
in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime board member, Othmer had contributed money to the
society in the past, and the library is named for the couple. But
now, with almost $15 million from Mrs. Othmer's will, the
historical society will close this month and reopen in early 2001
to undergo a $14 million renovation. The city has pledged $4.1
million toward the project, and the historical society has also
begun a three-year fund-raising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While an undetermined amount of Othmer money will go to the
project, Carol Clark, the Brooklyn Historical Society's new
president, said much of it will pay to enhance the library, to
expand educational programs and to create a permanent museum
exhibition entitled, ``Brooklyn Works.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Polytechnic, where Othmer made his name as a
chemical engineering professor, inventor and consultant who became
famous in his field as a co-author of the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia
of Chemical Technology. In its post-World War II heyday,
Polytechnic was a leader in microwave technology, aerospace
technology and fields like polymer chemistry. But in the 1970s, the
university nearly went bankrupt, having fallen behind rivals like
Carnegie-Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators believe that the Othmer money could change all
that. The gift has prompted an ambitious planning and fund-raising
effort _ $52 million has been pledged so far _ by the university in
an attempt to reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to use it wisely, we recognize that,'' said Richard S.
Thorsen, Polytechnic's vice president of development. ``It secures
the financial future of the university. But we want to do much more
than that. It's an opportunity to really break out.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot is tentatively planned. A large if undetermined sum will
go into the endowment. There are also plans to renovate the
academic building, Rogers Hall; to build a second academic
building, and to erect the university's first dormitory. Thorsen
said Polytechnic may create 25 new professorships, costing $1.5
million to $2.5 million each. As many as 50 endowed scholarships
are under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Frisch, the provost, predicted big changes in the curriculum.
Some master's programs may be phased out. New programs in
telecommunications and biotechnology will probably be created, as
well as a continuing education program, a potentially profitable
endeavor.

RODMAN INTRIGUES LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Dennis Rodman hasn't even stepped onto the premises
yet, and already he's Topic No. 1 within the walls of the Great
Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers wrestle internally over whether the seven-time
rebounding champion is worth the trouble, they remain outwardly
noncommittal about the prospect of obtaining his services.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executive Jerry West admits the club is, at the least,
intrigued by the talented, tattoed, unpredictable, enigmatic,
colorful, controversial, cross-dressing power forward with four
championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   But West won't say how intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``To really say there's any substance to it . . . it's bandied
about in the office. But we have no idea if there will even be any
interest on his part to start with,'' West said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question, if Rodman is indeed interested in the
Lakers, how interested are they in him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know that,'' West said. ``People have to want
you sometimes before you decide those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all aware he does bring a basketball ingredient
that's been proven. His teams seem to win. He's one of the smartest
players to play this game, period. He knows how to do it. Plus he's
got great energy and enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers are making inquiries. Rodman and owner Jerry Buss
have chatted and West has talked to Rodman's new agent, Steve
Chasman of talent agency ICM. Chasman, however, wasn't a registered
player agent as of Wednesday, according to the players association,
though he was expected to file for certification.
</P>
<P>
   As the story took on a life of its own, as everything involving
Rodman does, West said just enough to keep the plot afloat, even
while downplaying the possible conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``These questions are all really meaningless,'' he told
reporters. ``There's so much more to this than just maybe us having
a desire to talk to him. And we have not talked to him personally.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting here trying to speculate on something that we really
have had no definitive discussions on is just filling up space in a
newspaper and creating a lot mote publicity and lot more
controversy. Which I'm sure Dennis likes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman made $4.5 million last year. The Lakers can only offer
the $1 million veteran's minimum, but Rodman doesn't appear to have
any better offers, and other teams he likes have ruled out hiring
him, including the Houston Rockets on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Buss, a partier and playboy in his own right, has an
affinity for Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Jerry about it,'' West said, ``and he's always
liked Dennis personally and he knows him personally and I'll leave
it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, a longtime Rodman critic but now his greatest
advocate, began lobbying openly for his services this week. It will
be O'Neal who benefits the most from Rodman's rebounding and
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Of West's efforts, O'Neal said: ``I'm happy. Hopefully something
can get resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Lakers quietly express reservations about Rodman's
presence, but overall he's got support in the locker room, where
his talents weigh more heavily than his antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'll test us, I'm sure he'll be Dennis,'' Rick Fox
said. ``We're not expecting him to be anything else. That means
whatever comes along with that, those 13-14 (rebounds) are pretty
nice to have too.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derek Harper, ``As long as he doesn't dress in drag and sit
next to me, he's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Fox sat out practice for the second straight day
because of soreness in both ankles and knees. He said the problem
was a new pair of shoe insoles that gave insufficient shock
absorption, but he expects to be ready for Friday night's season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection
Wednesday and is listed as day-to-day.

STATE INVESTIGATORS FIND WELFARE DELAYS IN CITY
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ Posing as poor people, state health investigators
visited eight welfare offices in New York City last week and found
that four of the offices failed to promptly provide Medicaid
applications as required by federal law, state officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, city workers must distribute Medicaid
applications ``without delay.'' But at the four welfare offices,
the workers told the undercover investigators that they would have
to return on another day to receive the forms, state officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have concerns about what we have found,'' John
Signor, a spokesman for the State Department of Health, said
Wednesday. ``We're going to continue monitoring the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The state investigators made their visits the day after a
federal judge ruled that city welfare workers were improperly
denying applications for Medicaid and food stamps to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, the judge, William H. Pauley 3rd of U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, ordered the city to guarantee prompt access to
the applications. He also temporarily blocked the city from
converting any more of its welfare offices into ``job centers,''
where workers discourage the poor from applying for public
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the order, the city must produce a plan this month to
correct the problems. City officials have already vowed to retrain
hundreds of welfare workers, revise applications and post signs
clearly outlining the public's rights to government benefits. But
the problems uncovered by the investigators suggest that legal
violations continue to occur, even though city officials have
already begun training workers and posting signs.
</P>
<P>
   City welfare officials said Wednesday they could not comment on
the investigation because they had not been provided with
information about the findings.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for the poor said they were particularly concerned
that state investigators discovered such problems so soon after the
judge issued his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really saddens me that this continues after all we've been
through in the courts,'' said Helen Lee, a staff lawyer at the
Legal Aid Society, which filed the class-action lawsuit that
resulted in Pauley's ruling. ``This is something we need to fix
right away. We're talking about people's lives here.''
</P>
<P>
   In court hearings before the ruling, Pauley also criticized
state officials for failing to carefully monitor the city's
compliance with federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   That complaint has been echoed by officials from the federal
Health Care Financing Administration, which began an inquiry seven
months ago to determine, in part, whether state officials were
properly overseeing the city's Medicaid operations. During the
court hearing, a federal health official noted that state officials
had repeatedly failed to provide proof that they were monitoring
the city as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   City officials had said the problems were isolated, the
inevitable growing pains of a program created 10 months ago.

COLUMN: MIFFED MODELS: QUIT POUTING AND ORGANIZE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion models in New York are hurting, and no one
feels their pain.
</P>
<P>
   The rage in fashion magazines is for covers featuring actresses
and celebrities like Courteney Cox, Michelle Pfeiffer, Oprah
Winfrey and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Editors find that these covers
sell better than ones featuring models' faces. They also find
celebrities, even movie stars, easier to work with than models.
</P>
<P>
   So there's mewling on Seventh Avenue (``The Models Are Angry''
was one recent headline) as the industry ponders the awful question
raised last week by Conor Kennedy, a booker at Company Models: ``If
magazines are making such an effort to feature Gwyneth Paltrow over
and over again, well, what happens to the next generation of Linda
Evangelistas?''
</P>
<P>
   The public's answer thus far has been a resounding: Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   As victims, miffed supermodels rank on the sympathy scale just
above Arab princes whining over low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   But with a little effort, the models might be able to win
sympathy here on their home turf as they struggle against the
competition from Hollywood. Cover girls, after all, are one of New
York's major businesses, and the city's politicians have
traditionally provided help to any local industry that complains
loud enough.
</P>
<P>
   If millionaire stockbrokers and athletes and taxicab-fleet
owners are entitled to special treatment, why not supermodels?
Workers of Seventh Avenue, unite! You have nothing to lose but your
pouts!
</P>
<P>
   Start by forming the SOS (Save Our Supermodels) Committee and
make enough campaign contributions to get a public hearing in the
City Council. Then tearfully tell of your shattered dreams (``I,
like, had to finish high school!'') and economic hardships (``You
know, I had to pay for this dress'').
</P>
<P>
   Give testimony about ``totally unfair competition'' from
celebrities, but avoid lines like ``Excuse me, Oprah is such a
whale'' and ``That Hillary cover _ hello, total airbrush!'' Also to
be avoided: ``I mean, Courteney Cox, she's got to be 30.'' While
testifying, try not to fling your hair back while staring blankly
into the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Hire a consultant to calculate the tens of billions of dollars
generated by models for the New York economy. Count not merely the
revenues of the modeling agencies but also the money spent on
flowers, dinner, nightclubs, jewelry and cars by men pursuing
models. Include a generous ``multiplier effect'' in the
calculations _ say, two investment bankers and one real estate
developer per model.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to include the revenues of the garment industry,
which stands to lose sales because of the ineptness of amateur
models. Stress the endless hours of training to acquire the skills
needed for a grueling cover shoot. Demonstrate how a veteran runway
model can increase sales by knowing how to ``work a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Stress the safety risks of using celebrity models. Illustrate
how easily an amateur can start a fire by knocking over a
photographer's light. Point out that fashion-show runways are
simply not designed to support the weight of modern-day celebrities
(again, do not mention Oprah by name). Sound bite: ``Celebrity
models are a tragedy waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand tax breaks. Urge the mayor to reserve curb space downtown
for models' Town Cars and to include a fashion stadium in his West
Side sports complex. Above all, advocate a new city agency: the
Fashion Models Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Taxi and Limousine Commission, the FMC would license
all working models and require them to display a medallion during
photo shoots. The courts might not allow the FMC to ban celebrities
from modeling, but it could achieve the same effect by mandating a
long apprenticeship and test. (Sample questions: What is the
private line for reservations at Balthazar? How often do you need a
glycolic facial peel?)
</P>
<P>
   If all this seems too complicated, there is a simpler solution
that requires no legislation: join the teamsters. The union could
easily negotiate contracts that prevent celebrities from ever
posing again, and there would be one fringe benefit. Once New
York's fashion editors tried conducting a photo shoot while a
veteran shop steward enforced the teamsters' work rules, no one
would ever complain again about models being difficult.

 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That fast tempo promised and/or threatened by
first-year coach Chris Ford may have to begin at a trot.
</P>
<P>
   `I don't think we can get into a shootout with them,` said Ford
of his team's date for Friday's season-opener.
</P>
<P>
   `Them` refers to the Phoenix Suns, who will sprint into the
Sports Arena with a mighty 116.5 points-per-game scoring average in
two exhibition victories over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   `We have to play some semblance of defense,` said Ford, who does
not hesitate when identifying the main target of Clipper
basket-protection tactics. `Our number one concern is Jason Kidd's
ability to dominate the game with the basketball.`
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, now beginning his fifth NBA season, averaged 11.6 points
per game and shot just 42 percent from the field for the Suns last
season. Not much domination there, right?
</P>
<P>
   That's because Kidd's seminal skill is the precision pass, which
typically arrives at the end of a frantic open-court burst. The
former Cal star was second in the league in assists-per-game last
season at 9.1.
</P>
<P>
   `He goes 100 miles per hour for 48 minutes,` said Darrick
Martin, the Clipper responsible for staying between Kidd and the
hoop. `You just try to contain him as much as possible and kind of
funnel him into help.`
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be the scheme under construction during most of
the team's Wednesday-morning workout at Veterans Park SportsComplex
in Carson. Some of the aforementioned help could come from the
shot-blocking potential of rookie center Michael Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the NBA's top draft pick - who began practicing with
the team last Sunday -- will play, but won't start.
</P>
<P>
   `I don't think I'll put that pressure on him right now,` Ford
said. `I'll put him out there and give him a shot and see how we
all react. The better he plays, the longer he'll stay out there.`
</P>
<P>
   subhead Ex-Rebel helps his cause
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby, the rookie free agent from UNLV, continues to
shine in team scrimmages.
</P>
<P>
   `He backs down to no one,` Ford said. `I would not hesitate to
use him early. He brings us so much energy out there. It'll be
interesting to see how he does against NBA competition on a nightly
basis.`
</P>
<P>
   Against Continental Basketball Association competition this
season, the 6-6 forward averged just 16.8 minutes per game, but
still scored at a 9.8 clip. Despite his ability to penetrate,
elevate and finish in style, Nesby's field-goal percentage was only
43 percent. His quantum leap in Clipper camp has been abetted by
assistant coach Rex Kalamian, who convinced the young forward to
alter the trajectory in his flat-line jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   During one shooting drill with Kalamian, this new arch deluxe
helped Nesby make 25 perimeter shots in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead Pain still gaining
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's arthroscopy on the left knee of rookie Brian Skinner
has been judged a success. The power forward from Baylor will begin
rehabilitation today and is expected to be out 2-3 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent point guard Scott Brooks will be out 6-8 weeks,
thanks to a right-knee injury sustained last Friday in a collision
with Laker Elden Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Clippers - reserve center Keith Closs and backup guard
James `Hollywood` Robinson - were held out of Wednesday drills due
to sore knees.
</P>
<P>
   A bum hamstring could cause Phoenix shooting guard Rex Chapman
to miss Friday's opener.

   NEW YORK_ It was a Cold War-era relic smack in the middle of
Times Square's swirling orb of kinetic neon, but in the end
everyone seemed to want a piece of the Armed Forces Recruiting
Station before it was smashed to pieces on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After a somber pause to allow television news cameras onto the
spit of asphalt at Broadway and 43rd Street, construction workers
armed with power saws and crowbars began ripping down the most
popular _ and arguably the ugliest _ military recruiting station in
the nation. By this time next week, the building's musty remains
will have been unceremoniously buried in some out-of-state
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   By July, the old 400-square-foot station will have been replaced
by a brash new 500-square-foot station, costing roughly $1 million,
designed to fit in with Times Square's futuristic milieu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad because that's the only place you can remember how
it was 40 years ago,'' said Constantinos Poniros, watching his son,
George, the site's demolition manager, supervise the dismantling.
The elder Poniros planned to take a six-foot section of stainless
steel from the station's exterior back home to New Jersey as a
keepsake.
</P>
<P>
   In the 49 years since it opened, the station forged a special
reputation. It was the only outpost to house recruiters from all
four military branches. It was the only station that could reject
far more recruits than it enlisted _ more than 200 a year signed up
_ and still claim top honors in recruiting circles. And it was the
only recruiting station in the country without a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go to the NYPD across the street, and the
restaurants,'' said Staff Sgt. Armando Diaz, the last Air Force
recruiter to work in the cramped station. ``I won't miss that.''
</P>
<P>
   The booth, as recruiters called it, also became a
stainless-steel magnet for protesters of wars in Vietnam and Iraq
and of the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy toward gay
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The booth's smoked glass windows and lusterless stainless steel
was considered slick in 1950 when it replaced an earlier recruiting
office built in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   The new station will feature American flags burning in red,
white and blue neon on the east- and west-side exterior walls. A
giant, nine-panel television screen, affixed to the north wall,
will spread the military's message to passers-by. Phosphorescent
poles (also in blazing red, white and blue) will fan out from the
station for the benefit of nighttime drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be high-tech,'' said Peter Shugert, a spokesman for
the Army Corps of Engineers, which is supervising the project. ``It
will have all the modern conveniences.'' And, he added, unlike the
shack now being demolished, ``It will have running water.''

FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT FOR BACKBONE TRAIL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The Backbone Trail's future appears financially
rosy and on track for its anticipated completion in 2004 or 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't foresee any stumbling blocks at this point,'' said
Art Eck, superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area, the National Park Service unit that oversees the
proposed 70-mile trail from Pacific Palisades to Point Mugu.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six miles yet to be finished, two miles will open to
hikers next year and another mile should see the bottoms of boots
in 2001, Eck said. About a dozen parcels of private property needed
to be purchased for the remaining three miles of trail have been
identified and are in various stages of assessment, appraisal and
other red tape.
</P>
<P>
   The budget set aside to buy the land and build the trail is
sound. It's so sound, in fact, Eck and other officials don't
anticipate spending any of the $5 million President Clinton
recently requested for Santa Monica Mountains land acquisition on
Backbone Trail projects. (See related story.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have enough money in the pipeline to buy the trail
bed for the Backbone Trail. That's in hand,'' said U.S. Congressman
Brad Sherman (D-Woodland Hills), a proponent of the Backbone Trail
who has successfully lobbied the White House for funds to purchase
land for the trail and other recreational opportunities within the
Santa Monica Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman is particularly passionate about completing the Backbone
Trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It links together most of the parcels that are publicly owned
in the Santa Monica Mountains, and it allows people that are in as
good as shape as you, not me, to hike from Will Rogers (State
Historic) Park to Point Mugu,'' he said. ``And it also is a
wildlife corridor so that our furry friends no longer have to date
their cousins. In other words, they get a chance to breed with more
distant populations and be a viable breeding stock.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Backbone Trail coffer is a portion of $6 million the
federal government allocated in January 1998 for trail acquisition
in the mountains. Funding comes in annual installments of about $1
million, Eck explained.
</P>
<P>
   Also likely available is $2 million Congress earmarked
specifically for the Backbone Trail for the 1998-99 fiscal year.
However, that money is contingent upon a match of $2 million, or
the equivalent in property, which Eck anticipates will come from
the state government. ``Prospects look good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having enough funding to buy land for the trail is one thing;
making sure all the paperwork is in order and all the other ends
meet is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a while to spend,'' Sherman said. ``Each real
estate acquisition is not easy. Dealing with land acquisition in
the Santa Monica Mountains has shown me that sometimes preserving
the environment means using one entire tree for the documents
necessary for one real estate deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Eck maintains the trail will be finished within a five- to
six-year time line. ``Frankly, I have no reason to think it
wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-mile segment of trail in the west-central Santa Monica
Mountains has been flagged from Zuma Ridge Motorway to Los Angeles
County Fire Camp 13, paralleling Encinal Canyon Road to its south.
It should open to hikers in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   From there, plans call for the trail to extend a half-mile north
of Encinal Canyon Road on existing Clark Ranch Road to Mulholland
Highway, and then to the north for another half-mile on property
already owned by the National Park Service. The latter segment
should be ready for hikers, bikers and equestrian in 2001.

HALF-BROTHER GETS A SHARE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Neb., Ind., Calif.) (With NY-PHILANTHROPY) 
 (bl) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Mildred Topp Othmer left $2 million in her will
for any ``sisters of mine, nieces of mine and children of such
nieces,'' there was no mention of a brother. Mrs. Othmer, the
second of three sisters, never had one.
</P>
<P>
   Or did she?
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, after the $750 million estate left by Mrs. Othmer
and her husband, Donald, became national news, an unexpected claim
was made. Alphonso Axel Ernie Topp Jr. had never met Mrs. Othmer,
but he believed that she was his half-sister.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer asserted that Topp was entitled to a share of the
estate, as were his 8 daughters and their 11 children.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, everyone got something. The institutions to which
Mrs. Othmer gave most of her money got more than $526 million. Her
niece in Omaha _ who, like Topp, challenged the will _ received
$17,640,909.90. Topp, a retired Army colonel in California, got
$2.4 million. His 8 daughters and their 11 children got $90,909.09
each.
</P>
<P>
   But is Topp really Mrs. Othmer's half-brother? Interviewed by
phone in California, Topp, 78, said he learned of Mrs. Othmer only
after his father died in 1965. On a visit to Denmark, where his
father was born, he said relatives told him that his father had
married and divorced in Omaha before he was born.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Mrs. Othmer's parents divorced in March 1919,
and her father, Holger Topp, disappeared. Friends of Mrs. Othmer
say she never heard from him again. Perhaps he went to Indiana. In
June 1919, a man named Alfonse A. Topp was married in Indianapolis.
This couple had one child, Alphonso Axel Ernie Topp Jr. When the
senior Topp applied for citizenship in 1942, he listed Holger as a
middle name.
</P>
<P>
   So are Holger Topp and Alphonso A. Topp Sr. the same man? ``The
parties decided that Topp's claim had some merit and were willing
to settle,'' said Theodore Wagner, the Othmers' estate tax lawyer.
``Most of the lawyers involved believe he probably is related.''
</P>
<P>
   But is he entitled to money from a woman he never knew? Thomas
Dahlk of Omaha, Topp's lawyer, said, ``It's the law.'' Topp said he
made his claim to help his grandchildren.

FLORIO JOINS AN INFLUENTIAL NEW YORK FIRM 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.J., Pa.)  By RONALD SMOTHERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In an effort to extend its influence into New
Jersey, where it believes that the law business is booming, the
politically connected New York City law firm of Fischbein Badillo
Wagner Harding has acquired the law firm of former Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Florio's 13-lawyer firm, Florio &AMP; Perrucci, which is based in
Piscataway with offices in Philadelphia and business in his native
southern New Jersey, will be absorbed into Fischbein Badillo, a
103-lawyer firm whose partners include Herman Badillo and Raymond
Harding, both firms' principals said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo is a former Democratic congressman and deputy mayor of
New York City who became a Republican last June. Harding is the
chairman of New York state's Liberal Party. Both have close ties to
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   In joining the powerful Manhattan firm, Florio, a Democrat,
follows Burton B. Roberts, the former Bronx district attorney and
chief administrative judge of State Supreme Court in the Bronx, who
signed on as a partner last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Florio was named chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
of New York on Tuesday, he said he would still practice law.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, Michael Perrucci and Joseph Bock of the New Jersey firm
will become partners in the consolidated law firm, although their
names will not be added to the title yet, Richard S. Fischbein, the
firm's senior partner, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fischbein Badillo's strengths are in trade, labor and employment
law as well as commercial and real estate matters and litigation.
Florio, an author of the nation's Superfund law while in Congress,
has worked extensively in environmental, international and
employment law.
</P>
<P>
   Both Florio and Fischbein were sanguine about the political
chemistry that might result from the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not hurtful that this expands all of our philosophical
bases and it will make for good discussions at lunches,'' Fischbein
said.

SAHARA SURVIVAL 101: OVERHEATEING BLAMED FOR ILLNESS AT SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The students at Intermediate School 135 in the Bronx,
which had been closed since Friday after about 80 pupils and
teachers mysteriously became sick there, returned to school
Wednesday. The children seemed fine, but some of their parents were
sick with worry.
</P>
<P>
   City school officials believe that excessive heat in many
classrooms was the likely cause of the widespread illness, which
left students and staff members complaining of dizziness, pain and
vomiting. But several parents said they were dissatisfied with that
explanation and complained to Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who
made a brief visit to the school at 2441 Wallace Ave. in Bronxdale,
about his decision to reopen it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very upset,'' Sarah Siegel, the president of the Parents'
Association, said to the chancellor. ``By right these children
should not be in the school today.'' Crew said he disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Spence, the Board of Education's deputy chancellor for
operations, said Wednesday that a number of city agencies and
representatives of the United Federation of Teachers conducted
environmental tests at the school over the weekend, which did not
yield any conclusive results. ``To date, we cannot find a single
possible toxic cause,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spence said officials believe that excessive heat and low
humidity, perhaps laced with a tiny amount of hydrogen sulfide from
the heating system, may have caused the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Spence said that 60 of the school's 80 thermostats were not
working, and failed to cut off heat entering many classrooms even
though they were warm enough, and that some classroom's windows did
not open. Temperatures in many classrooms last week reached 85 or
90 degrees, he said, while the humidity was less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a school that's so hot and dry it's like the
Sahara,'' he said. The three classrooms that had generated the most
complaints of symptoms will stay closed through the week so that
testing can continue, Spence said, adding that five or six people
would remain at the school with testing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At the school Wednesday, Crew said he had decided to reopen most
classrooms because he believed they were safe. ``Every precaution
has been taken so far to make sure the problems we had will not be
repeated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Siegel, the PTA president, and several other parents who
had come to the school for a briefing by health officials,
scientists, epidemiologists and Board of Education representatives
said they had kept their children home yesterday. The school's
attendance, which is usually 90 percent or more, was at 73 percent
Wednesday, the school principal, Dr. Carole Valentino, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not safe,'' said Noelia Hernandez, whose son, Miguel, is
in the sixth grade. ``I'm going to keep my son home until we know
for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents said the briefing provided little new information,
and if they did not get answers they would insist that their
children be transferred. The Board of Education said such requests
were unlikely to be granted.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Valentino said she supported the chancellor's decision.
``In my heart today I really wanted to open the school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The children, meanwhile, were of mixed opinions _ often
mirroring those of their parents. Katrina Lajqi, a 12-year-old in
sixth grade, said she had come for the meeting Wednesday, but did
not attend school and would not Thursday, either. ``They should
just leave the school closed today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hector Algarin, 12, said he was eager to return to school
and was not worried about getting sick. He said he hoped that
reducing the temperature in the building might alleviate the
headaches he often got in school.
</P>
<P>
   And the school did manage to turn the crisis into an educational
opportunity: Accompanied by guidance counselors, environmental
investigators went from classroom to classroom, demonstrating how
to test for carbon dioxide and poison (there was none) in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids loved it,'' Dr. Valentino said.

UNION TO SUE NEW YORK CITY OVER WORKFARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ District Council 37, the giant union representing
120,000 city workers, plans to sue the Giuliani administration
Thursday, accusing it of violating state law by using thousands of
workfare recipients to do tasks once done by full-time city
workers, union officials said on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Several union officials said the city's use of more than 6,000
workfare recipients to rake leaves, pick up trash and do other jobs
in parks violated a law that bars communities from using workfare
workers to do work once done by city employees.
</P>
<P>
   The suit represents a reversal for the council, because its
former executive director, Stanley Hill, was accommodating to the
city's rapid expansion of its workfare program, the nation's
largest. With more than 35,000 workers, the program requires
welfare recipients to do numerous jobs to receive their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who supported Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the 1997
election, had to step aside after the Manhattan district attorney
undertook an investigation into kickbacks, embezzlement and vote
fraud at the union.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Saunders, the trustee for the council appointed in December
by its parent union, the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees, has said he planned to take a tougher approach
to the administration than Hill did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor and the union had a meeting, and they made clear
they disagree,'' said a senior union official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``This just suggests that where there's a
difference in approach, the union will part company and take the
action it needs to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the lawsuit, to be filed in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan, would seek an injunction barring workfare
recipients from doing jobs once done by city workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1990, nonadministrative employment in the Parks
Department dropped to less than 1,200 from nearly 2,800, while the
number of workfare employees in the parks jumped to more than
6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Cohan, director of litigation at the Welfare Law Center, an
advocacy group, applauded the district council's lawsuit, asserting
that workfare pulls down the wages of unionized workers. ``We're
delighted that the union is working to protect its members,'' he
said.

RISE IN NEW YORK CITY CHILDREN WHO ARE BORN INTO POVERTY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite an improving economy in New York, more than
half of the city's children are born into poverty, according to a
report released Wednesday by a children's advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   More than 66,000 of the nearly 127,000 children born in New York
City in 1996, or about 52.2 percent, were born to families with
incomes under the federal poverty level of $23,000 a year for a
family of three, the 216-page report said. The percentage of
children born into poverty was the highest ever, surpassing 51.7
percent in 1994 and 39 percent in 1990, according to the report,
which was prepared by the Citizens' Committee for Children of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the rise were not clear, the group said. But the
report noted that there were worsening situations in related areas,
which include an increase in the number of homeless children and a
decline in the number of children reading at grade level, which
point to spending cutbacks at city agencies like the Department of
Homeless Services and the Administration for Children's Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data paint a very alarming picture,'' said Gail Nayowith,
executive director of the Citizens' Committee. ``There's a
relationship between government spending and outcomes, whether it's
the number of children living in poverty or reading at grade level.
You get what you pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   The group said that there have been spending cuts in four out of
19 city agencies that serve children, including a 16.7 percent drop
in spending at the homeless-services department from fiscal 1994 to
1998, to $378 million from $454 million.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha I. Lugo, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani,
declined to comment on specific points in the Citizens' Committee
report. In a prepared statement, she said: ``This administration is
proud of its record in regard to children. In funds combined, we
have spent more money on children than any other administration in
the history of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nayowith said the rise in the percentage of children born
into poverty stemmed mainly from increases among white and Asian
families. The percentage of black and Hispanic babies born into
poverty stayed roughly the same: about 60 percent of black infants
and 75 percent of Hispanic babies. But the percentage of white
children born into poverty rose in 1996 to 21.6 percent from 12.8
percent in 1990, and among Asians the percentage went up to 47.7
percent in 1996 from 21.9 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited a large number of what it called ``risks to
child well-being,'' including poverty, unemployment, teen-age
pregnancies, low birth weight, juvenile arrests, and
high-school-dropout rates. The group cited scores of city, state
and federal information.
</P>
<P>
   But the group acknowledged conflicts within the data, including
different definitions of poverty. The federal data for children
born into poverty, for example, defines poverty as annual income
below $23,000 for a family of three in 1996, but for children
living in poverty as $12,500 for a family of three.

HIS HEAD STILL SHAVED, MESSIER STILL BRISTLES

<P>
   MONTREAL _ The head is still shaved. The square jaw juts out as
defiantly as ever. Mark Messier, at age 38, still propels himself
up ice with the same powerful strides that were one of his
trademarks as a Ranger _ that, and guaranteeing playoff victories.
</P>
<P>
   But playoff victories will be unlikely this season. The
Vancouver Canucks are in danger of missing the post season for the
second consecutive season _ ever since they acquired Messier as a
free agent. The Canucks are young, rebuilding and woeful. It is
obvious that Messier does not fit in.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that the future Hall of Famer has lost
a bit of his legendary ferocity. Messier, who suffered the first
serious concussion of his 20-year career earlier this season, seems
reluctant to charge into the corners and trade high elbows. But he
leads the team in scoring _ 13 goals and 29 assists _ just as
another 38-year-old legend, Wayne Gretzky leads the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   While every game has become important to Messier, none will be
quite as emotional as Thursday night's contest at Madison Square
Garden against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will never be past that kind of emotional stage,'' said
Messier, who broke into tears last season during a pre-game
celebration on videotape of his six seasons in New York and then
went out and scored the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   The ruts that line his cragged face and the circles under his
eyes seem more pronounced than they were when Messier was captain
of the Rangers and the soul of their 1994 Stanley Cup champions,
who became the organization's first cup winners in 54 years.
</P>
<P>
   Messier was asked Wednesday if he recalled what could have been
had the Rangers decided that they should have re-signed him to play
alongside Gretzky again for more than only one year, one in which
they surprisingly reached the 1997 Stanley Cup semifinals before
injuries and a younger Flyers team defeated them in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd have to ask those questions to the people making
decisions,'' Messier said. ``I was very satisfied with my six years
in New York. It was probably the best time of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier's relationship with his former general manager, Neil
Smith, is obviously a subject that still bothers a player whose
influence over his teammates was so strong that he was called
Captain Dad.
</P>
<P>
   There were many who felt that influence _ and the way that
Messier successfully held out for a new contract after the Rangers
won the Cup (something his then-contract stipulated he could do) _
may have caused some resentment by Smith and hastened Messier's
departure from New York.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Wednesday how he felt about Smith's current plight
running a team that also is in danger of missing the playoffs,
Messier bristled and said: ``I don't have any feelings
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Messier's relationship with Gretzky. The two first
met as teen-agers and grew up together as they helped create a
dynasty in Edmonton. And Messier seemed elated when Gretzky signed
with the Rangers in the summer of 1996. But there are those in the
Rangers' organization who have suggested that Gretzky resented
Messier leaving after they only had one season together.
</P>
<P>
   And some close to Messier seem to feel that Gretzky distanced
himself from Messier when Messier was trying to negotiate with the
Rangers before he opted for a guaranteed 3-year, $20 million deal
with Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Messier retains much closer ties to Brian Leetch and Mike
Richter, his two best friends during his Rangers years. When asked
what he thought of the Rangers reluctance to negotiate with Leetch,
who is in the final year of his contract, during this season,
Messier _ who knew the feeling himself _ quipped, ``Well, it's
pretty similar with what they did with Richter, too. At least
they're consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his arrival in Vancouver, the coach (Tom Renney)
and captain (Trevor Linden) were gone. Along came Mike Keenan,
Messier's controversial old coach on the Rangers' 1994 team.
</P>
<P>
   Messier went out of his way to stress Keenan's importance to
that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike, I don't think, ever got enough credit for what happened
in '94 because of all the things that happened directly after us
winning,'' Messier said, referring to the power struggle with Smith
that Keenan eventually lost. ``But we wouldn't have won without
Mike making all the deals he did at the trading deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem in Vancouver was that Keenan did not win enough,
despite all the deals he and the then-general manager Pat Quinn
made. Still, Vancouver struggled. And once Brian Burke succeeded
Quinn (who had signed Messier) this past off season, Keenan knew it
was only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   Burke took his time in dealing the disgruntled star forward,
Pavel Bure. The Canucks floundered and on Jan. 24, two games after
Bure was finally dealt to Florida, Keenan was replaced by the
former Colorado coach Marc Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is talk that Messier _ who is guaranteed $6 million
for next season plus a $2 million buyout for 2000-2001 _ might be
the next to go, perhaps to somewhere like Dallas, a team that is
set to make a run at its first Stanley Cup.

PATAKI RETREATS ON FUNDING FOR EARLY SCHOOL PROGRAMS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 )  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In his State of the State Message a year ago,
Gov. George E. Pataki said it was time to ``declare, once and for
all, what we all know to be the case'' _ that prekindergarten
programs work. He promised to increase spending on such programs
tenfold by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But in his budget message last week, the governor appeared to
make a sharp turn in the opposite direction, proposing to eliminate
some early-childhood programs and cut back spending on others,
including the prekindergarten programs he praised so warmly last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan has left school districts perplexed and furious,
with some scrambling to come up with money they thought had been
promised and others wondering whether to abandon the effort
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, for example, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew
Wednesday warned that thousands of children might lose out on
prekindergarten as a result of the governor's proposed cuts. Dr.
Crew said the city wants to offer the program to 29,000 children
next year, up from 14,000 this year, and to all 112,000 of the
city's 4-year-olds in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned, they are at risk,'' Dr. Crew said of
the universal prekindergarten classes. ``They are unfunded mandates
at this juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   The districts, from New York City to Syracuse to Buffalo, had
been counting on hundreds of millions of dollars in additional
state aid, based on an agreement that Pataki and the Legislature
reached in 1997 to phase in programs for very young students over
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The money, which would have totaled about $1.5 billion in the
school year beginning in 2001, was intended to help the districts
provide prekindergarten classes for all 4-year-olds, smaller class
sizes in the early grades and all-day kindergarten for districts
that now have either no kindergarten, or only half-day sessions.
Some of the money was also earmarked for school construction,
textbooks and computers.
</P>
<P>
   But in his budget proposal, Pataki sought to back away from that
agreement. He delivered the promised construction money, but
proposed eliminating allocations for prekindergarten, kindergarten,
and smaller classes, offering instead to provide school districts
with a more modest cash grant that could be used for programs of
their choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal would have the greatest impact on New York
City, which would receive a $77 million state educational grant in
lieu of the $150 million it would have otherwise received for
early-childhood programs. The money from the original deal, school
officials said, would have enabled the city to hire 600 additional
teachers to reduce class size in the first, second and third
grades, as well as add 4,000 full-day prekindergarten slots.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester and Buffalo, school officials had planned to add a
combined 1,536 prekindergarten slots for the coming school year.
But those plans are suddenly up in the air, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't wait until August to decide that you're going to
expand the program by several hundred slots, particularly in large
city schools that have critical classroom space problems,'' said
Georgia M. Asciutto, the executive director for the Conference of
Big Five School Districts, which represents the state's five
largest urban school districts, including Rochester and Buffalo.
``That process has to start much earlier than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the agreement Pataki reached with the Legislature in
1997 would have provided school districts around the state with
$100 million in 1999-2000 for prekindergarten classes, $75 million
for class size reduction, $10 million for full-day kindergarten,
$50 million for school maintenance, along with several smaller
allocations.
</P>
<P>
   The Governor would replace all of those programs, totaling $270
million, with a grant of $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides note that he intends to supplement the state
grant with $100 million in federal money that has been allocated to
help schools reduce class size in the early grades. But his critics
maintain that the state should not be reneging on its financial
commitment to early-childhood programs just because the federal
government is now providing money for the same purpose.

GROWING ECONOMY LAYS TO REST FISCAL POLICY MYTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The unveiling of a century-ending federal budget brings to mind
how this century's final decade has laid to rest a generation's
worth of fiscal policy myths. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the long-gone era of perceived budgetary red ink as far as
the eye could see, conventional wisdom said rising federal deficits
would lift interest rates and slow economic growth. It was the
``crowding out'' theory. As Uncle Sam borrowed more, it posited,
the credit capital available for businesses to finance expansion
would become increasingly scarce and costly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of the sort happened, though. The interest rate trend
has been down during much of this decade. This was so even as the
deficit climbed to a record $290 billion in fiscal 1992 and stayed
above $200 billion through fiscal 1994. As the deficit moved into
surplus in 1998 for the first time in nearly 30 years, interest
rates remained on a predictably downward path. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The experts were wrong because they didn't account for the power
of political stability. A rate-boosting credit squeeze failed to
materialize because the world remained willing to lend all U.S.
borrowers most of the credit they wanted at reasonable prices. This
willingness was largely due to America offering the safest
investment haven in the world, which also helps explain why chronic
trade deficits haven't brought the U.S. economy to grief. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another punctured myth is the belief that huge tax increases
would pose an insurmountable barrier to growth. This myth, too, has
been debunked largely because America is the home of the world's
most investor-friendly financial markets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some die-hard critics of the Clinton administration claim this
economic expansion hasn't been as strong statistically in some ways
as the 1980s recovery, but they can't deny an indisputable fact:
This period of uninterrupted growth has been the longest in
peacetime history despite two substantial tax increases in the
1990s. If growth continues for another year or so, it will be the
longest expansion ever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. economy grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate in last
year's final quarter, it was a phenomenal performance for a boom
this long in the tooth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom was wrong because the experts failed to
fully comprehend the power of a hospitable investment climate.
Compared with Europe and Japan, for example, the U.S. stock market
is an investor's paradise. While far from perfect, the U.S. market
is probably unique in the way it protects shareholder interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The resulting appeal of U.S. equity markets largely explains the
investor demand for stocks in recent years that has driven stock
prices higher than anyone thought they could go, given the
underlying economic fundamentals. As stock prices have soared,
Americans have felt wealthier, which has translated into a desire
to use their new wealth to finance a better life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With some two-thirds of economic growth fueled by personal
consumption, the result is a virtual circle. Rising consumption
brings economic growth, which encourages the stock investment that
drives equity prices higher and, in turn, creates aggressive
consumers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Add to the mix sound monetary policy that tames inflation, and
the combination becomes unbeatable. &QL;

GOVERNMENT SUES AMC, SAYING DISABLED MOVIEGOERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS
TO STADIUM SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice is suing AMC Entertainment Inc.,
saying the company isn't providing moviegoers in wheelchairs access
to stadium seating in most of its theaters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte said the lawsuit, filed Friday, was
a surprise to the Kansas City movie theater company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been in discussions with them for a number of months and
have submitted seven or eight different sets of plans for their
approval that weren't accepted,'' Nolte said. ``However, we're
still in negotiations with them and plan to continue to do so in
good faith.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks an order requiring AMC to make modifications
to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of basic fairness,'' said Bill Lann Lee,
acting assistant attorney general for civil rights. ``People who
use wheelchairs go to the movies and pay the same prices as
everyone else. They should have access to seats of comparable
quality to those available to most other patrons.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The snag in negotiations centers on exactly what constitutes a
good seat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some movie patrons like to sit in the back, others close to the
screen, some in the middle of a row, others next to an aisle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the definition for what is a comparable sightline for the
general public,'' Nolte said. ``But that keeps changing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMC embarked on an aggressive expansion program in the early
1990s, building megaplexes containing 18 to 30 screens, or more.
Most megaplex theaters feature stadium, or tiered, seating that
gives an unobstructed view to most moviegoers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most seating for patrons in wheelchairs and others who can't use
stairs is on a flat area in front of the stadium seating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of AMC's new megaplexes include at least a few screens that
have elevators to give wheelchair users and other disabled patrons
access to a landing at the back of the theater. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMC isn't the only movie chain being called to task. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a federal court in Waco, Texas, ruled that
two Cinemark theaters with stadium seating violated the Americans
With Disabilities Act by forcing patrons who use wheelchairs to sit
in the front two rows of the theaters. That case is being
appealed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says it also is investigating other movie
theaters and theater chains for possible violations of the act. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AMC lawsuit also asks that the company be forced to pay
damages to patrons with disabilities who did not have access to
stadium seats and that the company pay unspecified civil
penalties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lee used one of AMC's advertising slogans to drive home the
Justice Department's position. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``AMC says it is `changing the way the world sees movies,' ''
Lee said. ``We're just making sure that change complies with the
law.'' &QL;

D'AMATO VISITS CITY HALL 
ASTROBIOGRAPHY 
AUTEUR PESTERS MUCKETY-MUCKS 
YO-YO MA DAY, YO-YO MA WAY
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who was that familiar-looking man escorting Stuart
Subotnick around City Hall Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a lobbyist,'' Alfonse D'Amato declared.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato had arranged a meeting between Subotnick, the president
of a group that owns a major league soccer team in New Jersey, the
MetroStars, and wants to organize one in New York, and Deputy Mayor
Randy Levine.
</P>
<P>
   It was a get-acquainted session, D'Amato said, and later Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani _ the two men had their differences when D'Amato
was a U.S. senator from New York _ agreed that D'Amato's visit to
City Hall was not a lobbying trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be lobbying about something that isn't even at the
point of being a bid or a contract,'' the mayor said later in the
day. ``When the city is seeking ideas and thoughts, it's not
lobbying; it's just like anybody else that can come in and talk
about possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Giuliani and D'Amato did not encounter each other.
``He wasn't in,'' D'Amato said as he left. So there was no talk of
the Senate race he lost to Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here, again, with Subotnick,'' D'Amato said. ``We spoke
about soccer, soccer, soccer. Kicking the ball, not each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn the Author
</P>
<P>
   Last year, John Glenn went on his second flight in space. Now he
is writing his second book, and on Wednesday Bantam said that it
would publish it in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bantam did not say how much it was paying for the still-untitled
story of Glenn's life, which will cover his 55-year marriage and
his 24-year Senate career as well as his time in space. As with
many celebrity autobiographies, a writer has been brought in. And
the editing at Bantam will be done by Beverly Lewis, who handled
autobiographies by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and Beverly Sills,
the soprano-turned-arts administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's other book was ``We Seven,'' written in 1962 in
collaboration with the six other Mercury astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Cable Complaints
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Isles called her cable company the other day to ask
why it did not carry the BET channel, which is scheduled to carry a
documentary called ``Scandalize My Name: Stories from the
Blacklist'' on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people in New York to want to see it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Miss Isles _ who had an affair with the socialite
Claus von Bulow that Rhode Island prosecutors said led him to try
to kill his wife with an insulin injection in 1979 _ made the
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   She said that one of the purposes of a screening at Lincoln
Center on Tuesday ``was to get everybody to call the number on
their bill because we don't know the muckety-mucks. Have a little
groundswell.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Time Warner Cable of New York, Geri Warren,
said the calls would have no immediate effect. ``Right now, we're
channel-locked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yo-Yo Ma Day
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The idea is to observe Yo-Yo Ma Day on Yo-Yo Ma Way.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki has declared next Tuesday Yo-Yo Ma Day. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani has renamed 46th Street between Fifth and Madison
Avenues Yo-Yo Ma Way, but only temporarily. After Yo-Yo Ma Day,
Yo-Yo Ma Way will go back to being 46th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The cellist is scheduled to spend a part of his day signing
autographs at the HMV record store on Fifth Avenue, and HMV would
like the street-name change to be made permanent.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a problem. The City Council, not the mayor's
Transportation Department, normally decides on long-term
street-name changes. And the Council has its rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person's got to be deceased,'' said Randy Orozco, a
Council spokesman.

GOP SPLIT IS REFLECTED IN DISPUTE ON MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Plans to announce a long-awaited expansion of New
York's Holocaust museum at a ceremony Thursday have been postponed
because of a heated dispute over its financing between Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, whose rift appears to
widen by the day.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Giuliani said Wednesday that the city and the state had
agreed to chip in $11 million each to help pay for the proposed
expansion but that the state had recently reneged on its verbal
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration is determined to come up with more
money to cover the state's share, city officials said, but would
need the support of Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, who
is out of town this week. Therefore, they decided to postpone the
announcement until at least next week.
</P>
<P>
   This version of events was described as approaching fiction by
various members of the Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Race, Pataki's chief of staff, on Wednesday denied that the
state had agreed to contribute the $11 million; in fact, he said,
the state had never even been asked to make such a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   And James F. Gill, whom the governor appointed as chairman of
the Battery Park City Authority _ a state-run agency that controls
the land on which the museum sits _ approached apoplexy in
disputing the Giuliani administration's version of events.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the agreement had always called for the city to
contribute $22 million, while the authority would cede the land on
which to build the expansion. ``It was always the deal _ it was the
deal at the get-go,'' he insisted. The city's contention, he said,
``is made out of whole cloth. It's nonsense. It's garbage. And
frankly I resent it.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Randy Levine, the city's deputy mayor of economic
development, said: ``If the state had kept its $11 million in, we
could have gone forward. I'm telling you, they made the
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth regarding the museum issue, it seemed clear
from the nasty charges and countercharges that the awkward detente
between the state's two Republican leaders is no more.
</P>
<P>
   It was particularly remarkable that their feud should touch an
issue as politically delicate as the Holocaust museum, given that
both men will no doubt continue to court Jewish voters and
contributors as they pursue possible national ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Those ambitions could well collide in a party that may be able
to handle only one New York Republican at a time. And the men
harbor a mutual distrust that dates back to Giuliani's decision to
back Pataki's opponent and eventual victim, Mario M. Cuomo, in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the governor and the mayor have professed to enjoy a
fruitful relationship, with Giuliani endorsing Pataki's re-election
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, the two camps have appeared to go out of
their way to antagonize each other.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, for example, did not check with Pataki last month
before proposing a plan to build a domed football stadium on
Manhattan's West Side, even though the governor controls the land
on which it would be built.
</P>
<P>
   And Pataki surprised Giuliani by recently announcing plans to
investigate the School Construction Authority, even though the
governor's appointee to the authority was at the center of recent
charges of mismanagement.

ASHCROFT BLASTS NEWS RELEASE LINKING HIM TO ALLEGEDLY RACIST
GROUP 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri on Tuesday condemned a group of
alleged racists that a Democratic political group had linked to the
Republican in a news release last month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also sharply criticized the news release from the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, which called Ashcroft the ``white
supremacist's presidential choice.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like the press release was offensive, injurious and
wrong,'' said Ashcroft aide Don Trigg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The campaign committee's news release was based on a televised
appearance by Gordon Baum of Bridgeton, Mo., a leader of the
Council of Conservative Citizens. The group, criticized as racist
and anti-Semitic, has made headlines recently because of its loose
ties to GOP congressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on CNN, Baum said he could support Ashcroft for
president, although at the time of the interview Ashcroft already
had dropped out of the 2000 race. Baum had first mentioned
television commentator Pat Buchanan as the candidate who ``probably
comes fairly close to us on some of the social and cultural
issues.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is being challenged for a second Senate term in 2000 by
Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its Jan. 26 news release, the campaign committee said Baum's
statement ``proves'' that Ashcroft's base of support was the
extreme right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad to think that those fighting on his team are white
supremacists who hope to reverse the civil rights strides America
has made since the 1950s,'' Joe Hansen, the campaign committee's
executive director, said in the news release. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Michael Tucker, another campaign committee official,
said the political group stood by the news release. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
issued a news release that said, ``Just like Larry Flynt and James
Carville, Governor Carnahan's political team at the DSCC is
embracing the politics of personal destruction.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Carnahan have said the governor and his staff had
nothing to do with the campaign committee's news release or its
distribution. The governor told reporters Monday he had not seen
the campaign committee's release. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I know the facts, I'm not going to make a statement
about it,'' Carnahan said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said he considered the Council of Conservative Citizens to be
a dangerous group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's office issued news releases from the National Jewish
Coalition and the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise,
among others, that condemned the campaign committee. An Ashcroft
aide said the senator repudiated the citizens council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just appalling,'' said Ann Wagner, chairwoman of the
Missouri Republican Party. ``People hate this kind of sleazy
campaigning. To have it begin two years out is a real
disappointment.'' &QL;

HUNDREDS GATHER TO MOURN, PRAISE LONGTIME KC AREA MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN and HELEN T. GRAY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The words the Rev. E.A. Freeman spoke from the pulpit at First
Baptist Church were powerful, but his life was his greatest
sermon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He preached the gospel every day'' with much more than words,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackson delivered a 40-minute eulogy to about 1,000 people who
attended Freeman's funeral at First Baptist Church at Fifth Street
and Nebraska Avenue in Kansas City, Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, a longtime religious and civic leader who led the
church for 50 years, died Jan. 26 at age 84. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he lived, he walked in a dark room and light came
up,'' said Jackson, whose friendship with Freeman began in the
1950s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was last on a schedule of speakers that included Kansas
City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, a United Methodist minister; Carol
Marinovich, mayor of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and
Kansas City, Kan.; and religious leaders from throughout the
country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An entire section of the sanctuary was reserved for ministers
and their wives. About 100 ministers attended. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us here today, our careers are defined because of
Freeman's credibility,'' Jackson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 80 persons who could not fit into the sanctuary sat on
folding chairs in the church gymnasium and watched the service on
closed-circuit television. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The program called the service a ``Home Going Celebration,'' and
it was a spirited commemoration of Freeman's life. Early in his
remarks, Jackson asked those assembled to ``give it up'' in
remembrance of Freeman, and the crowd responded with a standing
ovation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rather than reflect on the sorrow and finality of Freeman's
passing, speakers chose to focus on his personality, his lifetime
of commitment and achievement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone asked me to describe Dr. Freeman,'' Marinovich said.
``What comes to mind from my discussions with him are a gentleman
and a gentle man. He will truly be missed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker recalled the stories and jokes that
Freeman loved to tell. Some even recounted a favorite, evoking
laughter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were around him, he would find a way to make you
laugh,'' said the Rev. Wallace S. Hartsfield, pastor of
Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver read aloud a letter from President Clinton, who called
Freeman a ``strong, inspiring spiritual leader.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Said Cleaver: ``He touched people, he changed folk and lifted
them spiritually. If there were a candidate to live again, I would
nominate E.A. Freeman.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The service was led by the Rev. Ellis C. Robinson, who took over
at First Baptist after Freeman retired in 1996. As a boy, Robinson
lived next door to the Freemans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Freeman always said he wanted to die at First Baptist or
on his way to First Baptist,'' Robinson said. ``This is the only
place we could have this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robinson met with the speakers before the service and urged them
to limit their reflections to two minutes, but almost no one did,
and the service stretched to four hours. But Freeman's influence
could not be summarized in a mere 120 seconds, and Robinson
understood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to do what we ought to do, because if we did,
we'd be here for a week,'' he said. ``We are here to show Dr.
Freeman that we love him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The service was attended by representatives of the National
Baptist Congress of Christian Education and the Kansas Missionary
Baptist State Convention, both of which Freeman once served as
president; as well as the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A. Inc. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was committed to bringing the kingdom of God here on
earth,'' said the Rev. Stacy Ollar, pastor of Welborn Community
United Church of Christ in Kansas City, Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ollar told of how he and Freeman helped organize a group to
fight for fair utility rates in the early 1980s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two men also crossed racial lines and exchanged pulpits in
the early '80s when Ollar was pastor of the Bristol Hill United
Methodist Church in the Turner district of Kansas City, Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was one of a minority of black Baptist pastors who
embraced the ordination of women. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a mentor and encourager for women who dared to heed the
call,'' said the Rev. Rosetta Whitfield of First Baptist Church.
``He was our father in the ministry.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, Freeman helped heal a rift between Jackson
and the National Baptist Convention that dated to the 1950s when
the convention became uncomfortable with the high-profile activism
of Jackson's associate, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, at his first revival, Jackson chose First Baptist as
the location for a weeklong spiritual event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At one point Tuesday, Jackson referred to Acts 13:36: ``For when
David had served God's purpose in his own generation, he fell
asleep.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Freeman,'' Jackson said, ``served his generation well, and
then he fell asleep.'' &QL;

 Jury RULES AGAINST ANTI-ABORTION WEB SITE, `WANTED' POSTERS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 cs. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal jury in Portland, Ore., ruled Tuesday that a Web site
and Old West-style ``wanted posters'' listing personal details
about abortion doctors amounted to illegal threats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jurors ordered the defendants to pay more than $107 million in
damages to two clinics and four doctors _ among them Robert D.
Crist, medical director of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and
Mid-Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the 14 defendants is from St. Louis and another is from
Wichita. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury saw the posters for what they are _ a hit list for
terrorists,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, whose Portland affiliate was a plaintiff in
the case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot restore the lives of those who have been killed.But
this verdict reminds us all that while Americans have a great
diversity of thoughts and feelings about abortion, we speak with
one voice to renounce domestic terrorists.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs said their next step is to seek an injunction
that, among other things, could shut down the Web site. It remained
active late Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the jury verdict that would require it to
be taken down, but I can foresee a variety of avenues by which
people may try to get it taken down,'' said Planned Parenthood
attorney Roger Evans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The defendants said an appeal is already in the works. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the verdict could have major implications for
the First Amendment. At issue was whether the defendants' tactics
encouraged violence against abortion doctors or were simply acts of
constitutionally protected free speech. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tactics included ``The Nuremberg Files'' _ a Web site that
lists hundreds of ``baby butchers'' and asks activists to send in
doctors' home addresses, license plate numbers and even the names
of their children _ and ``wanted'' posters offering rewards for
information about doctors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those questions that lie really at the heart of
the First Amendment,'' said Richard E. Levy, a constitutional law
professor at the University of Kansas. ``We allow speech that we
disagree with. We even allow speech that is dangerous. The line is
drawn very broadly to protect speech, and the government can
proscribe speech only in very specific circumstances.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Crist _ whose address and phone number appear
on the Web site and ``wanted'' posters _ told jurors that he was
``truly, truly frightened'' by the tactics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Crist said, when St. Louis police showed him a flier
with the heading ``Guilty of Crimes Against Humanity,'' they told
him to take it as a serious threat and compared it to a ``contract
on my life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crist said he began wearing a bulletproof vest and using armed
police escorts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear a vest even when I go to dinner with my wife and son,''
he testified. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs sued under federal racketeering laws and the 1994
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which makes it illegal
to incite violence against abortion doctors and their patients.
While the clinic access law has been used numerous times against
activists who have bombed clinics or shot doctors, this case was
believed to be the first not to result from a violent attack or a
direct threat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the activists were terrorists
who conspired to use publications, intimidation and even killing to
scare doctors into quitting. Distribution of their ``wanted''
posters, the plaintiffs said, was followed by the killings of three
doctors and one of their escorts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the fliers and the Web site contained no direct threats,
they said, a reasonable person would perceive them as such, given
the atmosphere of violence in which four doctors and two clinic
employees have been killed since 1993. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The defendants argued, however, that their tactics were merely a
form of protected political protest. They described the trial as an
``inquisition'' aimed at silencing their attempts to speak out
against abortion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated 4 1/2 days before issuing a verdict in the
three-week trial. But several defendants said the doctors and
clinics would have a hard time collecting any of the millions in
damages awarded by the jury. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to get anything. We're all broke,'' said Tim
Dreste of St. Louis, a member of the Missouri Republican State
Committee who served as the north central director of the American
Coalition of Life Advocates, one of the defendants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many defendants said they have made themselves
``judgment-proof'' by transferring their assets to spouses and
others. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Evans, the Planned Parenthood attorney, said, ``They're
judgment-proof, but on the other hand, it clips their wings
significantly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael Bray, a pastor from Bowie, Md., and a defendant
in the case, said the verdict won't change his tactics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect I'll continue speaking the truth,'' said Bray, who
last month sponsored his fourth annual banquet in College Park,
Md., to honor activists who have killed doctors and bombed
clinics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the damages, Bray said, ``there's no money to be had.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But they don't want that,'' he said. ``They just want me to
shut up and let them kill in peace. But I don't have any intention
to shut up at this point. I will continue to call them murderers. I
may have to get creative about it, though.'' &QL;

IN `OLD DAYS,' RECRUITING WAS DIRTY BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I heard it again yesterday, like every year on national signing
day, the distant echo of Jim Wacker, pleading for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know. I swear I didn't know.''.
</P>
<P>
   Shut up, coach. You knew. Everybody knew what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yeah. The old days, when the first week of February allowed
otherwise distinguished local citizens to dabble in Texas-style
organized crime. But, of course, it was all done in the name of an
honorable cause _ football bragging rights for dear ol' alma mammy.
</P>
<P>
   Like the infamous story of Big Bucks from SMU cutting the deal
with Fat Wallet from TCU, where a ``financial ceiling'' was placed
on the head of every local high school hot shot, therefore
controlling under-the-table costs. And this was the church-school
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer necessary to bring up the names of those most
involved, but certainly the memories linger. In this case, the old
days were the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   All that wild cheating was, well, fun, particularly from a
media-coverage standpoint, but the eventual long, hard fall trapped
the participants. To a certain extent, it brought about both the
demise of the Southwest Conference and the football program at
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   But man, is it ever quiet these days. High school recruiting
remains the lifeblood of college football, and the state of Texas
remains a national focal point, but to hear the current
participants tell it, cleanness basically prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Teaff not only lived and coached through the ``bagmen''
era, he's now the executive director of the American Football
Coaches Association. For one thing, Teaff is a clearing house for
complaints within the national coaching community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new world out there,'' said Teaff yesterday from
Waco. ``I don't even hear a whisper from members about our
association needing to do something about this coach or that coach
because his school is paying off kids. We have our problems and our
agendas, but that's a non-existent concern these days.''
</P>
<P>
   R.C. Slocum of Texas A&AMP;M was also coaching in the ``old days.''
As the high school signatures came in yesterday, the Aggies
prospered. So, of course, did the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Texas cheats, and I know we don't,'' he said.
``Believe me, neither of us would have had these quality classes if
there was a school out there still doing something.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, a coach would be nuts to try it because
his job is on the line. Not only the job he has, but basically his
chances of ever getting another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaff will preside over the annual national meeting of the AFCA
this week in Dallas. ``I can guarantee harmony at this convention,
with coaches working together, just like it's been over the last
five years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back, however, to the '80s and we'd sit there at the
convention and glare at each other. That guy across from you was
cheating, you knew it, and you knew it had cost you a kid. It was
dog-eat-dog.''
</P>
<P>
   In Teaff's opinion, university presidents either stopped hiring
the coaching Capones or severely curbed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to make it really stick, we had to have the rule changes
on recruiting,'' he added. ``First and foremost was the removal of
alumni from the recruiting process. There was never a major
recruiting scandal that didn't heavily involve out-of-control
alums.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much a coach thought he could organize his
alums, there was always one, or more, thinking he had to do
whatever was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a rule change on coaches having personal contact
with a recruit, resulting in a ``dead period'' from Sunday night
until the signing day on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rule restored sanity to the process,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, most all the shenanigans took place the night
before signing day, or the morning of,'' Teaff said. ``Out of
nowhere, a kid changed his mind on you. Everyone knew why, we just
couldn't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the AFCA, Teaff is now pushing for more changes, such as
an early signing date. He says it would eliminate ``commitment''
switching, plus cut the cost of recruiting. ``There are details to
work out on that, although I feel it's do-able,'' Teaff said. ``But
the most important thing is we now have recruiting under control,
and everything else is fine-tuning.''
</P>
<P>
   If true, that's a long, long way from the way it was, when the
only defense of a nailed coach was a feeble, ``I didn't know.''

Longhorns can claim a national title.

<P>
   Thanks to the change of mind by quarterback Chris Simms, Texas
signed a recruiting class yesterday that most experts rated the
nation's best. Simms is regarded as the nation's top offensive
player; the Longhorns also signed linebacker Cory Redding of
Houston, considered the nation's top defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Simms' decision to attend Texas was icing on the cake,''
said Bobby Burton, editor of the ``National Recruiting Advisor''.
``Their group of offensive recruits might be the best in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any coach, \RTexas'\S Mack Brown has awakened a
sleeping giant,'' Allen Wallace, publisher of SuperPrep magazine
said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas kept kids at home while going out and signing the
nation's top talent, too,'' said Tom Lemming of The Prep Football
Report. ``But Texas' class is not a dominant class like some of the
best classes in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominant or otherwise, Brown said yesterday's haul represented
``the best class I've ever been associated with'' in 24 seasons as
a college football coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a class that can jump-start us back into the
elite of college football,'' Brown said. ``Some people say being
rated No. 1 in recruiting means absolutely nothing. But you'd
rather be rated No. 1 than 50th. That's a no-brainer. The guys who
are on this list are players that everyone else wanted as much as
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' recruiting resurgence helped reverse a decade-long trend
of the top players leaving the state to play elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M, following its rival's lead, also signed a class that
is considered among the nation's best. Austin-based recruiting
analyst Bobby Burton believes the Aggies signed an excellent group
of defensive players. A&AMP;M also signed Joe Weber, a top-notch
running back from California.
</P>
<P>
   The other schools with top classes were Ohio State, UCLA,
Georgia, Notre Dame, Miami (Fla.), Alabama, Michigan and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State was disappointed when wide reciever Reggie Brown
stayed in his home state and signed with Georgia. The Bulldogs
brought in some of the nation's top wide receivers, which should
make sophomore quarterback Quincy Carter happy.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, whose board of regents is expected to make a
decision tomorrow about the school's possible move to the Big Ten
Conference, again had outstanding recruiting success. The Irish did
especially well in stocking up on offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They signed the right guys almost to a person,'' Lemming said.
``It was perfectly planned, a masterful class.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Notre Dame was disappointed when quarterback C.J. Leak
of Charlotte, N.C., pulled one of the biggest surprises of
yesterday's signings. Leak spurned the Irish, Penn State and
Michigan State to sign with Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Burton called Leak's decision ``the biggest surprise'' of the
recruiting season.
</P>
<P>
   National champion Tennessee, which is expected to be go into
next season as the No. 1 team, signed a solid class that could have
been better. The Volunteers were jilted by several top recruits,
the most notable of which was Simms, who orally committed to
Tennessee in December.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State, which had just 12 scholarships available, made a
late rush that left coach Bobby Bowden smiling. The Seminoles
landed running back Nick Maddox plus quarterbacks Anquan Boldin and
Fabian Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality wise, it's going to be mighty hard to beat,'' Bowden
said. ``We don't have many needs this year, and it's hard to
recruit when you can't show them they'll play right away.''
The nation's top 10 Star-Telegram college football writer Wendell
Barnhouse ranks the nation's top 10 recruiting classes: School
Conf. Class comment 1. Texas Big 12 QB Chris Simms lifts Horns to
the top 2. Ohio State Big 10 Buckeyes continue to stockpile the
talent 3. UCLA Pac-10 Another top class, but where's the defense?
4. Georgia SEC Bulldogs sign 3 of the top wide receivers 5. Notre
Dame Ind. Irish drop after losing QB C.J. Leak 6. Texas A&AMP;M Big 12
Aggies load up on defense, especially LBs 7. Miami (Fla.) Big East
Butch Davis gradually rebuilding 'Canes 8. Alabama SEC Rebuilding
'Bama gets more top players 9. Michigan Big 10 Failed to land
needed defensive linemen 10. Tennessee SEC National champs whiffed
several key signings

SEAVER TO REPLACE McCARVER IN METS' TV BOTH 
 (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball history books do not readily show that during their
playing careers Tim McCarver ever knocked Tom Seaver out of a game.
But Wednesday Seaver knocked McCarver out of the Mets' broadcast
booth.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that Seaver said was long overdue, the Mets brought
back their Hall of Fame pitcher to serve in a variety of roles,
most visibly as one of their announcers for the 50 games this
coming season and the 40 games next year that will be televised by
WPIX-New York. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under a two-year contract, Seaver will also work for the Mets in
uniform, beginning with a 10-day period in spring training and
continuing throughout the season as an organization-wide pitching
guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the general manager, the manager or the
pitching coach,'' Seaver cautioned during a conference call with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I wonder why it didn't happen five or six years ago.
I'm just glad we've been able to get me back and get me involved. I
feel I can help the organization in many aspects. I think I'm
capable of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   But in bringing back the greatest player in their 37-year
history, the Mets dumped perhaps the best television analyst they
have ever had. McCarver said only last week that he was prepared to
return for his 17th season with the Mets ``if I'm wanted,'' but he
found out Wednesday that he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to do your job from a journalistic standpoint,''
McCarver said, ``and I can walk away knowing that I exercised every
bit of my journalistic integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that Seaver was replacing McCarver instantly prompted
speculation that manager Bobby Valentine had a hand in the change.
McCarver is rarely shy about offering on-air opinions and has been
critical of Valentine at times. In turn, the manager has been said
to not care for the comments. But Valentine and Mets executives
denied any link. ``It's a front-office decision,'' General Manager
Steve Phillips said. ``Bobby didn't do anything to push this one
way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bingham, the club's senior vice president for marketing and
broadcasting, said: ``This didn't start as Tim. It started as Tom.
It started as a desire to bring Tom in. Tim was here for many, many
years. He had a long and very good career here. It was not a desire
to get Tim out.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine called McCarver ``a fine broadcaster'' who knows his
baseball. ``I had nothing to do with it,'' Valentine said by
telephone from Aspen, Colo., where he was skiing. ``I'm not the
reason for Tim losing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager said he welcomed the addition of Seaver to the team.
``I've been a proponent for this type of thing to happen,''
Valentine said. ``I'm very happy he's going to be part of the '99
Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingham said the Mets considered having Seaver and McCarver work
together but decided both did their best work as analysts, not as
play-by-play broadcasters. He said the Mets hoped to keep Gary
Thorne and Ralph Kiner, the other two members of the over-the-air
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver's path of return to Shea Stadium, where he has not been
since August 1992, began last summer when his agent, Matt Merola,
called Nelson Doubleday, the Mets' co-owner, and, according to
Seaver, asked, ``Why isn't Tom involved in your ball club one way
or another?''
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday, Seaver said, talked to Phillips, and Phillips
contacted the former pitcher. (The Mets' acquisition of Mike Piazza
last season came about in the same way.) The broadcasting element
of his employment, Seaver said, ``came from both sides talking
about how to best utilize Tom Seaver working for the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   His dual role as club employee and broadcaster raised the
objectivity issue, but both Seaver and club officials asserted he
could comment and analyze with integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue we thought about and discussed,'' Bingham said.
``We addressed this issue with Tom. I think anyone who knows Tom
knows he's going to be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver said he didn't want to be just a broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would find it somewhat hollow,'' he said, ``if I wasn't
allowed to use my expertise, what I know about pitching, in helping
this organization. I insisted that be part of the deal. It would be
silly not to have me do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his role in the organization will develop ``as we go
along, as we find out what is needed and what they feel I have to
offer. I don't think they know, and I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he felt he could help pitchers with ``the mental
part, the physical part, the mechanical part, all the nuances that
pitching is about. I feel I can help the whole spectrum of
pitchers, from the rookie coming into camp to the veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Seaver back is part of the Mets' attempt to correct an
oversight. They basically have ignored their past. Former Met
Mookie Wilson, one of their coaches, is a rarity in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do need to connect more with our history,'' Bingham
said. ``We wanted to reconnect with Tom. He's an icon of our
club.''

CAVAN HAPPY WITH BIG CLASS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rice went for defense, Tulsa reeled in big linemen and SMU took
a little of everything in the store, as the members of the Western
Athletic Conference's local quadrant pronounced themselves pleased
with their signing-day catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really pleased with the way things worked out,'' said SMU
coach Mike Cavan, who called his group of 24 signees ``the best
class they've had here in quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The group included the pitch-and-catch team of quarterback Kelan
Luker and wide receiver Cody Cardwell that led Stephenville to a
Class 4A state title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think Luker can make an immediate impact?'' Cavan said,
laughing. ``Well, considering we have only one guy on campus who
has played quarterback in a Division I game \RJosh McCown\S, I'd
say he \RLuker\S has a pretty good shot at No. 2 right away. I'm
certainly not going to play it myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also felt that Cardwell, though he received less publicity,
was just as good a catch for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope those Stephenville people start coming to our
games like they came to Texas Stadium four weeks in a row in the
playoffs. We've got plenty of room, and I'm instructing our ticket
manager to open a booth down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Other high-profile SMU signees included Carthage running back
Kris Briggs, Houston Wheatley receiver Chris ``The Comet''
Cunningham, defensive tackle Warrie Birdwell from Mission, and
Waxahachie linebacker Khalid Beard _ plus swift Marcus Carter, who
played four positions at Rusk, and 6-foot-6, 280-pound tackle
Sterling Harris from Terrell.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has already developed a warm friendship with C.B.
Williams (6-6, 270), a tackle from Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``They plan to room together so they can wear each other's
shoes,'' Cavan said. ``They each wear a size 18.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs also signed Harris' brother, linebacker Devonric
Johnson, ``who is a great student and was probably headed for the
Ivy League if he hadn't come here,'' Cavan said.
</P>
<P>
   Although 11 of Rice's 17 signees line up on defense, there are
also three quarterbacks who coach Ken Hatfield is excited about.
</P>
<P>
   One is Jeremy Hurd, who led Duncanville to a state title, has
turned in a 24-foot, 6-inch long jump, and is considered the
state's top option quarterback. Then there is Kyle Herm, a
multisport star who led Stanton to a 16-0 state championship season
as a junior and set a state Class 2A record for career touchdown
passes with 81. The third prospect, Diboll's Jeff Vanover, was
all-area at QB and all-state (3A) as a linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   And while 11 of Tulsa's 22 signees are linemen, the prize of the
class is quarterback Josh Blankenship of Tulsa Union _ the first
Oklahoma high school player of the year in 15 years to sign with
the Golden Hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa coach Dave Rader described Blankenship as ``the
prototypical quarterback for the one-back offense, and a terrific
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also the son of Union coach Bill Blankenship, who was
Rader's roommate when they played together at Tulsa 20 years ago.

TEXAS FINISHES SWEEP OF UTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas designated hitter Steve Woodward said a two-game
series sweep against UT-Arlington has made the Longhorns even more
excited about the upcoming weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Texas defeated UTA, 9-3, yesterday at Disch-Falk Field behind a
one-hitter through five innings by junior left-hander D.J. Jones.
The Longhorns opened the series with a 5-2 victory Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With a three-game series opening against defending national
champion Southern California on Friday, Woodward said it was
important for Texas to prove it can play every phase of the game.
Against UTA, the Longhorns did.
</P>
<P>
   Texas pounded out 12 hits, and has played the first 18 innings
of 1999 without an error.
</P>
<P>
   In the series, seven Texas pitchers allowed five runs on 10
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we played against UTA, I think we showed we can
compete against anybody,'' Woodward said. ``Our defense made plays,
we hit the ball, ran the bases and got good pitching. You can't do
much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas (2-0) did it with a mix of last season's veterans and some
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman first baseman Jeff Ontiveros, a native of nearby Round
Rock, gave Texas a 1-0 lead in the second inning with a solo homer
to left off UTA starter Ben Grundhauser (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Longhorns outfielder Jason Cox drove in a run with a sacrifice
fly in the third, and Woodward hit a solo homer in the fourth to
give Texas a 3-0 lead. That was all Jones (1-0), a transfer from
Navarro College, would need to earn the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Through five innings, Jones struck out five and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored four runs in the sixth, all with two outs, and UTA
(0-2) fell behind, 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored seven of its nine runs with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to put people away with two outs,'' UTA coach Butch
McBroom said. ``We didn't pitch very well at all in the two games.
I thought we would eventually face somebody we would hit, but we
weren't able to keep the game close.''
</P>
<P>
   After facing Texas pitcher Ryan France for two innings without
success, UTA got some offense in the eighth inning off the
Longhorns' third reliever, Scott Hild.
</P>
<P>
   UTA second baseman Joe Kennedy hit a one-out single, followed by
a single to right by Matt Mize. John-Paul Davis made it 9-3 with a
homer to left-center field before Adam Bush grounded out to end the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys were able to build rallies and sustain them,'' Texas
coach Augie Garrido said. ``The attitude of the team was good. They
were unselfish and gave 100 percent in their roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Mize, Davis and Martin, hitting third, fourth and fifth in UTA's
order, went 8-for-21 in the series. The rest of the team went
2-for-42.

MORRISON'S LEGACY: LIVE AND RACE FOR TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the final four months of 1998, Buddy Morrison put his
signature on a drag-racing season he knew he never would see.
</P>
<P>
   When the cancer that Morrison had been battling for over a year
claimed him Dec. 15 at age 54, the futures of Reher-Morrison Racing
Engines and its Pro Stock drag-racing team were secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy did everything he could to make it easy for the
business,'' said David Reher, who formed RMRE in 1971 with his
friend and fellow Arlington resident. ``From mid-September on last
year, we talked a lot about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison also spent some quality time with Bruce Allen, the
driver he chose to succeed the late Lee Shepherd in 1985 when
Reher-Morrison-Shepherd ruled as four-time National Hot Rod
Association and two-time International Hot Rod Association Pro
Stock world champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy was like a mentor to me,'' said Allen, also of
Arlington. ``One of the things we talked about a lot was not living
in the past. He said, `Today's the day when you get out there
racing.' Buddy was always looking down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Minus Big Buddy and admittedly behind in their off-season
preparation, Reher and Allen hope to begin the hard climb back
among drag racing's elite during the season-opening AutoZone
Winternationals. First-round qualifying is scheduled for today at
Pomona (Calif.) Raceway, where Reher-Morrison-Shepherd scored their
first official national event Pro Stock championship victory in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a series of encouraging quarter-mile passes during the
Pro Stock SuperBowl Challenge at Houston Raceway Park last weekend,
neither Reher nor Allen is touting any storybook endings for
Southern California. The competition in Pro Stock figures to be as
cutthroat as ever, beginning with qualifications to fill the 16-car
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Allen did not qualify for 12 of 22 national events last year,
including three of the last four. Allen, who tumbled from fourth to
13th in the points standings in 1998, did record the fastest speed
of his 14-year career in Baytown on Sunday. His top lap at 199.07
mph capped a weekend filled with elapsed times in the low
6.9-second range.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we saw other people running good,'' said Allen, driver of
The Outlaw Fuel Additives Pontiac Firebird. ``We saw Mike Thomas, a
Pennzoil teammate, run 200 \Rat 6.845-seconds\S. We want to get
into that 200 mph area.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the team plans to debut a new Don Ness-built
chassis for the season's second race at Phoenix later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have two new engines with different concepts as far as
induction and cylinder heads that aren't together yet,'' Reher
said. ``We're looking in-depth into a lot of things. It's not all
gloom and doom.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly as Buddy Morrison willed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted us to carry on as well as we could, and I think
we'll do a good job,'' Reher said. ``I'll always miss Buddy. But I
consider that he's still helping us.''
QUICK HITS HILL'S HOPES HIGH
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a one-year contract extension from Pennzoil, former
Top Fuel champion Eddie Hill of Wichita Falls continues to defy the
NHRA's timers. And Father Time.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who turns 63 next month, earned the No. 1 qualifying spot
during the PRO National Time Trials at 4.632 seconds and 297.55 mph
at Firebird International Raceway in Phoenix last month. Hill, who
also will perform crew chief duties this season, qualified for all
22 national events last year. His current qualifying streak of 40
consecutive races would be stout for a driver half his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly, we're all smiling,'' said Hill, the 1993
NHRA Winston Top Fuel champion and winner of the season-opening
Winternationals in 1995. ``I can't remember the last time I was
this excited about racing.''
CLUTCH PERFORMER
</P>
<P>
   The switch is on from a four-disc to a five-disc clutch system
in Top Fuel and Funny Car, a technical innovation Cory McClenathan
believes will produce a win/win for drivers and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This five-disc clutch doesn't slam you into the back of the
seat three-quarters down the track,'' said Cory Mac, who will debut
his new black-and-green MBNA America-sponsored Top Fuel car at the
Winternationals. ``This clutch is going to help the cars run easier
and quicker and faster passes. That will make for exciting
side-by-side racing _ and a lot less smoking of the tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the season goes on, I think you'll see some big differences
in elapsed time and mile per hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time and reigning Top Fuel champion Gary Scelzi owns both
ends of the national record _ 4.525 seconds and 326.44 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we might top-out at 328 this year,'' said
McClenathan, runner-up to Scelzi the past two seasons. ``But after
what I saw in testing, we could very well see 330.''
FIRE DOWN BELOW
</P>
<P>
   No drag racer can talk his way into a competitor's head like
John Force, the reigning and eight-time NHRA Funny Car champion.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Capps, runner-up to Force last year despite winning five
national events in the Copenhagen Chevrolet Camaro Z/28, insists
that ``The Brute'' did not psyche him out down the stretch last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm good friends with John,'' said Capps, who will attempt to
defend his Winternationals title this weekend. ``He brings a little
more motivation out of me. I've built a deep-down fire for him over
the winter and want to take the title from him.''
CANNON TAKES AIM
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Cannon's debut in Funny Car figures to be a hot story at
the Winternationals.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken Cannon is the six-time and reigning International
Hot Rod Association Pro Modified champion. Cannon, 36, earned his
NHRA license at Gainesville (Fla.) Raceway in December and plans to
debut a Pontiac Trans-Am-bodied car at Pomona, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping an eye on Scotty Cannon. He's a real
competitor,'' said Force, who is scheduled to debut a redesigned,
aerodynamic 1999 Castrol GTX Ford Mustang body tweaked by NASCAR
guru Jack Roush. ``All he \RCannon\S thinks is `win.' Those kind of
guys, they get you on the ropes and you got to fight them.''
</P>
<P>
   Capps said he recently met Cannon after watching his IHRA
exploits on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love watching the Pro Mods on TV, and how he would kick
their butts and take their names and then tell them about it,''
Capps said. ``He's going to talk some trash to Force and everybody,
but he's a smart cookie. I'm very impressed with him.''
TESTING AND TUNING
</P>
<P>
   The first of six all-day open test sessions have been scheduled
at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis for this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Saturday and Sunday, AAA Texas Test Days are
booked for Feb. 13-14, Feb. 27 and March 6. Gates will open at 10
a.m. with time trials from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tech cards will cost
$20.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunoco Season Kickoff, a $25,000 Bracket race, is scheduled
for Feb. 20-21. First O'Reilly Drag Racing Series points meet of
the season is booked for Feb. 28.
LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll fall off the wagon. They're tough, and
we need to rise to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Cory McClenathan, on 1997-98 Top Fuel champion Gary Scelzi and
owner/tuner Alan Johnson
SPOTLIGHT ON ...
MEYER BIDING TIME ON MOTORPLEX MOVE
</P>
<P>
   The pace has slowed on Billy Meyer's plan to relocate the Texas
Motorplex drag-racing facility from Ennis to Grand Prairie. That
does not mean Meyer is spinning his corporate wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reviewing plans on some expansion out there,'' said
Meyer, the Waco businessman and former Funny Car driver who has
spent 12 months negotiating a possible move into the heart of the
Metroplex's entertainment corridor. ``We are communicating with
Ennis and Grand Prairie. But I haven't been trying to force the
issue with anybody. We're quite successful where we are, and I
think we'll have quite a bit of news in the next quarter that will
be exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Two NHRA national events again highlight the calendar at the
all-concrete quarter-mile. O'Reilly Auto Parts has reached a
multiyear agreement to sponsor the NHRA Fall Nationals on Oct.
21-24. It will be the 14th edition of the race formerly known as
the Chief Auto Parts Nationals and Revell Nationals _ the
longest-running major motorsports event in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The third annual Castrol Nationals is scheduled for April 22-25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growth rate was huge at the spring race last year _ over
20 percent,'' Meyer said. ``So that race is still in a growth
pattern. The fall race's growth was about 4 percent. But we really
can't `grow' that race on Sunday. We can grow it on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday. About the only thing spectators can do now is
be smart enough to buy tickets in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans looking for national events on TV will have to
channel-surf. ESPN, ESPN2, TNN, Fox and ABC will carry drag racing
this year, with 14 of the 20 races scheduled for either live or
same-day coverage.
</P>
<P>
   TNN, which carried 11 live events last year, is down to four one
week-delayed shows and live coverage of the U.S. Nationals on Labor
Day Weekend. Meyer said the argument that the NHRA's daylong
elimination format is an awkward fit for live TV is weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to use golf as an analogy,'' Meyer said. ``A golf
tournament is carried live, but they don't show every single inch
of the day. The process NHRA came up with has some pretty good
stuff, live and taped. Just because it's an all-day event doesn't
mean it can't be live at the end of the day. They need to improve
the show itself with competition and production.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd just as soon everybody come out and see it live.''
INSIDE THE NUMBERS Thundering across Texas
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Motorplex in Ennis and Houston Raceway Park in Baytown
have produced six of 10 current professional quarter-mile national
elapsed time and mph records in the NHRA's Winston Drag Racing

YOU CAN'T ALWAYS COUNT ON A COUNTEROFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some questions from the workplace: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --What are your chances for a counteroffer? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume you're a valued worker who just announced a new job
offer. Now you are waiting for your current boss to try to keep
you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even employers who rant about high turnover and the difficulty
of retaining good people may not cough up a counteroffer. A recent
survey by Robert Half and Accountemps found that 56 percent of the
executives surveyed might try to the persuade an employee to stay,
but 42 percent said that was unlikely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the unemployment rate is so low, willingness to counter
has increased in recent years, said Michelle Hersh, vice president
of the temporary-staffing service in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many won't counter because they want to ``avoid challenges
to their compensation scale when other staff learn of the agreement
and question their own salaries,'' she said. Also, some employers
``may have lingering concerns about an employee's loyalty after a
counteroffer is accepted.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --What does customer service mean to you? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Kansas Citian Harry Hall, it sure isn't those convenient 800
numbers. Hall spent more than an hour on the phone Wednesday
morning trying to reach an employee who works at an AT&AMP;T office in
downtown Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hall thinks he spoke with AT&AMP;T customer service representatives
in Miami, Salt Lake City and somewhere in West Virginia. The 800
numbers are the only ones listed in the local phone book. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``For the life of me, I couldn't get to a living soul in Kansas
City,'' Hall said. ``No one would give me a phone number for the
office right here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If it had been an emergency, AT&AMP;T would have taken Hall's
message and contacted the worker. Because Hall was trying to reach
the worker for business reasons, he was out of luck _ and not happy
about it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Have you tried to give any input lately? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I sometimes write about organizations involved in
``empowerment'' or ``teamwork'' or ``flattening hierarchies.'' The
efforts are designed to improve communication with the staff and to
hear from people whose jobs would be most affected by policies or
procedures at stake. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's the goal, anyway. I recently heard a real-life story that
shows how many workplaces fall far short. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A worker told her boss, ``I have a suggestion for the suggestion
box.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aware we had a suggestion box,'' he responded, and
walked away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Do you know where your ``gig line'' is? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The smartly dressed man knows. It's the vertical axis along
which the shirt buttons, tie, belt buckle and pants zipper should
lie. A zigzagging gig is a no-no. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's from /{Attention to Detail: A Gentleman's Guide to
Professional Appearance and Conduct/}. In addition to addressing
the finer points of office attire, author Clinton T. Greenleaf III
attempts to rid the world of ``dead fish'' handshakes and other
killers of good impressions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a quick read that covers a lot. Perhaps a graduation gift?

WOMEN MAKING PROGRESS AS PROFESSORS BUT STILL LAG BEHIND MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL and LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women are making inroads as professors on college campuses but
still suffer disparities in pay and promotions, a national study
shows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In just under 25 years, the percentage of women faculty members
has increased from 22.5 percent to 33.8 percent, according to the
study released this week by the American Association of University
Professors. But many women are in lower-level positions such as
lecturers and instructors; only 18.7 percent of the top-ranked
category of full professors were women in 1997-98. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The findings do not surprise faculty members in Kansas and
Missouri. At the University of Kansas, 14 female professors have
formed a caucus to figure out why women aren't rising more rapidly
in the ranks there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not pounding our fists on the table,'' said KU law
professor Ellen Sward, one of the organizers. ``We are trying to be
cooperative. At the same time we are trying to be firm about things
we think need to be done.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The study lists a variety of reasons why women lag behind men:
from subtle discrimination, to traditionally lower expectations for
women to the strains of juggling career and family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At KU, 14 percent of the full professors employed in 1997 were
women. The numbers were similar around the region. Women made up 13
percent of the full professors at the University of
Missouri-Columbia and 16 percent at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the January-February issue of
/{Academe/}, indicates that more than half the women are in lower
positions such as lecturers and instructors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997-98, the study said, women represented 55.6 percent of
lecturers; 58.6 percent of instructors and 46.8 percent of
assistant professors _ the profession's full-time entry level
position. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Although women are rapidly increasing as a proportion of the
profession they tend to be relegated to less desirable positions at
lower salaries and at somewhat less prestigious institutions than
men,'' said study author Ernst Benjamin, director of research at
the American Association of University Professors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is some evidence of discrimination,'' Benjamin
said. ``But I think also there is a pattern that women are
systematically offered less desirable positions and they take them
because they are less mobile than men _ they have to stay where
their families are _ or they work hours that are more restricted,''
also because of their families. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to cluster in low-paying fields, such as English,
instead of higher-paying disciplines such as engineering, he said.
And because many women are new entrants in academia, they tend to
have less seniority than men, which affects their salaries and
promotions, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discrimination that goes on is subtle, said Mary
Gibson, national chairwoman of the association's Committee on the
Status of Women in the Academic Profession. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``(Subtle discrimination) is much more difficult to identify and
deal with,'' said Gibson, an associate professor at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, N.J. ``It's done by absolutely
well-intentioned people who don't even recognize they are
discriminating.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that a male professor's research article will
be considered more valuable than a female's, even when the article
is exactly the same, Gibson said. It's difficult for society to
overcome the ingrained notion that men are more capable than women,
she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sward said women in the KU caucus are aware that subtle
discrimination exists, as well as some that is more blatant. They
formed the caucus last semester, she said, after receiving
anecdotal evidence that ``some women were running into problems,
some (of which were) fairly serious.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sward declined to provide specifics. However, she said, ``women
should be failing at same the rate as men in promotion and tenure
and they are not.'' Women are failing more often, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The caucus had its first public meeting last week. The women are
working with administrators to gather information on equal pay,
tenure and promotions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all on the same side here,'' Sward said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at Kansas State, KU and UMKC said they believed
they are making progress in hiring more women and are trying to
promote more to the higher ranks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our situation is tied directly to our salary problems,'' said
Ron Downey, an assistant provost at K-State. Retaining women is
difficult, he said, because K-State's salaries are lower than the
salaries paid at other universities of similar size. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several administrators and faculty members at UMKC said the
environment there has become much more woman-friendly over the past
few years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deans are trying to ensure that women are considered as
candidates to fill faculty job openings. Women who have children
and household responsibilities are less afraid to talk about them
because many male colleagues are taking on more household duties
themselves. With more women teaching on campus, there's a better
support network and a more welcoming atmosphere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the environment here now is superb. Of course, some
women faculty might have different opinions,'' said Marvin Querry,
executive dean//vice provost at UMKC. ``Historically there have
been cases where women were not treated fairly. But I would hope
it's getting more favorable. If problems exist, we try to correct
them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carla Klausner, a history professor at UMKC for more than 25
years, said she has seen ``a great deal of change here in the last
10 to 15 years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She remembers getting out of graduate school and hearing that
some colleges just weren't hiring women. And she felt some
discrimination when she first came to UMKC, especially because
women weren't receiving equal pay. &QL;

TCU'S RECRUITING CLASS LAUDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A couple of weeks ago, TCU football coach
Dennis Franchione traveled to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   He was to visit with Bo Schobel, a highly recruited defensive
end who long ago said he'd be attending TCU.
</P>
<P>
   He also discovered a reminder of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the phone on the wall, there was a letter from me dated
Jan. 20, 1998, offering him a scholarship,'' Franchione said. ``And
I was there Jan. 20, 1999. So, it has a been a culmination of a
year of work and preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first year, Franchione has recruited a class loaded with
players just like Schobel, players who had a chance to go anywhere,
but, instead, chose TCU.
</P>
<P>
   TCU has secured unheard of recognition about its class from
recruiting analysts both in Texas (behind only Texas and Texas A&AMP;M)
and nationally (a Top 20 program by some analysts).
</P>
<P>
   Franchione received 19 faxes from recruits committing to TCU
yesterday, his last coming at 11 a.m. from Dallas Kimball tailback
Ricky Madison. With a junior-college fullback already on campus,
TCU finished with a recruiting class of 20.
</P>
<P>
   Faxes came from Fort Worth's most sought-after recruits _
Dunbar's twins Jerome and Jerrod Braziel, Wyatt's Donald Burrell
and Boswell's Chad Pugh _ and from recruits like DeSoto's Casey
Printers and Lamar's Tommicus Walker _ wanted by schools such as
Texas and Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think TCU just did a great job recruiting us and the players
in this area,'' Jerome Braziel said.
</P>
<P>
   When Franchione sent Schobel that letter a year ago, he had his
doubts about landing the defender.
</P>
<P>
   He faced the task of selling a 1-10 Horned Frogs team to players
also being courted by programs such as Texas, Texas A&AMP;M and Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Waco Robinson's John Glud bought into Franchione's message in
August, selecting TCU instead of A&AMP;M and Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was the first one,'' Glud said. ``I had a feeling the
first day I went to TCU's camp that something special was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Bishop Lynch's Matt Orlovsky, Printers and Schobel
followed soon after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were four really good commitments right from the get-go
that not only got you some guys but got you some real quality
football players,'' Franchione said. ``You certainly have to
appreciate those guys who jumped on board when we were trying to
win instead of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Being first and early brought a few negatives.
</P>
<P>
   Glud and Schobel both had friends asking: ``Why TCU?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tired of people asking: `Why TCU?' '' Glud said. ``That
\RSun Bowl\S victory just said: `That's why TCU.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schobel also had a chance to go anywhere, his name littering Top
100 lists everywhere. He visited Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Family drew him to TCU. His father, Bob Schobel, played for TCU
from 1969-72. His cousins, Aaron and Matt, play for TCU now.
</P>
<P>
   A numbering system already has been planned. Matt looks to wear
No. 7. Aaron already wears No. 14. Bo says he plans to wear No. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Schobel had committed long before he left for El Paso and
TCU's Sun Bowl victory against USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a lot better that day,'' Schobel said. ``I remember
thinking that we have a good chance to become a national power.''
</P>
<P>
   His fax arrived first yesterday and was waiting for Franchione
upon his arrival at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Schobel had just a few last demands before signing, including
``a guaranteed weekly supply of homemade \Rnot store-bought\S
chocolate chip cookies'' and the ``eldest daughter of the most
well-paid coach at TCU should also be made available.''
</P>
<P>
   A joke, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Smiles and laughs were plentiful at TCU, though. So, Franchione
played along, signing off on Schobel's farcical requests and faxing
back a message of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have the rest of the staff start on daughters
immediately. Just please, please sign!''

   WASHINGTON _ He was supposed to have been the most hostile
witness of all, the one who wouldn't check his grudges at the door,
despite the setting.
</P>
<P>
   But Sidney Blumenthal, the opinionated journalist-turned-White
House adviser who is reviled by Republicans, walked into the
Senate's national security briefing room to be deposed Wednesday
and immediately blunted those sharp edges, prompting one House
prosecutor to go so far as to call him a ``gentleman.''

   When it was over, both sides agreed that no new ground was
broken, but the House managers of the impeachment case called
Blumenthal's testimony ``productive'' and said it would help them
to bolster the official record on their accusations that Clinton
obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers did try to raise issues outside the articles
of impeachment, beginning to question Blumenthal about Kathleen
Willey, congressional officials said. Ms. Willey has accused
Clinton of groping her, an allegation he denies. The accusation,
and her allegations that she was subsequently harassed by an
unidentified person after her testimony in the Paula Jones case,
are under investigation by the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers, led by Lanny Breuer, objected to the
questions delving into the Willey matter. Blumenthal was permitted
to answer, but said he knew nothing about Ms. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   During one objection on an undisclosed issue, the five presiding
senators in the room, led by Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and John
Edwards, D-N.C., asked that the room be cleared as the senators
decided what to do.
</P>
<P>
   During the one hour and 15 minutes of the deposition, Blumenthal
testified, as he had before the grand jury on three different
occasions, that in a conversation with President Clinton on Jan.
21, 1998, Clinton described Monica Lewinsky as a mendacious
``stalker'' who sought an intimate relationship with him. But
Blumenthal said he never repeated it to reporters, congressional
officials said. And he added that Clinton never instructed him to
spread the story or perpetuate the lie, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never leaked any conversations,'' Blumenthal is reported to
have said to prosecutors. ``I never spoke to any reporters about
any personal conversations with the president about Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton lied about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, Blumenthal replied, ``Yes,'' the officials said. And he
noted that Clinton never apologized to him for the lie.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., the leading questioner for the House
on Wednesday, asked sharp, precise questions that required short
answers, the officials said. He was joined by Rep. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., who inquired mostly about the ``politics of personal
destruction'' that he believes dominates White House strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Through their questions, the two House prosecutors hoped to
illustrate that Clinton had used Blumenthal to try to destroy Ms.
Lewinsky's reputation by engaging in a smear campaign. The term
``stalker'' later showed up in some news reports. They also
maintain that Clinton intentionally gave false information to
Blumenthal so that it would be passed on to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the president was talking about preparing, if
necessary, to disparage her reputation,'' said Rep. Ed Bryant,
R-Tenn., one of the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal is long despised by Republicans as the man behind
Hillary Rodham Clinton's accusation that a ``vast right-wing
conspiracy'' was out to get the president. Blumenthal has also been
accused of masterminding the disclosure last year that Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., had a long adulterous affair nearly 30 years ago.
Blumenthal has denied that accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said, ``I found him to be a gentleman, and I hope he felt
the same way about us.''

LAVIN AMONG THOSE IMPRESSED BY PAYNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even if Oregon State loses the rest of its games,
UCLA's Steve Lavin plans to vote for Beavers coach Eddie Payne for
Pac-10 Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Payne has been that much better than his competition _ turning
an amalgam of transfers and secondary recruits into a respectable
outfit that has defeated Arizona and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers are 5-4 in conference play (11-7 overall) entering
visits to USC tonight and UCLA on Sunday. That classifies as a
minor miracle in Corvallis, considering they won a total of eight
conference games from 1996-98.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers have a decent chance to finish higher than seventh
place for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne has done a tremendous job getting them to buy into his
team concept,'' Lavin said. ``They've embraced the game plan and
they've identified roles. It's not so much the players they have as
the way they play.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Payne) will get my vote for Coach of the Year regardless of
how they finish.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Payne's performance unique is his seamless rebuilding
of Oregon State's core. Six players left the program after the
1997-98 seasons, including guard Carson Cunningham, who transferred
to Purdue, and guard Corey Benjamin, who entered the NBA last
spring. The Beavers start four junior college transfers and
sophomore guard Deaundra Tanner, yet they're as cohesive as
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, in his fourth year, is taking the success in stride. The
Beavers do not have the talent to sustain their current standing
(fourth place), and they have the grueling L.A. and Arizona road
trips looming this month, plus a trip to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it for a night and wake up the next day and go back to
work,'' he said of the watershed victories over UCLA and Arizona.
``But we're aware it's a journey, not a destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much margin for error. We have to play every
possession like it's the last possession and take advantage of our
opportunities. We're still deficient from an athletic standpoint,
and we have to overcome that by being precise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers benefit from being Oregon's travel partner _
visitors have concentrated on the Ducks and dismissed Oregon State
as an easy victory _ and from a grinding style that befuddles
faster teams.
</P>
<P>
   But defense has fueled the Beavers' success. Oregon State leads
the Pac-10 in field goal percentage defense (36.5), and it has held
league foes to 18.6 percent shooting from 3-point range in Gill
Coliseum. Payne's strategy is to deny the opponent what it does
best: with UCLA, the Beavers prevented Baron Davis from
penetrating; with Arizona State, they smothered Eddie House on the
perimeter; with Arizona, they contained Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Oregon State _ perhaps the hardest step _ is
to learn to win on the road. The lesson continues this weekend in
L.A..
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs down: Granted, Lavin shouldn't have acted the way he
acted at Washington and Baron Davis shouldn't have said what he
said. But the Pac-10 office compounded the problem by mishandling
their respective punishments.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner is Davis, an emotional 19-year-old who said
something he shouldn't have _ that referee Terry Christman
``cheated'' the Bruins _ without knowing the potential
repercussions: reprimand, probation, suspension. He was embarrassed
publicly and strong-armed into an apology.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner is Lavin, 34, who knew the rules, knew
exactly what he could say, and made several incriminating remarks.
Regardless of whether he actually used the buzzwords _
``referees,'' ``officials,'' or ``Terry Christman'' _ everyone knew
exactly what he meant. But because his comments were cloaked and
calculated, he received a private reprimand: Gee, Steve, please
don't do that again.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in offenses was not commensurate with the
difference in penalties. Davis paid a much higher price for saying
what Lavin knew enough to infer, and that's not fair.
</P>
<P>
   And by forcing Davis into an apology, commissioner Tom Hansen
undermined the credibility of the apology itself. (UCLA released a
three-sentence statement that Davis presumably did not write.)
Davis' post-practice comments Tuesday seemed sincere, but they
didn't have to be to serve their purpose. The league was so eager
to make an example of Davis, it tarnished the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Around the West: The Connecticut-Stanford collision Saturday at
Maples Pavilion lost much of its significance with the Huskies'
loss to Syracuse and the injuries to star Rip Hamilton and center
Jake Voskuhl.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has a thigh problem and is expected back this week, but
Voskuhl is out with a stress fracture. Without him, the Huskies
don't have the frontline muscle to match Mark Madsen and friends.
Stanford by double-digits....Doesn't it seem like Utah's Rick
Majerus does the best coaching job of his life every year? Quietly,
his Utes have become one of the hottest teams in the country....
The area's best non-Pac-10 game of the season takes place Feb. 19
in Malibu, where Pepperdine hosts Gonzaga in a West Coast
Conference showdown....Any Associated Press pollsters voting for
New Mexico should have the privilege rescinded. The Lobos have won
one road game, San Jose State; they lost at New Mexico State by 21,
and they scored just 39 points at home against Utah.... Now that
he's eligible at a four-year school, watch for Schea Cotton to
surface close to home, perhaps at Pepperdine or USC. &QL;

   ARAFAT (Gaza City, Gaza Strip) _ Suha Arafat, the first lady of
the Palestinian territories, would seem an unlikely partner for the
69-year-old revolutionary, who remains forever wedded to his cause.
She was raised in a well-off home in the West Bank, educated by
nuns and refined at the Sorbonne. And her deep-seated Christian
faith and Western assertiveness seem at odds with his world:
desperate Gaza with its veiled Muslim women. But in ideology Mrs.
Arafat, whose husband is to meet on Thursday with President Clinton
in Washington, is every bit the fiery Palestinian freedom fighter.

spray-painted copper or silver, understand, but objects molded of a

   GERMANY-FURNITURE-FAIR (Cologne, Germany) _ Material was the
message at the International Furniture Fair, where retailers find
the broadest range of contemporary furniture available. Exhibitors
_ some 1,600 from 46 countries _ were out of new ideas about form,
stuck as they were in the minimal, spare look of the 1970s. So they
turned to substances for inspiration. The materials of the moment
are neither cutting edge nor high tech. Instead, designers
experimented with the tried and true _ wood, glass, stainless steel
and porcelain _ with surprising results. Here's a preview of the
designs likely to cause the biggest ripples when they arrive in
America this spring and summer. By Arlene Hirst.

ISLANDERS, BACK TO THEIR LOSING WAYS, FALL TO RED WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Bill Stewart's coaching career in the NHL got off to a
good start, but the momentum has stopped and he is now seeing how
wretched his Islanders can play.
</P>
<P>
   After Stewart replaced Mike Milbury behind the bench on Jan. 21,
the Islanders won their first two games and then earned a tie. But
now, Stewart must try to turn his team around from his first NHL
losing streak. The Islanders lost their second in succession
Wednesday night, a 5-1 defeat administered by the Detroit Red Wings
in Joe Louis Arena. In their last two games, the Islanders have
been out-scored 14-3. They play on Thursday night in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selfish penalties,'' Stewart said, referring to third-period
infractions called against Robert Reichel and Zigmund Palffy. The
penalties made a comeback all but impossible. ``Missed check on the
second goal,'' he said, referring to Mariusz Czerkawski, who played
less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not good enough for this league,'' Stewart added, referring to
the team in general. ``I wasn't too pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Rich Pilon, the rugged defenseman, who was knocked down
by a punch from Detroit's Darren McCarty, who also scored two
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have to step up and start playing for the team instead of
yourself,'' Pilon said. ``You can't keep blaming the goalie or the
coaches. We're all men. You've got to be prepared to make
sacrifices.'' Pilon said his teammates should wear ``work boots''
instead of ``ballet slippers'' and that the new coach means
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to make it stop,'' Pilon said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Yzerman, Martin Lapointe and Brendan Shanahan also scored
for the Wings, who held a 3-0 lead after 26 seconds of the second
period. Sergei Nemchinov scored the Islanders' goal, cutting the
lead to 3-1 at 1:29 of the second. Shanahan's goal came in the
game's last second, beating goalie Tommy Salo, who faced 44 shots.
</P>
<P>
   In the other net, the Wings had an interesting rotation. Chris
Osgood, the regular first-stringer, did not suit up due to a case
of the flu. His replacement was Kevin Hodson, who left in the 18th
minute of the first period when a finger on his right hand was cut
when he stopped a shot. He was replaced by Norm Maracle, who
stopped 19 of 20 shots he faced. Hodson stopped the other eight
before he left.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first appearance for Maracle since he was arrested
last Sunday morning in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak and charged
with drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I wasn't expecting to play,'' Maracle said. ``I was a
little down. Obviously, I made a big mistake, and I want to
apologize. I'm supposed to be a professional athlete and
professional athletes don't do that. We get a lot of kids who look
up to us. It doesn't look good. I know it'll never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty, who has battled his own alcohol problem, said of
Maracle: ``Everybody makes mistakes. We're here to support him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty seemed especially energized Wednesday night. In
Detroit's previous game, a 2-2 tie in New Jersey, McCarty said he
regretted not avenging the deeds of Devils enforcer Krzysztof
Oliwa, who put two Wings defensemen _ Larry Murphy and Todd Gill _
out with injuries and later threw Yzerman around by the face mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's more upset about the other night than I am,'' McCarty
said. ``It's something you don't forget. It's not going to happen
again.''

TEXAS DEFENSE STOPS A&AMP;M

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With Texas A&AMP;M calling a team meeting in the
lane every time Texas threw the ball into either Chris Mihm or Gabe
Muoneke, the Longhorns had to find some other avenue to victory.
</P>
<P>
   They found it along a well-worn path _ defense.
</P>
<P>
   Texas converted 30 A&AMP;M turnovers into 30 points and finally put
away the stubborn Aggies, 71-59, last night before a season-high
Erwin Center crowd of 12,915.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns (13-9) won for the 10th time in 11 games and
boosted their Big 12-leading record to 8-1. The Aggies (9-10)
dropped to 2-7.
</P>
<P>
   UT point guard Ivan Wagner led the defensive charge with a
career-high and Big 12-record 10 steals, though he also committed
five turnovers against a well-designed A&AMP;M defensive scheme. He
scored nine points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking off the court tonight Ivan said how sorry he was about
the turnovers _ you've got to love a guy like that,'' UT coach Rick
Barnes said. ``He did a great job converting some plays when he
came up with steals.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's 10 steals tied a school record (B.J. Tyler, 1994) and
broke a Big 12 year-old standard of eight set by A&AMP;M's Michael
Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a conscious effort to step up our defense tonight
because against UMass \RSunday\S it just wasn't there,'' Wagner
said, referring to Sunday's 76-65 victory against Massachusetts.
``I thought they were telegraphing their passes, or their moves, a
lot. I tried to anticipate and stay a step ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half was as bad as we played in a long time. Our
offensive execution wasn't good at all. We raced up and down the
court with them and didn't get settled \Roffensively\S, but we
didn't lose our composure to where we felt like we couldn't win the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attention, Mihm managed his seventh consecutive
double-double with 11 points and equaled a career high of 17
rebounds. By converting 10 of 12 opportunities from the line,
Muoneke scored a game-high 19 points. Kris Clack added only 12, but
Texas got strong bench support as guards Will Clay and Chris
McColpin scored eight each.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Aggies scorer Shanne Jones did not score for the first
time in his career in only 18 minutes. A&AMP;M now has 60 costly
turnovers in its past two games against Oklahoma State and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty seems to be our magic number,'' A&AMP;M coach Melvin
Watkins said. ``Some of those are very disturbing because we turned
it over for a lack of being able to dribble the basketball at
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to compete at the highest level and we did some
of the time. A great atmosphere. It should make for some good
basketball down the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he wasn't surprised by the Aggies in the first
meeting between his team and Watkins'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Melvin and know how his teams play _ they play hard,''
Barnes said. ``But this is what February is about. Teams are going
to compete and you have to be ready to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are right now we're going to have to take everyone's
best shot and that's great. When you do that, it makes you
better.''
