<HEADLINE> New Prime Minister Appointed in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- King of Nepal Birendra today
appointed Lokendra Bahadur Chand as prime minister of a new
coalition government which is to replace the outgoing one led by
Sher Bahadur Deuba, the royal palace announced here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Chand, parliamentary leader of the National Democratic Party
(RPP), submitted to the king a petition earlier in the day for
forming a four-party government by claiming majority support in
the 205-seat lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The new ruling coalition is expected to comprise Chand's RPP
party, the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML), the Nepal Goodwill Party (NSP) and the Nepal Workers and
Peasants' Party (NWPP), sources said.
</P>
<P>
The RPP and the NSP had been ruling partners of the outgoing
government led by Deuba's Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
The Deuba government resigned last Thursday after losing a
confidence vote in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Chand, 57, a two-time prime minister during the partyless
Panchayat legislature which ended in 1990, has played a crucial
role in bringing down the Deuba government.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of an RPP faction led by Chand and the NSP party
from the NC-led coalition resulted in Thursday's defeat in a
confidence motion tabled by Deuba in parliament for his
government.
</P>
<P>
The former main opposition the CPN-UML, with its 90 MPs in the
house, will demand vice-prime ministership and other important
posts in Chand's cabinet, which is expected to be announced
Tuesday, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Senate Chairman Meets U.S. Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Senate leader Wasim
Sajjad said today that Pakistan is striving to improve its
economic situation, promote privatization and boost a liberal
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad made the remarks during a meeting here with a
nine-member delegation of the U.S. Council of Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan was also striving to improve the law and order
situation and foster good relations with all countries, the
neighboring states in particular.
</P>
<P>
A number of crucial economic measures were being worked out by
the government with a view to bailing the country out of the
difficult economic situation, said Sajjad.
</P>
<P>
He said the government enjoyed the trust of the business
community, and expressed the hope that Pakistan's economy would
pick up soon.
</P>
<P>
The Senate leader asked the U.S. corporate sector to invest in
Pakistan, promising that impediments to foreign investments would
be removed.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan would like to resolve all bilateral issues peacefully
and was prepared to hold discussions with India on all contentious
issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, so as to arrive at a peaceful
negotiated settlement of the core issues, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that resolution of the disputes would provide the
necessary impetus for peace, security and development in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad expressed the hope that the visit by the US delegation
would lead to a better understanding of the domestic situation in
Pakistan and more investment opportunities that the Pakistani
Government wants to extend to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the delegation, Maurice Greenberg, said that
peace in the region would automatically help in attracting foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan needed to build infrastructure and increase
the domestic savings rate which is believed to be too low.

<HEADLINE> EU Reimposes Minimum Prices on Computer Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
reimposed minimum prices on DRAMs which originate in Japan and
South Korea and are sold in the EU, but companies will not be
obliged to raise their prices during March.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed 60-percent anti-dumping duties on DRAMs from
Japan in January 1990 and 24.7-percent anti-dumping duties on
South Korean-made DRAMs in March 1993, after Japanese and South
Korean exporters were accused of dumping on EU markets.
</P>
<P>
But these measures were suspended 21 months ago following a
price rise in DRAMs.
</P>
<P>
The EU reintroduced the anti-dumping measures on the ground
that prices of most DRAM products have fallen below the production
cost and EU DRAM producers are suffering losses.
</P>
<P>
However, the European Commission decided to carry out those
measures in a flexible, gradual way in order to minimize the
potential risks of destabilizing the DRAM market, until an overall
review of anti-dumping restrictions is completed in June this year.
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesman said that the EU has informed Japanese
and South Korean exporters of its latest decision in the form of a
memorandum of understanding.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea to Get COMESA's Road Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea is to obtain yellow
card and road transport facilitation within the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the latest issue of weekly
''Eritrea Profile'', a COMESA seminar on the yellow card scheme
operations and road transport facilitation was held recently in
Asmara, capital of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was designed to familiarize the private sector,
business community and government institutions in Eritrea with
the various COMESA transport facilitation instruments that will
enable them to explore the business opportunities available in
the COMESA region.
</P>
<P>
In an opening statement, Bunyabarenzi (one name), director of
transport and communications in the COMESA secretariat, called on
the entire business community in Eritrea to play a more effective
role in using the various COMESA transport facilitation
instruments and benefit from the advantages of the vast market
opportunities available in the COMESA region.
</P>
<P>
He said the immediate tasks of the regional grouping are to
remove all barriers to intra-COMESA trade and investment and
increase competitiveness in all areas, including production and
service sectors.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA treaty came into force on December 8, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: US Loses Credibility With UN Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has expressed his regret that the United States should
have vetoed a U.N. Security Council's resolution to condemn
Israel's decision to build a Jewish neighborhood in the Arab
residential areas of east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president was speaking on the eve of his meeting
with U.S. President Bill Clinton this morning.
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that the veto should have been adopted by the
United States. Without the veto, it could have given a signal to
the Israelis not to go through violating the agreements (between
the Israelis and Palestinians), not to create problems for the
peace process," Mubarak told the CNN "Late Edition" program in an
interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States has lost credibility as an honest
broker among the Arabs by its move against the U.N. Security
Council's resolution.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab world have an idea that the United States is a fair
partner in the peace process. But I think with the veto, I think
it will create much more -- a feeling of injustice from the United
States," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. veto in the U.N. Security Council has contradicted
Clinton's remarks when he said the Israeli housing plan could only
"build mistrust" during his meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he would ask Clinton to pressure Israel to reverse
its decision to build 6,500 homes in east Jerusalem, which was
captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to ask President Clinton to take his influence,
to use his influence with the Israelis to just stop this," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned Israel that its handling of the thorny issue of
Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem without consulting with the
Palestinians may explode the whole peace process in the Middle
East.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Auctions Ready in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for the opening of
Zimbabwe's flue-cured tobacco auctions are progressing well
despite concern that this year's crop could be well below
farmers' expectations.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Tobacco Association Public Relations Director Lal
Taylor today said that farmers are busy making preparations for
this year's auction floors which are expected to open on April 22
and run until mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco farmers are this year expected to deliver between 215
million and 220 million kilograms, up from about 201 million kg
last year which earned the country about 527 million U.S. Dollars
in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Taylor noted that due to heavy rains this season, the
country's tobacco farmers had been forced to down-size their crop
projections from the initial estimates of between 235 million to
240 million kg.
</P>
<P>
''Fortunately the quality of the crop has not suffered and all
indications show there will be increased demand this year,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> India, Russia to Continue Nuclear Cooperation: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said today that India and Russia will
continue cooperation to build a nuclear power station in India.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question in the lower house of the Indian
parliament here, Gujral said that Moscow has not changed its mind
in helping India build the Kudankulam nuclear power station after
Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's visit to the United
States, which has reportedly pressured Russia not to help India
with the nuclear power project.
</P>
<P>
A cooperation agreement to help India build a nuclear power
station was signed in 1988, but its implementation was delayed due
to political changes in the erstwhile Soviet Union, Gujral said.
</P>
<P>
This particular advanced technology for setting up a
1,000-megawatt nuclear power station is not available with Indian
scientists, who are keen to go ahead with it, added the minister.

HANOI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A 60-Megawatt hydro-power station
will be completed in Laos by 1999 to help eliminate poverty in the

<P>
The diversion dam is reported to be 80 kilometers north of the
capital Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
KPL said the project, expected to be operational by the end of
1999, will provide electricity to nearby households and industries.
</P>
<P>
Laos will also sell some of the energy to Thailand, which is
expected to earn some 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the project, including a 140-kilometer transmission
line, is estimated at 112.6 million dollars, KPL added.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Will Win General Election: John Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- British ruling Conservative Party
leader John Major said here today the conservatives were behind in
1992 but came back to win.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Talk Radio, Prime Minister John Major said Britain
was outperforming its European Union partners with lower inflation
and lower unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Labor Party for offering lightweight
policies. "This is not a country where you can deal with long-term
problems with short-term snappy solutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Major, who has faced severe problems in uniting his party over
Europe, insisted that calls from right-wingers such as MP Sir
George Gardiner for him to rule out British membership of a single
European currency were not in the country's interests.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his view that the time had not yet come to decide
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he would be prepared to use Britain's EU vote
to stop countries joining a single currency if their economies
were not ready for it.
</P>
<P>
"If they were likely to go ahead in the wrong circumstances, it
is in the British national interest to stop them doing so," Major
said.
</P>
<P>
If a single currency were "botched" without Britain joining
it, the pound sterling could rise sharply against it. "That would
make all our exporters uncompetitive," Major said.
</P>
<P>
With a general election expected in May, Major's Conservatives
were staggered by right-wing MP Sir George Gardiner's decision to
join the Referendum Party last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It has pushed Major into a two-seat minority in parliament and
play its part in putting the Conservatives some 20 points behind
Labor in the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Major dismissed the group Gardiner has joined as "a one-issue
party with a remarkably shortsighted view."

<HEADLINE> Board to Look Into Zimbabwe's Reserve Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A board comprising military
experts has been set up to look into the intricacies of forming
the envisaged national reserve defense force to be called up
during war emergencies.
</P>
<P>
defence minister moven mahachi announced formation of the
reserve force late last year, saying a 9.09 million U.S. Dollars
fund had been set up to equip the force which will comprise
retired soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Forces Headquarters of Zimbabwe said today in a
statement, ''the board is now complete. An announcement will be
made in due course once the findings and recommendations have
been approved by the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
Formation of the reserve force comes at a time when the
Zimbabwean army is trimming its force from 51,000 to a manageable
40,000-strong one in line with international trends of cutting
defense budgets.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Paradzai Zimonte has already been appointed the
Chief of Staff of the Reserve Force.

<HEADLINE> Greece Satisfied Over Agreement to End Crisis in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece has expressed its
satisfaction over an agreement reached between Albanian President
Sali Berisha and his political opponents to end the crisis in
Albania and pledged support in efforts to complete the nine-point
deal.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said in a statement
today that Prime Minister Costas Simitis telephoned Berisha Sunday
night to express "his satisfaction over the reaching of the
agreement."
</P>
<P>
The nine-point agreement, signed Sunday after two days of talks
and mediation by top European envoys, called for the formation of
an interim all-party government to supervise general elections to
be held in June.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said the Greek premier also "stressed the need for the
completion of all steps in finding a final solution and assured
Berisha of Greece's support in the efforts of the people of
Albania to achieve progress, development and democracy."
</P>
<P>
Reppas described the agreement as a "positive development" and
expressed the conviction that "Albania's political forces will
make every effort to lead the country out of the present crisis
through political consensus and peaceful procedures."
</P>
<P>
According to him, Greece is concerned over the situation in the
neighboring country, fearing that the crisis will harm the
interests of the ethnic Greeks, lead to the influx of large
numbers of refugees and destabilize the peace in the region.

8,000 to 10,000 European workers of the Renault automaker will
stage a protest in Paris Tuesday against the auto group's decision
to close its assembly plant in Vilvoorde, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators will gather outside the Renault headquarters
in Billancourt, west of Paris, and will march around its outskirts
before organizing a "European picnic," while the committee of
European group of Renault is holding an extraordinary session at
Boulogne-Billancourt.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian, French and Spanish unionists are calling for the
"obtaining of real negotiations and annulation of the measures
taken" to close the plant, which they described as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted the unionists as saying
that "alternative solutions exist for industrial policy and
significant reduction of working hours" to avoid the closure of
the Vilvoorde plant and other layoffs.
</P>
<P>
They also called on Renault's leadership, the European
Community and the public powers of Belgium and France to change
their attitude.
</P>
<P>
The committee of European group of Renault, which is a purely
consultative organ gathering representatives of workers from the
Renault headquarters and its branches in Europe, will discuss
"evaluation and perspective of the strategy of Renault" and the
"motivation of cessation of activity of the Vilvoorde plant and
its consequences on employment."
</P>
<P>
But it is little probable that the committee will start Tuesday
negotiations with the president of Renault, Louis Schweitzer, said
AFP.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the unionists are trying to gather enough force
from all the European plants of Renault to pressure the leadership
to step back on its decision, before starting deep-touched
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The workers of Renault plants in France, Belgium and Spain
staged a one-hour strike last Thursday to protest the closure of
the Vilvoorde plant, which will result in the layoff of 3,100
workers.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Brushes Aside Arafat's Warning of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today brushed aside the warning issued by
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat that
the peace process was in "real crisis."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held consultations with coalition members on
coalition crisis and the mounting tension with the Palestinian
side before departing for a two-day visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Arafat's warning, Netanyahu said that the
Palestinians now finally realized that a new national government
had taken office in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader said the message had been conveyed to
the Palestinian side by Foreign Minister David Levy during his
Sunday night's meeting with Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen) and other Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
Abbas today offered resignation to Arafat to protest over
what he described as Israel's continued violation of the
signed peace accords. Arafat has yet accepted his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Levy rejected the Palestinian protests over Israel's decision
on the first stage of troop pullbacks, its plan to build
Har Homa neighborhood in southeastern Jerusalem, and its order
to close four Palestinian offices in eastern Jerusalem. Levy
stressed that Israel would proceed with construction in Har
Homa despite the PNA's strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu repeated that the Arab world would understand that
his government would stand firm behind all interests of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
PNA Secretary Ahmed abdel Rahman attacked Israel for "freezing
everything." He warned that the PNA was ready to freeze the
peace process if Israel continued violating the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
In another angry reaction, Palestinian Council
Speaker Ahmed Qreia (Abu Ala) today demanded suspension of
peace talks with Israel. He also called for international
examination of further implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian
interim agreement. But international intervention needs agreement
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The PNA is increasingly angry with a series of hardline
moves taken by Israel, including the decision on pulling back
troops from only 9 percent of the West Bank in the first
stage, the plan to build the Har Homa neighborhood in
southeastern Jerusalem and the order to close four Palestinian
offices in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said that Israel should have made the
decision on further troop redeployments through consultations with
the PNA, which hoped to gain up to 30 percent of West
Bank rather than the 9 percent. Levy insisted that Israel
retain sole right of deciding the scope of further pullbacks.
</P>
<P>
Late today, Arafat will convene a meeting of PLO's Fatah
Central Committee to formulate the next response to Israel's
latest moves which he condemned as "conspiracies and tricks"
that threaten the peace process.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peace-keepers in Angola Start Pulling Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Uruguayan peace
keepers started to pull out of Angola last weekend under a
decision by the U.N. Security Council at the end of 1996 on the
gradual withdrawal of all U.N. peace-keepers from the country.
</P>
<P>
All Uruguayan peace-keepers will withdraw before March 14 from
the southern African country, Lieutenant Puaa (one name), a
spokesman for Uruguayan peace-keepers said in central city Huambo
today.
</P>
<P>
Namibian peace-keepers will start pulling out of the country on
March 24 and Portuguese logistics personnel will end their duty
of terms here after a month, said the official Angolan News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan peace-keepers hope the lasting peace will come
to the land suffering from almost 20 years of civil war as soon
as possible, said Puaa.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 U.N. peace-keepers arrived in Angola in early
1995 soon after a peace accord was signed by Angola's warring
sides.
</P>
<P>
However, the final date when all U.N. peace-keepers leave the
country is not available.

<HEADLINE> AL Official: Israel Tries to Create "No War No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- In the latest expression of the
Arab frustration over the stalled peace process, an Arab League
(AL) official today accused Israel of trying to create a state of
"no war no peace" in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is trying to create a no-peace-no-war situation, the
same status that existed between the 1967 and 1973 Middle East
wars," said Arab League Assistant Secretary General Said Kamal
Said.
</P>
<P>
However, he voiced doubt about the viability of such a
state. "The current no-peace-on-war situation will be
short-lived, as it did not last in the post 1973 period," he
added.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. rejects the U.N. intervention to challenge Israeli
settlement activity, she is required, in turn, as the sponsor of
peace, to play a positive role and rescue the peace process, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The international community has come to the conviction that
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is looking for pretexts
to terminate the peace process and "equate the oppressed with the
oppressor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arab outrage has been mounting over the recent Israeli
decisions to build new Jewish homes and close four Palestinian
offices in East Arab Jerusalem, as well as pull back from only 9
percent of the rural West Bank, instead of 30 percent as the
Palestinians had expected.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. veto of a European-sponsored U.N. Security Council
draft resolution against the Israeli settlement plan dealt
another blow to the Palestinians who are getting increasingly
frustrated with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. veto has virtually created "a feeling of injustice"
in the Arab world, as observed by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who is currently on a five-day "saving-pace" tour in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat is
reportedly so pessimistic about peace talks with Israel that he
is thinking of leaving the self-rule Gaza Strip and moving his
operations to Cairo. But Mubarak has advised him against the
idea, which is feared to arouse confusion among his people and
put Israeli-Palestinian relations out of control.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Distribute Food Relief in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
will this year distribute 2.9 million tons of food worth 1.4 Billion
U.S. Dollars as relief and development supplies to 90 countries
including Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
WFP country Director Irene Lacy told reporters here today it
was estimated so far that Tanzania needs 10,000 tons of maize and
1,000 tons of pulses to feed about 200,000 people who have been
affected by famine.
</P>
<P>
She said the exact requirement would be known after the monitoring
team which was dispatched to the affected regions today to assess the
situation, submitted their report.
</P>
<P>
'However we have recommended for an immediate supply of 10,000 tons
of maize and 1,000 tons of pulses," she explained, adding that the
team will be due back on March 25.
</P>
<P>
The WFP official further said the food would be procured
within Tanzania and later distributed to the affected areas, the
operation which was expected to take place before the end of this
month. It would cost the program between four and five million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the WFP official, the monitoring team will visit
Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Coast, Lindi, Morogoro, Dodoma, Singida, Tabora,
Shinyanga, Mwanza and Mara regions to estimate the number of affected
people and identify locations of the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said worldwide, a total of 50 million people were
expected to benefit from this WFP's supplies.
</P>
<P>
She further said half of the targeted people would benefit through
development projects whereas relief supplies would cover 14 million
displaced people, seven million refugees including 400,000 Zaire and
Burundi refugees currently in the country and four million victims of
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The director said the supplies would be made by her organization in
recognition of the importance of food to human life.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no food there will be no peace, no democracy and no
development," she stressed.

<HEADLINE> President: Turkey Attaches Importance to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said here today that Turkey attaches importance to its
relations with neighboring Iran.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the press office of the presidential
palace said that Demirel expressed his anxiety over the recent
diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Iran during his meeting
with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati.
</P>
<P>
Velayati arrived here this morning for conveying to Demirel
an invitation from Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to attend
a summit meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) scheduled in December in Tehran, capital of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Demirel stressed that the ties between Turkey and Iran should
go on in the way of respect to the principles of mutual
interests, friendship, good neighborhood and not interference
with other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Velayati, Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan said that Turkey attaches importance to the
Turkish-Iranian relations, the prosperity of the people and the
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that the ties between the two countries had gone
forward in the past one year and Turkey and Iran are friendly
countries.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Velayati said that Iran and Turkey "had put
some difficulties under control with clever attitude and
patience in the past few days."
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with his Turkish counterpart Tansu
Ciller, Velayati said that they held a "constructive and
productive talk" for the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that it is necessary to make more
cooperation not only in the bilateral relations, but also in the
international and regional issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Velayati had brought with him a message
from Rafsanjani concerning the current diplomatic dispute
between the two countries, which resulted in exchange of
expulsions of diplomats by both sides.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was triggered by Iranian Ambassador to Ankara
Muhammed Reza Baqeri who made a pro-Sharia (Islamic law) speech at
the commemoration of anti-Israeli "Al-quds (Jerusalem) Night"
gathering in the Turkish city of Sincan, 40 kilometers west of
Ankara last month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Demirel sent Turkish Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Ali Tuygan as special envoy to Iran and handed
over a written message to Rafsanjani in a bid to improve the
strained ties.

<HEADLINE> Canada Helps Tanzania Drill Wells in Dar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The government of Canada
has authorized an emergency contribution of 40.8 million Tanzania
Shillings (about 68,000 US Dollars) for the provision of wells to
key medical institutions in three districts of Dar es Sallam.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here today by Canadian High Commission
said Canadian High Commissioner to Tanzania Verona Edelstein has
authorized the money as an immediate response for the water
scarcity in the Ilala, Kinondoni and Temeke districts of Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the Canadian move was due to the Prime
Minister's efforts to mobilize resources in curbing the city
water crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In dealing with the critical water situation of Dar es
Salaam, this contribution will be made to the Tanzania Red Cross
Society (TRCS) and will be funded by the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA)," it added.
</P>
<P>
The TRCS will undertake a program of drilling one bore-hole at
each of the district hospitals while 40 shallow wells will be
installed in the three districts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Since last month, when the water level fell at River Ruve
following a prolonged dry spell in the country, some parts in the
city have been experiencing water scarcity, and out of them,
Ilala, Kinondoni and Temeke are most hit districts.

<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind said here today that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is still the bedrock to European security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Writing in an article to the Times newspaper today, Rifkind
said that NATO, which formed the bedrock of European security for
five decades, "is still our insurance policy against any serious
threat to peace in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Rifkind noted that enlarging NATO will be significant not only
to those Central European countries but to NATO member states as
well.
</P>
<P>
"By adding to the stability of Central Europe, we reduce the
risk of our sons and daughters ever having to fight in another
European war," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The prospect of joining NATO is helping Central European
countries to overcome ethnic and territorial disputes. And once
these countries feel secure, they will have the confidence to
develop better relations with Russia."
</P>
<P>
On Russo-NATO relations, the British foreign secretary said
that no European country is more important to European security
than Russia, whose size and importance demand that it should be
treated as a full partner.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that neither the new NATO nor the its
enlargement poses a threat to Russia, as "the alliance has no
plans, no intention, no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the
territory of new members."
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that a deal will be struck this summer between
NATO and Russia to create a new strategic partnership," he added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon FM Describes European Peace Formula As </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz today described the European-sponsored peace formula based
on the principle of "total withdrawal for total security" as
"preliminary."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz made the remarks after a meeting with European Union
(EU) Middle East peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos this
afternoon, who delivered the formula to Lebanon today.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister said that it is acceptable on
the condition that the formula meets the Arab position generally
and the Lebanese and Syrian position particularly, which demands
a complete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
"Because of this the first part of the expression really
constitutes the Lebanese and Syrian demand," the foreign
minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"For the second part," he said, "if it means the security to
which the Arab states should commit themselves, rather than
rights Israel will have on the lands it will withdraw and
conditions to limit the sovereignty of those Arab states, it
becomes acceptable. "
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on difference between the new formula
and the"land-for-peace" principle, Boueiz said, "what Moratinos
is suggesting is actually a preliminary formula through which he
is trying to activate the peace negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process was inaugurated on the principle
of exchanging land for peace which was defined in the Madrid
conference in October, 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The land-for-peace principle includes the term of peace
which entails a determination of future political and other
relations, while the new formula deals only with the security,
which is easier to be achieved than the peace," the foreign
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason the formula could be a bridge if it is
clearly crystallized and if Moratinos successfully persuades the
parties in the peace process to accept it," Boueiz added.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived here from Damascus, the capital of Syria,
this morning to continue his peace mission in the region. He
held a meeting with the Lebanese foreign minister in the
latter's office.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges Clinton to Use Influence on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak today said the United States as a "full partner" in the
Middle East peace process should use its influence to pressure
Israel to reverse its decision to build a Jewish neighbor in Arab
east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At a photo session before his discussions with President Bill
Clinton at the White House, Mubarak told reporters, "The president
is a full partner in the peace process. Without the United States,
it would be very difficult to continue the peace process. So it's
very important to have his influence."
</P>
<P>
Asked about a U.S. veto last Friday against a U.N. Security
Council resolution to call on Israel to abandon its housing
project in east Jerusalem, Clinton said he will answer the
question later this afternoon after his talks with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Sunday that it was unfortunate that the United
States vetoed the U.N. resolution, which would only encourage
Israel to push on with its housing construction in east Jerusalem
leading to a possible flare-up of violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move in the United Nations could lose its credibility
in the Arab world, and the Arabs would feel injustice played on
the U.S. side in handling issues like Jewish settlements in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said he would ask Clinton to use his influence to stop the
Israeli government from carrying on with the construction plan.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world was angered over the U.S. veto and a Saudi-owned
newspaper urged Arab countries Sunday to boycott American products
including weapons.
</P>
<P>
The boycott would force the United States to "suffer from the
same means it uses against Iraq, Iran, Cuba and any country that
opposes its policy," the newspapers Al-Hayat said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Economic Forum (WEF) has
decided to quicken the implementation of its World Electronic
Community (WELCOM) inaugurated in early February, according to a
press release by the WEF here today.
</P>
<P>
Because of growing demands from the participants since the WEF
annual meeting in Davos, WELCOM will be implemented at a fast pace
and reach more than 1,000 global decision-makers by the end of the
year, the WEF said in its release.
</P>
<P>
An agreement has been made between the United Nations and the
WEF to equip the secretary-general and the heads of the UN
agencies with WELCOM in order for the UN to have better and faster
coordination and more efficient management.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the virtual community to be established among
WEF members and constituents, specific applications of WELCOM are
under discussion with organizations like the World Bank and the
international financial community to create a special hotline to
deal with possible global financial crises.
</P>
<P>
The new system is said to enable WEF members and constituents
to open up new business opportunities, facilitate expanded
commerce, joint ventures and strategic alliances, and enhance
global business and government understanding.
</P>
<P>
Some of the services WELCOM offers are multi-point
video-conferencing both with WELCOM and non-WELCOM members, a
24-hour multilingual concierge service, crisis management support,
direct face-to-face counseling with world experts and
organizations such as the World Trade Organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian farmers were today
advised to sow anti-drought, short-maturing crops as well as
cultivate plain areas.
</P>
<P>
The National Meteorological Services Agency of Ethiopia
forecast that dry weather, prevalent for a long time in most
parts of the country, will not change in the coming 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Despite expectations of good rainfall distribution this month,
the amount of rainfall in some parts of the country would be
minimal, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency warned that this year cultivation would be hampered
in regions where expected rainfall is small.
</P>
<P>
The season with short rains, usually starting from
mid-February to May in Ethiopia, has not come until March this
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency said that no change is expected in the
southern and southern-eastern lowland areas where there is acute
water shortage for people and animals due to failure of rains
since last September.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Blasts US Veto of UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon today sharply criticized
the U.S. veto of a draft resolution by the U.N. Security Council
demanding Israel to abandon a recent housing plan in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in his office, Lebanese Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz said that the U.S. veto not only
"violated principles of the Middle East peace process," but also
"preempted the Security Council and paralyzed its role."
</P>
<P>
After a two-day debate, in which some 50 countries criticized
Israel's housing plans in East Jerusalem, Washington vetoed the
Security Council draft resolution, which denounced the plans as
"illegal and an obstacle to peace."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister pointed out that the veto also
violated the original policy of the U.S., which had announced
that it did not support or encourage Israel's settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
"What is more dangerous is in the veto's form, since the
U.S. automatically uses its right of veto whenever Israel and
its interests are involved," the Lebanese official said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. veto prompted an angry reaction from Arab
countries which called for an emergency session of the U.N.
General Assembly to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Drafted by the European Union, the resolution enjoyed the
support of the U.N. Security Council's other 14 members.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda have pledged continued supports for closer regional
cooperation among the three eastern African countries.
</P>
<P>
Their pledges were made in their messages published today in
commemoration of the forthcoming March 14 first anniversary of
the establishment of the Secretariat of the East African
Cooperation (EAC).
</P>
<P>
In his message, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, the current
chairman of the EAC Authority, pledged "unqualified support" to
the forging of closer social and economic ties among the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa sent a message to the EAC
Secretariat which was set up on March 14 last year, saying that
"much has been done in this first year to create a firm
foundation on which to continue building our cooperation."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the political will to stay the course in our
three capitals remains firm and unshaken."
</P>
<P>
During the past year, he said, agreements have been translated
into greater practical cooperation in eastern Africa, leading to
a "faster and balanced social and economic progress".
</P>
<P>
In his statement on the eve of the first anniversary of the
EAC Secretariat, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said that
notable achievements have been made in the past year in building
a foundation for the re-integration of eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the regional cooperation would lead to
production on a larger scale, create more competition, improve
efficiency and result in better products.
</P>
<P>
The three presidents urged the Secretariat to work tirelessly
toward the speedy realization of the objectives of the East
African Cooperation.

KAMPALA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni held a one-hour meeting with visiting Islamic spiritual
leader Aga Khan here today on economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he held talks with Ugandan Vice-President Specioza W.
Kazibwe on some social and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stressed the importance of continued cooperation

</P>
<P>
Since then the network has made significant achievements in
Uganda, including the rehabilitation of the Aga Khan School
complex in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Aga Khan, 60, who arrived here on Sunday for an eight-day
visit to the east African region, has several million followers

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Clash With Israeli Soldiers In Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting tensions between
the Israelis and the Palestinians, the Israeli military
authorities today declared Hebron a "closed military zone"
following clashes between Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based
in East Jerusalem, the clashes took place after the arrival of Israeli
bulldozers, accompanied by some 100 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The bulldozers began work on a new road between the settlement
of Kiryat Arba and the Ibrahimi Mosque in the center of the West
Bank city, running over Palestinian land adjacent to the Jewish
settlement. The land was planted with grape vines and olive trees.
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinian protesters suffered minor injuries during
clashes with Israeli soldiers, border guards and police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 200 Palestinian protesters marched from Beit
Sahur, near Bethlehem, toward Har Homa, site of the would-be
new Jewish settlement in the Arab East Jerusalem, only to be
stopped by Israeli security forces at the Jerusalem municipal
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
In East Jerusalem itself, the PLO Office Orient House
became a scene of confrontation between Palestinian residents and
Israeli rightwingers this afternoon. Israeli and Palestinian
demonstrators shouted insults to each other across the street
and briefly scuffled until they were separated by police.
</P>
<P>
While Faisal Husseini, member of the Executive Committee of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, was meeting with three members
of the Israeli Knesset (parliament) Interior Committee, another
member of the committee, Benny Elon, joined the rightwing
demonstrators calling on the government to close Orient
House. Elon is from the ultra-right party of Moledet.

PARIS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said today during a meeting with General Fu Quanyou,
chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army of
China, that the French government highly estimates the foreign
policy of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
He said that France and China hold identical views over many
international issues and are having cooperation and dialogue in
some important fields.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Franco-Chinese relations make up an important
part of France's foreign policy, and that the visits to France of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Chinese Premier Li Peng in 1994
and 1996 have greatly pushed forward Franco-Chinese cooperation.
</P>
<P>
De Charette also said that the visit to be paid by French
President Jacques Chirac to China in May will be an important step
in developing Franco-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that France and China share a joint desire to develop
bilateral relations in the political, economic, trade and military
fields, and that the two countries have increased high level
dialogue on political issues and security since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou said that the Chinese government and army pay great
importance to developing relations with the French government and
the French army.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past two years, Sino-French relations
have further developed and high-level contacts between the armed
forces of the two countries have been frequently made.
</P>
<P>
He said that to maintain good Sino-French relations will
benefit not only the two countries, but also world peace,
stability and development.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Going On in Kaya Town in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese government spokesman,
Brigadier Tayeb Al Tayeb Ibrahim Mohamed Kheir, said today that
fighting was still going on in the town of Kaya adjacent to the
Ugandan borders.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who is the Minister of Culture and Information,
said that the attack on the Kaya area was initiated from within
Ugandan territory targeting Sudanese border towns and villages
which are few hundred meters from the Ugandan borders.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the offensive was mounted by large
numbers of tanks and heavy artillery which the Sudanese rebels did
not possess.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Minister described the attack as "practical
manifestation of the aggressive designs as pronounced by Uganda
President Museveni when he openly disclosed a few days ago that
his problem with the Sudan would be settled in the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The General Command of the Sudanese Armed Forces issued a
statement Sunday accusing Uganda of launching attacks on
Kaya, shelled the "Bazi" town and opened a route to the rebel
forces to proceed towards "Yei" area" of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese national democratic alliance which groups northern
Sudanese opposition and southern Sudanese rebels launched a large
scale offensive in eastern Sudan on January 12, occupying the
towns of Kurmuk and Qissan close to the borders with Ethiopia. The
Sudanese government had then accused Ethiopia and Eritrea of
committing aggression against eastern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, press reports today said that the Sudan has
officially called upon the League of Arab States Sunday to
table the issue of "Ethiopian and Eritrean aggressions against
eastern Sudan" on the agenda of the upcoming Arab League
ministerial council meeting scheduled to take place on March 30 in
Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Supporters for Liberia's Detained Faction Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of Liberia's former
faction leader Alhaji Kromah today shut shops and suspended
businesses in solidarity to protest the detainment of Kromah on
charge of illegal possession of weapons.
</P>
<P>
A TV report said tonight that Kromah's fellow Mandingoes,
including gas and petroleum dealers and commercial vehicle
operators, stopped their business in a bid to slow down the pace
of concerned moves in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The protest went ahead despite the warning from the Moslem
community that it could worsen the crisis stimulated by the
arrest of Alhaji Kromah, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A radio broadcast in Monrovia today urged all Mandingoes not
to treat the arrest of Kromah as a witch hunt against them.
</P>
<P>
Today's protest came after the West African peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG) reportedly raided the homes of close relatives of
Kromah in the eastern suburbs of Monrovia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A cousin of Alhaji Kromah, who is the chief of staff of the
armed forces of Liberia, said Kromah's ECOMOG bodyguards have
been withdrawn after the detainment of Kromah when three trucks
of arms were found in his home last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kromah has since been under house arrest, with telephone lines
cut off and activities into his home blocked by tanks.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, which oversees the Liberian peace process, has
announced it would treat any one caught with weapons as criminal
after the conclusion of voluntary disarmament for the former
rival factions at the end of January this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu said
Kromah would be handed over to the civil police for possible
prosecution after investigations are completed.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's Independent press today also called for the
prosecution of Kromah, who has resigned from the post of
vice-chairman of the ruling Council of State to run for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
However, General Moses Dar argued the arms discovery had been
recorded by ECOMOG before the deadline date but ECOMOG had not
turned up to pack the arms.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG's action was a "scheme to destroy Alhaji Kromah
politically, given the level of momentum in his effort to
organize a political party, transforming a military organization
into a major political organization," he charged.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends U.S. Veto of U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Monday defended his representative to the United Nations for
vetoing a Security Council's resolution calling on Israel to
abandon its decision to build Jewish homes in Arab east Jerusalem,
saying the United States went against the move because it was
"ill-advised".
</P>
<P>
"We felt that the resolution of the Security Council was...
ill-advised for the general reason that we generally prefer that
the Security Council resolutions not be injected into the peace
negotiations, first; and second, because there was specific
language in this resolution that we have previously vetoed because
we also feel it attempts to shape the final status negotiations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a joint news conference at the White
House after his talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton admitted that Israel's decision to build a Jewish
neighbor in Arab east Jerusalem "would not build confidence, would
not be conducive to negotiations; would be seen by the
Palestinians and others as an attempt to, in effect, precondition
some of the final status issues."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, however, said: "Such developments (by Israel's housing
plan) make the peace process a fragile and vulnerable one.

<HEADLINE> France Tries to Exempt From European Summer Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- France is facing an uphill
struggle this week to exempt itself from European summer time,
since all of its 14 European Union partners have indicated that
they will support a continuation of the one-hour clock change.
</P>
<P>
As EU government officials met in Paris today to set a strategy
for the recent meeting of EU transportation ministers in Brussels,
French officials conceded that their struggle against summer time,
which France helped to institute in the mid-1970s as an
energy-saving measure, had failed.
</P>
<P>
However, French officials said that Secretary of State
Anne-Marie Idrac would demand an exemption for France from
European summer time, which would leave Paris a one-hour time
difference from other European Continental capitals in the summer.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that another alternative which Idrac
would demand would be a shorter prolongation of summer time when
EU ministers consider legislation to extend the current time
system from 1998 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
EU officials expressed certain willingness to consider the
latter option, but they dismissed the prospect for France's
exemption as a practical nightmare.
</P>
<P>
Both The Netherlands, the current EU president, and Germany,
France's biggest neighbor, argue that a time change at the French
border would cause Europe's train and plane schedules in total
havoc.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will not affect the switch of summer time this
year. European countries are going to set their clocks ahead by
one hour at 2 A.M. on March 30, a Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Industry Grows 10.4 Percent In First Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The first two months of 1997 saw
the added value of China's industry rise at an annual rate of 10.4
percent in real terms to 278.7 billion yuan, the State Statistics
Bureau announced today.
</P>
<P>
According to a bureau report, the added value of state-owned
enterprises was 168.7 billion yuan, an annual increase of 6.3
percent. The state-owned firms alone turned out 143.8 billion
yuan-worth of added value, 4.6 percent more than in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The light industry grew slightly faster than the heavy industry
during that period, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The light industry generated an added value of 114.9 billion
yuan, up 10.9 percent, while the added value of the heavy industry
rose 10 percent to 163.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the light industrial sector, production of most durable goods
witnessed relatively quick growth.
</P>
<P>
Production of washing machines, refrigerators, air conditioners
and cameras rose in a range from between 11 to 21.8 percent.
Production of textile products either decreased or edged up.
</P>
<P>
In the heavy industrial sector, energy and major raw materials
continued to enjoy stable growth in January and February.
</P>
<P>
Production of the country's primary energy stood at 181 million
tons of coal, a rise of 4.2 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that because southern China has entered the
spring plowing season and the north is now preparing for it,
strong demand for fertilizers and pesticide has pushed up their
production.
</P>
<P>
China produced 4.65 million tons of fertilizers during the
first two months, an increase of 12.3 percent, and 80,000 tons of
chemical pesticides, up 2.7 percent.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Senate Chairman
Wasim Sajjad today called for further widening the scope of
bilateral cooperation between Pakistan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here today with visiting First Under Secretary
of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, Mohammad Adel El-Safty, Sajjad
stressed the need for further strengthening the Pakistani-Egyptian
ties through close cooperation and understanding on major regional
and international issues.
</P>
<P>
They discussed a wide range of issues of mutual interest
including the Middle East situation and the Palestine-Israel
agreement, according to a press release by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad called in particular for increasing bilateral trade
between the two countries, saying that although trade between
Pakistan and Egypt has increased manifold in recent years, it was
still not reflective of the level of political ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed satisfaction at the fact that the
Extradition Treaty, concluded between Pakistan and Egypt in 1994,
was working very well in meeting the contemplated ends.
</P>
<P>
El-Safty said the Egyptian people and government were also
eager to further strengthen the mutually beneficial relations

<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
its armed police have seized 175 tons of narcotics in the past
11 months of the current Iranian calendar year ending March 20,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said that the Law
Enforcement Forces arrested 12,000 drug traffickers, including
3,200 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani called for "any
effort to fight drug trafficking and addiction," the official
news agency IRNA said today.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said infiltration of Mafia groups into the power
centers of the world and their attempts to spread corruption have
deteriorated the problem of drug trafficking and addiction
across the globe.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani criticized the cultural policy of the West and the
double standard of the big powers in dealing with the drug
producing countries.
</P>
<P>
The support of the "arrogant powers" for the governments
involved in cultivation and trade of illicit drugs such as
Afghanistan proved that the big powers are not sincere in their
campaign against drug trafficking, Rafsanjani noted.
</P>
<P>
He termed the U.S. publicity over its allocation of 16
billion U.S. dollars to fighting drug-related crimes and
allotment of another 400 billion dollars for this purpose next
year as a mere gesture.
</P>
<P>
The president recommended that cultural means including
satellite TV networks should be used to identify and remove the
cultural roots of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a transit route for drugs coming from Pakistan and
Afghanistan destined for Europe.

<HEADLINE> Bank Maintaining Stable Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Citic Industrial Bank
established 10 years ago will strive to maintain stable business
growth this year, the bank's president Dou Jianzhong said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Serving mainly the large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises, foreign-funded companies and major township-run
enterprises, the bank has been expanding business quickly over the
past few years, Dou said at a ceremony held here today for the
publication of the book, titled "Currency Options Guide."
</P>
<P>
The bank's profit hit 15.8 billion yuan last year, placing
Citic sixth among the country's commercial banks, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Citic will achieve its goal by improving management
and routine banking services. A developed computer banking system
will go into trial operation next month to enhance Citic's
competitiveness with other banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Competition is part of life," Dou said, adding that the bank
will issue its Citic Card in the third quarter of this year, to
vie with other cards in the market.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Buchmann, head of the Beijing Office of the Credit Suisse
First Boston that co-sponsored the publication of the book with
Citic Industrial Bank, said that the Chinese-English version of
the guidebook was published at a time when China's financial
market is growing rapidly and the involvement of Chinese entities
in the international market is growing.
</P>
<P>
In line with such developments, there is an increasing demand
for financial derivatives, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese borrowers and issuers in the international capital
market have in the past decade actively used new financial
options, including those for currency, to hedge against adverse
market risks and to lower borrowing costs, Buchmann said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss-based bank now has three branches and offices in
China.

<HEADLINE> WHO Director-General Opposes Human Cloning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- World Health Organization (WHO)
Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima today expressed his opposition
to possible human cloning following Scottish scientists' recent
successful cloning of an adult sheep.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released today in Geneva, Nakajima called for a
public debate at national and international level to establish
regulations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the significance of the medical achievement,
saying that it may yield benefits including therapeutic
applications.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the use of cloning for the replication of
human individuals was not acceptable as it would violate some of
the basic principles governing medically assisted procreation.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima recalled the opinion of a scientific group organized
by the Special Program of Research Development and Research
Training in Human Reproduction (HRP) to review the technical
aspects of medically assisted procreation and related ethical
issues.
</P>
<P>
The group underlined the need to "respect the freedom
indispensable for scientific research and creative activity," but
also stressed that extreme forms of experimentation including
human cloning must be prohibited.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima stressed that technical and ethical guidelines must be
observed to ensure that health and dignity of human being are
fully protected.
</P>
<P>
He said a public debate at both national and international
level would discuss the matter of cloning and set up certain
regulations based on these guidelines.
</P>
<P>
WHO will take the lead in organizing the debate. The HRP's next
meeting on April 23-25 will review the issue of cloning to prepare
for the debate, Nakajima said.

<HEADLINE> Illicit Fees for Rural Education Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Central government departments
have issued a circular nationwide aimed at prohibiting the
collection of illicit fees for rural education and easing the
financial burden of farmers.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, education fees are excessive and some are
diverted for other purposes -- practices which must be halted
and banned, according to the circular, which was issued by the
State Education Commission, the State Planning Commission, and the
ministries of Agriculture and Finance.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the circular, the four departments have also
formulated regulations to supervise fund raising for rural
education.
</P>
<P>
The regulations state that the fees should be charged in
accordance with the development of the local economy and education
as well as the farmers' financial status.
</P>
<P>
Money collected from farmers should only be used to build new
buildings and renovate rundown buildings for the state-run
primary and middle schools, instead of being redirected as bonuses
or welfare benefits for teachers, or as a substitute for state
education funds, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
With county government approval, township governments will
collect the education fees for those schools which have
deteriorating facilities or need new classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Farmers can pay the rural education fees through various means,
including direct cash payments, or by providing goods or
labor.
</P>
<P>
No education fees should be collected from farmers in poor or
disaster-stricken areas, where state education funding can make
ends meet for local schools, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Any violation of the regulations should be corrected within the
period set by the local governments, and violators should be
punished or even taken to court.

<HEADLINE> Swearing-in Ceremony for Nepal's New PM Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The swearing-in ceremony for
Nepal's newly appointed Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand was
postponed to Wednesday as coalition partners are still in the
process of working out the formation of the cabinet, sources here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Chand, parliamentary leader of the National Democratic Party
(RPP), was appointed prime minister by King Birendra Monday after
he submitted a petition to form a new coalition government to be
joined by the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML) and the Nepal Goodwill Party (NSP).
</P>
<P>
He was earlier expected to announce his cabinet today after
taking oath of office.
</P>
<P>
However, as talks over the cabinet formation are still going on
between Chand and the biggest ruling partner CPN-UML, Chand had to
postpone his swearing-in ceremony, a source close to Chand's RPP
party said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the CPN-UML, with its 90 MPs in the
205-seat lower house, is demanding a considerable number of
important portfolios in the cabinet or the council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
Chand's cabinet, expected to be announced Wednesday morning,
will include seven to 10 members from the three coalition
partners, namely the RPP, the CPN-UML and the NSP, according to
the source.
</P>
<P>
The compact cabinet will be expanded to a nearly 30-member one
after the government secures a confidence vote in parliament
within one month of its formation, he said.

BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A tea party was held tonight for
deputies to fifth session of the National People's Congress (NPC)
and members of the fifth session of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, the country's
legislature and top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
The tea party, which was chaired by Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman
of the CPPCC National Committee and head of the United Front Work
Department of the CPC Central Committee, was attended by the
Communist Party and State leaders#,including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng,
Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
Tomur Dawamat, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
addressed the party.
</P>
<P>
He cited China as a unified, multi-nationality socialist
country and said that the CPC has always attached great importance
to the issues and work concerning various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The first generation of the central collective leadership
represented by Mao Zedong formulated a series of principles and
policies on settlement of China's issues relating to different
ethnic groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee held in
late 1978, the second generation of the central collective
leadership with Deng Xiaoping at the core made important
expositions on the issues and work concerning ethnic groups in
leading China's reform, opening-up and socialist modernization
construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tomur Dawamat noted that Deng Xiaoping's stand, viewpoints and
methods on handling China's issues relating to ethnic minority
groups during the new historical period constitute important
component contents of Deng's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The third generation of the central collective leadership with
Jiang Zemin at the core has inherited and carried forward the fine
traditions and work styles of the leaders of the Party's older
generations, attached overriding importance to the issues and work
concerning the ethnic groups and to equality, unity and common
prosperity among nationalities throughout the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unity among all ethnic groups, social stability, economic
development, consolidated boundary and a significantly improved
life of the people have fully proven that the Chinese nation has a
great allying power, the Party's policy on ethnic issues are
correct and successful, the work relating to ethnic groups is
effective, and the relations among all ethnic groups are very
good, he said.

<HEADLINE> Coal Miners Continue Blocking Bonn Government District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Western German coal miners continued
their blockade of the government district here today after
negotiations between the government and trade union representatives
on mining subsidy cuts were postponed to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The protest began early on Monday with miners surrounding the
headquarters of major political parties and causing traffic chaos
in Bonn. The authorities have said they will allow the protests to
continue.
</P>
<P>
Up to 20,000 miners were expected to join the Bonn
demonstration in protest against government plans to reduce annual
federal subsidies for western Germany's bituminous coal mines from
10 billion marks (about 5.8 billion U.S. dollars) currently to 5.5
billion marks (abut 3.2 billion dollars) by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the unprofitable deep-pit coal mines in the west of
Germany received a record handout of 11.2 billion marks (about 6.6
billion dollars) from the government and the state, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions believe that the quick pace of subsidy reduction
by the government will result in mass unemployment in the coal
mining regions of the Ruhr Valley and Saarland, pushing up
unemployment in the country, which hit a record of 4.67 million,
or 12.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan, only about 35,000 jobs in mines out
of the current 85,000 should remain by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions demand the annual subsidies remain 6.5 billion
marks (about 3.8 billion dollars) by 2005 and express their
willingness to reduce the coal mining workforce to 45,000.
</P>
<P>
The mining trade union IG Bergbau leader, Hans Berger, was due
to hold talks with the government today, but the talks were
postponed to Thursday.

<HEADLINE> France Wants Exemption From European Summer Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- France is facing an uphill
struggle this week to exempt itself from European summer time,
with all 14 of its European Union partners having indicated that
they will support a continuation of the one-hour clock change.
</P>
<P>
As government officials met in Paris to set their strategy for a
meeting of EU transportation ministers here Tuesday, French
officials conceded that their campaign against summer time, which
France helped institute in the mid-1970s as an energy-saving
measure, had won no converts.
</P>
<P>
However, they said that Secretary of State Anne-Marie Idrac would
demand an exemption for France, which would leave Paris with
a one-hour time difference from other Continental capitals in the
summer.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Deng Xiaoping's Theoretical Contributions Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A seminar discussing the
significant contributions made by the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping to the theory of scientific socialism was held in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the Teaching and Research
Department under the Party School of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee and the Editorial Board of the magazine, "Front
for Theoretical Work."
</P>
<P>
Participants spoke highly of Deng's contributions to the theory
of scientific socialism, noting that his greatest contribution was
the creation of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
This theory is of great importance to the history of scientific
socialism and takes hold of the essence of socialism, they said,
adding that it offers the first series of fundamental ideas on how
to build, consolidate and develop socialism in an economically and
culturally underdeveloped country like China, they said.
</P>
<P>
Guided by the theory, the Party formulated its principal line
in the early stages of socialism, made the historic decision to
undertake the reform and opening-up, mapped out the blueprint for
China's socialism, and put forward the theory on the socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
The participants termed Deng's theory as contemporary Marxism
in China and an important symbol for the development of socialism
in a new age.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian King Seeks Advice on Case Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk today sought advice from a top judicial official on his
intervention in the case of Srun Vong Vannak, security chief of
the Khmer Nation Party (KNP), a KNP press release said.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Minister of Justice Chem Snguon, King Sihanouk
wrote: "I have received a letter from H.E. Sam Rainsy dated March
10, 1997 requesting me to intervene in order to ensure that the
public authorities respect the Constitution, the laws of the
Kingdom and human rights in the case of Mr. Srun Vong Vannak."
</P>
<P>
"I am enclosing the above-mentioned letter and asking Your
Excellency to advise me on what I should do," the King wrote in
the letter sent from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
KNP President Sam Rainsy wrote to King Sihanouk Monday to ask
for a royal order to force municipal authorities to allow KNP
security chief Srun Vong Vannak access to legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
Vannak, also a member of the party's steering committee, was
arrested on February 14 on charge of masterminding the murder of
Kov Samuth, a brother-in-law of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Vannak's arrest came after a man identified as Suos Kasem
turned in himself to the police and confessed that he killed Kov
Samuth on November 19 on the order of Vannak, who offered him a
50,000 U.S. dollar reward for the act.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Phnom Penh Municipal Penal Police Mok Chito told
reporters last week that Suos Kasem, Vannak and another suspect in
the murder have confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
Rainsy said the charge against Vannak and the allegation by the
police are groundless and that the criminal procedure has violated
every point of the due process of law.
</P>
<P>
The KNP confirmed today it will stage a public demonstration on
March 12 to demand Vannak's release.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Seeks More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors will soon be
allowed to buy stakes of up to 74 percent of Ukraine's most
promising industrial enterprises, said Industry Minister Valery
Mazur today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's enterprises in metallurgical, chemical,
woodworking and light industries have already teamed up with
foreign investors in more than 100 highly profitable joint
ventures, Mazur told a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
But "the amount of foreign investment is still too small," said
Mazur, who did not provide the total amount of foreign investment
in enterprises under his ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The largest investment -- 30 million U.S. dollars -- belongs
to the Spanish firm Transplan, but some of our enterprises are
worthy of investments ten times that size," he said.
</P>
<P>
Topping the ministry's list are a 350-million-dollar project to
produce ethylene and polyethylene at the Severodonetsky Azot
complex and a 160-million-dollar polypropylene processing plant in
Kalusha.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine also hopes to attract investors to mining enterprises
that sit on deposits of iron ore and other minerals.
</P>
<P>
"These mines are now being privatized, and they can yield
profit within three years of investment," said Mazur.
</P>
<P>
However, many foreign investors complain that corruption and
administrative decrees have jeopardized their ventures in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"We're hesitant at this point, we need a more secure business
environment in 1997," said John Shmorhun, manager of Du Pont De
Nemours International S.A., a company active in the agro-chemical
industry.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Mazur promised that foreign investors
will get support form Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenki and President
Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
"If certain Ukrainian laws get in the way of a prominent
investor, they can be overridden by a government resolution or
even a presidential decree," added the minister.

<HEADLINE> National Unity, Stability Emphasized at Tea Party  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A tea party was held tonight for
deputies to fifth session of the National People's Congress (NPC)
and members of the fifth session of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, the country's
legislature and top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
The tea party, which was chaired by Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman
of the CPPCC National Committee and head of the United Front Work
Department of the CPC Central Committee, was attended by the
Communist Party and State leaders#,including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng,
Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
Tomur Dawamat, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
addressed the party.
</P>
<P>
He cited China as a unified, multi-nationality socialist
country and said that the CPC has always attached great importance
to the issues and work concerning various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The first generation of the central collective leadership
represented by Mao Zedong formulated a series of principles and
policies on settlement of China's issues relating to different
ethnic groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Plenum of the 11th Central Committee held in late
1978, the second generation of the central collective leadership
with Deng Xiaoping at the core made important expositions on the
issues and work concerning ethnic groups in leading China's
reform, opening-up and socialist modernization construction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tomur Dawamat noted that Deng Xiaoping's stand, viewpoints and
methods on handling China's issues relating to ethnic minority
groups during the new historical period constitute important
component contents of Deng's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The third generation of the central collective leadership with
Jiang Zemin at the core has inherited and carried forward the fine
traditions and work styles of the leaders of the Party's older
generations, attached overriding importance to the issues and work
concerning the ethnic groups and to equality, unity and common
prosperity among nationalities throughout the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unity among all ethnic groups, social stability, economic
development, consolidated boundary and a significantly improved
life of the people have fully proven that the Chinese nation has a
great allying power, the Party's policy on ethnic issues are
correct and successful, the work relating to ethnic groups is
effective, and the relations among all ethnic groups are very
good, he said.

Strengthening unity among all ethnic groups and safeguarding
the integrity of the motherland, he noted, are in the fundmental
interests of all ethnic groups and are an important guarantee for
doing a good job in all aspect.
</P>
<P>
"We must hold still higher the banner of patriotism and
equality and unity among all ethnic groups, resolutely resist the
attempts of the Western hostile forces to 'Westernize' and 'Split
up' China by exploiting the ethnical and religious issues, oppose
all conspiratorial schemes to undermine ethnic unity and separate
the motherland, and firmly safeguard national and ethnic unity,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that deputies and members of the ethnic
minority nationalities have, over the past four years, contributed
tremendously to unifying the masses of all ethnic groups and to
promoting socialist ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that 1997 is an important year in the history
of China's development and there will be two major events of
far-reaching significance this year, namely, the Chinese
government's resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty over
Hong Kong and the convening of the 15th CPC national congress.
</P>
<P>
"Our work relating to ethnic issues must subordinate to and
serve the overall situation of the Party and the State and create
a sound environment and conditions for the successful fulfillment
of the two major events," he said.
</P>
<P>
Performing artists from the Chinese capital presented splendid
performances at the tea party, which was con-sponsored jointly by
the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, the
Nationalities Committee of the NPC, the State Nationalities
Affairs Commission, and the Subcommittee of Nationalities and

<HEADLINE> s d s 3206 China-Law-Severity of Law China to Maintain Legal Deterrence Against Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A new criminal code in China is
to maintain, in the main, the level of severity in punishing
criminals as is found in the existing Criminal Law and 22
supplementary laws and decisions, legal experts said here today.
</P>
<P>
Draft amendments to the Criminal Law, which have kept the
majority of sentencing provisions unchanged, are now under review
by deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top
legislature in session since March 1.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments have been a result of wide-ranging
discussions and in-depth researches by people from all walks of
life.
</P>
<P>
There has been a long-going debate on the proper level of
severity in punishing criminals among Chinese legal experts, law
enforcers and the public.
</P>
<P>
Some people in academic circles have proposed light treatment
of criminals, reducing capital punishment sentences or even
abolishing capital punishment, in accordance with the world trend
of meting out light punishment for the convicted.
</P>
<P>
But judicial bodies and the public are more concerned about
worsening public security, and believe that it is still too early
to adopt such a scholarly proposal.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Legislative Work Subcommittee
under the NPC Standing Committee, judging by what public opinions
the NPC has received so far, the Chinese public favors giving
harsher punishments against offenders.
</P>
<P>
Many NPC deputies also support heavier treatment of offenders
who jeopardize public security and market economic order.
</P>
<P>
Although China remains one of the countries with the lowest
crime rates, there has been a fairly rapid increase in crimes; and
economic crimes, corruption and malfeasance have been going up
speedily, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Gao Mingxuan, secretary-general of the Criminal Law Chapter
of the China Law Society, said that the top legislature has
attached great importance to the issue of punishment severity.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, has
organized many meetings and seminars to solicit opinions and
discuss this issue before a consensus was finally reached -- to
maintain the severity of sentences largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons are: the consistency and stability of the
criminal justice system must be maintained; and deterrence against
wrong-doers must be kept to curb the rise in crimes in the
country, according to Gao.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments stipulate that the severity of punishment
must be commensurate with the offender's crime and his or her
criminal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Gao went on to explain that the relatively harsh treatments in
the draft law are directed against crimes that severely harm state
security and people's interests. Crimes normally regarded as
"contradictions among the people," such as crimes committed out of
neglect, are usually given sentences that last no more than three
years and never exceed seven years according to the draft
amendments.
</P>
<P>
Most deputies attending the current NPC session agreed that the
severity of punishment in the draft law is suitable to
Chinese realities and is proper and adequate.

</P>
<P>
"The ancient silk road which bridged the eastern and western
civilizations has regained its vigor to help reinforce the

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls for Ceasefire in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today appealed to the international community to help force a
ceasefire in Zaire and to take emergency humanitarian action to
help refugees stranded in the civil war in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
French government spokesman Alain Lamassoure said that Chirac
told a cabinet meeting "the humanitarian situation in Zaire is
tragic."
</P>
<P>
"No one can ignore it any longer. No one can remain
indifferent. We have to ask if there is not a sort of conspiracy
of silence," he quoted Chirac as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chirac reaffirmed France's support to the UN peace proposal
calling for an immediate end to hostilities in and withdrawal of
foreign forces from Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan-backed rebels fighting the government of French-backed
President Mobutu Sese Seko have captured a swathe of eastern
Zaire, driving Rwandan Hutu refugees before them, and threatened
the key garrison city of Kisangani on the Zaire river.
</P>
<P>
The french state secretary for emergency humanitarian action,
Xavier Emmanuelli, just back from his Africa tour, said in a
report to the meeting that some 400,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees are
believed to be holed out and in very poor condition.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuelli said that he was shocked by the lack of any
humanitarian organizations in eastern Zaire, where tens of
thousands of refugees fled Goma and Bukavu and 3,500 other
refugees are suffering from extreme weakness after four months of
wanderings.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that France launch its own mini-airlift while
awaiting wider international support.
</P>
<P>
Chirac proposed the Emmanuelli report be sent to the United
Nations, the European Union, and the United Nations Security
Council.

<HEADLINE> Electricity To Be Rationed In Dar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Power rationing may start
any time in Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam as the government
can no longer afford to meet the costs of generating
hydroelectric power by gas turbines, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that a prolonged drought has again affected
the generation of electricity at the main hydropower station in
Kidatu in Morogoro Region, Western Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The dry spell in Coast and Morogoro regions was only a
secondary reason for the new power shortage situation, according
to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Gas turbine generation of electricity was likely to prove too
expensive for the country, a factor overlooked in putting up the
plant.
</P>
<P>
Treasury coffers can no longer pay the monthly cost of 3.33
million U.S. Dollars to run the gas turbines commissioned in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Load shedding started in the last quarter of 1992 as power
generation declined owing to a fall in the water level at Kidatu
and the reserve dam at Mtera further up the River Basin.
</P>
<P>
Dam levels at Mtera and Nuyumba ya Mungun on the Pangani
Valley have declined on account of lower than average rainfall
for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
The government sought to put up the expensive plant after the
shedding started in 1992, but may now have to do without the
costly substitute.

<HEADLINE>   Khamenei Criticizes Western Monopoly of World Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today criticized the monopoly of western giant oil
companies in today's world oil market, which he described as
"oppressive" and "completely" against the interests of producers.
</P>
<P>
"The world oil market is structured to serve the interests of
the western multi-national oil companies," the state-run Tehran
Radio quoted Khamenei as saying.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement while touring Iman Khomeini Petrochemical
Complex in Iran's southwestern province of Khuzestan.
</P>
<P>
The complex is believed to be the largest one in the Middle
East, which was destroyed by Iraqi bombardment during the
eight-year war between Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Khamenei did not specify any foreign countries or
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader stressed that the oil producers should sell
oil on the basis of their own will, decision and interests.
</P>
<P>
He said that "it is my heartfelt wish that we reach the stage
in which we would be able to cut the oil export at any time,"
adding "It is only then we can say we are the real owner of our
oil."
</P>
<P>
Iran, the second largest oil exporter and the fourth largest
oil producer in the world, pumps out about 3.6 million barrels of
crude and exports about 2.5 million barrels per day in line with
quota of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran is expected to earn about 19 billion U.S. dollars from oil
export during the current Iranian calendar year which ends on
March 20, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Fishermen Warned Against Illegal Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Fisheries and
Marine Resources Minister Hifipunye Pohamba has warned Namibian
fishermen against fishing illegally in other countries'
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian Broadcasting Corporation said Pohamba expressed
his concern over allegations of illegal fishing by Namibian
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Addressing fishermen at Walvis Bay at the weekend, Pohamba
said South Africa and France had lodged a complaint against
Namibian vessels fishing illegally in their territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Pohamba said the government understood the difficult position
facing local fishermen but warned that this did not justify them
stealing other countries' stocks.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, the Namibian government would support any
legal action taken by South Africa or France to discourage
illegal fishing, said the Minister.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian fisheries sector has experienced very poor
seasons in the past two years due to abnormal oceanic conditions,
resulting in heavy quota cuts and losses for the industry.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Namibia imposed very heavy penalties and seized
the vessels of those caught fishing illegally inside its own 200
mile exclusive economic zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Foreign Minister
Kelebone Maope has accused South Africa of dragging its feet on
concluding the customs union agreement with the mountain kingdom,
said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Monday in Maseru, capital of the
kingdom, Maope said: "There is general feeling in government
circles that South Africa is not moving fast enough in concluding
the agreement."
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the Lesotho government would make further
efforts to compel the South African government to speed up the
process, said the Minister.
</P>
<P>
Maope also accused South Africa of engaging in negotiations
with western countries which would impact on the envisaged
customs union agreement.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to South Africa's current
negotiations with the European Union for a free trade agreement,
which reportedly caused serious concerns to the countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho, a small land-locked country in the southern African
region, is widely believed under heavy influence of its big
neighbor, South Africa, both economically and politically.

<HEADLINE> Legislators on National Defense Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- It is necessary to enshrine
principles and policies set forth by the Party for the People's
Liberation Army and the army's fine traditions and precious
experience in the form of law, so as to help strengthen China's
national defense.
</P>
<P>
This is a consensus reached by legislators here attending the
Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's legislature, who are deliberating on a draft law on
national defense these days.
</P>
<P>
They held that the draft law draws historical experience of the
past decades since the founding of New China in 1949 and reflects
developments and features in the new historical period. It is a
socialist defense law with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
They noted that, if adopted at the current NPC session, the law
will play a significant role in building and consolidating
national defense, safeguarding a smooth progression of reform and
opening up as well as national economic development, and ensuring
the country's long-term stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Feng Wencheng from east China's Anhui Province said
that the draft national defense law has three distinct
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"The law has affirmed the Party's absolute leadership over the
armed forces, stressed the importance of popular education on
national defense, and provided legal protection for the legitimate
rights and interests of servicemen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pan Yiqing, a legislator from north China's Tianjin, said that,
while adhering to the Party's leadership over the army, the draft
law defines different responsibilities of the Central Military
Commission and the State Council, and clearly stipulates on
national defense funds, national defense assets, the obligations
and rights of servicemen, scientific research for national
defense, and weapons production.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers also put forth ideas and suggestions for improving
the draft law.
</P>
<P>
Gong Pingqiu, a PLA deputy to the NPC, said that the Party's
absolute leadership over the army is the fundamental principle for
the building of the PLA and, therefore, should be made still
clearer in the draft law.
</P>
<P>
Anhui legislator Meng Fulin stressed that, in the process of
carrying out reform and opening up and seeking prosperity,
national defense should by no means be neglected.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the law stipulate clearly on the proper
settlement of and financial support for soldiers and officers
disabled in wars and military service, and that specific
punishments be stipulated for those who refuse to serve in the
army.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Feng Wencheng said that the system of the armed
police force should be established in the form of law.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wang Peisheng from Shanghai suggested that the draft
law add some articles concerning the training of PLA men with both
military and civil skills, so as to enable ex-servicemen to better
serve the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
After being revised according to the legislators' suggestions,
the draft national defense law will be put to a vote at the last
plenum of the current NPC session.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Girl Gets Letter, Photo from Belarussian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A 12-year-old Chinese girl who
has won international recognition for her paintings today received
a thank-you letter and photo from Belarussian President Alexandr
Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
At a presentation ceremony here today, Zeng Yangyang, who
attends the Lixin Primary School of Beijing, was given the letter
and photo by Belarussian Ambassador to China Vyachaslau
N. Kuznyatsou, in appreciation for the New-Year's card and
painting she sent to Lukashenko last year.
</P>
<P>
Zeng's painting to Lukashenko is of a giant panda and
peonies. In her card, she invited the president to visit Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, the Belarussian president says, "In China, which
is far away from Belarus, someone is concerned about our country
and wants to make friends with us. I am deeply moved. This wish
has also been strongly echoed in my heart. Thank you very much for
inviting me to visit Beijing."
</P>
<P>
"Children of all countries share a common aspiration -- peace
and friendship," he writes.
</P>
<P>
After reading the president's letter, Zeng said that she wants
to meet young people in Belarus, especially those mentioned by the
president in his letter who are suffering from the aftereffects of
the nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Zeng
said she wants to send them paintings, too.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, the Belarussian ambassador said that since the
two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1992, they have seen
sustained development of cooperation in political, economic and
cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
He said Lukashenko's letter and photo to Zeng reflect his great
concern for the friendship and exchanges between young people of
the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador called Zeng a "sincere young envoy" of the
friendship between Belarussian and Chinese peoples.

<HEADLINE> EU Likely to Tighten Food Safety Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) might
introduce tougher food-safety regulations following a report that
many of its member countries are failing to detect cases of the
"mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Kiely, agriculture spokesman for the European Commission,
said Monday that the executive agency is already considering ways
to improve Union-wide surveillance of the disease after the
internal report highlighted a number of shortcomings in the food
safety mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The report said existing EU food safety laws including controls
over meat plants have not been uniformly introduced or respected.
</P>
<P>
Kiely declined to elaborate on what measures the EU might take
to tighten food safety, but he left open the possibility of
reviving a proposal to ban the sales of beef for human or animal
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Such a ban was rejected by EU farm ministers last December.

<HEADLINE> Conditions for Cross-Strait Talks Not Yet Ripe: Tang Shubei (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The conditions and political
atmosphere for resumption of talks between two organizations
across the Taiwan Straits are not yet ripe since the Taiwan
authorities have not returned to the "one China" principle, a
Chinese official who handles Taiwan affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, Tang Shubei, executive
vice-chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), said the ARATS has always stood for talks under
the "one China" principle and proposed for a second "Wang-Koo
Meeting" in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Tang recalled that he visited Taiwan in May 1995 to make
arrangements with the Foundation for Exchange Across the Taiwan
Strait for the second "Wang-Koo Meeting," which stands for another
meeting between Wang Daohan, president of the Beijing-based ARATS
and Koo Chen-pu, president of the Taibei-based Strait Exchange
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
In June, however, Lee Teng-hui visited the United States, which
seriously poisoned the atmosphere across the straits. So the ARATS
had to announce the suspension of the second "Wang-Koo Meeting"
and other talks between the two organizations at different levels,
he said.
</P>
<P>
After three years of talks between ARATS and the strait
exchange foundation, he noted, ARATS became aware that the
fundamental differences between the two sides hinged on their
political difference which must be resolved through political
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Just as Premier Li Peng noted in his government report at the
ongoing NPC session that "the two sides of the Taiwan Straits will
settle disputes through political negotiations on the basis of
'one China' principle and gradually achieve the peaceful
reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
"We can negotiate on some routine issues while the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits conduct political negotiations," Premier Li
said.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Tang also reiterated the Chinese
government's "one China" stance. He quoted President Jiang Zemin
as saying in an earlier important speech on the Taiwan issue that
there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China,
and that China's sovereignty and territorial integrity cannot be
separated.

With regard to Taiwan's efforts to develop non-governmental
economic and cultural ties with other countries, Tang said that
"we do not hold differing views...but we are in opposition to its
activities of so-called 'expanding living space internationally',
which is aimed to go in for 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one
Taiwan'."
</P>
<P>
"Only after the peaceful reunification of the motherland is
accomplished can the Taiwan compatriots truly and fully share with
the Chinese people of all other ethnic groups the dignity and
honor attained by our great motherland," said Jiang Zemin in early
1995 in his speech on pushing forward the peaceful reunification
of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
On the "one China" principle, he said, the two organizations
reached vocal census at the end of 1992 which means the two sides
should adhere the "one China" principle. Owing to difference
between the two sides, we can leave the political implications of
"one China" principle for the future.
</P>
<P>
On investment by Taiwan businessmen, Tang said, the motherland
will protect the legitimate interests of Taiwan businessmen
according to the Law on the Protection of Investment of the Taiwan
Compatriots enacted by the National People's Congress in 1993 and
the 22 provisions formulated by the State Council to encourage
Taiwan investment. Special preferences will be given in line with
relevant regulations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council and other related departments are studying the details on
the Law on the Protection of Investment of the Taiwan Compatriots.
The draft law will be worked out soon to solicit suggestions from
various walks of life.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Relations Rely on Principles, Not Bribery: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman said here today it is ridiculous to claim that the
development of Sino-US relations could be influenced by offers of
money,
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here today, Spokesman Cui Tiankai refuted
recent allegations by some US media organizations that China made
political donations to the U.S. Democratic Party, in an attempt to
bribe the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that the healthy development of relations between China
and the United States relies on the faithful implementation of the
three joint communiques which set out the principles of the
bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said that China maintains a clear stance of non-interference
in internal affairs when forging ties with other countries.
</P>
<P>
China is not interested in using unjustifiable means to
interfere in other countries' internal affairs, nor will it
approve such activities by any other country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is a developing country whose economic
construction and growth generate excessive demands for money. It
has no money to spare on election donations for a US political
party, and has no desire to spend money in this way, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in the past, the US media had reported
"intelligence information" about China's alleged activities, which
was ultimately proved groundless.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sino-US relations should not be affected by
hearsay. Instead, the two sides should focus on common interests
and the overall need for cooperation and long-term development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
China wishes that the US congress and the US public will learn
more about the real situation in China, and is ready to
establish normal contacts with them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China welcomes members of the US congress,
including its leaders, to visit China.
</P>
<P>
"This will be conducive to the development of the relations
between the two countries," he said.

grouping's single market, Indonesia's Chamber of Commerce and
Industry chairman said here today.
</P>
<P>
"As an economic bloc, the ASEAN has agreed not to close (its
doors) to others. Thus, efforts to forge cooperation among its
members do not mean that it would ignore non-ASEAN countries,"
Aburizal Bakrie said after opening the 53rd meeting of the ASEAN
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
"We will even be more intensive in inviting non-ASEAN countries
to form cooperation with them or merely ask for their inputs," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Bakrie said the chamber will focus on three sectors -- the
capital goods sector, which continues to show a trade deficit; the
food and agriculture sector, which involves the ability to feed
the ASEAN region's 500 million people; and the tourism sector,
which is a main source of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Bakrie, who chairs the ASEAN chamber, said that to integrate
the ASEAN market into the global market, it needs special
management.
</P>
<P>
He said opportunities outside ASEAN must be found through
strategic alliances with other countries to enhance the region's
industrial strength.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN chamber should thus prepare "a map of journey" toward
the global market and one way is by organizing the first ASEAN
business summit, which opens Wednesday and will be attended by
some 600 businessmen, including those from non-ASEAN countries or
regions, he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Draft Business Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Substantial expansion was seen in
1996 in China's bank draft sector, which involves the businesses
of remittance, discounting and re-discounting, according to the
People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Last year, along with the promulgation of the Law on Bills, the
draft businesses were given strong legal protection.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, bills of exchange worth a total of 389.8 billion yuan
were issued in the country, while commercial banks discounted
226.4 billion yuan and the People's Bank of China re-discounted
725.8 billion yuan, up 61.5 percent, 98.2 percent and 60.9 percent,
respectively, over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the development of the commercial draft sector
and its related businesses has stepped up the integration between
commercial credit and bank credit, broadened the channel for
enterprises to raise funds, improved the structure of credit
assets of commercial banks, and increased the means for the
central bank to exercise macro-economic control.
</P>
<P>
Currently, they point out, bank draft businesses and other
businesses concerned are concentrated in the eastern, coastal and
relatively developed areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the development of bill businesses relies
on the existence of a mature commodity economy.
</P>
<P>
According to information from the central bank, in 1996, the
ratio between acceptance, discount and re-discount stood at 3:2:1.
</P>
<P>
The country's bill market will be further developed by properly
expanding the general volume of re-discounts and pushing forward
the expansion of the businesses of acceptance, discount and
re-discount.

<HEADLINE> China's Population Rose by 12.7 million in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's total population reached
1.22 billion in 1996, up 12.7 million over the figure of 1995,
according to the latest survey of the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
About 23.67 million people were born in the country last year,
and the natural growth rate was 1.04 percent, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
An average 21 million people are born in China each year -- an
annual increase of about 13 million, said Peng Peiyuan, state
councillor and minister in charge of the State Family Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national forum on family planning and
environmental protection, which was held in Beijing on Saturday,
Peng said that there is still an imbalance between family planning
work in various parts of the country, and that in the middle and
western parts of China, and that poor areas will face many
problems.
</P>
<P>
The population census of 1990 showed that the number of women
of child-bearing age in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, Jiangxi, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces,
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Tibet Autonomous Region will
reach its peak during the 1995-2000 period, she said.
</P>
<P>
This will make it difficult to lower the birth rate in those
areas, Peng said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that a variety of new problems keep cropping
up, and the family planning situation of the floating population
continues to cause difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The State Family Planning Commission will list population
control and the work to improve people's lives in the general
program for poverty-relief, she said.
</P>
<P>
The "Happy Project" was launched by the Chinese Population
Welfare Foundation, the Family Planning Association of China and
China Population Newspaper in 1995 to help the poor mothers in
rural areas. It has collected more than 20 million yuan (about 2.4
million US dollars) and helped 17,000 poor families in 22
counties, Peng said.

JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Foreign Minister
Kelebone Maope has accused South Africa of dragging its feet on
concluding the customs union agreement with the mountain kingdom,
said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Monday in Maseru, capital of the
kingdom, Maope said: "There is general feeling in government
circles that South Africa is not moving fast enough in concluding
the agreement."
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the Lesotho government would make further
efforts to compel the South African government to speed up the
process, said the Minister.
</P>
<P>
Maope also accused South Africa of engaging in negotiations
with western countries which would impact on the envisaged
customs union agreement.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to South Africa's current
negotiations with the European Union for a free trade agreement,
which reportedly caused serious concerns to the countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho, a small land-locked country in the southern African
region, is widely believed under heavy influence of its big
neighbor, South Africa, both economically and politically.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Produces Fewer Engineers: De Klerk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa produces
dramatically fewer engineers than countries in the developed
world, with local tertiary institutions training only 32
engineers per million people compared with the 600 per million in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The figures were revealed by the opposition National Party
leader De Klerk at the opening of an international construction
symposium, the Federation Internationale de la Precontrainte
Symposium, in Johannesburg on Monday.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk quoted statistics indicating that 393 engineers had
left South Africa in 1994, a 68.7 percent rise compared with that
of 1992.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has to analyse the reasons for the loss of too
many professional people and then take the necessary rectifying
steps to stop the brain exodus, said De Klerk.
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted productivity and labor relations as
matters of special importance if South Africa's international
competitiveness was to be improved.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk urged the African National Congress-led government,
organized labor and private sector to work together to strike a
deal to increase competitivity.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Japanese Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today he hopes that both China and Japan will view
Sino-Japanese relations from a "long-term and strategic
perspective," and handle bilateral ties in a way that benefits
both sides and safeguards peace in Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also the general secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks at a meeting with
Doyi Takako, head of the Japanese Socialist Democratic Party, at
Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government have
always paid close attention to the Sino-Japanese relations and
have been devoted to the cause of maintaining and developing the
friendship between the two countries, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The leader said Takako and other members of delegation are "old
friends" who have contributed to the normalization of the
relations between the two countries and to promoting the sound
growth of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We will not forget what your Party has done to maintain
and develop the Sino-Japanese friendship," he told Japanese guests.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
the relations between China and Japan, Jiang said, adding that
getting the bilateral relations to their present level has not
been easy.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth redoubling our efforts to treasure the
relationship that is the result of the efforts of several
generations," Jiang noted. "We sincerely hope that the Japanese
government will stick to the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint
Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and push
ahead, in a down-to-earth way, the healthy and stable development
of bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
Takako thanked Jiang for meeting with her, and said the
contacts between her Party and the Chinese Communist Party had
enhanced mutual understanding and friendship.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Democratic Party heeds the friendly and
cooperative relations between the two countries, she said, adding
that maintaining and developing the ties is of great importance
not only to the two countries, but also to peace and development
in Asia and the world as a whole.

ALMA ATA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan President Nursultan
Nazarbayev has appointed Zeinukka Kakimzanov as the new deputy
chairman of the Supreme Economic Committee (SEC), the Kazakhstan
newspaper Pravda said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kakimzanov, born in 1959, was graduated from Moscow University
and had worked as chairman of the board of the People's Savings
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Former SEC Deputy Chairman Erdjan Ujembaev was named as the

Meanwhile, Nazarbayev appointed Galymzan Zakiyanov as the
director of the National Strategic Supervision Office (NSSO),
another newly-established organization.
</P>
<P>
The SEC, which was set up in April last year and headed by
Nazarbayev himself, mainly serves as an advisory body for the
president on strategies of economic and social development as well
as national security.

<HEADLINE> Electricity To Be Rationed In Dar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Power rationing may start
any time in Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam as the government
can no longer afford to meet the costs of generating
hydroelectric power by gas turbines, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that a prolonged drought has again affected
the generation of electricity at the main hydropower station in
Kidatu in Morogoro Region, Western Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The dry spell in Coast and Morogoro regions was only a
secondary reason for the new power shortage situation, according
to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Gas turbine generation of electricity was likely to prove too
expensive for the country, a factor overlooked in putting up the
plant.
</P>
<P>
Treasury coffers can no longer pay the monthly cost of 3.33
million U.S. Dollars to run the gas turbines commissioned in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Load shedding started in the last quarter of 1992 as power
generation declined owing to a fall in the water level at Kidatu
and the reserve dam at Mtera further up the River Basin.
</P>
<P>
Dam levels at Mtera and Nuyumba ya Mungun on the Pangani
Valley have declined on account of lower than average rainfall
for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
The government sought to put up the expensive plant after the
shedding started in 1992, but may now have to do without the
costly substitute.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Sole Hydroelectric Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Power generation capacity at
Owen Falls Power station, uganda's sole hydroelectric station,
has been increased from 150 to 180 mw, reported local daily "the
New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
This occurred following completion of its refurbishment
recently, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The upgrading, which costs Uganda Electricity Board about 30
million U.S. Dollars, will reduce power loadshedding in the
country by 50 percent starting next month, it said.
</P>
<P>
The fund to upgrade the station was granted to the government
by the British Overseas Development Association and the
refurbishing work started in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Power demand in Uganda is 220 mw, and the upgrading of the
Owen Falls Power Station will reduce the loadshed to 40 mw.
</P>
<P>
However, the power load was growing faster (2 percent every
month) than the board can cope with.
</P>
<P>
Before rehabilitation of the station started in 1989, there
was no loadshedding in the country for power shortage.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Language Teachers Working Excessive Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Ninety percent of Hong Kong
language teachers are under an enormous workload, spending seven
days a week, five hours a night marking students' compositions,
according to a survey published in today's South China Morning
Post.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in January by the Professional Teachers'
Union, showed that Chinese and English language teachers have to
spend 35 hours a week after school, including weekends and
holidays, marking students' assignments.
</P>
<P>
The union's chairman, Cheung Man-kwong, stated that it was
"extremely inhuman" for teachers to work such long hours.
</P>
<P>
Among the 580 Chinese and English language teachers
interviewed, 50 percent said their workload was heavy and 40
percent said it was extremely heavy.
</P>
<P>
The survey sent 1,000 questionnaires to teachers at 200
secondary schools and 300 primary schools in the territory and
nearly 60 percent responded.
</P>
<P>
The union suggested that the Education Department increase the
number of language teachers and limit the number of classes they
teach from three to two.
</P>
<P>
The department should also encourage teachers to adopt more
flexible ways, such as using audio-visual material in their
teaching, the union said.

<HEADLINE> Two Kilograms Heroin Seized at Kenya's Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police have seized two
kilograms of heroin at the Jom Kenyatta International Airport,
the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources of the Anti-Narcotics Unit as saying
on Monday that the consignment was seized from three Nigerians
and a Tanzanian.
</P>
<P>
The suspects arrested last week were being held at the police
unit at the airport and would be charged in court once
investigations are completed, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The four foreigners were arrested last week soon after
disembarking from an aircraft from an Asian country as police
officers detected that they had swallowed the drugs.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that "our men at the airport are very
alert and attention is being focused on the airlines arriving
from drug-source countries."
</P>
<P>
The anti-narcotics officers in Kenya had arrested eight
Nigerian drug barons at the airport since last December including
one suspected to operate an international drug trafficking ring.
</P>
<P>
Late in 1995, a woman passenger traveling from India was
arrested at the airport with 10 kilograms of heroin worth a
street value of 180,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Kenya had intensified the war against
drugs by ensuring that aircraft arriving from drug-source
countries were thoroughly checked before being cleared.
</P>
<P>
"Curbing drug trafficking is an enormous task since the drug
barons have devised deceptive methods of transporting the
consignment", the sources added.

<HEADLINE> HK's Unit Trust Inflows Post Two-year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unit trust industry
attracted net inflows of 168 million US dollars in January, the
largest amount ever recorded in a month since 1994, according to
local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The figure could be largely attributed to the buoyant stock
exchange, said Peter Lord, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong
Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
"The massive inflows mainly related to the rally in the Hong
Kong stock market, especially in the fourth quarter of 1996," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA was very pleased with the strong net inflows,
especially after the net redemption recorded for three consecutive
months, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the marked improvement of sales was
not across the board. Of the 14 sectors, half turned in net
inflows while the rest posted net outflows.
</P>
<P>
The leader in terms of net inflows was Hong Kong equity funds,
which pulled in 138 million US dollars, or 82 percent of the total
in January.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive month that the sector ranked
first in net sales.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA figures represent the retail and some institutional
sales of 45 fund management companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC) president Clarence Makwetu is to defy a party
decision to remove him from parliament and intends to take up his
seat when the National Assembly meets today in Cape Town, a
source said here today.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu, 69, now PAC national chairman, was stripped of his
parliament seat at an extraordinary meeting of the PAC National
Working Committee (NWC) in Johannesburg last Friday while he was
on a tour to Kenya as part of a government delegation.
</P>
<P>
The NWC meeting also decided that Makwetu should face an
internal tribunal to answer charges of contravening the party's
disciplinary code and its oath of allegiance, said the source who
declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu, however, said on Monday in Cape Town that the
decision was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he had been in his parliamentary office on
Monday attending to businesses, and would take his seat regularly
when the Assembly meets on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu was charged of fostering tribalism and divisions in
the party and of subverting the leadership of the Stanley Mogoba,
who succeeded him as PAC president late last year.

refused to move to Rhino camp about 40 miles southeast of Koboko,
reported the local daily "the New Vision" today.

be transferred to Rhino camp, where over 30,000 other Sudanese
refugees are living.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were being transferred for security reasons
because Sudanese troops and Sudanese backed Uganda rebels often

The local authorities resolved last week to start an emergency

to board the lorries which were to take them to Rhino camp.

JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- More than one million South
African children under the age of five nationwide suffer from
some form of stunted growth, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey released by the Medical Research Council
(MRC) on Monday in Cape Town, children's stunted growth was due
to a number of reasons including repeated diarrhoea episodes,
malnutrition, and iron and vitamin A deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
The MRC's nutritional intervention research programme would
also conduct a study to determine the possible effect of
micronutrients on the growth of children, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Researchers hoped to determine whether micronutrient
supplementation would have a positive effect on the growth and
mental development of infants.
</P>
<P>
The MRC further stressed evidence from previous studies had
shown that the period when babies were weaned onto solid foods
was also the period when stunting started in affected children.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has acted to check rampant
illegal logging and all would-be investors in the timber sector
will be closely scrutinized and monitored, Environment and
Natural Resources Minister William Harrington has said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted him as saying that from now on
the would-be investors will only be given concessions if they
show genuine capacity in machinery, fiscal and financial backup.
</P>
<P>
He said at the weekend that his country is worried over the
illegal activities in the north of the country where concession
holders are not complying with conditions of licenses granted.
</P>
<P>
In the Copperbelt, over 30,000 people including foreigners are
encroaching in the state forests, added the minister who launched
an investigation on the illegal activities two months ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the licenses of the loggers involved in illegal
cutting of trees will not be renewed.
</P>
<P>
If the illegal logging is not contained, "water works in Kafue
will dry and therefore no drinking water for Lusaka. There will
be no hydro-power stations at Kafue, no navigation and fishing.
The entire social life of the people will be affected," warned
Harrington.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will encourage agro-forestry and those
who plant their own timber will be given incentives to export 75
percent of their products.
</P>
<P>
Harrington cited certain constrains such as inadequate fund
for police in the affected areas.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest city of Shanghai
will see another district lifted out of heavy pollution before the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Taopu District, an industrial area focussed on chemical
production in the northwest of Shanghai, had serious pollution
problems at the end of last decade.
</P>
<P>
The district, covering an area of 15 square kilometers, has
over 50 enterprises. Over the past 30 years, a large quantity of
acid and alkali spewed out by the factories, along with other
harmful gases, has caused serious pollution problems in the region.
</P>
<P>
The city government has spent some one billion yuan (about 120
million US dollars) in the district's environmental protection
projects over the past decade, statistics say. As a result, nearly
a hundred polluting sources have been improved.
</P>
<P>
Before the end of this year, Shanghai will dismantle over 50
medium and small-sized boilers in the district. "This action is
expected to reduce 95 percent of the smoke and dust, and 45
percent of the sulphur dioxide spewed out," said an official with
the district government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a sewage treatment plant with a capacity to dispose
of 80,000 tons of waste water daily will be completed in
mid-1997.

recently, local daily "The Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
On prevention of pollution, councillors at the meeting agreed
to impose strict measures to ensure that all factories, old and
new, should have pre-treatment facilities to bring their effluent
to standards laid down by the urban councils act.
</P>
<P>
These pre-treatment facilities will be made a statutory
requirement before industrialists are allowed to operate.
</P>
<P>
The council needs about 1.26 million U.S. Dollars to achieve
internationally accepted water and waste water quality monitoring
systems.
</P>
<P>
The situation in water polluting in Harare has been
deteriorating in recent years. Fish have died at Lake Chivero and
Lake Manyame, Harare's main water reservoirs, with the cause
often linked to industrial waste discharged into the Manyame
River catchment area.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Risk Management of Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China will acts to improve risk
management of its foreign debts this year in a bid to improve its
efficiency in utilizing foreign funds, according to Tuesday's
China Securities News.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that instead of the conventional practice of
imposing a foreign debt quota, China will gradually introduce an
assets-liability management system to better use overseas funds,
the newspaper quoted a foreign investment official.
</P>
<P>
A small number of large enterprise groups will be granted the
authority to raise funds overseas on their own this year, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
"Poor efficiency in managing foreign investment in some projects
resulted in defaulted debt among financial institutions, it also
posed difficulties to foreign debt control," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to "invisible foreign debt" in infrastructural
projects and misuse of short-term foreign loans for long-term
projects.
</P>
<P>
"An assets-liability management system of foreign loans will
prove to be a wise choice for the establishment of a socialist
market economy, and China's financial institutions, which are well
under the way of commercialization, will surely benefit from
more efficient use of foreign funds," said the official.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Discovers Ancient Sculptural Masterpiece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A rare and unique antique has been
found in Egypt when a farmer dug foundation for his new house
recently, an Egyptian Gazette report said today.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified farmer hit upon a limestone statue, 95
centimeters high and 25 centimeters wide when he was laying the
foundation for his new house, about 300 meters off a temple in
Zagazig city, Sharkia, Eastern Arabian Desert.
</P>
<P>
The new find, that depicts a woman sitting on a chair in a
shape of a lion's leg, holding three small boys in her arms, is a
rare and priceless work of sculptural craft, said Ali Hassan,
secretary general of the Higher Council, an official body in
charge of protecting cultural relics in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"The ancient statue has no equal in the long history of
Egypt's civilization and the world's art of sculpture," the
official was quoted by today's Egyptian Gazette as telling a press
conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statue probably dates back to the New Kingdom (1570
B.C.-332 B.C), Hassan said. No one knows exactly who this woman
is, but she certainly had a relationship with the kingdom,
because the statue contains precious stones, he added.
</P>
<P>
The three smaller statues standing in front of the woman's
chest have inlaid cornelian necklaces which are still in a good
condition but the heads of two of the three are missing. The
bigger statue also carries an incomplete statue of a girl on the
pillow on her leg.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said that surveys are being performed in the area where
the statue was discovered to find the missing part, then it will
be restored before being put on display after all the studies
have been conducted.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the statue had been removed from its
original place. "In all probability this statue, which was found
on March 2, was stolen by someone who buried it beside the
farmer's house," he added.

Philippines, where he was conferred a honorable Doctorate of Law
degree.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conferment ceremony, Kissinger, who arrived

countries should be left to decide for themselves when they
encounter political and internal problems "as this part of the

and by its own message that we all could be proud of," he said.
</P>

He said that the world is entering into a new era where the
whole world is connected by economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The world is fast becoming one global village," Kissinger
claimed.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S.- Philippine relations, Kissinger said that the
relations between the two countries have not decreased despite the
American withdrawal of its troops from two military bases -- the
Clark air base and the Subic naval base in the Philippines in the
early 1990's.

<HEADLINE> New Labor Law Approved by South Korean Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A new labor law was approved today
at a cabinet meeting called by Prime Minister Koh Kun and it would
be submitted to President Kim Young-sam for his final approval
before it comes into effect.
</P>
<P>
According to the new labor law adopted by the South Korean
National Assembly late on Monday, multiple unions within an
enterprise are justified, but employers are permitted to stop
paying strikers according to the "no work, no pay" clause.
</P>
<P>
Employers are also permitted to introduce flexible work hours,
but a ceiling of no more than 12 hours is set for total working
hours per day.
</P>
<P>
Sackings will be allowed in two years on grounds of "management
emergency" only.
</P>
<P>
Employers are banned from paying full-time union officials from
2002.
</P>
<P>
The new law was a revised bill to replace a law passed in the
parliament last December by the ruling New Korea Party before the
arrival of the parliament members from opposition parties. The
event sparked the withdrawal of the opposition parties from the
parliament and large-scale strikes organized by the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
Under increasing domestic political pressures, the ruling party
was forced to make a concession to revise the law in exchange for
support from opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The revised labor law was finally adopted by the parliament
late on Monday with the favorable votes in the parliament from
both the ruling party and two major opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the new law was widely accepted by
employers but the labor unions saw no obvious improvement in the
law. Labor unions asserted that the possibility to call fresh
large-scale strikes could not be ruled out.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Boost Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial centre, is seeking to spur the growth of its
burgeoning foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Jiang Yiren, in charge of the city's foreign
trade, said Shanghai will try to develop all five areas of foreign
trade-- commodity export, overseas fund application, technology
trade, service trade and sino-foreign economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Exports in Shanghai totalled 13 billion US dollars in 1996,
10.5 percent more than that of 1995. However, growth of export is
restricted by elements such as resources shortage and rising labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
Under the export-enhancement program, the municipal government
gives a shot-in-the arm to the service trade.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that current revenue of Shanghai's service
trade accounts for a mere 12 percent of its total commodity
exports. By contrast, Hong Kong's service trade accounts for an
impressive 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
A top foreign trade official said foreign-funded firms are
expected to export five billion US dollars worth of commodities
this year, up 20 percent over last year. The city also plans to
name 70 varieties of goods its major export commodities, which
will bring in a total of 5.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city aims to boost export of mechanical and electronic
equipment by encouraging local entrepreneurs to invest in or
contract construction projects abroad, said the official, who
forecast a remarkable rise in export of computer softwares and
other hi-tech products.
</P>
<P>
As part of its bid to promote exports, Shanghai plans to form a
batch of large enterprise groups in various fields of foreign
trade, and to build new export commodity manufacturing bases.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
has witnessed an unprecedented momentum in its opening drive,
thanks to new measures by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of "promoting development through
opening-up," the province introduced some 1.53 billion US dollars
of contractual overseas funds by the end of last year through trade
fairs.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Shaanxi approved some 250 overseas-funded projects and
made actual use of 510 million dollars in foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Shaanxi provincial foreign trade and
economic cooperation office said new measures to usher in foreign
funds had taken the province's opening drive to a more extensive
and deeper level.
</P>
<P>
Along with the transfer of shares in a power plant and the
contract to manage an expressway last year, new mechanisms were
initially installed to introduce overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
And the structure of its foreign investment was more
diversified last year, said the official, adding that
infrastructural facilities and basic industries have become
hotbeds for overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more overseas investments are channelled into
productive projects, which are crucial to the inland province's
economic take-off.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Head Voices Confidence about Future HK-Taiwan Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, Executive Vice
Chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), expresses confidence about relations between Taiwan and
Hong Kong after the latter's return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Tang told a press conference here today that some specific
issues concerning Hong Kong-Taiwan ties after July 1 have already
been properly dealt with, or will soon be.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that Vice Premier Qian Qichen, on behalf of the
central government, has announced seven principles on Hong
Kong-Taiwan ties after July 1, and "we are ready to see that
non-governmental exchanges between Hong Kong and Taiwan are
maintained and developed under the principle of one China."
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan organizations and personnel in Hong Kong can
remain there after July 1; however, they must follow the "one
China" principle and must not engage in activities that violate
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or
activities that go beyond their registered scope of activities.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to see that they make contributions to the
development of relations between Hong Kong and Taiwan, and to Hong
Kong's prosperity and stability," Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong-Taiwan relations after July 1
will be a special part of relations between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Issues that involve cross-strait relations and national
sovereignty will be handled by the central government or the
government of the Hong Kong SAR with authorization from the
central government, with the rest to be handled by the HKSAR
government in accordance with the Basic Law, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The problem of air links between Hong Kong and Taiwan after
July 1 has been resolved, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
As for sea links between the two places, he said, the
spokespersons of the Taiwan Affairs Office and the Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office under the State Council have emphasized that
marine shipping between Hong Kong and Taiwan should also be
conducted under the "one China" principle.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Likely to Lose 300,000 Jobs After US GSP Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand might lose more than
314,000 jobs if the United States ends generalized system of
preferences (GSP) tax concessions on Thai exports, the Thai
Commerce Ministry said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
If Thai manufacturers do nothing to improve productivity,
losses in its exports will amount to 5.18 billion baht (207.2
million US dollars), the ministry warned.
</P>
<P>
The ministry made the prediction before the United States
introduce a new GSP program when its existing one is due to expire
on May 30.
</P>
<P>
Thailand emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the US GSP in
the region after the US gradually lifted its GSP privileges for
Malaysia, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Thai electronics exporters said that their exports will be
affected seriously if the US decides to end GSP privileges for
their products.
</P>
<P>
The exporters said that they will lose the price
competitiveness they are enjoying now on the US market.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai Plastic Industries Association said that Thai
plastic products would remain active on the US market even without
GSP privileges.

<HEADLINE> Study under Way for Handling Taiwan Hijacker Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior official in charge of
Taiwan affairs said in Beijing today that relevant departments of
the Chinese mainland are studying the issue of a Taiwan hijacker.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, executive vice-chairman of the Association for
Relations across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), made this announcement
while answering reporters' questions at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan plane was hijacked to the city of Xiamen in east
China's Fujian Province on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Xiamen Airport had taken good, proper care of the hijacked
plane, and provided food and drinks for passengers aboard," said
Tang, adding that the plane, after being refuelled, left Xiamen
for Taiwan at around 6:50 p.m. yesterday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ARATS has sent missages to the Foundation for
Exchange across the Taiwan Strait in Taiwan twice during this
period to provide the relevant information.
</P>
<P>
A plane hijackers is a criminal offender that should be
repatriated according to the Quemoy Agreement reached between the
ARATS and the Strait Exchange Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwanese side agreed in principle that plane hijackers
from the mainland should be repatriated, but fails to abide by the
agreement and has not sent them back up until now," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So the handling of the Taiwan hijacker issue is relatively
complicated. This is all due to the Taiwanese side," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The relevant departments of the Chinese mainland are making
further investigations on the Taiwan hijacker, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientist Finds New Way To Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli doctors are using a
remote-control device to help women with atonic bladders to
urinate, a way regarded as a breakthrough in the world, The
Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The device was developed by Dr. Ofer Nativ, a urologist at Bnei
Zion Hospital in Haifa, north Israel.
</P>
<P>
The invention is meant for women who were born without
muscular control of their bladder, or who lost control due to
neurological illnesses or traumatic injury.
</P>
<P>
The device, called the intra-urethral sphincter and pump
prosthesis, draws urine from the bladder using a small pump that
can remain in the woman's body for a month or more.
</P>
<P>
Periodically, the woman holds a cigar-shaped remote-control
device -- which contains a battery -- next to her lower abdomen
to activate a magnet that turns on the pump. When all the urine
has emptied out, the device beeps.
</P>
<P>
The battery is changed every few weeks, and the 2.5 to 6
centimeters silicone tube and pump are changed every four weeks
to three months. In many cases, the patient herself can change
them.
</P>
<P>
"Without this device, women have to undergo the time-consuming,
annoying, embarrassing and limiting procedure of inserting a
catheter into their urethra five or six times a day to drain the
urine," said Nativ.
</P>
<P>
The traditional catheterization is usually done by a specially
trained person, and sometimes by the patient herself. If any
residual urine remains in the bladder, infections or bleeding
could result. Other patients have a stoma leading out of the
abdomen and a urine-collection bag that must be emptied several
times a day, according to Nativ.

<HEADLINE> International Stonetech Exhibition Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of over 150 businesses
from more than a dozen countries and regions today displayed their
latest technologies and stone products at the Stonetech Exhibition
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises from Italy, Portugal, Finland, Greece, Spain, the
United States, India, Canada, the Republic of Korea, as well as
from Hong Kong and Taiwan have participated in the exhibition,
co-sponsored by the China State Administration of Building
Materials Industry and the China Chamber of International
Commerce (CCIC).
</P>
<P>
According to senior CCIC official Liu Jingzhou, the expanding
cooperation between stone enterprises from different countries has
vigorously boosted the industry development.
</P>
<P>
China's export volume of stone topped a record 700 million US
dollars in 1996. So far, China has found markets for its stone
products in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Germany, the United
States, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has introduced a large amount of advanced
equipment from Italy, Germany and other countries. By drawing on
advanced foreign technology, China has developed equipment which
conforms to the country's stone production needs.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has set up over 100 equipment manufacturing
enterprises for stone production. Starting in 1990, China has
exported equipment for stone production to Russia, Kazakhstan,
Pakistan, Indonesia and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
China produced 100 million sq m of stone materials including
granite, marble and terrazzo in 1996, ranking behind Italy as the
world's second-largest producer of stone, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Border Fair Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbin, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Border fair trade between
China's Heilongjiang Province and Russia witnessed record-high
growth in 1996, according to latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The volume of such business topped 350 million US dollars,
more than double the figure of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to official definition, border fair trade refers to
that trade done within 20 square kilometers from the border at
government-designated markets.
</P>
<P>
The increase was scored after Sino-Russian border trade had
slipped due to policy readjustments between the two governments
and quality problems.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage border transaction, the Chinese
Government exempted tariffs on items priced below 1,000 yuan
(120.48 US dollars) for each person daily.
</P>
<P>
Another factor was enhanced market supervision on the Chinese
side to ensure the quality of the commodities traded.

<HEADLINE> Chung Ying Street Should Keep Its Name: Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chung Ying Street, linking
Shenzhen and Hong Kong, should retain its name after Hong Kong's
return to the motherland in July and be made into a venue for
education in patriotism, two legislators proposed.
</P>
<P>
"Chung Ying" literally means "Sino-British" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by Zhang Lei and Lu Peiyan, both
Guangdong deputies to the Eighth National People's Congress, which
has been in session here since March 1.
</P>
<P>
The 250-m-long and 3.5-m-wide street, where two social systems
coexist, is deemed as an epitome of the modern history of China.
It was a small river before silting turned it into a strip of
grassland.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 99 years ago, Britain forced the Qing government of
China to sign Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong. Ever
since then, the street has remained separated into two parts.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and Lu proposed that the Shenzhen city and the future
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region keep the
name of Chung Ying Street, to let future generations of the
Chinese people bear in mind the painful page in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed that a "Chung Ying Street Museum" be
established and made into a venue for education in patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Related departments have already begun to study the proposal,
it is learned.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Former United States National
Security Adviser and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger will
address Wednesday here a group of top Filipino policy makers on
global implications of Southeast Asian unification.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported today that Kissinger's
vision on the Southeast Asian unification could be a major policy
input to policies that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) is currently working on as it prepares for its 30th
founding anniversary in August this year.
</P>
<P>
Grouping Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, the ASEAN now hopes to advance
its "ASEAN-10" goal for the year of 2000 to this year.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN is expected to include by August this year the last
three Southeast Asian countries into its fold -- Cambodia, Laos
and Myanmar, the Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger arrived here Monday for a series of major policy
speaking with various groups from the government, the academia and
the private business sector of the country.
</P>

University of the Philippines at its Diliman Campus in Quezon
City, Metro Manila, after addressing a special student convocation
at the state university.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Sudan Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda denied yesterday Sudan's
accusation about its involment in internal conflict in southern
Sudan, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Medi Kaggwa, the State Minister in Uganda's President's Office
for Political Affairs, told ''the New Vision'', ''Uganda
(Ugandans) is not in Sudan and neither do we want to intend to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
An official statement of the Sudanese armed forces broadcasted
later Sunday said that the Ugandan armed forces attacked Sudanese
border town of Kaya earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local media said the attackers are the rebels of Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA). The latest news reaching here said the
Sudanese rebels were 10 kilometers away from Yei yesterday, an important
garrison city in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The loud crossfires were heard in northwestern Ugandan city of
Arua, some 77 kilometers south of the Uganda-Sudan border.
</P>
<P>
Shaban Bantariza, the Public Relation Officer of the Fourth
Division of the Ugandan army, told local journalists in northern
city of Gulu, ''we are only at borders waiting for rebels.''
</P>
<P>
There are two Ugandan rebel groups in the area affected by the
bloody conflict -- the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) and the Uganda
National Rescue Front, Part Two (UNRF ii). Reports reaching here
said the two rebel groups were covering the Sudanese army in its
fighting against SPLA rebels.
</P>
<P>
At least 86 officers and soldiers of the Sudanese army and Ugandan
rebels were killed in the fighting since earlier Sunday, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Amama Mbabazi, Ugandan State Minister for Defence, confirmed to
local English newspaper ''the Crusader'' that Major General Mugisha
Muntu, the Ugandan Army Commander, shifted to Gulu to monitor the
developemnt in southern Sudan. The army commander is likely to stay
in the north ''as long as his presence was required,'' Amama said.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has been fighting for independence of Christian-dominated
south from the Moslem dominated north.
</P>
<P>
Eriya Kateaya, the First Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of
Foreign Affairs of Uganda, said the planned Iran-brokered
Uganda-Sudan talk will be held in Kampala on Friday as scheduled.

<HEADLINE> New Political Group Formed in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A non-government political
party consisting of personages in Kuwait has been formed in
disregard of the official rejection of such organizations in the
Islamic Gulf country.
</P>
<P>
The new group, called the Kuwait Society for the Defense of
Public Fund, announced its formation Monday afternoon at a meeting
attended by some 200 of its members which include some former
parliamentary members, prominent businessmen and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
The group, which was designed to help check corruption,
applied to Kuwaiti Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour for
official recognition, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the current law, the Kuwaiti government has suspended the
formation of any Non-Governmental organizations. However, such
groups do exist in fact without official recognition.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the new group were quoted as saying "the time is
right for such a movement (to defense public funds) to come out
and represent the moderates" in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution of the society, one of the basic
objectives is to protect public funds, through awareness,
education, preparation of studies, bills, and also to investigate
certain cases regarding embezzlements of public funds.
</P>
<P>
Its constitution defined public funds as "all funds owned by
the state and its establishments, and other companies where the
government has at least 25 percent of their shares."
</P>
<P>
The sources said the society does not mean to confront anyone
or anything and advocates a free market economy.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Stops Showing of Story of Filipino Overseas Maid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered to defer the public showing of a controversial film
about the suffering of a Filipino overseas contract worker.
</P>
<P>
Ramos sent an urgent fax message to the chairman of the Movie
and Television Regulation and Classification Board to stop showing
"The Sarah Balabagan Story" from Bahrain, the last leg of his
10-day visit to South Asia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He ordered the board to "take all necessary actions" to defer
the showing of the movie in an anticipation that the film would
have an extreme negative impact on the relations between the
Philippines and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos also asked the Department of Justice to study
the possibility of filing a temporary restraining order on the
movie on the ground of national interest.
</P>
<P>
The movie is about a teenage Filipino Muslim girl who was
sentenced to death for killing a UAE national after she defended
her womanhood.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government, particularly President Ramos asked
the UAE government to save Balabagan from execution.
</P>
<P>
In response to the appeal that also included an appeal from
various world organizations to spare the young Filipino girl from
the death sentence, the UAE commuted the sentence to a few years
imprisonment and eventually released her from prison last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Leonides Caday earlier wrote a
memo to President Ramos, recommending the stopping of the film
from being shown to the public.
</P>
<P>
Caday said the movie contains some portion in which the UAE
will resent like the rape scene which was not consummated but
displayed the killing of Mr. Baloushi, the UAE national killed by
Balabagan.
</P>
<P>
The UAE government has already warned that the showing of the
film may have a negative effect on the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency said the showing of the film might
also affect the life of another Filipino facing death penalty in
the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Crisis Remains Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The current Israeli-Palestinian
crisis has remained despite a high-level meeting Monday night
between Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Palestinian
Culture and Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the 90-minute meeting held in Tel Aviv, Rabbo
said the two sides failed to bridge the huge gap on the issues of
Israel's decision on further troop pullbacks, its plan to build
Har Homa neighborhood and to close four Palestinian offices in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) hopes to gain about 30
percent of the West Bank rather than the Israeli-decided 9
percent in every stage of the three-phase further pullbacks, and
it is demanding Israel to cancel the new plan to build 6,500
Jewish apartments in Har Homa of southeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"There is a crisis, and the crisis is becoming worse and
worse, because the agreements should be accepted and the
settlements and confiscation of land should stop," Rabbo said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, on his part, acknowledged the clear gap existing
between the two sides. But he defended Israel's decision on the
scope of further troop pullbacks and the plan to build the Har
Homa neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
He called on the PNA to continue the peace process and
refrain from violence despite the current crisis. "I suggest to
Mr. Rabbo and the Palestinian (National) Authority to continue to
do the best efforts together to move on quite a lot of subjects
that can improve the life of the Palestinians," he said.
</P>
<P>
With tension mounting, clashes broke out late Monday between
Israeli troops and Palestinian demonstrators in the volatile
West Bank town of Hebron, during which 11 Palestinians were
injured.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were trying to prevent Israeli bulldozers to
clear the ground to build a road connecting the nearby Kiryat
Arab settlement and the Jewish quarter of Hebron. The area has
been declared a closed military zone.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai warned that violence was "too dangerous" and could
destroy the peace process, adding he had asked Rabbo to send the
message to PNA President Yasser Arafat to do his best to prevent
violence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat warned earlier Monday that the peace march was in a
"real crisis" because of Israel's clear violation of the peace
accords. He called Israel's decisions on further pullbacks, on
Har Homa settlement construction and closure of the Palestinian
offices in East Jerusalem "tricks and conspiracies" against the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a sign apparently indicating the depth of the current
crisis, Israel Radio reported today that Arafat has refused to
answer telephone calls from Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu in the past days.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who left Monday for a two-day visit to Russia, has
instructed Foreign Minister David Levy to continue contacts with
the Palestinian side.

<HEADLINE> Pretoria's Munitoria Fire Not Arson, Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The fire which destroyed half of
Pretoria's City Council Administration complex, Munitoria, was caused
by a malfunctioning electrical component in a light fitting and not by
arson, fire investigators said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the forensic investigations, the fire started last
Monday evening when bitumen in the light's ballast, which used to
boost the voltage of the fluorescent light when it is turned on,
melted and caught fire, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Forensic investigator David Klatzow said the heat of the meltdown
would have pushed the flammable material up to near ignition
temperature and was set alight by a sperk from a short-circuit caused
by the meltdown.
</P>
<P>
The fire spread through the ceiling void (the space between floors)
from the basement into the main building, where it destroyed most of
the western section, causing millions of Rand's damage to the complex.
</P>
<P>
The bitumen, which is used as an insulator, would have dripped into
a drip tray, making the fire almost impossible to detect, said
Klatzow, adding it could have taken 30 to 90 minutes for the bitumen
to melt before catching fire.
</P>
<P>
However, he ruled out arson was the cause for the fire.
</P>
<P>
Negligence in maintaining the electrical fittings was also
dismissed by Klatzow and Kobus Strydom from the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research, another member of the investigation team.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fire department investigator Captain Andre de Beer said
his team had been able to pinpoint where the fire began from
witnesses's accounts, the damage to ceilings, and how the fire vented
itself.
</P>
<P>
Once the fire had spread into the ceiling void and into a
staircase, it was extremely difficult to stop, added Klatzow.
</P>
<P>
The fire flared up again twice last week but was quickly put out
each time. enditem

<HEADLINE> Petro-Chemical Center Taking Shape in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Maoming City in south China's
Guangdong Province is striving to become a petro-chemical
production base generating three billion yuan of output value
yearly by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The city has been accelerating construction of an oil refinery
with an annual processing capacity of 10 million tons, since the
operation of a 300,000-ton ethylene production facility in the
city in February, said a local official.
</P>
<P>
A heavy-oil catalytic cracker, with a processing capacity of
1.2 million tons, one of the key projects during the Ninth
Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000), reported a success on trial
processing in October last year.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2000, the city will have an oil refining
capacity of 1.7 million tons. Its ethylene production capacity
will be enlarged to 450,000 tons, and the annual ethylene
processing output value will amount to 10 billion yuan, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Maoming has emerged as an industrial city for the development
of shale oil and oil refining since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to build this city into a petro-chemical
production center is necessary to improve the backward economic
situation of the city and western Guangdong, said the official.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the 300,000-ton ethylene project,
which cost over 17 billion yuan, will be able to provide the
market with 890,000 tons of synthetic resin, synthetic rubber and
chemical raw materials. It will also generate seven billion yuan
of output value and 600 million yuan of after-tax profits a year
while advancing the city's industrial base by adding 10 billion
yuan of industrial output value yearly and creating 100,000 new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The city has made painstaking efforts to make the ethylene
project a complete success, including establishing a leading group
responsible for comprehensive development of the ethylene project
and related research organizations. The leading group has decided
to vigorously develop the processing industry by the immediate
consumption of ethylene by-products.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises to produce radial tires and aluminum plastic hybrid
materials have started construction.

<P>
HANGZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
this year plans to rearrange the investment structure to secure
sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the provincial economic planning authorities
revealed that the investment in fixed assets this year will be
limited to 185.5 billion yuan, with growth rate slightly less than
last year.
</P>
<P>
The capital is planned to be poured into agriculture,
infrastructure construction, and industries that could drive
future economic growth, as well as cultural, scientific and
educational fields.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang in recent years gradually adjusted the investment
structure and diverted the precious assets to needy sectors. An
increasing proportion of funds has been injected to energy,
transport and telecommunications projects, fields long considered
bottlenecks for local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to build an expressway linking Hangzhou, the
provincial capital, with Shanghai. The second-phase of Qinshan
Nuclear Power Plant, Yuxi Hydroelectric Power Plant, an airport in
Zhoushan Island, to name a few, are scheduled to start initial
construction.
</P>
<P>
The local government will establish measures to supervise use
of capital, reducing blind investment to a minimum.

NEW DELHI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Minister of
Agriculture and Food Processing Philippe Vasseur has held
discussions with his Indian counterpart Chaturanan Mishra as well
as other Indian ministers on cooperation in hi-tech areas of
agriculture and food processing.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, during the meetings,
Vasseur said that although some joint ventures existed between
France and India in dairy and aquaculture, new ventures were also
being identified.
</P>
<P>
These new ventures include post-harvest technology in fruit and
vegetables, food processing, he added.
</P>
<P>
India has sought the setting up of a new wholesale market with
French technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
France would have to be provided with a greater access to
Indian markets and similarly India would also have to have gained
more leverage on the European market. The issue would have to be
tackled with a great degree of caution, he added.
</P>
<P>
The French minister arrived here Sunday on a five-day visit to
India.

<HEADLINE> Courts in China's Interior Areas to Have Closer Ties With HK Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court,
together with relevant departments, will have closer judicial ties
with courts in Hong Kong and render assistance to each other in
line with provisions of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) and in accordance with the principle
of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
The remark was made today by Ren Jianxin, president of the
Supreme People's Court, at the Fifth Plenary Meeting of the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) in a report
on the work of the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
The Article 95 of the HKSAR Basic Law stipulates: "The Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region may, through consultations and
in accordance with law, maintain judicial relations with the
judicial organs of other parts of the country, and they may render
assistance to each other."
</P>
<P>
The top judge said that, after China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 this year, HKSAR will be
established according to provisions of the Constitution and the
Basic Law of HKSAR, where the policies of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR, in accordance with law, will enjoy independent
judicial powers, including that of final adjudication, he said.
Courts in Hong Kong will undoubtedly increase exchanges and ties
with courts in other parts of China after Hong Kong's return, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the top judge, Chinese courts handled and
concluded 3,831 cases involving Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in
1996, up by 11.59 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Ren said people's courts have abided by state laws and
regulations and followed the principle of "one country, two
systems" when dealing with cases involving Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The people's courts, he said, have safeguarded the legitimate
interests of litigants and impartially handled the cases by
proceeding from the principle of promoting economic and trade
relations between inland areas and Hong Kong and Macao and
promoting cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Relocates Over 700 Factories From Downtown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city has
relocated over 700 industrial firms from the urban districts in a
move to reduce pollution and make room for the development of the
service trade.
</P>
<P>
The city, pledging to become an international economic,
financial and trade center, plans to make large-scale
readjustments to the existing 3,000-plus factories.
</P>
<P>
Of this group, more than 2,000 will be moved to the suburban
areas or be turned into service firms.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the 700 relocated factories,
including textiles and chemical companies, are serious polluters,
and their removal has left a three sq km-space suitable for the
development of real estate, trade and banking industries.
</P>
<P>
The city government has drafted preferential policies for the
purpose. Local unprofitable firms see this as a good opportunity
for future development, while many overseas companies have been
engaged in the development of the former sites.
</P>
<P>
The readjustments will be completed before the year 2010, and
by then, Shanghai will see a five sq km-central office block, a 30
sq km-central commercial area and a 70 sq km downtown.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hails Mexico's Appointment of New Anti-drug Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
applauded Mexico's appointment of new top anti-drug officer,
saying it would help dispel doubt about President Bill Clinton's
decision to certify Mexico as an ally in the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo named Mariano Herran
Salvatti, a lawyer, to replace former anti-drug chief, Gen. Jesus
Gutierrez Rebollo, who was arrested on charges of accepting pay
from Mexico's top drug lord.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the
nomination should be welcomed by the U.S. Congress, which has been
critical of Clinton's move, saying Mexico lacked sincerity and
capability in combating drugs.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a highly significant appointment which ought to
be welcomed by the detractors of our president's policy," Burns
said. "We have absolute trust and confidence in President
Zedillo."
</P>
<P>
Burns hoped the announcement "will convince those in Congress
and those around the country and perhaps even in our own
hemisphere who have any doubts that President Zedillo's commitment
to wage the war against narcotics is genuine."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the International Relations Committee of U.S. House
of Representatives voted 27-5 to overturn Clinton's certification
that Mexico was fully cooperating in the battle against drugs.
The full House is to vote later this week.
</P>
<P>
A similar measure has been introduced in the Senate and its
Foreign Relations Committee has scheduled a hearing on the issue
for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton today also defended his decision to certify Mexico and
vowed to convince the U.S. Congress to back his position.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to do my best to persuade the Congress that we're
right," Clinton said at a joint White House news conference with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

to study, according to a new policy of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission will give preference to Xinjiang

areas have always suffered from a scarcity of trained personnel.
</P>

This year, the quota of people to study abroad is expected to
reach 150 from five autonomous regions and Yunnan province which
boasts a great variety of minorities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nepal's New Prime Minister Chand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Before being appointed prime
minister of Nepal's new government by King Birendra Monday night,
Lokendra Bahadur Chand had been prime minister twice during the
partyless Panchayat era which ended in the country in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Chand, parliamentary leader of the National Democratic Party
(RPP), is expected to form his cabinet and take the oath later
today with the participation of the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) and the Nepal Goodwill Party
(NSP).
</P>
<P>
Born in a landlord family in far western hilly district of
Baitadi in 1940, Chand received higher education in the capital
and the neighboring India by completing his two bachelor's degrees
of arts and law.
</P>
<P>
He began his political career in 1968 when being elected a
deputy representing his home village in the then Panchayat
legislature of the Baitadi district, nearly 400 km from Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
He was elected to the national Panchayat legislature, or the
National Assembly, six years later and became vice chairman of the
legislature in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chand was appointed prime minister for the first time in July
1983 by King Birendra under the recommendation of the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that he was destined to become the last prime
minister under the Panchayat system, which was introduced in 1960
following a ban on political parties, when he was again appointed
to the post in 1990.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra abolished the partyless legislature and
reinstated the multi-party parliamentary system in the same year
amid a nationwide people's movement jointly led by the Nepali
Congress (NC) party and the Communist party.
</P>
<P>
Chand formed his RPP party, whose membership mostly comprises
former Panchayat members, in 1990 and the RPP party won 19 seats
of the 205-seat lower house in the 1994 mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
He managed to bring down a three-party government led by NC
leader Sher Bahadur Deuba last week through joining hands with the
main opposition the CPN-UML, which has 90 MPs in the house.

<HEADLINE> More Farming Machines Used in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The farm machinery market has
been expanding fast with the development of the rural economy in
east China's Jiangsu province in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the total power of farm machinery in the province
reached 23 million kw, at about the same level in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu now has 815,000 tractors, 22,000 havesters and 1.4
million pieces of supporting machinery.
</P>
<P>
Now 55 percent of farm jobs in the province are done by
machines, said local government officials.
</P>
<P>
Increase in grain purchase price and the wider use of advanced
techniques have encouraged the use of farm machinery. And more
farmers are considering buying such machinery for themselves.
</P>
<P>
The craze for farm machinery has brought good profits for
manufacturers. Haima Harvester Plant, the largest farm machinery
manufacturer in the province, completed a business volume of 30
million yuan last year, twice that in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign manufacturers also rushed into the province to get a
share in the market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Albanian Political Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Washington today welcomed a
political agreement between Albanian President Sali Berisha and
the opposition to form an interim coalition government ahead of
early elections in June, a U.S. State Department spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
"We join our European partners in welcoming the agreement
between President Berisha and the opposition in Albania, " State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"We now strongly urge all parties in Albania to implement this
agreement, to implement the amnesty, the cease-fire, and to work
towards the formation of the new government," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a new prime minister will be named by
Berisha and the deputy prime minister will be appointed by the
opposition. The rest of the ministerial posts will be divided
equally between Berisha's Democratic Party and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Berisha was forced to agree to set up the interim government
following weeks of unrest in the country and a week of fighting
between the military and rebels demanding his resignation in the
wake of the collapse of pyramid investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people lost their life savings and blamed Berisha
for allowing the schemes. Weeks of street protests turned violent
10 days ago when rebels looted army depots for weapons and started
fighting government forces.
</P>
<P>
The government last week declared a state of emergency, but the
violence continued, centered around the key southern town of
Vlore. An estimated 40 people have died in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today rebels from Vlore signed an Italian-brokered
agreement with Berisha to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
Eight representatives of the rebels in Vlore signed a

<HEADLINE> US Government Urges Senate to Pass Chemical Weapons Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government said today
it will continue attempts to persuade the Senate to ratify the
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) by April 29 despite threats by
the treaty's opponents to use every effort to block it.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to maintain this issue as one of our most
important congressional issues, in fact, one of our most important
foreign policy issues in 1997," U.S. State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Jesse Helms, Chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, pledged to block the ratification unless the
convention was substantially modified.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the administration makes the modifications I am
demanding, the CWC will not leave my committee, " the Republican
senator declared.
</P>
<P>
If the United States does not ratify the CWC by April 29 when
it is due to go into effect, it cannot participate in the
committee that will draw up the treaty's rules of implementation.
</P>
<P>
Burns said there were strategic reasons for ratifying the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
"If we're not part of it (the committee), we leave ourselves
defenseless with no way to help write the rules of
implementation," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"By refusing to ratify, we won't have chemical weapons
ourselves, we won't be able to influence the international debate
to limit countries that do have them, " said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The CWC, which bans the production and stockpiling of all
chemical weapons has been ratified by more than 60 countries
including China, enough for the treaty to take effect on April 29
with or without the U.S.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Diplomats Lose Immunity from Parking Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- There was uproar in the
United Nations today when diplomats were told today that they
 would no longer be exempt from paying parking fines.
</P>
<P>
Starting next month, diplomats who fail to clear up their
tickets within 12 months would lose their license plates until
they paid up, U.S. and New York city officials said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. Committee on relations with the host
country, which deals with problems affecting the diplomatic
community, American United Nations Envoy Bill Richardson said:
"Consistent with the obligation of all to obey local laws,
beginning on April 1, the owners of diplomatic vehicles which have
parked illegally will be expected to either pay or otherwise
adjudicate all parking summonses received."
</P>
<P>
Objections were raised immediately by representatives of
Russia, France, Britain, China, Spain, Honduras, Costa Rica and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Several diplomats said the rules were being imposed without
proper consultation and called for the establishment of a working
group to study the matter.
</P>
<P>
Others complained that their vehicles had been deliberately
ticketed, even if parked in a reserved spot, and that unauthorized
vehicles in a diplomatic parking space were rarely towed or
ticketed.
</P>
<P>
After listing numerous annoying experiences with New York
police on the parking issue, a Russian diplomat concluded that the
New York city was not friendly to the diplomatic corps and that
the United Nations should move its headquarters to another place.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, a large-scale anti-UN campaign is a signal that now,
after 50 years, the city has grown tired of the United Nations,
fed up with its own problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
If this was the case, it was not the parking issue which should
be considered, he said. "What we should look into, then, are
offers from other cities to host the United Nations headquarters."
</P>
<P>
But Bill Richardson argued the U.S. State Department had
determined that the new policy and program were "consistent with
international law as well as with the host country's obligations
to the United Nations and the United Nations community in New
York."

<HEADLINE> New Way Found to Modify Ultra-tiny Structures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have developed a
method of modifying the outermost surface of materials which will
open the door for new applications in computing, microelectronics
and the storage of information.
</P>
<P>
The system brings ions in for a "soft-landing" on surfaces,
providing a new way to trap and study ions and modify the outmost
layer, says a newsletter from Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
Ions are electrically charged atoms, or groups of atoms.
</P>
<P>
The new technique is also outlined in the latest issue of the
Science journal.
</P>
<P>
"This not only allows us to preserve the ions for future use,
but also allows us to modify the surface of a material in a way
that is reversible." says Graham Cooks, professor of Chemistry at
Purdue, and chief researcher of the team.
</P>
<P>
Generally scientists use instruments called mass spectrometers
to study ions. However, ions are only stable while in flight. When
they hit a surface, crash landings take a toll on the tiny
structures, making it impossible to preserve them or deposit them
onto a surface without destroying them.
</P>
<P>
Even the most successful instruments can trap ions for only a
few seconds.
</P>
<P>
Cooks and his team developed a way to "parachute" ions onto a
surface and bring them in for a soft landing. "Our study shows for
the first time that polyatomic ions can be transferred from the
gas phase to a surface and held there for periods of days," cooks
said.
</P>
<P>
First, they made gold surfaces covered with a single layer of
organic molecules called fluoracarbons, which stood vertically
like flagpoles from the surface and were strongly bonded to the
gold. Then they attached bulky groups of trimethylsilicon
molecules to the end of each ion to slow its landing and ensure
that it did not hit the gold surface.
</P>
<P>
Once the ions landed -- wedging between the fluorocarbon
structures, the fluorocarbons served as shields to keep the
chemically reactive particles from interacting with the gold
surface or with molecules in the air.
</P>
<P>
"This experiment allows virtually any chemical species to be
generated in a mass spectrometer as an ion, and injected into a
surface," Cooks says.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka, Kuwait Make Progress in Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka-Kuwait Joint
Commission (SLKJC), which was set up at the end of last year, held
its first meeting here Monday evening, according to Trade Ministry
sources today.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Sri Lanka and Kuwait has shown remarkable
progress over the past several years, the sources quoted Trade
Minister Kingsley Wickremaratne as saying at the opening session
of the SLKJC first meeting.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that trade with Kuwait had brought Sri Lanka
Rs 720 million (12.8 million U.S. dollars) in foreign exchange and
Sri Lanka's main export item tea enjoyed a market share of 42
percent of the total tea market in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
They said that the two countries had been linked in trade over
centuries and the current meeting would help renew tie-ups, mutual
understanding and respect.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's exports to Sri Lanka reached 10 million U.S. dollars
in 1995 and in the first nine months of 1996 increased to 11.5
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Sri Lankan workers are employed in Kuwait,

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Call for More Organ Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Eight medical experts in China's
top advisory body today raised a proposal calling on more people
in China to donate their organs and bodies posthumously to save
the life of patients suffering organic exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Zheng Falei with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,
and seven other members of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which is in
its fifth annual session here, have followed the example of some
Chinese legislators, who set forth a proposal on posthumous organ
donation several days ago.
</P>
<P>
All eight members are noted medical experts, including two
academicians of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and
vice-presidents of several major hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"Donation of organs and bodies after death is a embodiment of
lofty moral integrity, and a concrete expression of the ethical
and cultural progress of the mankind," they noted in the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Describing organic exhaustion as one of the most serious
threats that endangers the people's health and life, the experts
acknowledged that organ transplant has become a popular means of
rescuing human life in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that to date, more than 400,000 people around
the world have received transplanted organs, and 300,000 of them
now have transplanted kidneys. Moreover, marrow, heart, liver and
other organs can also be transplanted.
</P>
<P>
In spite of marked progress scored across China in this field
since the early 1970s, organ transplant still falls far behind
that in the developed countries, owing mainly to a lack of donors.
</P>
<P>
"The state should step up the ethical education on organ
transplant in whole society, and increased efforts should be made
to spread scientific knowledge in public," the experts suggested.

</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, on a one-day visit to
Poland today, made the remarks following a meeting with his
Polish counterpart Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy supported Poland's bid to join NATO and the
European Union and didn't agree with giving Russia a veto on
NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Russia and NATO are locked in a bitter row over plans by NATO
to decided at the summit which eastern European countries should
be the first to be invited to join the military alliance. Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic are the favorites.
</P>
<P>
Prodi also met Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski, who is
expected to visit Italy early next month.

<HEADLINE> Nepali New Govt for Nation's Prosperity: Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's new government, led by
Lokendra Bahadur Chand of the National Democratic Party (RPP),
will bring about political stability and work for all-round
development in the country, a ruling partners' joint statement
said here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued soon after King Birendra appointed RPP
parliamentary leader Chand as prime minister of a new government
which is expected to be joined by the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) and the Nepal Goodwill Party
(NSP).
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday Chand submitted a petition to the king, claiming
to form the new government with support of a majority of 103 MPs,
including those of the CPN-UML and the NSP, in the 205-seat lower
house.
</P>
<P>
Chand's coalition will replace the outgoing three-party
government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC),
which resigned last Thursday after losing a confidence vote in the
house.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement, issued by Chand, CPN-UML parliamentary
leader Man Mohan Adhikari and NSP leader Gajendra Narayan Singh,
said that the formation of the new government will put an end to
the confusion and uncertainty existing in the country for some
time and help bring about political stability.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the government will be to preserve the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country
and work for all-round national development, it said.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders promised that the new government will take
institutional and various other practical measures to bring
corruption, financial irregularity and smuggling under control.
</P>
<P>
Pledging that the coalition will work on the basis of national
consensus, the statement called for cooperation from all political
parties to the new government's future measures to be initiated
for the larger interest and prosperity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Within the next few days, the government will come up with
common targets, policies and programs with the objective of
promoting the country's economic development along with social
justice, equality and the well-being of all communities, it said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Crack Down on University Exam Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai government agencies
concerned are working on a plan to check cheating behaviors during
the country's university entrance examinations, a senior Thai
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the practice this year, the Police Department will
cooperate with University Affairs Ministry officials in detecting
the movement of suspected gangs, said Pramote Chotemongkhol,
deputy permanent secretary of the University Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Post and Telegraph Office has also agreed to lend its
mobile units to help detect electronic signals sent by the gangs,
Pramote said.
</P>
<P>
Details of the plan will be kept secret, Pramote added.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that numerous incidents of cheating
occurred over the past 10 years in the country, but few people
were arrested for the practice.
</P>
<P>
Gangs usually directed students sitting in the examination to
answer questions through their special electronic signaling
devices.
</P>
<P>
Customers were usually charged about 25,000 baht (1,000 U.S.
dollars) each and the amount can be higher for popular
specialties.

<HEADLINE> North American Countries to Continue Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will head the recovery
rate among the three North American countries from their
recession-hit economies, at least until 1998, a trinational report
said today
</P>
<P>
Mexico's GNP is expected to grow more than four percent through
1997 and 1998, much higher than its northern neighbors of Canada
and the United States, said the report by the United States-Canada
Conference Board and the Center of Economic Studies of the Private
Sector in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to grow 4.8
percent this year and 5.2 percent in 1998. Mexico was still
recovering from the "dramatic plunge" that followed the
devaluation of the pesos in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.S' GDP growth, stimulated by low interest rates, strong
consumption and confidence in the business sector, was projected
at 2.9 percent in 1997 and 2.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Canada's GNP, driven more by the exporting sector than by its
internal situation, would grow by 2.9 percent in 1997 and 2.7
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that this would be the first year since
1994 in which the three north American countries' domestic
economies grew significantly, but warned that their trade balances
and inflation might threaten growth.
</P>
<P>
The three countries would face growing trade deficits in 1997
and 1998, a fact that could be more complicated due to a possible
hike in U.S. domestic interest rates and a slight rebound in
inflation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Canada, the U.S. and Mexico make up the North American Free
Trade Agreement which was launched on January 1, 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's Foreign Minister Gennady
Udovenko will visit NATO's headquarters in Brussels on March 20,
to seek political support from the military bloc.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko announced the visit himself at a press here today. He
said he would discuss broadening cooperation with the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's Secretary General, Javier Solana,
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
NATO should provide Ukraine with political support because the
former Soviet republic, having given up its nuclear weapons, was
playing an important role in maintaining Europe's security,
Udovenko said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine was not a member of NATO, so the fifth article of the
NATO charter could not apply to Ukraine, Udovenko said. The fifth
article says when a member is threatened, other NATO members will
offer their collective support.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Procuratorates Deal Harsh Blow to Criminals: Procurator-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's procuratorates at all
levels dealt a harsh blow to serious criminal offenses last year,
Procurator-General Zhang Siqing said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his work report of the Supreme People's Procuratorate to the
fifth session of the Eighth National people's Congress (NPC),
Zhang said that the procuratorates nationwide in the past year put
on file for investigation and prosecution a total of 61,099 cases
involving embezzlements, bribes, diversion of public funds and
large amounts of unidentified assets and 21,257 cases in bending
the law for personal gains, fraudulent practices, illegal
custodies, dereliction of duty, violations of citizens' personal
rights and democratic rights, thereby avoiding an otherwise loss
of 6.78 billion yuan for the state and the collective.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the number of major cases involving Party and
government departments, administrative and law-enforcement
institutions, judicial institutions, and economic management
departments, especially those by leading officials, increased.
</P>
<P>
Of the suspects investigated last year, 13,530 were in the
above-mentioned institutions and departments, up 3.5 percent over
last year. Five of them were officials at the provincial or
ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
A considerable proportion of the cases involved embezzlement
and bribes valued between several hundreds of thousands of yuan
and tens of millions of yuan, with cases involving embezzlement or
bribes valued at more than one million yuan numbering 156 and the
number of cases involving diversion of public funds of over 10
million yuan standing at 57, including five with a value of over
100 million yuan, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
As an integral part of the campaign to severely punish
criminals in accordance with the law, the procuratorates approved
arrests of 17 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the procuratorates last year approved the
arrests of 18,860 people related to the smuggling, trafficking,
transport and manufacturing of drugs, filing law suits against
18,501 of them.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, procuratorates throughout China contested 2,405
verdicts that were believed to be misjudged or wrongly sentenced
last year, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
He added that a great effort was made last year to promote
socialist ethical and cultural progress among the procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
This year China will continue to severely punish criminals
according to law, in order to safeguard national security and
social stability, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts will also be made to fight against
corruption, promote the improvement of the Party's work style and
building of a clean and honest government, strengthen the
supervision of law enforcement, he said, urging procuratorates at
all levels to correctly handle the relations among reform,
development and stability and pay keen attention to the stability
of the social and political environment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, American Sailors Shake Hands in Pearl Harbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONOLULU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- American and Chinese sailors
gave each other guided tours of their ship decks today in Pearl
Harbor where Chinese naval vessels are on a courtesy call.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin, a guided missile destroyer and the flag ship of the
visiting Chinese vessel group, was open to American sailors. The
4,200 ton ship was commissioned in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese sailors visited USS Ingersoll, an 8,200-ton
versatile multi-mission destroyer designed primarily for
anti-submarine warfare.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and American sailors seemed to have many questions to
ask each other. But communicating was difficult because very few
understood each other's language.
</P>
<P>
An American sailor who acted as interpretor for the Chinese
group, had to turn to a small dictionary for help, while the
Chinese sailors found the little English they had learned back at
home inadequate.
</P>
<P>
However, crew members from both sides agreed it was a learning
experience and they were interested in how other side run things.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a group of Chinese sailors visited the USS
Arizona, a warship sunk during the Japanese bombing of Pearl
Harbor on December 7, 1941 and which is now a memorial to
more than 1,000 U.S. soldiers perished during the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese naval group will stay here until March 13 and then
head for San Diego, a U.S. mainland port that Chinese naval ships
have never visited.

<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, held its
fifth plenary meeting here today, with legislators hearing work
reports of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's
Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
The plenary meeting was presided over by Lei Jieqiong,

Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, made a

</P>
<P>
"In 1996, the first year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), under the leadership of the Party and supervision of
the people's congresses, courts at all levels across the country,
including special courts such as military and maritime tribunals,
had accepted and heard over 5.26 million cases of first instance,
15.82 percent more than in the previous year," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Among all these criminal, civil, economic, administrative and
maritime cases, more than 5.23 million had been concluded, a 15.53
percent increase over 1995, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The courts have played a positive role in maintaining social
stability and safeguarding the smooth development of reforms,
opening up and socialist modernization drive through its trial
work," he claimed.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Favor Proposal on Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's top advisory
body considered it a feasible proposal to upgrade Chongqing to a
centrally-administered municipality.
</P>
<P>
Though these members have no right to vote on the proposal,
experts and scholars among the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, which is
having its session here, expressed their keen interest in what
they called "an important strategy which will be of vital
importance to the development of China's vast interior areas as
well as nationwide economic advances."
</P>
<P>
The proposal has been submitted to the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Elevating Chongqing will benefit the building of the Three
Gorges Project, especially the resettlement of one million people
necessitated by the project, said Pan Jiazheng, academician of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a bad idea to separate Sichuan, which is too big, "
said the well-known dam expert.
</P>
<P>
China at present has three centrally-administered
municipalities, namely Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. On the 14th
of this month, NPC deputies will vote on the proposal to establish
a Chongqing Municipality --the fourth one.
</P>
<P>
In China's Yangtze River Valley development strategy, Shanghai
is often likened to the "dragon head" and Chongqing the "dragon
tail." "How can the dragon move when the dragon tail remain
still?" asked one CPPCC member.
</P>
<P>
Only by building a major economic center can the southwest and
northwest free themselves from poverty, said Zhai Shijing, a
research fellow from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
While voicing their agreement to the proposal to build
Chongqing into an economic and industrial center, some top
advisors also expressed concern about whether Chongqing can match
the other three municipalities in cultural, scientific and
technological strength.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Fuyu, a senior engineer from the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, expressed belief that Chongqing has a solid
foundation in scientific and technological research strength, that
in the weapons industry and the conversion of military
technologies to civilian use, in particular.

"1997 is a year of great importance in the history of China's
development, and the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong and the convocation of the 15th Party national
congress are two major events drawing worldwide attention," he
noted. "Therefore, we must maintain social stability and keep a
sustained, rapid and sound development for the economy."
</P>
<P>
The major tasks he listed for 1997 include making unswerving
and unremitting efforts to carry out the "strike hard" campaign,
continuing to seriously punish criminals of embezzlement and
bribery, adjusting economic relations and protecting the
legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons in
accordance with law, improving judicial competence, and making
every effort to build a high-quality contingent of judges.
</P>
<P>
This year, he said, Chinese courts at all levels would carry
work forward at the behest of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, hold high the
banner of Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, adhere to the Party's basic line, and, under the
leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin
at the core and the supervision of the people's congresses,
upgrade the trial work onto a new level, so as to serve reforms,
development and stability, and safeguard and promote a coordinated
development of socialist material and ethical-cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
In a work report to the legislators, Zhang Siqing, chief
procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said that during
the past year, procuratorial organs across the country had scored
all-round progress in various aspects of their work.
</P>
<P>
"We have resolutely investigated and handled major cases of
embezzlement, bribery, and abuse of power to serve one's friends
or relatives that involved government functionaries, dealt hard
blows at serious criminal activities, and made every effort to
strengthen supervision on law enforcement," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he said, Chinese procuratorial organs at all levels
had filed to investigate more than 61,000 criminal cases of
embezzlement, bribery, misappropriation of public funds, and huge
assets with unidentified sources.

They had also looked into over 21,000 cases of abuse of power
for the benefits of one's friends and relatives, illegal
detention, negligence of duty, and infringement on citizens'
personal and democratic rights, and retrieved a direct economic
loss of 6.78 billion yuan for the state and the collective, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the work has been done in a deep-going
way, and certain progress scored," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that last year more than 13,500 criminal suspects,
including staff members of leading Party and government
departments and employees of administrative law-enforcing units,
judicial, and economic administrative departments, were
investigated, up by 3.5 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 2,699 were leading officials at and above the
county level, including five leaders at the provincial or ministry
level. To date, the procuratorates have ended investigations on
and taken legal proceedings against 961 suspects.
</P>
<P>
The chief procurator said that there are three major tasks for
the procuratorial work this year, which include continuing to wage
the "strike hard" campaign to safeguard national security and
social stability, carrying on the anti-corruption efforts by
probing into major cases to boost the Party morale and build a
clean and honest government, and enhancing supervision over law
enforcement so as to push forward the administration of the
country according to law.
</P>
<P>
"Procuratorates at all levels and their staff must have a clear
understanding of the overall situation, properly handle the
relations between reform, development and stability, pay close
attention to stability in social and political atmosphere, and
insist on the principle of 'enforcing the law seriously and
focusing on handling of cases', to do a good job in various
aspects of the procuratorial work," he demanded.

SHIJIAZHUANG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A remote village in north
China's Hebei Province is now famous as the "village of
businesswomen".
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five percent of female laborers in the Beiyuanzi Village
are engaged in business.
</P>
<P>
With population of 3,197, the village was once a rustic town in
the mountains, where cooking and taking care of babies was
considered to be a woman's primary role.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980's, when policies of "reform and opening up" were
enforced in this small village, women began to take jobs as men do.
</P>
<P>
The local women's association and government organizations
injected massive aid in the form of preferential policies and
loans.
</P>
<P>
Now a contingent of businesswomen have entered the market, each
of them enjoying per capita income of more than 20,000 yuan every
year.
</P>
<P>
While they were getting richer, the women broke away from the
old traditional ways of thought of "a woman who has virtue is a
woman who needs no higher learning." In the village, 80 percent of
the women have now joined training courses of various kinds.

installing new switches on the northern section of the
Beijing-Guangzhou Railways to increase speed on this major line.
</P>
<P>
The north-south trunk, together with the Beijing-Shanghai and
Beijing-Harbin lines, will begin to operate at a speed of 140
km-160 km per hour. Previously, the speed has been less than 100
km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Recently, double-deckers have been making trial runs between
Beijing and Beidaihe, a coastal tourist resort in Hebei
Province. And the speed on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railways has been
increased to 180 km per hour on some sections.
</P>
<P>
All major railways in the country have been upgrading parts
such as switches to become faster. The new type of switches are
manufactured by the Shanhaiguan Bridge Plant.
</P>
<P>
Local experts attribute the low speed of the country's rails to
the poor quality of tracks and switches, and the large number of
curves.
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, rails, with the length of 1,000 m for a
single piece, were placed on the major lines, while many
elbow-shape spots have been straightened. These improvements allow
for increased speeds.
</P>
<P>
Beginning on April 1, the speed will be raised on these major
lines with Beijing at the center.
</P>
<P>
The railways are China's largest means of transport, carrying
50 percent of the country's passenger transportation and 70
percent of the total cargo shipping.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Members of the South
American Common Market (Mercosur) absorbed 35 percent of the
foreign investments in Latin America last year, the
Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank said today.

period.
</P>
<P>
The regional trading bloc, comprises Argentina, Brazil,

</P>
<P>
The growth of investments was mainly due to the heavy inflow of
capital to Brazil, 8.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Privatization and domestic demand in Argentina and Brazil
appeared to have been the main attractions for the capital inflow
into the two biggest economies in the group.

</P>
<P>
Official figures show that some 27,600 people were registered

<HEADLINE> China Spares No Effort in Combating Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's judicial and
procuratorial systems concentrated their resources last year on
combating serious crimes and, as a result, effectively safeguarded
social stability.
</P>
<P>
Crimes that were dealt with harshly included those that
seriously threatened public security, and embezzlement and
bribery, said Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's
Court, and Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, in their respective work reports to the
ongoing Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
To check a rise in crimes in some parts of the country, the
judicial and procuratorial systems, in coordination with pubic
security, state security and administrative departments, launched
what is called a "strike hard" campaign nationwide last April to
crack down on serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was aimed at fighting mainly the following crimes:
violent crimes, gun-related crimes, gang crimes, drug-related
crimes, crimes that sabotage the socialist market economic order,
embezzlement, bribery and misappropriation of public fund.
</P>
<P>
The judicial and procuratorial systems also conscientiously
took comprehensive measures to ensure public security and
persisted in combining "strike hard" with "prevention," to
consolidate and develop the achievements of the "strike hard"
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide campaign has hit hard the arrogance of criminals
and achieved important results as evidenced by a marked
improvement in public order, said Zhang Siqing, the
procurator-general.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, violent crimes, drug-related crimes,
gang crimes and crimes having mafia features still run rampant in
some parts of the country. Consequently, procuratorial
departments will step up the "strike hard" campaign to safeguard
national security and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin said courts at all levels will steadfastly follow
the principle of harsh and quick punishment in accordance with law
and carry on the campaign, dealing harshly with "criminal
elements" that commit murder, robbery and bombing, and punishing,
in accordance with law, criminals who harm state security.
</P>
<P>
He added the courts will also severely punish those involved in
prostitution, and the production and trading of pornographic
materials and those who organize gambling. Particular attention
will be paid to cracking down on drug-related crimes in accordance
with a national drug elimination plan covering the 1996-2000
period, he said.

<HEADLINE> Courts in China's Interior Areas to Have Closer Ties With HK Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court,
together with relevant departments, will have closer judicial ties
with courts in Hong Kong and render assistance to each other in
line with provisions of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) and in accordance with the principle
of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
The remark was made today by Ren Jianxin, president of the
Supreme People's Court, at the Fourth Plenary Meeting of the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) in a report
on the work of the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
The Article 95 of the HKSAR Basic Law stipulates: "The Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region may, through consultations and
in accordance with law, maintain judicial relations with the
judicial organs of other parts of the country, and they may render
assistance to each other."
</P>
<P>
The top judge said that, after China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 this year, HKSAR will be
established according to provisions of the Constitution and the
Basic Law of HKSAR, where the policies of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR, in accordance with law, will enjoy independent
judicial powers, including that of final adjudication, he said.
Courts in Hong Kong will undoubtedly increase exchanges and ties
with courts in other parts of China after Hong Kong's return, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the top judge, Chinese courts handled and
concluded 3,831 cases involving Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in
1996, up by 11.59 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Ren said people's courts have abided by state laws and
regulations and followed the principle of "one country, two
systems" when dealing with cases involving Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The people's courts, he said, have safeguarded the legitimate
interests of litigants and impartially handled the cases by
proceeding from the principle of promoting economic and trade
relations between inland areas and Hong Kong and Macao and
promoting cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Courts Playing Active Role in China's Modernization (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's top judge said the
country's judicial system will serve the reform, opening-up and
stability, guarantee and promote the coordinated development of
socialist material and cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, said
courts at all levels will carry work forward at the behest of Deng
Xiaoping, hold high the great banner of Deng's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the Party's
basic line, and under the leadership of the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core and the supervision of the
people's congress, elevate the judicial work onto a still higher
level.
</P>
<P>
Ren made the remark at the Fourth Plenary Meeting of the
ongoing Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the first year of China's Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), courts at all levels across China and special courts
such as military and maritime tribunals handled a total of 5.26
million cases of the first instance, and concluded 5.23 million
cases, up 15.82 percent and 15.53 percent respectively from 1995.
And the rises were higher than in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The judicial system played an active role in safeguarding
social stability, guaranteeing the smooth progression of China's
reform and opening-up and its socialist modernization drive, said
Ren.
</P>
<P>
He noted that maintaining social stability is the premise for
the smooth progression of reform and opening-up and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, courts across the country, resolutely following the
major policy decisions made the Party Central Committee on
carrying out the "strike hard" campaign to crack down on crimes,
handled 570,000 criminal cases of the first instance and concluded
570,300 cases, a rise of 15.39 percent and 14.97 percent from the
previous year. And 614,000 people were tried and their verdicts
have taken effect.
</P>
<P>
In the "strike hard" campaign and their efforts to crack down
on economic crimes, courts across the country followed the
principle of rendering harsh punishment on criminal and economic
cases in accordance with the law, said Ren.
</P>
<P>
He added the courts also paid attention to the quality of their
work in handling cases, and courts on a higher level increased
their supervision and guidance to those at a lower level, while
major cases were vigorously handled and verdicts made public
promptly.

<P>
In their efforts to deal blows to criminal cases that seriously
threaten public security and serious economic cases, Ren observed,
the courts meted out hard blows to violent, gun-related and gang
crimes, drug cases, embezzlement, bribery, misappropriation of
public funds, and crimes that undermine the economic order.
</P>
<P>
The courts also handled a 4.69 million civil, economic,
maritime and administrative cases and concluded 4.66 million cases
last year, up 15.87 percent and 15.6 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Serious law enforcement, Ren pointed out, is an important part
of building a socialist legal system, and the fundamental
requirements of the Party and the state on judicial activities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese courts advanced the reform on the methods of
trials, increase supervision over trials and professional
guidance, and increase the execution of verdicts.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee law enforcement and judicial fairness, Ren noted,
Chinese courts has implemented the Law on Judges, and continue
improving the ideological, political, ethical and professional
quality of the judges over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Courts at all levels also dealt harshly with those who took
bribes, or bent the law for the benefit of relatives or friends.
Last year, a total of 1,051 people involved in such cases were
subjected to disciplinary or legal punishment.
</P>
<P>
With the China's resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty
over Hong Kong and the convocation of the 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China, Ren noted, 1997 will be an
important year in the history of China's development.
</P>
<P>
The new situation this year set still higher requirements for
the work of the courts, Ren remarked.
</P>
<P>
Main tasks for the courts this year include:
</P>
<P>
-- steadfastly and untiringly carrying out the "strike hard"
campaign;
</P>
<P>
-- continuing to punish harshly criminals involved in
embezzlement and bribery cases;
</P>
<P>
-- re-adjusting economic relations in accordance with the law;
</P>
<P>
-- protecting the legitimate rights and interests of citizens
and legal persons in accordance with the law;
</P>
<P>
-- and further improving the judicial standards and working
hard to improve the competence of the judges.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stock Exchange Urged to Find New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) has given the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) one
month to appoint a new president to replace Vitaliano Nanagas who
was forced to resign last week.
</P>
<P>
SEC Chairman Perfecto Yasay said Monday that until a new
president is appointed, the commission will not decide on the
PSE's standing application for full Self-Regulatory Organization
(SRO) status, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The concern of the commission is the ability of the exchange
to operate as a self-regulatory organization. Definitely, the
commission will not make a decision until Mr. Nanagas has been
replaced," he said.
</P>
<P>
The temporary SRO status the commission granted to the PSE last
December expired on February 28. On the same day, the commission
granted an indefinite extension to allow it to complete its review
of the PSE's requirements and regulatory plans.
</P>
<P>
Nanagas' departure was preceded by widespread discontent among
PSE staff which resulted in the resignation of key officials. Even
PSE Chief Operating Officer Rafael Llave was reportedly planning
to resign due to disagreements with Nanagas' management style.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said the SEC was considering the issuance of clear
guidelines to prevent a similar situation from happening again.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Rebels Agree to Lay Down Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Albanian rebels in the key southern
town of Vlore, have agreed to lay down their arms and implement a
peace deal with President Sali Berisha after talks with Italian
diplomats, local media said today.
</P>
<P>
Eight representatives from a rebel committee in the town, at
the forefront of the unrest sweeping the country, signed a
declaration on an Italian warship, the San Giogio, in the Adriatic
Sea after a meeting with the Italian Ambassador to Tirana Paolo
Foresti.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian authorities called on Rome to mediate with the
rebels to try and bring calm to Vlore which has been the scene of
intense fighting between rebels and the Albanian military over the
past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
"The committee ... undertook to favor the immediate handing
back of weapons in the hands of the citizens of Vlore and to
ensure public order and progressively restore normal
administration to the town," the declaration, which was published
by the Italian Foreign Ministry, read.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who paid a whirlwind
visit to Tirana Sunday night, welcomed the statement and pleaded
emergency aid from the international community to help restore
order in the country.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40 people have died in the violence that has swept
southern Albania in the wake of the collapse of dozens of pyramid
investment schemes in which thousands of people lost their life
savings. They have blamed President Berisha for allowing the
schemes and are demanding his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Berisha was re-elected unopposed by parliament as president for
a second five-year term last week. But on Sunday he was forced to
agree to form an interim coalition government to oversee early
general elections in June, and an grant amnesty to rebels who would
hand in their weapons within a week.
</P>
<P>
Despite Monday's deal with the rebels in Vlore, there were
reports that the revolt was still raging in many southern towns.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The members of the South
American Common Market (Mercosur), Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay and
Paraguay, reported an economic growth of 3.2 percent at the end of
1996 compared with the 1.1 percent reached in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) headed by
Enrique Iglesias, a Uruguayan, said that the higher rate of
economic growth was accompanied by a 7.6 percent drop in the
inflationary index in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless the positive results in the economy of this region
contrasted with a greater imbalance in its external accounts,
associated with the progress of Argentina and Brazil, the two
largest partners of the group.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures of the IDB document point out that Brazil
could show a four billion U.S. dollar trade deficit and a deficit
of more than 21 billion dollars in its current account.

Argentina, in turn, had a current account deficit of about 4.2

<HEADLINE> Philippine Lower House Pushes for Compromise on Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the Philippine House
of Representatives has expressed openness to a possible compromise
with the Department of Finance (DOF) on an individual income tax
bill that the Presidential Palace wants to be enacted by May 1.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press quoted House Speaker Jose de Venecia as
saying that a compromise on income tax would be worked out with
the executive branch to enable the country to exit from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the individual income tax bill, the last part of
the Comprehensive Tax Reform Package, is now the only structural
reform that remains tied to the country's graduation away from the
IMF this June.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia hosted a crucial breakfast meeting Monday with
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, Executive Secretary Ruben
Torres and leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, trying
to draw up the compromise.
</P>
<P>
The House and the DOF are now giving different versions of the
bill. The House tries to raise the exemption level for individuals
to 72,000 pesos (2,748 U.S. dollars) a year and an additional
deduction of 10,000 pesos (381 U.S. dollars) for each of up to
four children in a family.
</P>
<P>
The DOF, however, is batting for an exemption level of 20,000
pesos (763 U.S. dollars) and a 6,500-peso (248 U.S. dollars)
deduction for each dependent child.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia said later on the meeting was intended to "fully
reconcile the conflicting figures" so that the country can fully
exit from the IMF by June 30.
</P>
<P>
He had told President Fidel Ramos that he would expedite the
passing of the individual tax bill, but Senate President Ernesto
Maceda expressed fears that his chamber would not pass the bill on
time due to the delay in the House.

<HEADLINE> World Sugar Surplus Estimated at 3.4 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The sugar cane harvest for the
1996-97 cycle will result in a 3.5 million metric ton surplus of
sugar cane worldwide, taking into account the initial stocks of
42.6 million tons, an industry report said today.
</P>
<P>
The technical report, published by a group of sugar-exporting
Latin American and Caribbean countries (Geplacea) meeting this
week in Venezuela, says the surplus is the result of a number of
factors including production and consumption of sugar.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, output will reach 41 million metric tons for
the same period because of rising production in Central American,
Caribbean countries, Brazil and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, sugar production will fall, but it will
be made up by the increases estimated in the rest of the
continent.

<HEADLINE> Street Markets in Beijing to Move Indoors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Vendors at Beijing's free markets
will not be free to do business outdoors since the municipal
government plans to move them into indoor markets.
</P>
<P>
The city government plans to eliminate 73 open-air markets
along 255 main avenues by the end of this year in order to make
the capital "tider and traffic will move more freely", according
to a report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
All the stands lining Beijing's streets will be removed by the
end of 1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 3,000 square meters for each 10,000 residents will
be set aside for indoor free markets, where vegetables, fruits,
foodstuffs and other cheap commodities for daily use are
available. Each market site will cover at least 1,000 square
meters, the report quoted Tan Zhimin, an official in charge of
environmental sanitation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Free markets, mainly located in residential areas, have been
playing an important role in providing Chinese urbanities
convenience in daily shopping, apart from the state-owned
department stores, supermarkets and chain stores.
</P>
<P>
However, "some street markets have clogged roadways, choking
traffic and raising the noise level to an irritation point. Street
vendors who cook food are also accused of adding to the city's
pollution," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Of 847 phone calls and letters from city residents to Tan's
office complaining about environmental problems, 39.4 percent said
they were bothered by the street stands," it noted.

JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN and China have agreed to
speed up the establishment of the ASEAN-China Business Council to
exploit market potentials in the two regions with a total
population of 1.8 billion, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry for Chinese Committee Chris Walean said last night after
a meeting between the ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and Industry and
China's Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT),
that the agreement would open great business opportunities for
ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN-China Business Council could hopefully be

</P>
<P>
The ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand

</P>
<P>
Trade between the ASEAN and China reached 20 billion U.S.
dollars in 1995, 40 percent higher than 1994.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on trade relations between Indonesia and China, he
said opportunities were wide open for the two countries to
increase their trade volume.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, bilateral trade between China
and Indonesia reached 3.78 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Chinese investment in Indonesia reached nearly 200
million dollars. Compared with Malaysia and Thailand, the figure
was relatively small, he said.
</P>
<P>
The smaller amount of Chinese investment in Indonesia was due
to the fact that most Chinese investors still could not make
maximum use of the facilities provided by the Indonesian
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added it took months for Chinese investors to get their visa
from the Indonesian government.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalists
Spain joined South Korea on the road to next year's World Cup,
with a close 2-1 win over South Africa in the qualifying
tournament here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Juan Escarre scored the winning goal in the 68th
minute to help Spain maintain an unbeaten record after four
matches and lead Group A with am unbeatable maximum 12 points.
</P>
<P>
Spain's first goal came from Pablo Usoz from a penalty corner
rebound in the 12th minute, Shaun Cokke equalised through a direct
penalty corner hit in the 29th minute.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, who missed the last two World Cup finals, staged a
final 10-minute onslaught to defeat Belgium 3-1 in a Group B match
to advance their claim for a semi-final berth.
</P>
<P>
Alexandre De Chaffoy struck first for Belgium after just three
minuites but that was all his side could offer as the humid
conditions took their toll.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand forced Belgium to concede five penalty corners in
the second half, with John Radonovich equalising in the 63rd
minute and then going on to complete a hattrick with goals in the
67th and 69th minutes.
</P>
<P>
The win gave New Zealand 10 points and put them equal second
with Argentina in Group B behind South Korea on 11 points.
</P>
<P>
South Korea play Argentina on Tuesday and a win for the South
Americans would see them grab the top spot and relegate South
Korea to second place.
</P>
<P>
A loss would not hurt South Korea, however, but pave the way
for New Zealand as the top two teams from each group are
guaranteed a place in the finals in Utrecht, the Netherlands in
May next year.
</P>
<P>
A lose to South Korea would mean Argentina would have to
compete in the play-offs between the third and fourth-placed teams
of each group.
</P>
<P>
Belgium completed the preliminary round with seven points to be
in fourth position and head for the classification matches
starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Canada who had earlier lost to South Africa and Spain, threw
the second semi-final berth in Group A wide open with a 5-2 win
over Poland.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians are now equal third with Poland on six points,
one behind Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The second semi-finalist will be decided on Tuesday when
Malaysia takes on Spain, Canada play Switzerland and Poland are
against South Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of Group B, Ireland recorded their first win
Monday by beating Belarus 3-2. Belarus end the tournament with no
points.

<HEADLINE> Riders and Teams Fined for Positive EPO Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Three riders, who were found
positive in EPO test before the first stage of the Paris-Nice
cycling race, were fined on Monday.
</P>
<P>
EPO, or erythropoietin, a drug produced to treat kidney
disease, is used to increase oxygen-carrying red blood cell levels
which enhance endurance.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Erwan Mentheour and Italian pair Luca Colombo and
Mauro Santaromita all submitted blood samples which showed red
blood cell levels in excess of the 50 percent limit -- they were
fined 1,000 Swiss francs (480 U.S. dollars) while their teams were
fined 40,000 Swiss francs by the International Cycling Union
(UCI), the sports' governing body.
</P>
<P>
High red blood cell levels, which thicken the blood, can induce
heart attacks and an official statement from the race jury
announced that the trio had been "declared temporarily unfit to
take part in sport".
</P>
<P>
The three cyclists are the first victims of new UCI rules
allowing it to suspend cyclists for two weeks if they fail the
test.

PARIS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Tom Steels sprinted to win
the second stage of the Paris-Nice cycling race on Monday as
French favourite Laurent Jalabert retained the leader's white
jersey.
</P>
<P>
Steels overtook Frenchman Frederic Moncassin and Adriano Baffi
of Italy at the end of the 162.5 kilometers stage from Vendome to
Bourges.
</P>
<P>
Jalabert, who won Sunday's opening stage, finished seventh and
pocketed a four second bonus for winning an intermediary sprint to
remain on course for his third successive Paris-Nice title.
</P>
<P>
The stage boiled down to a final sprint, with 25-year-old
Steels emerging to claim his second success of the year after
winning a stage in the Tour of Majorca.
</P>
<P>
However, his victory was overshadowed by the earlier decision
to bar three cyclists from competing after they failed blood tests
designed to deter use of the drug EPO.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Erwan Mentheour and Italian pair Luca Colombo and
Mauro Santaromita all submitted blood samples which showed red

ROME, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian striker Giuseppe Signori
said 'no' to English football, insisting he will stay with Serie A
side Lazio until he retires in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Lazio skipper, making a brief visit to Milan, said: "I'll
retire in 2000, when I'll be 32, but I want to win the league
championship with Lazio first."
</P>
<P>
Signori has been Serie A's top goalscorer in three of the last
four seasons and was expected to join the exodus of Italian talent
to the English Premiership after being linked with Arsenal,
Chelsea and Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
But he revealed: "I've definitvely dropped the idea of playing
in England.
</P>
<P>
"Our president Sergio Cragnotti has assured me that Lazio will
win something over the next few years and I believe him, " he

WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A top official of the

<HEADLINE> European Shares End at New Records on Strong Dow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- All the three major stock markets
in Europe ended at record closing highs Monday, fueled by Wall
Street's sustained gains and domestic economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London closed 17.1 points stronger at
4,437.4, the fifth consecutive record closing high, after having
touched an all-time record of 4,440.8 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
A firm start to trading on Wall Street helped London to sustain
its advance in thin volumes during afternoon trade, but traders
said that there were some signs of pre-election jitters appearing.
</P>
<P>
The market also received a massive vote of confidence from Bank
of England governor Eddie George who predicted earlier today that
Britain will hit its 2.5 percent inflation target, suggesting to
dealers that the chance of an early rise in interest rates had
receded quite significantly.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, shares also closed at a new record high, lifted
by the Dow's Friday strong rally, a stable, though slightly lower,
dollar and firmer bonds prices, with the DAX-30 index 59.87 points
higher at 3,436.07.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, stocks finished just above the
2,700-level, up 0.93 points at 2,709.21, still a new record
closing for the fourth session running, supported also by the
Dow's strong surge last Friday.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 17.1
points higher at 4,437.4. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index ended up
59.87 points at 3,436.07. In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished 0.93
points stronger at 2,709.21.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Young people who refuse to work up to 20 hours a week on
community- based projects on work-for-the-dole schemes could lose
all their unemployment benefits under plans to go to federal
cabinet today.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The biggest cyclone to threaten Queensland for more than two
decades was lashing at least 1,000 kilometers of coastline last
night, threatening homes, sweeping away beaches and forcing the
closure of ports, the worst affected areas being between Mackay
and Gladstone and the Whitsunday Islands.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Unemployment is worsening significantly in parts of
Melbourne and regional Victoria, with jobless rates rising back
over 10 percent, federal government statistics show. The most
startling change has occurred north and northeast of the Yarra
where average unemployment jumped 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The Victorian government is examining a radical plan to
begin selling off most of its public transport system in its
current term of office. The blueprint recommends splitting Public
Transport Corp. into seven separate corporations and beginning
privatizing them as soon as possible. That would be the first big
privatization of a public transport system in Australia.

WELLINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Met Service
issued a warning today that cyclone Gavin will hit parts of North
Island Wednesday after playing havoc in Fuji at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Met Service said winds of up to 110 kmh will hit parts of
Northland, Auckland, Coromandel, Gisborne and some other areas.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that up to 200mm of rain will lash the ranges
and coastal hills around Gisborne and Hawke's Bay in east of the
island.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that a large high pressure system due to
cross South Island on the same day will stop Gavin from hitting
the entire country.
</P>
<P>
Hawk's Bay grape and process crop growers are hoping that
forecasts would go wrong because the cyclone will put millions of
dollars worth of crops and fruit at risk.
</P>
<P>
Tomato harvesting is only 20 percent completed, most grapes are
still on the vines and apple picking is right in full swing.

<HEADLINE> Burns: Chinese Naval Vessels Visit to U.S. Very Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman of U.S. Department
of State Nicholas Burns today described the visit of Chinese naval
vessels to U.S. ports as "both newsworthy and very important".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press briefing, Burns said the Chinese vessels
are destroyers and oilers, which are on a training course in the
Eastern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
This is "significant" because this is "the first port visit by
these types of ship ever to the continental United States since
the founding of the People's republic of China back in 1949," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The visit "reflects the fact that we've got engage with the
Chinese militarily as well as politically and economically," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very important step forward for the United States and
China, and it begins this week," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian's
visit to the United States last December, both sides "agreed that
we ought to reengage on a military-to-military relationship."
</P>
<P>
Burns pointed out particularly that the Chinese naval vessels
visit to the United States also demonstrates "the reemergence of a
U.S.-China military-to-military dialogue."
</P>
<P>
According to Burns, the three Chinese naval ships arrived in
Pearl Harbor on March 9, and are scheduled to leave on March 13.
They will visit San Diego at U.S. naval base in California from
March 21 to 25.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese naval training ship visited Pear Harbor in April
1989.

<HEADLINE> US Says Trial of Bosnian War Crimes Marks Step Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that the trial of Bosnian Muslims for war crimes allegedly
committed against Bosnian Serbs marks a significant step forward.
</P>
<P>
The International War Crimes Tribunal, which is based in the
Hague, the Netherlands, began today its first trial for war crimes
allegedly committed against Bosnian Muslims. Three of the
indictees are Bosnian Muslims and one is a Croatian.
</P>
<P>
"Their trail today marks a significant step forward for the War
Crimes Tribunal," U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And it says a lot about the impartiality of that tribunal," he
added. Bosnian Serbs have complained that the tribunal only deals
with crimes committed by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Burns urged Bosnian Serbs to give in those who are accused of
war crimes during the civil war to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the trial says a lot about the Bosnian
government's willingness to extradite to the Hague its own
citizens who are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"And it stands in stark contrast to the attitude and behavior
of the Bosnian Serbs, and...the Croatian government, which by and
large have failed to adhere to their Dayton commitments in turning
over indicted war criminals for prosecution at the Hague," Burns
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dayton accord signed Serbs, Muslims and
Croats, the parties should turn over the indicted war criminals to
the Hague for trial.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany has for the first time in
the postwar era ordered a U.S. diplomat to leave the country on
charge of economic espionage, the German weekly newsmagazine Der
Spiegel reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Der Spiegel's account, a CIA agent working under
diplomatic cover tried to recruit a senior official of Germany's
Economics Ministry in order to obtain classified information on
high technology projects.
</P>
<P>
The official who was approached reported the matter to
Germany's counterespionage agency, the Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution, which demanded that the diplomat
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
The news weekly said the U.S. diplomat, whom it did not
identify, had already left Germany. In order to avoid any
disruption in bilateral relations, the affair was handled by
intelligence agencies of both nations instead of through formal
diplomatic channels, Der Spiegel said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns reportedly
declined to comment on the issue Monday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls U.N. Resolution "Ill-advised" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
in his defense of a veto to a U.N. Security Council's resolution
condemning Israel's housing plan in Arab east Jerusalem, said on
Monday that any kind of such a resolution was "ill-advised" in
resolving thorny issues concerning the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the argument at a joint news conference at the White
House following his talks with visiting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who accused Israel of flagrant violation of its agreement
with the Palestinians on the final Status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters that he felt the resolution of the
Security Council was "ill-advised" because the United States does
not want the Security Council to impose any resolution on the
peace process, as the United States intended to be exclusive peace
broker in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We can never achieve peace through U.N. Security Council
resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Jerusalem issue is a disputed one, as the Arab
world see the building of a Jewish neighborhood in east Jerusalem
is "a settlement and therefor a violation," while the Israelis
believe that is "already part of their territory."
</P>
<P>
the area that the Israeli government is going to build 6,500
Jewish homes is called Abu Ghenaim or Har Homa, which was captured
by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war. Israel has henceforth
declared the entire city of Jerusalem as an undivided one and will
be its capital, even though the international community, including
the United States, have refused to recognized its claim.
</P>
<P>
Clinton admitted, however, the Israeli move to build a Jewish
neighborhood in east Jerusalem "would not build confidence, would
not be conducive to negotiations; would be seen by the
Palestinians and others as an attempt to precondition some of the
final status issues."
</P>
<P>
His remarks go with what he said was "build mistrust" between
the Israelis and Palestinians when he met Palestinians leader
Yasser Arafat last Monday, but contradicted U.S. veto in the U.N.
Security Council and his defense of the veto.
</P>
<P>
He shared with Mubarak with a view that Jerusalem should be
"part of the final status negotiations".
</P>
<P>
"Everything surrounding Jerusalem is of immense emotional,
political and religious significance to all the parties involved
here. That's why they wisely put it as a final status issue," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the Israel's housing plan has brought more
"difficulties and complications", which could only "make the
peace process a fragile and vulnerable one."
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Jerusalem is as sensitive to Moslems and to
Christians as it is to Jews. Hence, the rights and sentiments of
all these people should be fully respected..... We view such
actions (of building the Jewish homes in east Jerusalem) as
flagrant violations that would not serve any useful purpose," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who arrived in Washington on Saturday for three-day
visit, said earlier that it was a regret that the United States
should have vetoed the U.N. Security Council's resolution and it
would cost the United States credibility as a peace broker in the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
He urged Clinton to use his influence to pressure Israel to
reverse its decision of housing construction.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also called for the negotiations resumed on the Syrian
and Lebanese track so that there would be a complete peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said Syrian President Hafez Assad was "positively inclined"
to reopen the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations, which was
suspended a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"He reiterated serious commitment to a just and comprehensive
peace settlement on the basis of Madrid formula. He believes...
that the talks should be resumed from the point where the parties
had left off a year ago," he conveyed the message to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
As Mubarak and Clinton discussed the Middle East peace process
issues, Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers in the West
Bank with several Palestinians injured by troops who used clubs
and guns to beat back about 100 Arabs who tried to stop workers
from opening a road for Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
The clash was the first serious outbreak of Arab-Israeli
violence since Yasser Arafat spurned an Israeli decision to hand
over another nine percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
self-rule in the first stage of the Israeli pullout from the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Israel only intended to give up 30 percent of the
land in the West Bank rural areas in its three stages of pullout
while he demanded 90 percent of the land. He blamed on Monday that
Isreal's decision on pullout of its troops from the rural areas
had created a "real crisis."

<HEADLINE> US FTC Moves to Block Staples-Office Depot Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) voted today to block a merger of the two largest
U.S. office supply retailers in a bid to prevent them from
monopolying the market.
</P>
<P>
The FTC said that it would seek a court order to prevent
Staples Inc. from acquiring Office Depot Inc.
</P>
<P>
The two largest office supply retailers had announced last year
that they decided to merger into one firm which would have
approximately 1,000 superstores in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In raising its objections by a vote of 4-1 today, the FTC said
the acquisition of 4 billion dollars would allow the combined firm
to control prices for the sale of office supplies in various
cities throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, that in those communities where Staples faces
competition from Office Depot, prices are significantly lower than
where it does not," said William J. Baer, director of the FTC's
bureau of competition.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary court injunction would prevent the merger from
going forward while the FTC pursues its investigation.
</P>
<P>
At present, the two companies own a combined 1,124 stores in
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Todd Krasnow, Staples' executive vice president for marketing
said today that Staples will "vigorously contest" the FTC's
intervention. He said that the deal was pro-competitive and will
result in lower prices.

<P>
PARIS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- France is envisaging establishing a
mini-bridge of humanitarian aid for Rwandan refugees in Ubundu,
eastern Zaire, said the French State Secretary for Emergency
Humanitarian Action Xavier Emmanuelli today.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuelli, who has just paid a visit to Ubundu, said that the

to Kisangani on Thursday, after a first plane carrying 40 tons of
food and cover sheets arrived in Kisangani today.
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 to 30,000 Hutu refugees have fled their camp in
Ubundu after the rebels took the city from government troops.
</P>
<P>
Although the refugees are not suffering from severe
mal-nutrition now, their food will run out in three days, said
French officials.
</P>
<P>
French officials also described as "preoccupying" the
situation of about 3,500 refugees, including 150 children, who are
living in an abandoned hospital in Kisangani.

<HEADLINE> U.S. States Alleged Not to Protect Female Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Justice Department today
alleged that Arizona and Michigan fail to protect female inmates
from rapes and sexual assaults by prison guards and staff,
according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, in separate lawsuits filed in U.S.
District Court in Phoenix and Detroit, alleged that conditions in
state-run prisons violate the federal Civil Rights of
Institutionalized Persons Act of 1980.
</P>
<P>
At the Arizona Center for Women and at state prison facilities
in Alhambra, Perryville and Tucson, female inmates have been
subjected to sexual misconduct and unlawful invasion of privacy,
including prurient viewing during showering, toileting and
dressing, the department charged.
</P>
<P>
The department also said that female inmates at Michigan's
Scott and Crane correctional facilities have suffered the similar
sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The department said that it began to investigate the cases at
prison facilities in two state in 1994 and 1995, but the two
states did not provide cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They either refused to allow Justice investigators access to
its prisons and would not negotiate to resolve the allegations or
refused to allow Justice attorneys to interview prison staff
members and prisoners about the complaints, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Both lawsuits sought court orders requiring the states to
protect female inmates from rapes, sexual assaults and other
improper sexual contact by the staff; to ensure that inmates and
staff do not engage in sexual relations; and that women inmates
fare not viewed in a prurient manner when showering, changing
clothes and using toilets.

<HEADLINE> UN Report Says Croatia Failed to Protect Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. report on the human
rights situation in Croatia said on Monday that Zagreb had made
little progress in its treatment of minority Serbs since a similar
report was submitted three months ago.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was issued under the name of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, also said that Croatia, despite
public statements to the contrary, had failed to arrest suspected
war criminals indicted by the Hague-based tribunal on the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. tribunal has indicted some 74 suspects -- 53 Serbs, 18
Croats and three Moslems. But most remain at large.
</P>
<P>
Up to 200,000 Serbs fled when Zagreb's troops recaptured the
Serb-dominated Krajina region in two swift offensives in mid-1995.
Only a few Serbs remained in the area and about 14,000 have been
allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
"Croatian Serbs continue to live in conditions of serious
insecurity," the report said. "Incidents of looting and harassment
remain common. Croatian police authorities are ineffective in
restoring security"
</P>
<P>
"There remains strong grounds for concern that the government
is withholding its full cooperation," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Croatia refused to accept the U.N. allegation, saying that the
incidents against Serbs should be viewed as a natural crime rate
rather than human rights violations and that all Croatians were
paying the price of years of warfare.

<HEADLINE> Subdued Output Prices Ease UK Rate Rise Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's factory gate price
inflation remained subdued and at the lowest level for over a
decade in February, keeping pressures on an interest rate rise at
bay, official figures showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said today that
producer output prices were unchanged compared with January and
1.3 percent up year-on-year, the lowest level since August 1986.
</P>
<P>
Core output prices, which exclude food, drink, tobacco and
petrol products, rose 0.1 percent on January and 0.5 percent on
the year, the lowest annual gain since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, producer input prices, or the costs of raw
materials, fell 0.5 percent from January to February, giving an
annual fall of 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government welcomed the "outstanding" figures, saying the
data were proof that its economic policies were working and
Britain had an unclouded outlook for retail prices for the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the figures suggested that there were little
need for an interest rate rise as there were few inflationary
pressures in the economy at present.
</P>
<P>
Economists believed that lower oil prices and the strength of
sterling helped drag input prices down.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Africa Advances in Regional Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The East African Cooperation
(EAC) has made achievements in the identification of the priority
for cooperation in political, security, economic, social,
cultural, legal and judicial spheres.
</P>
<P>
In an interview issued today by the East African weekly, EAC
Executive Secretary Francis Muthaura said that "progress has been
impressive by any standards" over the past year in the area of
cooperation among Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The currencies of the three countries now become convertible
in the whole EAC region.
</P>
<P>
He said during the year, the EAC Secretariat, set up on March
14 1996, held no less than 30 sectoral meetings aimed at
harmonizing policies of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
On the easing of the movement of people and goods, the three
EAC members have agreed on a travel document which is expected to
be launched in April this year.
</P>
<P>
The movement of people and goods among the states are "much
easier today than before", although there is still a lot to be
done, said the EAC chief.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the three eastern African countries also have
signed a memorandum of understanding on the establishment of the
East African Securities Regulatory Authority.
</P>
<P>
Revenue Authorities of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda have regular
meetings to facilitate the development of convergence of fiscal
policies, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the energy sector, the EAC projects include the immediate
inter-connection of the national grids for turning them into a
single East African network and power supply to border towns from
the three countries' power administrations.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura added that the EAC Development Strategy (1997-2000),
a master plan for the integration of the eastern African region
in political, economic and social fields, is expected to be
launched in April this year.

<HEADLINE> Supporters for Liberia's Detained Faction Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of Liberia's former
faction leader Alhaji Kromah today shut shops and suspended
businesses in solidarity to protest the detainment of Kromah on
charge of illegal possession of weapons.
</P>
<P>
A TV report said tonight that Kromah's fellow Mandingoes,
including gas and petroleum dealers and commercial vehicle
operators, stopped their business in a bid to slow down the pace
of concerned moves in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The protest went ahead despite the warning from the Moslem
community that it could worsen the crisis stimulated by the
arrest of Alhaji Kromah, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A radio broadcast in Monrovia today urged all Mandingoes not
to treat the arrest of Kromah as a witch hunt against them.
</P>
<P>
Today's protest came after the West African peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG) reportedly raided the homes of close relatives of
Kromah in the eastern suburbs of Monrovia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A cousin of Alhaji Kromah, who is the chief of staff of the
armed forces of Liberia, said Kromah's ECOMOG bodyguards have
been withdrawn after the detainment of Kromah when three trucks
of arms were found in his home last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kromah has since been under house arrest, with telephone lines
cut off and activities into his home blocked by tanks.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, which oversees the Liberian peace process, has
announced it would treat any one caught with weapons as criminal
after the conclusion of voluntary disarmament for the former
rival factions at the end of January this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu said
Kromah would be handed over to the civil police for possible
prosecution after investigations are completed.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's Independent press today also called for the
prosecution of Kromah, who has resigned from the post of
vice-chairman of the ruling Council of State to run for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
However, General Moses Dar argued the arms discovery had been
recorded by ECOMOG before the deadline date but ECOMOG had not
turned up to pack the arms.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG's action was a "scheme to destroy Alhaji Kromah
politically, given the level of momentum in his effort to
organize a political party, transforming a military organization
into a major political organization," he charged.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Fund managers in Britain are
pessimistic about the prospects for stock markets in London and
New York despite the recent new records in share prices, according
to a survey of investment intentions for stockbrokers Merrill
Lynch today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which covered 67 institutions managing more than
900 billion pounds (1440 billion US dollars), shows that sellers
of British shares outweigh buyers by seven percent while for the
American market, the balance between sellers and buyers is 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
Most managers forecast a fall in London and New York shares
over the next three months, with British interest rates to be
higher in a year's time and companies earnings growth falling as
the main factors.
</P>
<P>
On average, companies earnings growth is expected to be 8.6
percent this year, instead of an expectation of 10 percent made in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The strength of sterling, which has gained around 16 percent on
a trade-weighted basis since last August, is said to have made
investors lower their forecasts.

<HEADLINE> Safety Fears over BA's New Long-haul Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- British Airways (BA) has withdrawn
its new multi-million pound superjets from long-haul routes to
America because of safety fears.
</P>
<P>
Three Boeing 777 model BA were switched to shorter-haul
European and Middle East destinations "as a precaution", according
to an announcement by BA released here today.
</P>
<P>
Until the problems are solved, engineers decided the
twin-engined jets should be used only on shorter routes so that
they would be closer to an airport if an emergency landing became
necessary, a BA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Problems have been found with the lubrication of the gear box
bearings of the three aircraft with General Electric engines.
</P>
<P>
A BA pilot said: "The problem is that the triple seven has only
two engines. I don't want to be stuck in the middle of the
Atlantic with only one."
</P>
<P>
The BA spokesman said: "The problem has been identified and
parts are being brought in from the States.
</P>
<P>
"To us, safety is paramount, so the three B model 777s were
withdrawn from the transatlantic flights as a precaution," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Aviation expert John Loader said that the airline deserved
credit for the decision. "It's a sensible and correct thing to do
but it will be commercially disastrous," he added.
