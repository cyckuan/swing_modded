	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Congregants of a Hollywood area temple  
arrived for weekend services to see a swastika and ``Jews die'' 
spray-painted on a wall, just days after a shooting spree at a 
Jewish community center in another part of the city. ``I believe 
it's a copycat thing,'' police Sgt. Sanford Rosenberg said of the 
graffiti discovered yesterday at Temple Knesset Israel. No arrests 
were made. The temple plans to hire a security guard for the holy 
days in September. Police said patrols in the area will be stepped 
up.

	Bush Cements Front-Runner Status  
</P>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's strong showing in  
the Iowa straw poll places him exactly where most expected: as the 
breakaway leader to take the GOP presidential nomination. Despite 
no Iowa straw poll winner ever going on to win the nomination, Bush 
says he's ``on the road to winning the nomination.'' Steve Forbes 
and Elizabeth Dole finished second and third in yesterday's 
nonbinding poll. Former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander is 
almost certain to drop out of the race following his weak showing, 
sources close to his campaign said.

	RYE BROOK, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton and Hillary Rodham  
Clinton toured a home today in this New York City suburb near the 
Connecticut line during a quick house-hunting trip. The Clintons, 
accompanied by daughter Chelsea and the first lady's mother, 
Dorothy Rodham, are expected to visit several Westchester County 
homes. The first had a low stone wall and a tree-shaded drive. 
Reporters were kept at a distance from the house. Mrs. Clinton, 
considering a run for the U.S. Senate, must move to New York by 
Election Day 2000 to be eligible.

	SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) -- One of seven workers injured in an explosion  
at a Georgia Power coal-burning plant died of burns early today. 
The victim, who wasn't identified, died between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., 
said Frankie Smith, a nursing supervisor at Grady Memorial 
Hospital. She said two other patients are in critical condition and 
two in satisfactory condition. The explosion happened yesterday at 
Plant McDonough, northwest of Atlanta, when a chemical that workers 
were using to clean equipment ignited with coal dust.

<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian warplanes and paratroopers  
attacked rebel targets today to try to dislodge Islamic militants 
holding villages in the Caucasus Mountains republic of Dagestan. 
Russia's offensive is concentrated just a few miles from Dagestan's 
rugged border with Chechnya, and the Interior Ministry said it 
bombed guerrilla points just inside Chechnya yesterday. Russian 
officials have threatened the standoff could ignite a wider war. 
The Russian Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, is seeking international 
support for Moscow's actions in Dagestan.

	Iraq Says U.S., Britain Blocking Aid  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The Iraqi government has accused the United  
States and Britain of preventing aid from reaching Iraq's children, 
who according to a new UNICEF report, are dying at an alarming 
rate. Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak told reporters 
yesterday that only 60 percent of medicines ordered by Iraq under a 
U.N. oil-for-food program have arrived in the country. The U.N. 
sanctions, imposed after Iraq's invaded Kuwait in 1990, prevent 
Iraq from selling oil outside the humanitarian program. Iraq has 
been accused of hoarding aid and diverting money to military needs.

	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson  
signed a tentative cooperation agreement to aid Nigeria's troubled 
oil industry and other energy sectors in return for substantial 
free market reforms, officials said today. Richardson signed the 
memorandum of understanding with Nigeria's Energy Minister 
yesterday in Nigeria's capital of Abuja. The document calls on 
Nigeria to begin privatizing state energy companies and remove 
investment barriers. In return, the United States will provide 
short-term aid to help alleviate oil, gas and electricity shortages 
in Nigeria.

	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Defending Formula One champion Mika  
Hakkinen led from start to finish in his McLaren-Mercedes to 
capture the Hungarian Grand Prix today and gain ground on his 
Ferrari challenger Eddie Irvine. Hakkinen ended Irvine's two-race 
winning streak and moved within two points of the Ferrari driver. 
Irvine slid off the track on lap 63 and lost second place to 
Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate David Coulthard. Irvine 
finished third.

<HEADLINE> Van Damme Wants To Remake Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After five marriages and confessions about  
cocaine use, Jean-Claude Van Damme wants to remake his image. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to reinvent the brand name, because I'm a brand name,''  
Van Damme says in Sunday's Daily News. ``Arnold (Schwarzenegger) 
knew how to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Damme is back in theaters with ``Universal Soldier: The  
Return,'' a sequel. He says he feels ``indestructible'' after 
remarrying Gladys Portugues, making her wife No. 3 and No. 5, and 
that the drug problem he went public about last year is ``Gone. Oh 
yeah, gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be successful no matter what because you cannot stop a  
guy who believes in himself,'' he said. ``If I don't make it in a 
movie, I can be the new guy on TV. I can do, like, a romantic James 
Bond, French-accented comedy, like `To Catch a Thief.' And people 
will say, `Hey, cool guy!'''

<HEADLINE> Armed Group Kills 29 in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- An armed group killed 29 people in  
southwestern Algeria and injured three others Sunday in the worst 
violence since the country's president took office in April, the 
Algerian security forces said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack took place near Beni Ounif in western Algeria, close  
to the border with Morocco, the security forces said. Hospital 
sources said the death toll could be as high as 40, but that figure 
could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	No details on the attack were immediately available, and no one  
claimed responsibility for the attack. Such massacres are usually 
blamed on the Armed Islamic Group, which appears to want to 
sabotage the peace efforts of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack comes at a time when Bouteflika is trying to persuade  
Algerians to accept a plan of national reconciliation that includes 
an amnesty for Islamic militants not convicted of murder, rape or 
planting bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign for the Sept. 16 referendum on national  
reconciliation opens this week, but the renewed violence could 
derail Bouteflika's peace plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouteflika is hoping for strong approval of his plan and has  
said he will resign if it doesn't pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Minister Abdelmalek Sella had warned earlier this month  
that Islamic groups would carry out attacks in an effort to derail 
Bouteflika's peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Security checks were set up Sunday on roads leading in and out  
of Algiers in an effort to prevent attacks in the Algerian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 100,000 people have been killed in the North  
African country since 1992, when an Islamic insurgency erupted 
after the military-backed government canceled elections the 
now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 people have died in attacks since Aug. 1. Several bombs  
have gone off in Algiers, which had been relatively calm in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Algeria experienced a period of unusual calm following  
Bouteflika's election, but a new wave of violence that erupted in 
midsummer shows little sign of abating. 
</P>
<P>
	False bombs alerts are on the rise, and some journalists have  
received anonymous death notices. No one has claimed responsibility 
for the attacks or threats.

<HEADLINE> Thais Try To Keep Oil Biz at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A campaign by Thai activists to keep a  
local oil company in local hands is gaining momentum, with more 
than 70,000 people joining a club aimed at keeping foreign 
ownership out. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle over privatizing state-controlled Bangchak Petroleum  
PLC poses one of the more concrete challenges to Prime Minister 
Chuan Leekpai's attempt to reshape the Thai economy and leave the 
two-year-old Asian crisis behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationalists who have accused Chuan and finance minister Tarrin  
Nimmanhaeminda of selling out the country by letting foreign 
investors buy Thai banks and companies at bargain prices, have 
drawn a line at Bangchak. 
</P>
<P>
	A group called the Bangchak Lovers' Club, supported by the  
political opposition and certain Thai business sectors, has formed 
to lobby Chuan and Tarrin to ensure that Thai investors get first 
chance at 32 percent of the company's shares when they are floated. 
</P>
<P>
	Narong Chokwattana, chairman of the club, was quoted Sunday in  
Thai newspapers as saying that 70,503 people had joined the club in 
two months since it was formed and about half have indicated they 
want to buy Bangchak shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Their aim is to block the government from selling a strategic  
chunk of Bangchak to foreign investors, which Tarrin in the past 
has said would lead to important technology transfers and make 
Bangchak more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The club hopes to gather 350,000 signatures on a petition in a  
self-styled grassroots referendum to show opposition to selling the 
stake to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not to pressure the government,'' Narong was quoted as  
saying Sunday. ``We believe that a good and clever politician 
should heed the demand of the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bangchak, which operates an oil-refining business and runs gas  
stations across Thailand, has become a politically hot issue at a 
time questions are being raised about whether the Chuan 
government's efforts at economic reform have reached their limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Chuan came to power in the depths of the economic crisis  
in November 1997, he has stuck to International Monetary Fund 
demands to reform the economy in exchange for a $17.2 billion 
bailout. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency has stabilized and, until the past few weeks, the  
stock market had rallied. But though some indicators like exports 
are heading up, the failure of the banking system to clear up 
massive dud loans on the books is seen as undermining the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The big privatizations expected under the IMF package,  
especially the strike-prone electricity authority, haven't come 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, the comparatively minor sale of Bangchak is becoming  
political ammunition against Chuan just at the time his opponents 
are starting to unofficially campaign for elections due next year.

<HEADLINE> CIA Probes Cuban Link to Drug Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department and the CIA are looking  
into a possible Cuban connection in the U.S. drug trade, with water 
and air space lightly patrolled by Fidel Castro's government 
offering a tempting route for Colombian cocaine and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Castro, who has been portraying himself as an effective  
warrior against drug trafficking, the latest concern mixes the 
message from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the Senate voted earlier this month to ease  
restrictions on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, anti-Castro 
Republicans scored a victory in their quest to focus a spotlight on 
use of Cuban waters by drug barons. 
</P>
<P>
	They convinced the Clinton administration to look into an  
abortive cocaine shipment intended to go through Cuban waters last 
December. There is no suggestion that the Cuban government itself 
had any involvement with the shipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has vowed to pursue the drug war vigorously. Three weeks  
ago, Castro even invited the United States to join him in an 
anti-drug campaign so the two countries could become ``one of the 
greatest alliances against drug trafficking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug  
Control Policy, acknowledges that traffickers have been making 
increased use of Cuban air space and territorial waters. But, he 
notes, Cuba maintains it does not have the resources to patrol 
these large areas, especially its territorial waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no conclusive evidence to indicate that Cuban  
leadership is currently involved in this criminal activity,'' 
McCaffrey says. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro's detractors object even to the limited U.S.-Cuban  
anti-drug cooperation now in place, saying the evidence suggests an 
official Cuban role in supporting drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said it is preposterous for the  
administration to give Castro credibility on the drug issue, 
contending the Cuban leader is notorious for helping drug 
traffickers. Similar objections were raised by Rep. Lincoln 
Diaz-Balart, who, like Ros-Lehtinen, is a Cuban-born South Florida 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional critics of the embargo are showing surprising  
strength of late. The Senate vote to ease restrictions on the sale 
of food and medicine represented a rare defeat for anti-Castro 
hardliners. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a victory for farm groups eager for an expansion of U.S.  
markets abroad. Two Democratic senators from farm states, Minority 
Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Byron Dorgan of North 
Dakota, led a U.S. delegations for talks over the weekend with the 
Castro government. 
</P>
<P>
	Impetus for the inquiry into a Cuban drug connection came with a  
House committee report on the seizure of a 7.5-ton cocaine shipment 
by Colombia's narcotics police. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, a senior Drug Enforcement  
Administration official told investigators that ``in all likelihood 
the Dec. 3 shipment of cocaine to Cuba was eventually meant to 
transit through Mexico and on to the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba says the shipment was earmarked for Spain. The State  
Department initially agreed but now is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in August, on the day after the Senate vote on easing  
the embargo, the State Department asked the CIA to ``conduct an 
all-source review of intelligence community and law enforcement 
community data to shed further light on the ultimate destination of 
this shipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A CIA finding that the shipment was intended to reach U.S.  
markets after passing through Cuban waters could lead to Cuba's 
placement on the so-called ``Major's List'' of drug trafficking 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro's opponents in Congress are pushing for the State  
Department to apply that designation to Cuba. That would subject 
Cuba, much like Colombia and Mexico, to a State Department 
evaluation of its anti-drug performance each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries found to have lax counterdrug programs can be subject  
to sanctions. Such a finding would have no impact on Cuba, which is 
already under comprehensive sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it would be a blow to Castro's efforts to build an  
anti-drug image. It also could be used as a weapon by his U.S. 
critics, many of whom suspect the Clinton administration is seeking 
cozier relations with the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign for Cuba's inclusion on the list is being led by  
the chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Rep. 
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and the chairman of the House Government 
Reform and Oversight Committee, Dan Burton, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Being on the list, which has 28 countries, does not imply that  
the government in question is working with traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all Andean countries plus Mexico are on the list. As  
of the most recent State Department evaluation, all were 
``certified'' as fully cooperating with U.S. counternarcotics 
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Inmate Growth Rate Slows Somewhat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declining crime rates are beginning to help  
stabilize the nation's prison population, but nearly 60,000 more 
inmates were added to federal and state prisons last year, the 
Justice Department reports. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Dec. 30, 1998, there were 1,178,978 state prisoners and  
123,041 federal inmates for a total of 1,302,019, the department's 
Bureau of Justice Statistics said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	That was up 59,866 or 4.8 percent from 1997 -- below the average  
annual increase of 63,144 or 6.7 percent since 1990 and the lowest 
rate of growth since the 2.3 percent boost in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting the 592,000 jail inmates as well, more than 1.8 million  
men and women were behind bars in the United States, the report 
said. That represented an incarceration rate of 627 inmates per 
100,000 U.S. residents, a rate higher than in any other country 
except Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Although crime rates have been declining since 1993, it has  
taken time for that trend to move through the court system and show 
up in prison populations. Meantime, sharp expansion of mandatory 
minimum sentences and longer sentences, especially for drug crimes 
during the 1980s and for violent crimes in the 1990s, coupled with 
less generous parole continued to drive prison populations up. 
</P>
<P>
	Tougher federal and state sentencing laws and parole rulings  
pushed the U.S. incarceration rate up from one of every 217 
residents in 1990 to one of every 149 in 1998, the bureau reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are beginning to be some signs of stability in the  
prison population,'' said statistician Allen J. Beck, co-author of 
the report. Only 4 percent of the state inmate growth from 1990 
through 1997, the latest available data, came from new court 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	``That small increase from new court commitments reflects a  
declining number of arrests for violent crimes, including murder, 
robbery, rape and assault,'' Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The increasing length of stay in prison is the biggest factor  
pushing prison populations up at this point,'' he added. The growth 
is largest among inmates serving three to five years behind bars, 
with a smaller increase among those serving 20 years or life. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is that the average time served increased from 22  
months in 1990 to 27 months in 1997, the report said. New prisoners 
expected to serve 38 months in 1990, but 43 months in 1997. 
Meantime, inmate release rates dropped from 37 percent in 1990 to 
31 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990-1997 period also saw a 39 percent increase in the  
number of parole violators returned to prison, although Beck said 
that is beginning to level off. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in returning parole violators was cited by The  
Sentencing Project, a private group that advocates alternatives to 
prison, as evidence of an unforeseen effect of tougher sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Current punitive sentencing policies have resulted in  
overcrowded prisons and budgets stretched to meet even the basic 
needs,'' the project said. ``Drug treatment, mental health care, 
education programs and vocational training are all in short supply 
within prisons ..., leaving prisoners largely unprepared for their 
return to the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings in the report:  
</P>
<P>
	--Four state prison populations dropped in 1998: Alaska, down 1.6  
percent; Hawaii, down 1.1 percent; Massachusetts, down 1.0 percent, 
and Maine, down 0.5 percent. The largest increases were in 
Mississippi, up 17 percent, and North Dakota, up 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Dec. 31, state prisons held 13 percent to 22 percent more  
inmates than they were designed to; the federal system was 27 
percent over capacity. California had the most crowded system, 
holding twice the number of inmates than was designed for. Utah was 
the least crowded at 81 percent of capacity.

<HEADLINE> Sisters Show Wind Energy Can Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHARDTON, N.D. (AP) -- A few hundred yards from the cross tower  
at the Sacred Heart Monastery, two other towers rise from the 
rugged ranchland toward the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
	Their purpose has nothing to do with religion, everything to do  
with economics. 
</P>
<P>
	For two years, the two 100-foot-tall wind turbines have been  
saving money and generating electricity for the monastery's 24 
Benedictine sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love to watch them,'' said Sister Barbara Ann Schwab. ``When  
I get up in the morning, the first thing I do is look to see if 
they're moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the turbine blades are moving, then the sisters need to buy  
less electricity from their utility in southwestern North Dakota. 
If the wind is really blowing, they can sell any excess power to a 
wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
	The monastery is one of the forerunners of what likely will be a  
boom in wind energy projects in North Dakota, say officials 
involved with the developing science. 
</P>
<P>
	``The costs have come way down with wind energy; it's much more  
competitive with fossil fuel resources,'' said Kim Christianson, 
energy programs manager for the state Division of Community 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters, who get no financial aid from the Roman Catholic  
Church, raise llamas on the prairie to help pay their bills. About 
3 1/2 years ago, they decided to try wind power to cut costs and be 
friendlier to the environment, said Prioress Sister Paula Larson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a leap of faith,'' Larson said. ``We thought, if it  
works in the rest of the world, why wouldn't it work here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first year of operation, the turbine generated 37 percent  
of the electricity the monastery used at a savings of $12,105. 
Second year production reached 44 percent at a savings of $15,836, 
Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project cost $120,000.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a branch of the U.S.  
Department of Energy, determined that North Dakota has the greatest 
wind resource of any of the lower 48 states, Christianson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the state trails others in wind energy development.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody that's involved in wind energy will tell you we're way  
behind,'' said Brad Stevens, a project engineer at the University 
of North Dakota's Energy and Environmental Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons, he said, are low utility rates in North Dakota and  
resistance to new forms of energy that might threaten the state's 
coal industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But support for ``green'' power could encourage wider  
development. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people are willing to pay a little extra on their utility  
bill to say their electricity is coming from a renewable resource, 
and a nonpolluting resource,'' Christianson said. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, the sisters say the project is a success.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are times, certainly, when the wind gets to be too much  
for you, it kind of gets on your nerves,'' Larson said. ``That 
happens here, too, but at least it's not worthless wind.''

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Hits Homer in Triple-A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry hit a home run Sunday,  
connecting for the first time in his comeback bid as the Triple-A 
Columbus Clippers beat Buffalo 14-9 in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Batting fourth as the designated hitter, Strawberry went  
1-for-5, including a towering home run in the 10th for the New York 
Yankees' International League affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've hit a lot of home runs in my career,'' Strawberry said.  
``But baseball is a difficult game. It's just not going to come 
that easy. You just have to be patient with yourself, patient with 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was suspended in April after his arrest on  
solicitation and drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Where and when -- not to mention if -- he'll play again for the  
Yankees isn't clear. His surgically repaired left knee must be 
healthy enough for him to play the outfield, and he has been 
struggling at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm on track,'' said Strawberry, batting .256 with five RBIs  
for Columbus. ``I swing the bat well sometimes and sometimes I 
don't. That's just the way baseball is. Baseball's a funny game; I 
just take what it gives me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who has 332 homers in his major league career, has  
claimed that this will be his final comeback. He hit 24 homers last 
year before being diagnosed with colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's coming along fine,'' Columbus manager Trey Hillman said.  
``He's moving better than expected. He felt a little normal 
stiffness but nothing specifically related to the knee, so that's 
very encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If success can be measured by clicks of the turnstiles,  
Strawberry still has it. Friday's series opener drew 17,360 fans to 
Dunn Tire Park, the biggest crowd since the slumping Bisons' season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's crowd was still slightly larger than the season  
average despite competition from the telecast of the Buffalo Bills' 
first NFL preseason game and a popular county fair. Sunday's crowd 
was a healthy 13,842.

<HEADLINE> Thai State-Owned Bank To Get Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's central bank has approved  
the injection of $3 billion (108 billion baht) into state-owned 
Krung Thai Bank, which is saddled with massive non-performing 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will swap debt for equity in the bank, Thailand's  
second largest commercial bank, and should keep it afloat in the 
short term, Finance Ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thai banking industry is swamped in non-performing loans  
estimated at nearly half of all lending in the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	The inability of banks to restructure or otherwise cope with  
such debts is seen as the biggest hurdle to Thailand emerging from 
the two-year-old Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Krung Thai and government authorities set up a new  
company to manage the bank's non-performing loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Better loan management and the new injection of funds will help  
Krung Thai for now, Wuthichai Pongprasit, Finance Ministry 
comptroller general, said Friday, but ``in the longer term, it 
depends on the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's rescue fund will carry out the conversion.  
The fund is already the largest creditor of two failed smaller 
banks whose assets were absorbed by Krung Thai under a government 
plan to restructure the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of March, non-performing loans of Krung Thai Bank  
stood at about $10 billion, or 58 percent of its outstanding 
credit.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Poll a Momentum Boost for Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A late and reluctant entry in Iowa's  
straw poll, George W. Bush trounced the Republican presidential 
field in an impressive display of organizational strength that will 
serve him deep into the primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	The twice-elected Texas governor, already established as the  
leading money-raiser and the favorite in polls, proved his 
political team can convert his celebrity into actual votes. 
</P>
<P>
	On a sunny Saturday afternoon, 7,418 Iowans boarded buses to  
central Iowa to stand in long lines and cast their nonbinding 
ballots for the son of former President George Bush. He got nearly 
one-third of the vote in a field of nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anybody in positions two through 12 who doesn't  
view George Bush as the front-runner,'' said GOP Gov. John Engler 
of Michigan, who campaigned for Bush in Iowa. ``They're all 
shooting at him, so he has to take on the field and ... he did it 
successfully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made his first campaign trip to this initial caucus state  
just two months ago, surprising aides by predicting a big victory 
in the straw poll. Republican leaders in Iowa, including Rep. Greg 
Ganske, had advised Bush to skip the contest -- or at least lower 
expectations -- to avoid an embarrassing defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	But in meetings before that initial June trip, Bush heard from  
leaders of his Iowa team who said he could win -- and big. They said 
the contest would limber up his organization. They also warned that 
bypassing the poll might cause some Iowa supporters to question his 
resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	So Bush jumped into the straw poll contest with two goals: build  
a tidal wave of momentum and winnow the GOP field. 
</P>
<P>
	The early results were promising.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, in direct competition  
with Bush for moderate voters, finished sixth and is expected to 
suspend his campaign this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not interested in spending the next six months running  
down George Bush and arguing with the media to take me seriously,'' 
Alexander said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle, vice president under Bush's father, finished eighth  
-- behind three other social conservatives, including commentator 
Alan Keyes. Quayle pledged Sunday to stay in the race, but it is 
hard to imagine that Quayle could threaten Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Basking in triumph, Bush said of the field: ``I think  
everybody's going to have to reassess their positions and find out 
whether or not they can stay competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his rivals fared well.  
</P>
<P>
	Millionaire conservative Steve Forbes drew almost 5,000 voters  
to Ames, Iowa, finishing second to bolster his argument he is the 
only person with the resources to beat Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking third was Elizabeth Dole, former president of the  
American Red Cross -- a finish high enough to claim she is expanding 
the GOP base for young and professional women. The showing keeps 
Dole in the race long enough to make a run at Bush if he falters; 
it also adds to a resume that could land her the No. 2 spot on the 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're off to New Hampshire, ladies and gentlemen,'' a bouyant  
Dole told volunteers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington activist Gary Bauer's fourth-place showing was the  
best performance among social conservatives. ``I am the one true 
conservative candidate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's political team will not waste a minute to build on their  
momentum. Top strategist Karl Rove flew to South Dakota on Sunday 
to begin organizing for the state's April primary. The rest of 
Bush's crew returned to Austin, Texas, where the fund-raising 
operation already was fielding calls from contributors ready to 
board the Bush bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Having shown they can build a grass-roots operation in Iowa,  
Bush supporters are continuing their work elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was truly a remarkable weekend,'' said Gov. Marc Racicot of  
Montana, who campaigned for Bush. ``Several thousand people came 
from miles around this wonderful state to have a voice in the 
democratic process. And, you know, their voices were heard.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Soccer Player Tells of Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A former Iraqi soccer star says he and other  
players were tortured when they played badly, by order of President 
Saddam Hussein's son, The Sunday Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The claims by former Olympic competitor Sharar Haydar Mohamad al  
Hadithi support repeated allegations by Iraqi dissidents that 
Hussein's son, Odai, ordered players to be imprisoned and tortured 
and to have their hair and mustaches shaved off after losing 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, FIFA, the game's international governing body,  
investigated reports that Odai had the Iraqi team whipped with 
canes after it was eliminated from the World Cup qualifying 
competition. FIFA cleared Iraq's football federation of the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Odai, 35, runs the Iraqi football federation and the country's  
Olympic committee, in addition to owning Iraq's most influential 
newspaper as well as radio and television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also head of the paramilitary Saddam Fedayeen commando  
units. Odai killed his father's bodyguard during a 1988 banquet for 
Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak's wife, after a fight. And in 1996 
he was seriously injured in an assassination attempt by Saddam's 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Times article was based on interviews with al Hadithi  
and Abbas Janabi, Odai's former private secretary and press 
spokesman for 15 years, both of whom have left Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that after Iraq lost an exhibition match against Jordan  
in 1993, al Hadithi was taken to Al Radwaniya prison with three 
other players and mistreated for three days before being released. 
</P>
<P>
	When al Hadithi tried to resign in 1994, the article said, he  
again was taken to the prison, 30 miles from Baghdad, and was 
repeatedly hit on the soles of his feet, dragged on his bare back 
through a gravel pit, then forced to jump into a tank of sewage so 
the wounds would become infected. 
</P>
<P>
	After his release, he was banned from soccer for life and told  
that he might be killed if he was seen so much as kicking a ball in 
the street, the newspaper said. Al Hadithi now lives in hiding 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Janabi corroborated the allegations of torture and said he and  
more than 20 officials from the Iraqi Olympic committee witnessed 
the team being forced to kick a concrete ball around a field at the 
prison after they failed in a World Cup qualilfying round in Qatar 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Odai believed aggressiveness against sportsmen made them try  
harder, Janabi told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought they would be so frightened by the punishments that  
they would be encouraged to give a better performance,'' Janabi was 
quoted as saying. But ``he became senseless and cruel until he 
arrived at a stage when he sent players to prison, not only 
incarcerating them but putting them through a course of torture 
which was almost unbearable.''

<HEADLINE> AirTran, Southwest Raise Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Two low-cost carriers raised their fares over the  
weekend with some tickets out of Atlanta going up by as much as 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTran Airlines raised its prices as much as $40 per roundtrip  
on some walk-up and first-class fares. Most seven- to 
14-day-advance-purchase tickets increased about $10 per roundtrip, 
while airfares requiring a three-day advance purchase increased by 
up to $20 per roundtrip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some markets have seen an increase of 10 percent, while others  
are averaging around 5 percent,'' Tom Parsons, editor of 
Bestfares.com, said Sunday. Parsons tracks airline fares and acts 
as a travel agent through his Internet company. 
</P>
<P>
	Most major airlines quickly matched the increase on routes where  
they compete with AirTran, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Southwest Airlines also slightly raised air fares.  
Many routes increased by $1 each way and others increased by $3 
each way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news for the traveling public is that when Southwest  
has a fare increase, it is a minor irritation,'' Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest spokeswoman Linda Rutherford said the fare increase  
will not be on every flight, but price hikes will be for both 
advance purchase and walk-up fares. Southwest, the nation's 
fourth-largest carrier in terms of customer boardings, serves more 
than 50 cities in 28 states and is expanding its service into the 
eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message left with AirTran in Orlando, Fla., was not  
immediately returned. AirTran, formerly known as ValuJet, flies to 
31 cities in the eastern and midwestern United States, including 
Chicago, Houston, Newark, N.J., and Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Accused Doctor Said Ran Drug Mill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- Dr. Frank Fisher's supporters consider  
him a pioneer in the field of pain management. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard-educated physician says he prescribed heavy doses of  
painkillers to ease the suffering of his chronically ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors say Fisher did nothing more than run a drug  
mill, overprescribing medications that caused the deaths of five 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``His practice was a sham,'' says Deputy Attorney General  
Anthony Lewis. ``He wasn't providing medical care. He was providing 
drugs to the community, to people who wanted to abuse narcotics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher and the co-owners of a pharmacy that filled the  
prescriptions, Stephen and Madeline Miller, were charged with five 
counts of murder -- charges that Fisher says reflect a terrible 
misunderstanding of his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm being punished for behaving with good  
conscience and doing the right thing,'' he told The Sacramento Bee. 
``I don't think the attorney general's office understands the issue 
of chronic pain or how you treat it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Shasta County judge ruled last month that there wasn't enough  
evidence to try the three for murder and reduced charges against 
Fisher, 45, to involuntary manslaughter in three of the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Miller, 49, now faces two counts of involuntary  
manslaughter. Murder charges were dismissed against his wife, 
Madeline, 45. 
</P>
<P>
	The three still face 19 counts of fraud for billing Medi-Cal $2  
million last year. They have pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher billed Medi-Cal, a government-funded health-care program,  
for treating patients with no legitimate medical need, then steered 
them to the pharmacy with costly prescriptions for hundreds of 
morphine-like pills, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis says prosecutors ``are not attacking the pain-management  
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor had seen -- at least once -- up to 3,000 patients from  
Redding and surrounding communities in northern California, and 
probably no more than about 200 were being treated for chronic 
pain, Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher's supporters say the case is misguided. They have  
started a newsletter on his behalf and printed T-shirts to show 
their support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think these people who are prosecuting (Fisher) have never  
even had a headache,'' says former patient Barbara Hackett, who has 
lupus, an inflammatory disease that can affect the skin, joints, 
kidneys and nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had a family member with the kind of pain that every  
one of us puts up with every day, then this wouldn't be 
happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no consensus in the medical community on the best way  
to relieve chronic pain. While debate continues, doctors risk 
discipline from medical licensing boards for prescribing powerful 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, the Intractable Pain Act of 1990 lets physicians  
prescribe any level of medication they think is needed so long as 
an increase in dosages is gradual, among other precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mitchell Max, director of the pain research clinic at the  
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., is testing 
potential alternatives to the powerful opiates like oxycodone that 
Fisher prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
	``But nothing we've come up with is a good as opiates,'' Max  
says. ``Every physician has patients who do well on them. But they 
also have patients who take them like candy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Fisher's patients who died was 19-year-old Bruce Johannsen  
Jr. He choked on vomit ``due to oxycodone intoxication'' on July 1, 
1998, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	Johannsen's father, Bruce Sr., blames Fisher. ``He flooded this  
town with pills and my son got some of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Fisher faces up to 16 years in prison; Stephen  
Miller, 14 years; and Madeline Miller, eight. They could be fined 
$4 million each. The three are barred from their jobs pending the 
case's outcome. No trial date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's supporters include Robert Stevens, whose wife, Tamara,  
38, was among those Fisher was originally accused of murdering. 
After other doctors gave her 18 months to live, she survived almost 
four years under Fisher's care, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're prosecuting him for something he didn't do,'' Stevens  
said. ``He provided a service to this community.''

<HEADLINE> Fans Flock to Prince 'Garage Sale' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANHASSEN, Minn. (AP) -- The souvenirs went for a song at a  
garage sale held by the rock star formerly known as Prince. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 fans flocked to his Paisley Park Studios in  
suburban Minneapolis on Saturday to snap up his leftovers, 
including CDs, tapes, T-shirts, posters and props. 
</P>
<P>
	But the musician was nowhere to be seen, disappointing Kii Arens  
of St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping to come and see Prince sitting on a lawn chair,  
marking down prices,'' said Arens, who settled for some video 
props. 
</P>
<P>
	Arens, a member of the local band Flipp, and his friend Dave  
Wolf, of the local Vibro Champs, spent $300 altogether. They bought 
some neon tubes, guitar strings and electric arrows that were used 
in the ``Sign o' the Times'' video. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a really sweet barber chair for 50 bucks,'' Wolf said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was only one cashier, so buyers had to stand in line for  
up to two hours to pay for their purchases Saturday. The sale 
continued Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Encore Performance at Woodstock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHEL, N.Y. (AP) -- The singers sported gray hair this time, and  
some who came to hear them brought cell phones and strollers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 12,000 who gathered Sunday at Max Yasgur's old farm for  
the ``Day in the Garden'' concert were nonetheless after the same 
feeling that the three-day Woodstock festival produced there 30 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted my kids to experience some of the music and  
camaraderie,'' said Lee Augustine, 53, who came with his wife and 
three young ones. ``You can repeat some of it. You can bring back 
the music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Havens roused the crowd with his old Woodstock number  
``Freedom,'' and Melanie performed Jimi Hendrix's ``Purple Haze.'' 
Country Joe McDonald performed his signature anti-Vietnam War song 
``Fish Cheer.'' The show lasted well into the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Some who came Sunday to the grassy hill about 80 miles north of  
New York City were looking to rekindle a bit of the spirit they 
felt was sullied by rioting crowds at the much larger Woodstock '99 
concert in Rome, N.Y. last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The word `Woodstock' is out, you can't use that word,'' said  
Joe Turner, 43, lounging in a lawn chair and wearing a psychedelic 
shirt. ``It's been blasphemed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Castrovinci, 49, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is what it's all about, not like that synthetic, false  
Woodstock,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From the stage, Melanie reminisced about the ``three days of  
peace and music'' that she experienced 30 years ago. By comparison, 
Sunday's lineup looked like ``old timers' day,'' she joked. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't a trip down memory lane for everyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember much about the first time I was here,'' Arlo  
Guthrie told the crowd. ``I had to wait for the movie to come 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only one. A woman who identified herself only as  
``Ruth from Brooklyn'' vowed to buy ``food instead of drugs'' this 
time around. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Sunday's attendance fell far short of the roughly  
400,000 who flocked to the first Woodstock.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Addresses 40,000 in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dalai Lama came to the heart of New York  
City with a message for its conscience. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking for nearly two hours to a Central Park crowd of more  
than 40,000 on Sunday, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader chided 
the nation's largest city for allowing a gulf between rich and poor 
that helps fan ``a lot of trouble, a lot of fear, killings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The huge gap is very unfortunate,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The lecture capped a four-day visit to New York, and marked the  
Dalai Lama's second appearance in the park since 1991. That event, 
a ``meditation'' held two years after his winning of the Nobel 
Peace Prize, was attended by 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The applause that followed the Dalai Lama's remarks on the  
city's ills broke a reverential silence that spanned most of his 
address, which dwelled on themes of peace and tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life, when I look back, has not been easy,'' the  
64-year-old said. ``But one thing I learned -- the compassion, the 
sense of caring about others' welfare -- brings to me inner 
strength. It has defined the purpose of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said every person has ``the same potential for inner  
tranquility,'' but ``negative forces'' such as ``fear, suspicion, 
selfishness and self-hatred, can destroy inner peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born as the 14th heir to Tibet's 600-year-old religious dynasty,  
the Dalai Lama was driven into exile in 1959 at age 24 following a 
failed uprising against Chinese troops that had taken over the 
Himalayan nation nine years earlier. He has lived for most of the 
past 40 years in India, the head of a Tibetan government in exile. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Vreeland, director of New York's Tibet Center, said  
Sunday's crowd was ``about what we expected.'' The Dalai Lama, he 
said, ``is not proselytizing, he is imploring people to become 
better people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators said the message was an enunciation of principles  
that the human race would do well to embrace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It codifies what I've always believed,'' said Adam Rosen, 28,  
an art and sculpture student. ``It shows that people are 
spiritually starved. I hope some will hear this message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Richard Gere, a friend and disciple of the Dalai Lama,  
introduced him as a man whose words transcend religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeatedly stressing the idea of a single human race, the Dalai  
Lama noted that when seen from outer space, ``our beautiful blue 
planet'' has no national boundaries, and drew applause again in 
declaring that ``the concept of war is now irrelevant, the concept 
of violence is out of date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said Sunday's crowd was  
second in size only to Pope John Paul II's for a non-entertainment 
event, but could not put a figure on the latter. Some concerts have 
drawn upwards of 200,000 spectators.

<HEADLINE> Plant Worker Dies of Blast Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) -- One of seven workers injured in an explosion  
at a Georgia Power coal-burning plant died of burns early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, who wasn't identified, died between 4 a.m. and 5  
a.m., said Frankie Smith, a nursing supervisor at Grady Memorial 
Hospital. She said two other patients were in critical condition 
and two in satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
	One worker was treated at the scene and released and another was  
treated at Grady and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion happened about 1 p.m. Saturday at Plant McDonough,  
northwest of Atlanta, when a chemical that workers were using to 
clean equipment ignited with coal dust, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently what they were cleaning with flashed and it ignited  
some coal dust and exploded,'' Cobb County Fire Department 
spokesman Stephen Mize said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of damage to the plant was not immediately clear.

<HEADLINE> Industry Workers Rally in Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thousands of film industry workers rallied in  
Hollywood to support state legislation aimed at preventing the 
flight of film productions to other countries, most notably Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Pounding drums and hoisting American flags, the protesters  
marched on Sunday down a closed-off stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, 
then listened to speeches by actor Edward James Olmos and other 
industry workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am saying, bring Hollywood home,'' Olmos said. ``How do we  
do that? We get the best minds we have to tell our politicians that 
our workers be included. Don't leave the United States of 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the state Assembly, two bills have been passed that would  
provide tax credits for certain productions using California labor. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a recent study commissioned by the Screen Actors  
Guild and the Directors Guild of America, 285 of 1,075 
U.S.-developed film and TV productions last year were so-called 
``runaway productions'' for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Many filmmakers take their projects to other countries to save  
money. In Canada, it can be 25 percent cheaper to make a film. That 
country captured 81 percent of those ``runaway'' productions last 
year, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, ``runaway'' production has doubled since 1990, the study  
said.

<HEADLINE> Life Close to Land Is Spiritual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANNING, Mich. (AP) -- A breeze rustles the swamp grass as Mike  
Nowak lifts a trap from the gurgling stream and removes a beaver 
nabbed during the night. With a practiced flick of the wrists, he 
swings the sodden carcass over his shoulder into a woven basket 
strapped to his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Animals are very special to me,'' the burly trapper says.  
``All my meat has come strictly off the land, so I respect the 
animals. They give up their life for you, to feed and clothe you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One might consider Nowak a throwback to the 17th century  
coureurs de bois, those French hunters and trappers among the first 
Europeans to explore the upper Great Lakes region. They got along 
well with native Indians, respecting their customs and 
spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the 52-year-old outdoorsman also represents a very modern  
cultural phenomenon: Americans who turn away from the high-tech, 
urban fast track for the less materialistic ways of the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowak doesn't completely reject modernity or capitalism. He  
drives a battered Jeep and adores tinkering with Harley-Davidsons. 
He's a small-businessman, making and selling products made of 
animal furs and horns. 
</P>
<P>
	He earns a little extra money doing construction work in the  
summer, when hunting is out of season and animal furs aren't prime 
for trapping. ``But when Oct. 1 comes, I kind of roll that clock 
back 100 years and try to live that way,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a cramped trailer with a wood stove on a 40-acre farm in  
northern Dickinson County. It's next to the house where he grew up, 
and where his 88-year-old father still lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowak takes pride in growing, gathering, catching, trapping or  
shooting nearly all of his food. ``My grocery bill seldom goes over 
$15 a week,'' he says. ``All I buy is bread and milk and cooking 
spices. Could make my bread but don't want to take the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan's Upper Peninsula is ideally suited for living off the  
land. Although dotted with towns, most are small; the largest city, 
Marquette, has only about 21,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 85 percent of the peninsula is forested. Wildlife is  
abundant, and there's always a river or lake nearby full of fish. 
Despite a short growing season, farmers raise corn, hay, potatoes 
and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers say the U.P.'s back-to-nature enthusiasts tend to be  
either traditional hunter-trappers such as Nowak or people of a 
more liberal bent who might embrace vegetarianism or environmental 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of motivation, this rural life is not for the  
fainthearted. Winters can be brutal. Self-reliance and ``sisu,'' a 
Finnish expression for gutsy perseverance, are the watchwords for 
yoopers who tough it out. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem for Nowak, who looks the part with his weathered  
visage and deep-set blue eyes. He rises before sunup and walks 
several miles a day, regardless of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	His pantry is stocked with canned vegetables from the garden,  
his freezer packed with meat. His taste for wild game ranges from 
beaver to bobcat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Woodchuck, too,'' he says. ``They say it's a rodent, but I  
tell you it's the best-tasting rodent you'll ever eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today for lunch he pan-fries bluegill, served with home-grown  
potatoes and green beans and homemade applesauce and pickles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked a doctor one time why there's so much cancer, and he  
said the air we breathe and the food we eat,'' he says. ``Can't do 
much about the air, but you sure can control what goes into your 
body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nowak was hunting and fishing with his father before he started  
first grade. But when he graduated from high school in 1964, city 
lights beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent much of the next 15 years as a bricklayer in Reno,  
Nev., before returning to the Upper Peninsula for good. ``Best move 
I ever made,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite by accident, he became an entrepreneur in the mid-1980s  
after making himself mittens from coyote fur and a coat and hat 
from beaver pelts. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends began placing orders, and soon he was turning out hardy  
woodsman's garments with furs from otters, foxes and other 
critters. Demand grew, especially after he was featured in a couple 
of outdoor publications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting so busy I couldn't get out in the woods any  
more, so I hired a woman to do the sewing,'' Nowak says. ``Now it's 
gotten so big that I have to buy fur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also hit on the idea of using thin strips of beaver hair as  
bowstring silencers -- devices that eliminate the twang that can 
startle a deer in the second between when an arrow is shot and when 
it strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another product line: jewelry and knife handles made with deer,  
elk and moose horns, in keeping with Nowak's belief that no part of 
an animal should go to waste. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowak uses a distributor to get his bowstring silencers into  
sporting goods stores across the country. He sells his other 
products via mail-order. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he has no interest in being so successful that he  
loses touch with the simple life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes my income's just $5,000 or $6,000 a year, but it's  
like $50,000 or $60,000 to somebody else because I don't have too 
many expenses. I can live like a king off that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Checking his traps, he pauses to pick wild cranberries and watch  
honking Canada geese soar over a nearby lake. Cedar and birch 
stumps gnawed by beavers litter the boggy landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I haven't had a drink in 24 years,'' he says. ``I  
speak to school classes sometimes, and I tell them nature's the 
best high there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sets another trap in a narrow, two-foot-deep channel flowing  
into the lake, concealing it with swamp grass, hammering stakes on 
both sides to keep swimming beaver from bypassing it. Finishing the 
job, he grins contentedly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great life, buddy. The only bad thing is I'm probably  
halfway through it. Where does the time go?''

<HEADLINE> Zeier's Family OK After Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The family of Tampa Bay Buccaneers  
quarterback Eric Zeier escaped serious injury when their small 
plane crashed a few hours before he played in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeier's parents and sister were flying to see Saturday night's  
game against Cleveland when the Cessna 172 piloted by his father, 
Rick, lost power and came down near Chiefland, about 100 miles 
north of Tampa and 25 miles southwest of Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs learned of the accident about 25 minutes before  
kickoff, but didn't tell Zeier until after the game because the 
club had been assured there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the game ended, I found him,'' said Reggie Roberts,  
the team's director of communications. ``The first thing I said to 
him was: `Everybody's fine. Your parents had to make an emergency 
landing.' He was visibly upset and immediately got on the phone and 
talked to his dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Zeier, 48, has had his pilot's license for about a month  
and was making the trip with his wife Sharon, 49; daughter, Ellen, 
21; and James Strickland, 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The family planned to land at Vandenburg Airport outside Tampa  
and proceed to Raymond James Stadium for the game, Levy County 
Sheriff's Maj. Bobby McCallum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some unknown reason, (the plane) lost power,'' McCallum  
said. ``I think he went through all his emergency checks and so 
forth and decided to try and land it on County Road 347.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the plane headed down, McCallum said, Zeier did not see a  
power line. A part of the plane's rear clipped the line, sending 
the plane tumbling to the ground before coming to rest upside-down. 
</P>
<P>
	``All four of them were shook up and had minor injuries, but  
none of them required hospitalization,'' McCallum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeier played at the University of Georgia and was drafted by the  
old Cleveland Browns in 1995. He moved with the club to Baltimore 
the following season and was traded this spring from the Ravens to 
Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year pro, who completed 11 of 16 passes for 135 yards  
Saturday night, spoke with his family again by telephone Sunday 
before they left Chiefland to drive back to their Atlanta-area 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tony Dungy said he wasn't told about the accident until  
after the game. He gave the backup quarterback permission to take 
as much time off as he needed to help the family. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs didn't practice Sunday, but were to resume their  
regular training camp schedule on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time it got to me, Eric was fine and had spoken to his  
parents. We've kind of left it to him to use his judgment about 
what he needs to do,'' Dungy said.

<HEADLINE> Gun Show Held at Colorado School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCOS, Colo. (AP) -- The scheduled return of students to  
Columbine High School today did nothing to lower attendance at a 
gun show held over the weekend at a Colorado high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Mancos Valley Lions Club Gun and Knife Show said  
negative publicity undoubtedly boosted attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure we hurt with the people (at Columbine), but we're a long  
way from there,'' said Bill Nittler, chairman of the event. Mancos 
is a town of about 1,000 residents in far southwestern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months after the massacre at Columbine outside Denver,  
which left 15 people dead, including the two teen-age gunmen, 
hundreds turned out for the two-day show held in the cafeteria of 
Mancos High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Admission was $3 and brought in an estimated $2,000 for the  
Lions Club, which will use the money to help people in need, 
Nittler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendees questioned by reporters saw little or no connection  
between Columbine and their annual gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would sit in history class looking out the window and count  
a hundred guns in pickup trucks in the parking lot. Nobody shot 
anybody,'' 36-year-old gun exhibitor Bruce Dominey said, recalling 
his days at Mancos High School. ``Guns aren't the problem. They've 
got it all backwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before allowing the show, local school board members took notice  
of complaints by a teacher in nearby Durango who said it was 
inappropriate to hold a gun show in the wake of the Columbine 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one raised a protest at a subsequent board meeting to  
reconsider the show's location. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Ward, 35, the father of four daughters, said he had no  
qualms about having his girls at the show. Asked what his children 
know about guns, he replied, ``They know not to touch them.''

	Europeans, Iranian Kidnapped in Iran  
</P>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Four Europeans and an Iranian  
were kidnapped in central Iran, the Iranian news agency reports 
today, and a Spanish official says the incident may be related to 
drug trafficking. The four tourists -- three Spaniards and an 
Italian -- and the Iranian were seized last night from a hotel in 
the town of Kerman, 550 miles southeast of Tehran, the Islamic 
Republic News Agency said. Kerman's head of security, Abbas 
Doagooie, told the agency that the kidnappers were being pursued by 
security forces and all exits and entries to the province were 
being monitored. Neither the identity, nor the motive of the 
kidnappers was known, the agency said. The report gave no other 
details.

	KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Rwandan and Ugandan troops sharing  
control of the divided northern Congolese city of Kisangani 
exchanged fire for the first time, their commanders said today. The 
clash brought tensions between the two allies in the yearlong 
rebellion to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila to a boiling 
point, as a rebel leadership dispute in which they've taken 
opposing sides now threatens to engulf them as well. Rwandan 
commanders said Ugandan soldiers at Kisangani's main airport, 15 
miles east of the city, opened fire late last night on Rwandan 
positions at the airfield in an attempt to dislodge them. But 
Rwandan troops returned fire, wounding several Ugandan soldiers.

	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- As expected, Texas Governor George W. Bush  
easily won in the Iowa straw poll yesterday, receiving nearly one 
third of the vote. Bush said he's ``on the road to winning the 
nomination.'' Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole finished second and 
third in the nonbinding poll. Weak showings by former Vice 
President Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander staggered their campaigns. 
Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, is almost certain to drop 
out of the race, sources close to his campaign said. Quayle faces 
deep troubles as well.

	Clashes Erupt in Northern Ireland  
</P>
<P>
	LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Catholic militants fought  
with police, torched trucks and tossed fire bombs Saturday, 
protesting hard-line Protestant parades across Northern Ireland. 
Scuffles left dozens of officers and demonstrators injured in 
Belfast before culminating in protests in Londonderry, where 
Protestants celebrated the northern city's 1689 defense from a 
besieging Catholic army. Groups traditionally start marching in 
other towns before gathering here for the main parade. Suspected 
Irish Republican Army members hijacked and burned four trucks and 
vans on the city's Catholic west side in Londonderry, while more 
than 10,000 Protestant members of the Apprentice Boys fraternal 
group paraded through the city center nearby.

	Russian Forces Battle Militants  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces fought Islamic  
militants in scattered skirmishes in Dagestan Saturday, suffering 
at least four deaths as officials admitted that the rebels remained 
in control of seven villages. The fighting was concentrated in the 
Caucasus region of Dagestan, a mountainous Russian republic that 
borders breakaway Chechnya. A Dagestani government spokesman said 
the heaviest ground fighting was in villages north of the main 
combat zone in Dagestan's Botlikh district. A force consisting 
mostly of local volunteers repelled rebel attacks for three hours, 
killing at least seven militants, the Russian Interior Ministry 
said.

	Pressure To Oust Milosevic Mounts  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As pressure mounts from within  
Yugoslavia to oust President Slobodan Milosevic, vice premier 
Tomislav Nikolic -- an ultranationalist -- told a German magazine 
that Milosevic should resign ``not because the West demands it, but 
rather because he capitulated in Kosovo.'' On the other end of the 
political spectrum, Serbia's opposition leaders today warned 
Milosevic to resign or face an intense round of fall protests. Most 
Kosovo Serbs feel betrayed by Milosevic, who first provoked NATO's 
bombing campaign by refusing to agree to a Kosovo peace settlement, 
only to agree to terms he originally rejected after the bombing, 
effectively losing control of Kosovo.

	Woods, Weir Lead PGA Championship  
</P>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Heading into today's final round, Mike Weir  
gets another crack at Tiger Woods in Chicago, this time with the 
final major championship of the 20th century on the line. Woods 
made three straight birdies on the front nine and finished with a 
4-under 68 for a share of the lead, his best position in a major 
championship since his record-breaking victory in the 1997 Masters. 
``I just enjoy being in a position where everyone is trying to beat 
me,'' Woods said. ``If you have a lead, everyone else will have to 
shoot that much better. But that's not the case here.''

plans to begin a West Bank pullout on Oct. 1, angering Palestinian 
negotiators who said they were not being consulted. Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak told his Cabinet today that the army will begin 
preparations for a withdrawal next month. The Cabinet statement 
said Barak planned an October withdrawal ``parallel with 
Palestinian fulfillment of commitments.'' The withdrawal is the 
second scheduled under the peace accords brokered by President 
Clinton at Wye River, Md., last year.

	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Reynolds Metals Co. rejected today a $5.6  
billion takeover bid by Alcoa Inc. as inadequate, a decision likely 
to set off a bidding scramble for the No. 3 aluminum manufacturer. 
Already, a Chicago-based investment firm, Michigan Avenue Partners, 
said it has made a superior all-cash offer for Reynolds though it 
declined to disclose details of the bid. The offer came after 
Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum company, 
disclosed its unsolicited $65 a share cash-and-stock offer on

<HEADLINE> Roseanne Angry With 1 a.m. Slot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If Roseanne becomes the new queen of late-night  
television this fall, it won't be by choice. Not by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Her struggling daytime talk show has been assigned by several TV  
stations to start when most of the intended audience is asleep: 1 
a.m. in Phoenix, midnight in Denver, 1:05 a.m. in Minneapolis, 
after an informercial. 
</P>
<P>
	Other stations have dumped Roseanne completely.  
</P>
<P>
	Entering its second year, ``The Roseanne Show'' is not quite  
dead, but not really alive, either. Its star, the former 
blue-collar heroine of situation comedy, is enmeshed in a nasty 
corporate battle. 
</P>
<P>
	She's not talking, but her executive producer, Jeff Wald, is  
tossing a few grenades. He said the show's recent cancellation by 
11 NBC-owned stations was an attempt to strong-arm Roseanne into 
quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like bullies,'' Wald said, ``and I think they're  
trying to bully her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't supposed to be this way, of course. It never is. There  
was such enthusiasm when Roseanne agreed to a talk show that 
stations representing 86 percent of the country signed up, even 
though the syndicator, King World, required two-year contracts at 
stiff prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics immediately noticed the show's schizophrenic nature.  
Some days Roseanne wanted to entertain you, other days enlighten 
you. Some days she wanted to make you mad, other days she did so 
unintentionally. It was never clear what ``The Roseanne Show'' was 
really all about. 
</P>
<P>
	In a business where first impressions are crucial, initial  
ratings were lackluster, and they got worse as the year went on. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program itself is getting better,'' said Cindy Velazquez,  
general manager of the ABC affiliate KMGH-TV in Denver. ``It has 
settled into a direction that it didn't have initially. Personally, 
I felt it was all over the map when it first started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the improvement, ``The Roseanne Show'' was shunted to  
late-night when KMGH made room for its expanded evening news. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, stations don't have to worry about where to schedule  
shows that do poorly in the ratings. They simply go away, said 
Richard Kurlander, an expert on the syndication market for the 
advertising buying firm Petry Television. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time there's been a failure, and the  
syndicator is holding people to their contracts and producing the 
show,'' he said. ``This is new ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King World is guaranteed a profit no matter how many people  
watch the show, because of the two-year contract, Kurlander said. 
The decision to continue production is not necessarily obvious; 
King World must worry about alienating stations by holding them to 
a contract that hasn't work out. For now, King World is taking the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way out for stations unhappy with their contracts is if  
Roseanne walks away. They would get a refund for the second year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Wald is convinced NBC executive Pat Wallace is trying  
to push Roseanne out. Wallace ordered ``The Roseanne Show'' taken 
off the air at the NBC-owned stations, a huge blow since it 
includes big markets like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to change time slots, that's one thing,'' Wald  
said. ``But their avowed interest is to get her to quit. I've never 
heard anything like that in my 35 years in the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's more corporate intrigue. King World, after years of  
independence, was bought out by CBS earlier this year, and Wald 
believes NBC hates the idea of paying CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC denies trying to force Roseanne out. It said its stations  
were trying to find a scheduling formula that worked before cutting 
the show out of the fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the decision in an attempt to improve our ratings  
performance,'' Wallace, president of the NBC television stations, 
said. ``The program had not only not lived up to expectations, the 
ratings performance was extremely disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It makes no sense, Wallace said, for NBC to retaliate because of  
the CBS purchase. The network still has to do other business with 
King World, the syndicator of ``Oprah'' and ``Jeopardy.'' Kurlander 
also downplayed this theory, noting that it's CBS -- not NBC -- 
making money as the situation stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Roseanne Show'' will be seen in 60 percent of the country  
this fall, instead of 86 percent. King World won't say how many of 
the remaining stations have scheduled it for the graveyard shift; 
Kurlander estimates it's about one-third. Even Wald concedes this 
makes it more difficult to persuade stars to come on the show as 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't feel good to be taking on somebody this size,''  
Wald said. ``But, by the same token, David took on Goliath, and 
we're not afraid. We're not going to quit. We're going to stay 
there, and whatever stations are running us are going to get the 
best we have to offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's at least one clear lesson to be learned: ``We're  
advising stations to be very cautious about any two-year deals,'' 
Kurlander said.

<HEADLINE> Los Angeles Synagogue Vandalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Congregants of a Hollywood area temple  
arrived for weekend services to see a swastika and ``Jews die'' 
spray-painted on a wall, just days after a shooting spree at a 
Jewish community center in another part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's a copycat thing,'' police Sgt. Sanford  
Rosenberg said of the graffiti discovered Saturday at Temple 
Knesset Israel. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	In the temple's mailbox, police found a letter that appeared to  
be anti-British. Temple president, Harvey Shield, is British. 
</P>
<P>
	Shield said that after a white supremacist's alleged shooting  
rampage Tuesday in the San Fernando Valley, temple members 
suggested he should increase security. 
</P>
<P>
	``My initial response was, let's not overreact so quickly,''  
Shield said. ``Now there is no question about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shield said he planned to hire a security guard for the holy  
days in September. Police said patrols in the area would be stepped 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	White supremacist Buford Furrow was charged with killing a  
postal worker in suburban Chatsworth after he shot and wounded five 
others, four of them children, at the North Valley Jewish Community 
Center in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow allegedly told authorities the shooting spree was ``a  
wake-up call to America to kill Jews.''

<HEADLINE> Lockdown at San Quentin After Melee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) --As many as 80 inmates were involved in  
a 1 1/2-hour melee at San Quentin Prison that injured five guards, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 460 prisoners remained under lockdown following the  
brawl Friday night in a cell block that houses some of San 
Quentin's most dangerous inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	One guard was treated at Marin General Hospital for minor  
injuries. Four others who were punched did not require hospital 
treatment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison spokesman Vernell Crittendon said he didn't know how many  
inmates were injured, but none required medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The melee broke out as a number of inmates were returning from  
the dining hall about 7:25 p.m. Friday. An inmate apparently tried 
to block the door to the cell block, and a sergeant who tried to 
open it was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	When 21 guards could not quell the melee, a rare second alert  
was called for extra personnel to subdue the inmates. Crittendon 
said that in his 22 years at the prison, a secondary response has 
been used only about a half-dozen times.

<HEADLINE> Replay System Fails at Arrowhead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The first time the new instant replay  
system was used this season at Arrowhead Stadium, it failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee Titans asked for a review of a pass play in the  
second quarter of Sunday night's exhibition game against the Kansas 
City Chiefs. The play had been was ruled incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials huddled around the replay booth on the Chiefs'  
sideline, but the video system didn't work. Referee Ron Blum walked 
across the field to Titans coach Jeff Fisher and told him the 
officials' findings were inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	It was later announced that the glitch was caused by a software  
problem and the Chiefs went to a backup system. 
</P>
<P>
	The replay was available in the press box and it appeared to  
show that a pass from quarterback Steve McNair to Kevin Dyson was 
incomplete. Dyson appeared to be juggling the ball as he was 
tackled.

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona first baseman Travis Lee sprained his  
left ankle while fielding balls in the outfield during batting 
practice Sunday night and said he expects to be sidelined for three 
to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks said Lee sustained a moderate sprain. X-rays  
showed no broken bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, in his second major league season, had lost his starting  
job because he was mired in a 2-for-43 slump going into Sunday's 
game against Milwaukee. He was on crutches in the clubhouse after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it rains, it pours,'' Lee said. ``This is kind of  
brutal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee is batting .236 with nine home runs and 50 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	Lee had been working out in the outfield in recent days because  
Buck Showalter was considering playing him some there. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said he was working on gauging the distance of fly balls off  
the bat when he rolled his ankle while planting his foot. He said 
he had turned the ankle several times in the past, but never this 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	He fell to the ground in obvious pain as Showalter rushed to him  
and called for the medical cart to take him off the field.

<HEADLINE> US To Aid Nigerian Energy Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson  
signed a tentative cooperation agreement to aid Nigeria's troubled 
oil industry and other energy sectors in return for substantial 
free market reforms, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, the most senior U.S. official to visit Nigeria since  
an elected government was inaugurated nearly three months ago, 
signed the memorandum of understanding with Nigeria's Energy 
Minister Bola Ige on Saturday in Nigeria's capital of Abuja. 
</P>
<P>
	The document calls on Nigeria to begin privatizing state energy  
companies and remove trade and investment barriers. In return, the 
United States will provide short-term aid to help alleviate oil, 
gas and electricity shortages in Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the West African country is the world's sixth largest  
oil exporter and the fifth largest to the United States, Nigeria 
has for years been hobbled by official mismanagement, violent 
public protests, armed hijackings and kidnappings. Serious fuel 
shortages are common and gasoline is frequently sold only on the 
black market. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a joint venture between Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corp.  
was forced to stop pumping oil off the coast of Nigeria because 
angry residents in the area blocked supplies from reaching the 
company's platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's first civilian president in 15 years, Olusegun  
Obasanjo, has promised to fight corruption and focus on resolving 
violent disputes between rival groups vying for state oil revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson declared U.S. support for plans by a consortium led  
by Chevron to build a $400 million pipeline that will ship Nigerian 
gas to neighboring Benin, Ghana and Togo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clinton administration feels that Nigeria is one of four  
countries in the world that requires important American attention 
in investment,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation managing director  
Jackson Gauis-Obaseki said Saturday the government had lost more 
than $1 billion in oil revenue this year as a result of violent 
disruptions to the petroleum industry.

<HEADLINE> Berry: Race a Factor in Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Halle Berry can't help but compare her Hollywood  
experience to that of Dorothy Dandridge, the black movie star of 
the 1950s and '60s whose nomination for a best actress Academy 
Award couldn't overcome the discrimination she faced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dorothy wanted to be treated like her white counterparts, and  
she suffered for it,'' Berry says in Sunday's Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	She plays the late star in the upcoming HBO film ``Introducing  
Dorothy Dandridge.'' After earning an Oscar nomination for the 1954 
film ``Carmen Jones,'' Dandridge died in 1965 of a prescription 
drug overdose. She was 42. 
</P>
<P>
	Doing the film biography changed Berry's perspective on her own  
struggles as a black actress in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to believe conditions (were) hard for black artists,''  
she said. ``But if you lived Dorothy Dandridge's life for a while, 
you'd realize how far we've come. Dorothy didn't know that Halle 
would be sitting here in 1999 seeing a bright day dawning. I may 
not see the end of the tunnel, but someone else may.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Berry notes that race remains a factor in Hollywood  
decision making, saying she cannot compare ``the choices I make in 
my career to the choices Meg Ryan has.''

	It's been nearly four months since seniors Eric Harris, 18, and  
Dylan Klebold, 17, attacked with guns and bombs, killing a dozen 
classmates and a teacher and injuring 23 others before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Local church members say that for fellow believers nationwide,  
Littleton has become a symbol both of inexplicable evil and of 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday services originated with the Rev. Rick Barger, whose  
1,700-member Abiding Hope Lutheran Church is filled with young 
families. Barger says in the aftermath of the campus shootings many 
students and parents have found more solace in the rhythms of 
normal church services than large community events. 
</P>
<P>
	Local churches report attendance by both youths and adults rose  
significantly after the shootings, and remains above average. 
</P>
<P>
	In his sermon, Barger said ``God has done awesome work in this  
community. These last few months, I feel, have been one of the 
biggest Spirit-filled movements of the 20th century. God has 
invaded a country to bring us from darkness into light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main speaker was Bart Campolo, whose Kingdomworks does  
inner-city mission work in Philadelphia. He said ``you'd better 
believe that good overcomes evil or I don't know how you can go 
back to school ... If I can follow Jesus I can make it through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the gathering to reach out to lonely students. ``Look  
for people to love and care and pray for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gunmen Harris and Klebold reportedly felt like outsiders at  
Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shootings, various religious leaders have called for  
stricter gun control; a toning down of violence in movies, TV and 
rock music; or posting of the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Littleton carnage produced Evangelical Protestants' most  
important martyr in decades, Cassie Bernall, who experienced a 
dramatic conversion two years ago. She reportedly told a gunman 
``yes, I believe in God'' and was immediately shot dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. David Flaig, who coordinates a network of local youth  
ministers, says that nationwide ``Littleton has become a rallying 
cry, particularly Cassie's statement of faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton teens have fanned out to speak and sing at many church  
gatherings. Stephen and Jon Cohen of the Columbine High Bible Club, 
whose band performed at Fiddler's Green, have appeared at 20 events 
across Colorado and in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Littleton high schoolers spoke at youth rallies Friday and  
Saturday night in Greenville, S.C.

<HEADLINE> Marine Life Returns to Brooklyn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leonard Thomas, a drawbridge operator on  
Brooklyn's Gowanus Canal, looked down from the Union Street bridge 
one day recently and saw a blue crab skittering under the water. 
Then another, and another. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 49, who has a second life as ``Chicken Man,'' the author  
of a popular cookbook of chicken recipes, was delighted -- and 
inspired. He climbed back into his tower and sat down to invent a 
new dish. ``I'm calling it Gowanus Gumbo,'' he says. ``Chicken 
stuffed with crabs.'' Pause. ``But not THESE crabs ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	While still far from edible, marine creatures are returning to  
the Gowanus, the notoriously polluted ditch that winds just over a 
mile through a wasteland of old factories, junkyards and derelict 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, the Gowanus was known as New York state's most  
toxic waterway and -- though it never caught fire like Cleveland's 
Cuyahoga River -- was among the foulest in the nation, too. 
</P>
<P>
	But that changed in May when the city, responding to demands by  
community groups, completed a $10 million repair of the canal's 
90-year-old ``flushing tunnel,'' which had sat idle since it broke 
down in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the tunnel's 12-foot-diameter bronze ship's  
propeller is pulling 300 million gallons of water a day from New 
York harbor, driving it through the canal and back into the harbor 
at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're bringing in fresh water at a rate that entirely changes  
the canal's water every 23 hours,'' said Joel Miele, the city's 
environmental protection commissioner. ``Since the harbor itself is 
the cleanest in 70 years, any flora and fauna capable of surviving 
in the harbor can do the same thing in the Gowanus, and they are 
merrily doing that as we speak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In just weeks, water that was once the color of skim milk mixed  
with motor oil has become dramatically clearer. It is now possible 
to see crabs and fish beneath the surface -- along with the trash on 
the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	A slow-moving, purplish oil slick proves there's a current in  
the 60-foot-wide canal. Jellyfish float past, Atlantic-bound, with 
bits of garbage and paper wrappers. Near the Carroll Street bridge, 
two geese and a duck paddle happily about. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas says a cormorant, a diving bird that feeds on fish,  
regularly perches on a containment boom to dry his wings. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the canal's infamous odor, he said, ``A year ago you  
couldn't stand it. Now, sometimes, it almost smells like sea 
water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Muir, director of the Brooklyn Center for Urban  
Environment, calls the swift return of marine life ``an astounding 
development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Two months ago this place was a biological desert. ... The  
water was nearly opaque and devoid of oxygen,'' he said. ``Any 
living thing that got anywhere near the outlet would run up against 
a wall of deoxygenated water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, most of the new sealife is ``migrating upstream from  
Gowanus Bay,'' Muir said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is to clean the bottom -- an expensive task that  
Miele says may require city, state and federal cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Muir said samplings show a canal bed coated by a ``uniformly  
awful,'' highly toxic accumulation of ``tarry-looking stuff, equal 
parts of petroleum precipitate, and to put it politely, organic 
materials settling out of sewage overflow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muir was too polite to mention non-organic material such as  
discarded condoms, known in local parlance as ``Brooklyn trout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The canal's name comes from Gouwane, chief of Brooklyn's  
Canarsee tribe. It earned a place in history in 1776 when its 
swampy waters helped delay British redcoats long enough for Gen. 
George Washington, defeated in the Battle of Long island, to escape 
to Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	A century later, the natural creek was dredged to create a barge  
route into downtown Brooklyn, eventually attracting stoneyards, 
tanneries, foundries, paint and ink factories, paper and flour 
mills, electroplating shops, coal, lumber and gas distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1893, Brooklyn's Daily Eagle called the canal ``an open  
cesspool.'' And the term ``gas house gang'' first applied to bands 
of thugs who ambushed sailors and other innocents from hangouts 
along its banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that many famous mobsters came from nearby Carroll  
Gardens encouraged myths of the Gowanus as a convenient place to 
dump inconvenient bodies. One local man half-jokes that the bottom 
cleanup will reveal ``leg bones tied to cement blocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But inhabitants say corpses rarely turn up with the bicycles,  
Christmas trees, shopping carts, highway cones and auto parts that 
emerge at low tide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody said it one day and it sounded good,'' says junkyard  
owner Dan Tinney. In his 23 years, Tinney said, ``two, maybe 
three'' bodies have been hauled out. Once, police spent hours 
recovering what turned out to be a mannequin planted by pranksters. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, barges delivering oil to a fuel depot next door are  
virtually the only customers that gourmet-bridge tender Lenny 
Thomas has to worry about: ``Maybe once a week during the summer, 
more often in the cold weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there already are signs of a new life for the canal. A film  
documentary, ``Lavender Lake,'' plays in local theaters, periodic 
boat tours draw capacity crowds, and a Gowanus Canal Web site 
(www.gowanuscanal.com) recorded 28,000 hits in one week -- almost 
three times the average -- after newspapers reported the crab 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Web site designer Mark Phillips says the publicity also spurred  
sales of his ``Gowanus Canal Yacht Club'' T-shirts. ``A lot of 
people are canal buffs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expect the canal's comeback to revive a shabby South  
Brooklyn neighborhood whose best-known business is a casket 
factory. Real estate entrepreneurs have displayed nibbling 
interest. And there is talk of a canalside park with weeping 
willows, outdoor cafes and paddleboats for rent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicken Man'' Thomas likes that idea. ``Walkways along the  
water would be nice. Water has a calming effect on people,'' he 
said. ``Maybe even a grill -- chicken on the canal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be nice to have a bunch of fountains, a  
promenade,'' agreed Risha Gorig, 29, a German-born sculptor who 
lives by the canal with her boyfriend and a rescued pit bull. She 
also imagines their canalside lot, shared with the owner of a 
garish houseboat, as the center of an artists' colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Tinney, the junkyard man, said a promenade ``sounds terrific,''  
but wouldn't be practical, as the canal's three bridges -- each of 
which opens in a different way -- are too low to walk under. He said 
he favors commercial development such as caterers, restaurants and 
a ``mini-shopping mall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the end it'll be a mix. it may not happen in our  
lifetime, but it will happen. This is the last jungle, the last 
frontier -- there's nowhere to go from here,'' he said.

	Bush Shines in Iowa Proving Ground  
</P>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush cemented his front-runner  
status last night with a convincing victory in the Iowa straw poll, 
passing an early test of political potency that could unravel other 
Republican presidential campaigns. The Texas governor said he's 
``on the road to winning the nomination.'' Bush received nearly one 
third of the straw poll vote, or 7,418. Steve Forbes and Elizabeth 
Dole finished second and third in the nonbinding poll. Weak 
showings by former Vice President Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander 
staggered their campaigns.

	Russian Forces Battle Militants  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces fought Islamic  
militants in scattered skirmishes in Dagestan Saturday, suffering 
at least four deaths as officials admitted that the rebels remained 
in control of seven villages. The fighting was concentrated in the 
Caucasus region of Dagestan, a mountainous Russian republic that 
borders breakaway Chechnya. A Dagestani government spokesman said 
the heaviest ground fighting was in villages north of the main 
combat zone in Dagestan's Botlikh district. A force consisting 
mostly of local volunteers repelled rebel attacks for three hours, 
killing at least seven militants, the Russian Interior Ministry 
said.

	Report: Protesters Sentenced To Die  
</P>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary  
Court reportedly has condemned to death instigators of last month's 
mass protests, Iran's worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic 
revolution. The evening Kayhan daily, which is believed to have 
close ties to Iran's hard-line judiciary, quoted ``informed 
sources'' yesterday, but the story has not been confirmed. The mass 
protests, which highlighted the struggle between reformists and 
conservatives in the government, were sparked by the police's 
storming of a Tehran University dormitory on July 9 after students 
objected to the banning of a reformist newspaper.

	New Computer Is Size of an Aspirin

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The latest from the cyberworld: an  
aspirin-size computer that, embedded in household appliances, could 
let people on the road or at the office use the Internet to cool 
their homes, heat coffee and tape TV shows. Believed to be the 
smallest such computer ever built, the inexpensive device could 
help usher in a new generation of connected home appliances, from 
VCRs to coffee makers to small cameras, controlled over the 
Internet from almost anywhere.

glitches, according to a federal report released yesterday. The 
rest of the states have only 139 days to guarantee reliability of 
their systems that run everything from law enforcement agencies to 
utilities. The report by the General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress, was released at a congressional 
subcommittee hearing held in Silicon Valley.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the wake of NATO's bombing  
campaign against Yugoslavia that followed the crackdown in Kosovo, 
sentiment to oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has been 
growing. The newly named vice premier in Yugoslavia -- an 
ultranationalist appointed as part of a government reshuffle meant 
to strengthen Milosevic -- called for the president's resignation. 
On the other end of the political spectrum, Serbia's opposition 
leaders yesterday warned Milosevic to resign or face an intense 
round of fall protests.

	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's prime minister has ordered  
the military to find the bodies of 38 people still listed as 
missing after clashes between troops and pro-democracy protesters 
seven years ago. In May 1992, tens of thousands of Thais poured 
into Bangkok's streets to protest an attempt by the military regime 
to stay in power rather than calling promised elections. Troops 
ultimately fired into the crowds, killing at least 50 people, 
wounding 100 and leaving scores missing.

final major championship of the 20th century on the line. Woods 
made three straight birdies on the front nine and finished with a 
4-under 68 for a share of the lead, his best position in a major 
championship since his record-breaking victory in the 1997 Masters. 
``I just enjoy being in a position where everyone is trying to beat 
me,'' Woods said. ``If you have a lead, everyone else will have to 
shoot that much better. But that's not the case here.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Wants Proof Buyers Can Use Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno says gun violence  
might be reduced if prospective gun owners are required to be 
licensed and show they can use a firearm safely and legally. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Sunday on CNN's ``Late Edition'' that she favored  
``not registering guns, but licensing the people who use guns on 
the common-sense principle that you shouldn't ... use a gun unless 
you know how to safely and lawfully use it, and unless you have 
evidenced the capacity and willingness to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have them take a written and manual test demonstrating  
that they know how to safely and ... to lawfully use it under state 
law,'' along with passing a background check, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general said her proposal was based on common  
sense. ``I think it would have a real impact, because now people 
can possess a weapon without knowing how to use it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She told of a friend who got a gun for self-protection. ``I  
said, `Do you know how to use that thing?' She said no. I said, 
`Take it back. You're going to be more dangerous with it than 
without it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, who also offered the idea of licensing gun owners in April  
after the Colorado school shootings, could not say if such a law 
would have prevented last week's shootings at a Jewish community 
center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if we have one law that focuses on the user, ensures that  
they have the capacity and the knowledge to use it safely and 
lawfully, then we can really go after people who possess a gun 
without a license, because there is no excuse,'' she added. ``Be 
licensed, know how to use it, and I think we could have a far 
greater impact in the whole area of gun violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has been seeking to strengthen federal gun and  
hate-crimes laws, but he has made no formal proposal regarding 
Reno's idea of licensing gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno would not say whether federal or state charges would be  
pursued first against Buford O. Furrow Jr., the white supremacist 
accused of wounding five people at the Jewish center Tuesday and of 
killing a Filipino-American postal worker later that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the Justice Department would confer with local  
authorities to determine a course of action. She also said it was 
too early to say whether her prosecutors would seek the death 
penalty in the killing of the postal worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the department should more aggressively  
investigate groups likely to be involved in hate crimes, Reno said 
it would use its authority to vigorously pursue investigations that 
appeared to involve criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't think we should go after somebody if there is no  
indication of criminal conduct,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, appearing on CBS' ``Face  
the Nation'' earlier Sunday, said the Justice Department needs to 
``see whether or not we are doing all that we can to effectively 
monitor these hate groups.''

<HEADLINE> Mt. Vernon May Have Hip-Hop Tribute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT VERNON, N.Y. (AP) -- Across the street, jobless men playing  
checkers in the shade look over at the old Fourth Avenue Firehouse 
and see crumbling brick, padlocked garage doors and boarded-up 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Ernest Davis sees the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame.  
</P>
<P>
	He sees big Hollywood-style induction nights. He sees rotating  
exhibits of memorabilia from the rappers like LL Cool J, Heavy D, 
Mary J. Blige and Doug E. Fresh. He sees shows that relate hip-hop 
culture to African history. 
</P>
<P>
	And he sees hope for the desolate neighborhood -- ``coffee shops,  
artists' galleries, new sidewalks, new streetlights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a building but it's not,'' Davis said outside  
the 94-year-old firehouse, vacant since the 1960s. ``It's an 
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to latch on to the wildly popular rap music culture  
for a project that will attract Mount Vernon's youth away from 
drugs and crime and serve as an anchor for the renewal of its 
toughest neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of 67,000 just north of the New York City borough of  
the Bronx is using a $500,000 federal grant to start the process. 
Davis is confident of getting more grant money and contributions, 
especially from wealthy hip-hop performers and executives, several 
of whom have ties to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``In rap they call this city `money-earnin' Mount Vernon,''' the  
mayor said, quoting a bit of rhymed hip-hop slang. 
</P>
<P>
	``But,'' he added, ``we don't keep the money.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs, an industry titan who grew up in  
Mount Vernon-- and his mother -- have already spoken to the mayor 
about helping out. Combs has earmarked some personal rap 
paraphernalia for the museum, including the desk on which his first 
big record deal was signed, Davis said. Heavy D, who spent his 
formative years in the city, is also expected to play a part. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Burrowes, who manages hip-hop queen Mary J. Blige, said a  
museum might educate today's artists, ``who are making tons and 
tons of money off hip-hop and might not even know how far back this 
thing goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How far back it goes is apparently up for debate. Akiba Solomon,  
national affairs editor at the hip-hop magazine The Source, said 
some trace the start of hip-hop to 1979 and the first rap hit, 
``Rapper's Delight'' by the Sugar Hill Gang. But Burrowes said the 
roots of hip-hop can be found in '20s and '30s swing dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	The culture's giant, Burrowes said, is Kool Herc, a  
reggae-influenced Jamaican disc jockey who began talking over the 
music while playing records at dance parties in Bronx parks in the 
mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Hip-hop includes more than music. Wendy Goldstein, senior vice  
president for artists and repertoire at MCA Records, said she'd 
like to see separate wings at the museum for ``great graffiti 
artists, great break dancers, great DJs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That vision may be a bit grander than what's available at the  
three-story firehouse, which measures 13,000 square feet. The mayor 
wants to reserve the upper floors for job-training classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he will involve young people in the planning,  
construction and operation of the museum, which he said could open 
next year. He has already recruited teens from a shelter to lug 30 
years of debris from the ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to give these kids a reason to see past the next  
shooting or shoot-up,'' he said. ``Make them think they'll live 
past next year, stay out of jail. Then, if they begin to think that 
maybe they'll be around a while, they'll want to look around and 
contribute. I want to treat these people as resources, not 
adversaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 61, says his own musical tastes run to Dave Brubeck,  
Sarah Vaughan and the Modern Jazz Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hip hop is not my culture,'' he says, ``but if you want to  
change people you have to reach them where they are.''

<HEADLINE> Dan Quayle Confident in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDOWN, N.H. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle reacted  
Sunday to his dismal showing in Iowa straw poll by giving 
confident, emotional speeches punctuated by applause from his 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He alluded to the obstacles he faces, spoke of forging ahead and  
congratulated Texas Gov. George W. Bush for his Saturday victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you look at America and the American spirit ... we have  
always been optimistic,'' he said. ``The thing I resent most about 
this administration is the cynicism and distrust they have put out 
into America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a picnic in Amherst, Quayle said he wasn't  
disappointed by his eighth-place Iowa showing and will make no 
changes in strategy because of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I congratulate George Bush,'' Quayle said. ``He won fair and  
square. But you have to win on Election Day. You can buy a straw 
poll. You can't buy an election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle attributed his finish to spending less money than the  
Texas governor and to a late start in the straw poll campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sandown and Amherst, Quayle won applause by deriding  
President Clinton, calling for classroom discipline and better pay 
for teachers, and promising to cut taxes 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle compared Clinton's administration to the Woodstock music  
festivals in 1969 and this year. Like the first show, Clinton began 
full of youthful ideals, Quayle said. But like this year's 
festival, his administration turned chaotic. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- With a swimming pool as a backdrop,  
Elizabeth Dole said Sunday she is diving into the rest of her 
presidential campaign buoyed by the results of the Iowa straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, who finished behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush and  
publisher Steve Forbes, called the backyard meeting with several 
hundred supporters a victory party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came into the top three in a very solid position, without  
spending the millions of dollars spent by the others,'' she said. 
``I think it shows we're bringing in a lot of new people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Stawasz, a former state senator from Hollis, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the dollars per vote, she got the best mileage  
of anyone in Iowa,'' he said. ``Bush did very well, but what was 
his cost per vote?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it grew dark, Laurie Doucette of Bedford watched as Dole made  
her way through the crowd.

	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- After his fourth-place finish in the  
Iowa straw poll, Gary Bauer said Sunday he plans to take on the 
higher ranked candidates one at a time, starting with Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said he has challenged the New Jersey publisher to a  
debate as a way to dispel Forbes' claim that he best represents 
conservative voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tries to claim the conservative mantle, and I don't believe  
it is his,'' Bauer said after meeting with supporters in 
Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Forbes is his current target, Bauer said he's preparing  
to ``zero-in on anyone who's still ahead of me. With each day, the 
field is going to get smaller, and the issues are going to get 
bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said he wasn't surprised that he finished ahead of other  
conservative candidates such as former Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what it did was confirm for the rest of the political  
world what we already knew -- that I'm going to be a top-tier 
candidate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, issues will determine the outcome of the campaign,  
not money.'' Bauer said.

	AMHERST, N.H. (AP) -- Despite his last-place finish in Iowa's  
straw poll, Republican presidential candidate Orrin Hatch said 
Sunday he is pleased he did as well as he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got in the race late,'' Hatch said at a Republican  
picnic. ``Anybody who knows me knows you should never count Orrin 
Hatch out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said 558 votes is a respectable total after campaigning  
only 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't place too much credence in (the poll),'' Hatch said.  
``It was clearly a fund-raiser.''

<HEADLINE> House-Hunting Clintons Visit N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE BROOK, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton and Hillary Rodham  
Clinton toured a home listed at almost $2.3 million in this New 
York City suburb near the Connecticut line during a quick 
house-hunting trip Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons, accompanied by daughter Chelsea and the first  
lady's mother, Dorothy Rodham, were expected to visit several 
Westchester County homes. Reporters were kept at a distance from 
the first two houses and the White House did not provide 
information about them. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was secluded from the street, with a low stone wall  
and a tree-shaded drive. The sale price for the 4.14-acre property 
was $2.295 million, according to a sales listing available to real 
estate agents. It is described as having French windows, high 
ceilings, landscaping, a heated pool and a picturesque bridge and 
brook. 
</P>
<P>
	The second home was in South Salem, a bit to the north but also  
near the Connecticut border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons interrupted their planned weekend stay at Camp  
David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. Mrs. Clinton, 
considering a run for the U.S. Senate, must move to New York by 
Election Day 2000 to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	They flew on a small Air Force jet rather than the Boeing 747  
that usually serves as Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Mrs. Clinton looked at a seven-bedroom colonial house  
in Edgemont priced at $1.7 million. The White House did not say if 
that house was on their list Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The house, sheltered from the street by trees and rocky walls,  
is within walking distance of fashionable Scarsdale in southern 
Westchester County. The neighborhood is 22 miles north of Times 
Square and a half-hour by rail from Grand Central Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	The house would be less of a financial burden on the Clinton's  
than the $3.8 million estate the first lady viewed in June. The 
Clintons earned $504,109 last year.

<HEADLINE> Boehringer Facing Shoulder Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Padres pitcher Brian Boehringer will  
likely have surgery Tuesday for a partial tear in his right rotator 
cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI examination Saturday revealed the tear. The right-hander  
left Friday night's game against Florida after four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego has not yet placed Boehringer on the 15-day disabled  
list, but is expected to do so Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boehringer has been solid since becoming a starter early in the  
season. He is 6-5 with a 3.24 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Spencer, demoted to Triple-A Las Vegas May 19, is expected  
to replace Boehringer.

<HEADLINE> Weir Collapses at PGA Championship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Mike Weir can thank his putter for his  
collapse at the PGA Championship. Or maybe he'd just like to throw 
it away. 
</P>
<P>
	With an 8-over-par 80 Sunday, Weir went from being tied for the  
lead with Tiger Woods to a six-way tie for 10th place. He finished 
eight strokes behind Woods at 3-under 285. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, it's disappointing, but what can I say?'' Weir said. ``I  
gave it my best and I didn't give up. Eighty is the best score I 
could have shot, obviously. I tried on every shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be back again.''  
</P>
<P>
	For three rounds, Weir looked like he might give Woods -- and  
anyone else, for that matter -- a challenge. Though he's only 
5-foot-9 and 155 pounds, he can drive the ball like Woods or David 
Duval. He's straight, too, and an accurate putter. 
</P>
<P>
	Not on Sunday. He had 35 putts and hit only 10 greens in  
regulation. The left-hander had seven bogeys and a double bogey. He 
bogeyed five holes on the front nine alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a big change in the speed of the greens and I didn't  
adjust to it well at all,'' he said. ``I just wasn't sharp all the 
way around. I didn't have a feel at all around the green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weir, a native of Canada, had no idea when he was warming up  
that he was in for such a rocky day. He felt fine at the practice 
range, and he even thought he hit the ball well. But once he got on 
the green, he lost his touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had every spike mark in the world, it seemed like,'' he  
said. ``It was just one of those days when bad luck and a 
combination of when I did hit a good putt, it hit a spike mark and 
went off-line. Whatever could go wrong out there went wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the five bogeys, Weir was still in contention after nine  
at 7 under. Then he double-bogeyed the par-4 11th and any chance of 
catching Woods ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really surprised me, especially on the back nine,'' he  
said. ``I was really in shock. I was in like la-la land a little 
bit because I just couldn't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while playing with Woods could rattle anyone's nerves, Weir  
said that had nothing to do with his awful day. He played with 
Woods in the final round of the Western Open last month, so he knew 
exactly what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing with the gallery or Tiger,'' he said. ``It  
was just me.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Comments on Bush's Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George  
W. Bush does not have a ``divine right'' to be president no matter 
how much money he's raised, Democratic rival Bill Bradley suggested 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know him. I've never met him. He seems genial. He's  
governor of a big state. He was re-elected. But with all of those 
attributes, if he didn't have $50 million, who knows? I think this 
is a time when it's possible to raise too much money,'' the former 
New Jersey senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was responding to a question about Bush from Dr. David  
Wallace, one of about 100 people who showed up to meet Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``How the hell does a guy like this, a rich kid millionaire with  
a very dubious background, present himself as presidential 
material?'' Wallace asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``You mean you don't think there's a divine right to office?''  
Bradley responded. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Bush received nearly one third of the votes in the  
Iowa straw poll, placing him first in the nonbinding contest 
between GOP hopefuls. He said the victory will propel him on to 
winning the Republican nomination for president. 
</P>
<P>
	In Salem, Bradley struck familiar campaign themes on what he'd  
like his legacy to be if elected president, saying he wants to 
protect the environment, lead a country at peace, be a good steward 
of a good economy, help kids reach their potential and bring racial 
unity. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his main goal is to help people prosper in times of a  
changing economy, changing technology, military threats and new 
immigration patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these things are happening simultaneously. One of the  
key jobs of the president is to give people a narrative of where 
they fit in in all of this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, Bradley told 30 anti-gun activists in Boston he  
wants to ban the sale of cheaply-made guns known as ``Saturday 
night specials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters he favors creating a national gun registry  
system similar to the process now used to register cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The former professional basketball player said he also believes  
in banning gun shows that don't perform background checks and that 
it should be a felony crime for gun dealers to sell guns to people 
who turn around and sell the gun to a felon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is challenging Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic  
presidential nomination.

<HEADLINE> Drought Prompts Stampede to Market / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- With water and feed hard to come by in  
many counties, West Virginia farmers are driving their cattle to 
the auction market earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the state's 13 cattle option markets, counted together,  
sold up to 300 percent more cattle this July than a year earlier. 
Figures for the other six were not available from the state's 
Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Crihfield, a farmer in Kentuck, Jackson County, sold 23 cows  
and 23 calves last month -- half of his cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have the water,'' Crihfield said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson County farmer James Bostics sold 15 cows, nearly half  
his livestock, to avoid the cost of buying hay. The Department of 
Agriculture estimates the hay crop is down 50 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In August we continue to see an above-average number of cattle  
moving,'' said department official Dwayne O'Dell. But he said the 
increased sales are not a cause for concern -- ``People are just 
moving livestock earlier. Many would have normally been marketed in 
October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, O'Dell said state agriculture officials are worried that  
if the drought continues some farmers may sell all their cattle and 
go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock ``are selling at a $50 to $100 deficit as compared to  
what they would normally sell for,'' he said. During a normal 
season, a calf, fattened up by grazing, would weigh about 500 
pounds, but is now only 375 to 400 pounds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog farmers in eastern West Virginia also may be selling animals  
earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some hogs may have been moved prematurely because of excess  
heat,'' said Agriculture Commissioner Gus Douglass. Heat leads to 
reduced growth, Douglass said, but ``there is sufficient feed for 
them.'' Hogs are not a key market for the state, he added. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Lumber prices hit an all-time high in the  
first six months of 1999, followed by a precipitous decline that 
has the industry struggling to stabilize itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Many mills ran overtime earlier this summer to take advantage of  
a 35 percent price increase in Douglas fir lumber. Retail lumber 
costs soared, sticking homebuilders and buyers with unexpected 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a remarkable run-up in lumber prices,'' said Ron  
Parker, president of Hampton Affiliates, a lumber manufacturer in 
Portland, Ore. ``The higher lumber prices have been very welcome 
compared to 1998, which was a difficult year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roller coaster ride follows a slump last year caused by the  
Asian economic slowdown. Some mills went from temporary shutdowns 
in 1998 to running extra days this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Record home construction, a recovering Japanese market and less  
imported wood from Canada helped fuel the increase, said Butch 
Bernhardt Jr., a spokesman for the Portland-based Western Wood 
Products Association, which represents lumber manufacturers in 13 
Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	Early summer temperatures jump-started the summer construction  
season, pushing demand higher. With single-family housing starts at 
a 20-year high and mills at a lower production level, lumber prices 
skyrocketed, Bernhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market recently caught up with itself. About three weeks  
ago, prices dropped again as supply exceeded demand. The cost of 
1,000 board feet of Douglas fir 2x4s, for example, dropped from 
$505 in July to $405 now.

<HEADLINE> Gordon, Blundell Come From Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ohio (AP) -- Although Juan Montoya won Sunday's CART  
Miller Lite 200 by charging from eighth to first, bigger moves in 
terms of numbers were made by Greg Moore and Mark Blundell, the two 
drivers on the last row of the starting grid. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore started 25th and finished 11th. Blundell began the race  
26th and ended 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must have gained at least 10 positions during the pit  
stops,'' Moore said. ``It's great to come back from so far and 
score points in a race where there was so little attrition. It's 
unfortunate that we didn't have track position since it's a tough 
circuit to move up from the rear of the grid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell posted the third-fastest qualifying time, but had to  
start in last place because his car failed to pass technical 
inspection after qualification. It was his second race since 
fracturing a vertebra May 4 in testing at St. Louis and he wasn't 
sure before the race how his neck was going to hold up under the 
demands of the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real workout,'' he said. ``This circuit is one of the  
most physically demanding that we race on, and I knew today would 
be a challenge. I have to say I'm pretty exhausted. My neck was a 
lot more tired than it was after the Detroit race'' (last weekend). 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	OHIO DRIVERS DISAPPOINT: The day wasn't so good for two of the  
three drivers on CART's Ohio-based teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Papis of Team Rahal started ninth and finished fifth, but  
teammate Bryan Herta, who was second on the starting grid, had an 
engine problem six laps from the end and placed 21st. Tony Kanaan 
of McDonald's Championship Racing, located about a mile from the 
Rahal shop in the Columbus suburb of Hilliard, started fourth and 
finished 23rd. He left with a fuel system problem on the 58th lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``As they say, 'The engine just blowed up,' '' Herta said. ``The  
engine ran fine and then it was dead. I had no warning that it was 
going. That's kind of the way the season has gone for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herta and team owner Bobby Rahal acknowledged earlier this  
weekend that they may be parting ways at the end of the season 
after four years, and his finish Sunday wasn't one to add to his 
resume if he has to look for another ride at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not exactly sure what the problem is, but we ran out of  
fuel twice,'' Kanaan said. ``The car was working OK. We just had 
some tough luck today and that happens in racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PENSKE PROBLEMS: The struggles continue for Team Penske and Al  
Unser Jr. The team, still with the most victories in CART history 
by far, hasn't won a race since 1997 and will end its relationship 
with Unser at the end of the season, with Gil de Ferran and Moore 
replacing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser started his day one lap after the rest of the field and  
finished 25th after going off course in the 55th lap.

	GORDON SWITCH: Robby Gordon announced that he's buying an Eagle  
997 from Dan Gurney's All American Racers team and will drive it in 
the season's remaining oval events next Sunday at Chicago and Oct. 
31 at Fontana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third chassis Gordon has driven this season. He  
started the year in a Reynard and switched to a Swift after five 
starts. He will continue driving the Swift in the year's other four 
events and will continue running with a Toyota engine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing this not because I'm dissatisfied with Swift, but  
because I think the Eagle will give us a better chance on short 
ovals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This definitely opens up the door to closer cooperation (with  
Gurney) next year,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said Gurney also has loaned him some of All American's  
engineers for next weekend to help with the chassis transition.

	ANDRETTI DRIVES AGAIN: It seems as though you can't keep Mario  
Andretti off the track at Mid-Ohio, even after his retirement in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, he drove the course in a specially equipped  
championship car for an IMAX film. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, he was on the track with another former champion,  
Emerson Fittipaldi, to test a racer that will be used in the Cobra 
Challenge, a ``senior tour'' for retired drivers that will be run 
next year on six road courses and is sanctioned by the Sports Car 
Club of America.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Unites Religious Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For nearly a decade, the Episcopal church and  
the Jewish synagogue shared a sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two congregations in suburban Granada Hills had little  
in common, different religions worshipping on different days of the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, last week, a gunman's bullets changed all that: The  
Episcopal Church of Saint Andrew &AMP; Saint Charles and Temple Beth 
Torah became a safe haven for children escaping a shooting rampage 
at a Jewish community center. 
</P>
<P>
	``That man did more to hurt his cause than anything else he  
could have done. He brought us together, binding us forever in this 
community -- Jewish and Christian,'' said Marv Simmons, a parish 
administrator at the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a week after Buford O. Furrow Jr. allegedly fired 70  
bullets in the lobby of the North Valley Jewish Community Center, 
wounding five people, including three children attending a day 
camp, residents in the suburban Los Angeles community say a moment 
of hate has united two distinctly separate religious congregations. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, who surrendered to authorities in Las Vegas one day  
after Tuesday's shootings, also is accused of killing a mail 
carrier of Filipino descent, a Catholic whose funeral Mass on 
Saturday was attended by Rabbi Lawrence Goldmark, head of the Board 
of Rabbis of Southern California. Furrow reportedly targeted the 
mail carrier because he was nonwhite and a federal employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect the Granada Hills community won't ever be quite the  
same,'' said Rabbi E. Robert Kraus, who leads the temple 
congregation. ``We need to take advantage of this feeling of 
cooperation. ...There's always been a spirit of cooperation, but we 
have an opportunity to come together on a much more practical 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The San Fernando Valley -- home to a large share of Los Angeles'  
600,000 Jews -- is dotted with synagogues and churches. It has long 
been a suburban oasis of single family homes and private, religious 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the community has been touched by tragedy before -- the  
1994 Northridge earthquake claimed dozens of lives and left 
thousands homeless -- it's the first time anyone came remember an 
act of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was different. It wasn't an act of nature. This was pure  
evil,'' said Sue Ashbrook, who attends the Episcopal church. ``What 
was he thinking? He'd make it so we didn't like them? If anything, 
he failed. Instead of separating us, he brought us together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a way of honoring those who came to the rescue of the  
shooting victims, Jewish groups organized a community-wide event 
Sunday dubbed a ``Unity Rally,'' but the harmony was disrupted by 
two raucous hecklers opposed to Gov. Gray Davis' speech advocating 
gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men shouted and booed the Democrat, who last month  
signed laws restricting gun purchases to one per month and 
tightening a ban on assault weapons. He said after the community 
center shooting that he would push additional ``responsible'' 
gun-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second amendment is just as important,'' Irv Rubin of the  
Jewish Defense League yelled at Davis. Last weekend Rubin and 
thousands of other Aryan opponents successfully blocked a parade in 
the nation's capital by white supremacists, including Aryan Nations 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The hecklers handed out fliers to crowd members, including one  
woman who tore up the paper and threw it at Rubin's feet. ``Don't 
leave yourself unarmed against those who want to murder you,'' the 
flier read. ``Gun control laws are only observed by decent people 
and haters aren't decent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, who has denounced the attack and  
what she called ``our culture of violence,'' also addressed the 
outdoor rally attended by hundreds. Doctors, firefighters and 
police officers covered the lawn at the California State 
University, Northridge, where the crowd gave a standing ovation to 
the family of the slain mail carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of hatred were not entirely vanquished. Members of Temple  
Knesset Israel learned Saturday when they discovered a swastika and 
the words ``Jews die'' spray-painted on a wall at the entrance to 
their preschool. Police called the crime a ``copycat thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Hollywood-area temple's mailbox, police found a letter  
that appeared to be anti-British. Temple president Harvey Shield is 
British. Shield said he now plans to hire a security guard for holy 
days in September, and police plan to step up patrols in the Los 
Angeles neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the only remaining victim in the hospital was  
upgraded from critical to serious condition this weekend. 
Five-year-old Benjamin Kadish was attending the Jewish day camp 
when he suffered multiple gunshot wounds.

<HEADLINE> House-Hunting Clintons Visit N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE BROOK, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton and Hillary Rodham  
Clinton toured a home Sunday in this New York City suburb near the 
Connecticut line during a quick house-hunting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons, accompanied by daughter Chelsea and the first  
lady's mother, Dorothy Rodham, were expected to visit several 
Westchester County homes. The first had a low stone wall and a 
tree-shaded drive. Reporters were kept at a distance from the 
house, and no immediate information was available about the price. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons interrupted their planned weekend stay at Camp  
David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. Mrs. Clinton, 
considering a run for the U.S. Senate, must move to New York by 
Election Day 2000 to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	They flew on a small Air Force jet rather than the Boeing 747  
that usually serves as Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Mrs. Clinton looked at a seven-bedroom colonial house  
in Edgemont priced at $1.7 million. The White House did not say if 
that house was on their list Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The house, sheltered from the street by trees and rocky walls,  
is within walking distance of fashionable Scarsdale in southern 
Westchester County. The neighborhood is 22 miles north of Times 
Square and a half-hour by rail from Grand Central Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	The house would be less of a financial burden on the Clinton's  
than the $3.8 million estate the first lady viewed in June. The 
Clintons earned $504,109 last year.

<HEADLINE> Veteran N.J. Sports Writer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- Joe Calabrese, a sports writer and  
editor in New Jersey for the past 38 years, died Sunday following a 
long illness. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Calabrese spent the past 12 years covering Rutgers athletics for  
The Star-Ledger of Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of anyone who didn't like Joe, or enjoyed being  
around him,'' said Kevin Whitmer, an assistant managing editor at 
The Star-Ledger. ``He was a great storyteller and a tremendous 
influence on the lives and careers of so many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over the Rutgers beat, Calabrese insisted the  
state's largest newspaper provide better coverage of women's 
sports, which at the time was not a popular opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing about Joe was, he always did the right thing, or  
what he strongly believed was the right thing,'' said Theresa 
Grentz, the women's basketball coach at Illinois whom Calabrese 
covered when she coached the Rutgers women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Covering us was never a gender issue with Joe, he just saw  
student-athletes who played a game and deserved coverage,'' she 
added. ``It was that simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving a journalism degree from Rider, Calabrese began  
his career at The Courier-News in Plainfield in 1961. He also 
worked at the Somerset Messenger-Gazette and Trenton Times. In 
1978, he returned to The Courier-News, which had moved to 
Bridgewater, and was eventually named the sports editor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to see Joe interact with young sportswriters,'' said Joe  
Bakes, who worked with Calabrese at both The Star-Ledger and The 
Courier-News. ``He was always so supportive. He nurtured a whole 
generation of New Jersey sportswriters and editors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calabrese is survived by his wife, DonaLee, and two sons, Chris  
and Matthew. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements, which are being handled by the Branchburg  
Funeral Home, were expected to be finalized Monday.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Heads to His Stables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVEN VALLEYS, Pa. (AP) -- William Goodling can't get a moment's  
peace in his congressional office, what with telephone calls to 
return, hearings to oversee and votes to cast. 
</P>
<P>
	But minutes after the final gavel drops each week, the chairman  
of the House Education and Workforce Committee rushes home for some 
peace and quiet with the uncomplaining company of five stout mares 
and two offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no beepers, no buzzers and no pink cards in his pocket  
telling the Pennsylvania Republican where he ought to be each 
minute of the day. Away from the madhouse of Capitol Hill, Goodling 
finds therapeutic relief in the stables 90 miles west of 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the sun goes down, I enjoy dunging out the stalls,''  
Goodling said recently after feeding his horses, capping a week 
dominated by talk of tax cuts. ``Nobody bothers me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raising horses for racing is far from a lucrative business.  
Goodling said he barely breaks even after factoring in food, 
medical care and breeding services. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he enjoys taking care of his horses and tracking the  
offspring he sells. Occasionally, one of them wins a low-profile 
race in Pennsylvania or Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you only have five mares they become part of the  
family,'' he said. ``I have to follow them all the time. ... I look 
in the papers. I probably generally go to the editorial page first 
and then go to the sports page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back at his home and farm in Seven Valleys two hours after the  
last House vote, Goodling wet down two mares, a colt and a filly to 
keep them cool, then brought them into the stables to spray fly 
repellent and offer a feed mix of grain and molasses. 
</P>
<P>
	He then drove to nearby Jacobus to care for three other mares  
there, including one just injured from a brush with a fence. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a twice-daily routine when the 13-term lawmaker is not in  
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife does it when I'm not here,'' he said. ``When we go  
away, we have to get my niece in. My niece is a very active 
horsewoman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodling grew up with horses. His father owned one to help out  
with plowing and cultivating the family fruit farm. He got one for 
riding when he returned from Army service in 1948. In the 
mid-1980s, he bought his first horse for breeding -- one that was 
retiring from the racing circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came back from the service, unlike most people I wanted  
a horse rather than a car,'' he said. ``I'm a horse lover. It's a 
hobby for now, though if I'm ever successful it becomes a 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodling occasionally learns of tax and other issues affecting  
the thoroughbred industry, but he said he leaves the lobbying to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides owning the five mares and their offspring, Goodling has  
partial stakes in a pair of studs for breeding. He reported income 
of up to $50,000 from his horse operation last year, but those 
earnings are canceled out by expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They eat like horses,'' Goodling said. ``I'm closer to  
breaking even, but again that doesn't count the therapeutic value 
of my involvement. That can be worth a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Catcher Has 20-20 Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Just because Ivan Rodriguez passed a milestone,  
it doesn't mean that he's content. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Rodriguez became the first catcher in major league  
history to steal 20 bases and hit 20 homers in a season in the 
Texas Rangers' 8-7 loss to the White Sox. After he singled to lead 
off the third inning, Rodriguez stole second base and later scored 
on Juan Gonzalez's double. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (20 steals) is good, but I want to keep going and  
steal 30 bases,'' Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two American League catchers have stolen that many. Kansas  
City's John Wathan holds the record for most steals in a season 
with 36 in 1982. Chicago's Ray Schalk stole 30 in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always wanted to steal more bases,'' said Rodriguez, whose  
career-high had been nine thefts in 1998. ``So, I worked on my 
speed in the offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, 27, said the rigors of catching make the achievement  
that much more special. 
</P>
<P>
	``The position is hard on you every day,'' Rodriguez said. ``All  
the squatting, it's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 24 home runs are also a career-high, surpassing the 21 he  
hit in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez has started 102 games this year behind the plate, the  
most by any AL catcher.

	ALPINE, Calif. (AP) -- An arson fire that started in an abandoned  
Air Force radar building burned more than 3,000 acres of brush in 
steep terrain, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 410 firefighters, aided by water-dropping helicopters,

	``Fortunately, the weather is cooperating,'' Perkins said,  
noting temperatures in the 80s and weak winds.

	No injuries were reported and no homes were threatened, but 100  
campers and residents were evacuated after the fire broke out at 
12:29 a.m. Saturday in the Cleveland National Forest in eastern San

Sunday and spurred the evacuation of two nearby trailer parks.

<P>
	Two workers were injured when a pipeline broke at the Catalytica

<HEADLINE> Elvis Fans Hold Graveside Vigil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Sporting a brand new ``Return to Sender''  
tattoo just above her ``Elvis stamp'' tattoo, LaVera Chapel waited 
at the Graceland gates Sunday for a candlelight procession past 
Elvis Presley's grave. 
</P>
<P>
	The Candle Vigil, as it's called by the Presley faithful, is the  
highlight of Elvis Week, a series of memorials, dances and parties 
marking the anniversary of his death on Aug. 16, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Presley, who died at Graceland, his Memphis residence, is buried  
in a small garden beside the house's swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt I had to come,'' said Chapel, 45. ``I want to show  
my patronage to Elvis for all the good times he gave me, and I'm 
here to represent the fans who can't be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chapel said she has traveled from her home in White Lake, Mich.,  
11 times for the graveside vigil, and she has an Elvis tattoo to 
mark each occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Though her upper arms and shoulders are pretty well covered with  
Elvis artwork, she had no worry about running out of space for 
additional tattoos as the annual visits go on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I either get larger or they get smaller,'' she said with a  
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapel said she had been sitting in her folding chair at the  
gates to Graceland's long, winding driveway since 3:30 a.m. for the 
procession scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. A dozen of so others also 
staked out their spots early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fans milled around the sprawling museum and souvenir  
complex across Elvis Presley Boulevard from Graceland, shopping for 
trinkets and bopping to rock 'n' roll bands performing under two 
tents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dempseys, the three-man house band at Graceland's nightclub  
on Beale Street, Elvis Presley's Memphis, performed spirited 
renditions of the singer's early recordings for Sun Records and 
RCA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to play all of Elvis' songs, and we're not going  
to take a break,'' band member Joe Fick joked with the audience. 
``We're going to play them all at once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judy French, 52, and Dot Johnson, 56, said their Loving You,  
Elvis, Fan Club of Rolling Fork, Miss., continues to grow because 
of their trips to Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've met lots of people here who are now in the Rolling Fork  
fan club,'' French, whose hometown is too small to have a traffic 
light. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it's hard to explain to people who aren't Elvis fans  
why the faithful keep coming back to Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be an Elvis fan to understand. We love the man,''  
she said.

<HEADLINE> CIA Probes Cuban Link to Drug Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Situated between south Florida and the South  
American cocaine and heroin belt, Cuba's skies and extensive 
territorial waters have been handy transit points for drug 
traffickers. That link now has the attention of CIA investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressured by congressional critics of Cuban President Fidel  
Castro, the CIA will try to determine whether the United States was 
the ultimate destination of a shipment of cocaine that was 
scheduled to transit Cubans waters but instead was seized by 
Colombian police at the port of Cartagena last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has denied official involvement in any such activity.  
Indeed, Castro has declared his own war on drugs and has even 
invited the United States to join him in an anti-drug campaign so 
the two countries could become ``one of the greatest alliances 
against drug trafficking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to the Clinton administration's view, congressional  
critics say the evidence suggests an official Cuban role in 
supporting drug trafficking. They say Cuba qualifies under State 
Department criteria as a ``major'' drug transit country, citing the 
planned stop in Cuban waters of the abortive drug shipment in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation of that shipment was carried out in February by  
staff members from two congressional committees. Of particular 
interest to them was whether the final destination for the shipment 
was the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The staffers reported that a senior Drug Enforcement  
Administration official said ``in all likelihood the Dec. 3 
shipment of cocaine to Cuba was eventually meant to transit through 
Mexico and on to the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba says the shipment was earmarked for Spain. The State  
Department initially agreed but now is not so sure. Earlier this 
month, the department asked the CIA to ``conduct an all-source 
review of intelligence community and law enforcement community data 
to shed further light on the ultimate destination of this 
shipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A CIA finding that the shipment was intended to reach U.S.  
markets after passing through Cuban waters could lead to Cuba's 
placement on the ``majors'' list of drug-trafficking countries. 
Cuba would thus be subject, much like Colombia and Mexico, to a 
State Department evaluation on its anti-drug performance each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign for Cuba's inclusion on the list is being led by  
Reps. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House International 
Relations Committee; and Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House 
Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director, has  
acknowledged that traffickers have been making increased use of 
Cuban air space and territorial waters. But he noted that Cuba 
maintains it does not have the resources to patrol these large 
areas, especially its territorial waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no conclusive evidence to indicate that Cuban  
leadership is currently involved in this criminal activity,'' 
McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Castro's detractors object even to the limited U.S.-Cuban  
anti-drug cooperation currently in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said it is preposterous for  
the administration to give Castro credibility on the drug issue 
because she contends the Cuban leader is notorious for helping 
traffickers. A fellow Cuban-born lawmaker, Rep. Lincoln 
Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., joined in the objection. 
</P>
<P>
	Inclusion on the ``majors'' list of drug-trafficking countries  
could be a potential stigma for Cuba and be used against the 
communist regime by its U.S. enemies, many of whom suspect the 
administration is seeking normal relations with the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Being on the list, now numbering 28 countries, does not imply  
that the government in question is working in league with the 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries found not cooperating with U.S. anti-drug efforts are  
``decertified'' and can be subject to economic sanctions. This 
would not be a problem for Cuba since it already is under 
comprehensive sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all Andean countries plus Mexico are on the list. But  
as of the most recent State Department evaluation, all were 
``certified'' as fully cooperating with U.S. counternarcotics 
efforts.

<HEADLINE>  Athletics' Phillips Out for Season </HEADLINE>

	TORONTO (AP) -- Tony Phillips, who helped spark Oakland's run at  
the AL wild-card spot, broke his left leg sliding into second base 
Sunday and will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was trying to break up a double play during the  
Athletics' 9-5 win over Toronto when he broke the fibula in his 
lower leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``His cleat got stuck in the ground right when he went into his  
slide, and that was it,'' Oakland manager Art Howe said. ``Tony was 
really heating up, he was getting on base and he's been a leader 
for us all year so we're going to miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips went 2-for-2 with a two-run homer and a stolen base  
against the Blue Jays before being injured. He is hitting .244 with 
15 home runs and 49 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, 40, will undergo surgery on either Sunday night or  
Monday at a Toronto hospital. A screw will be placed in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Christenson and Jason MacDonald will replace Phillips in  
center field and in the leadoff spot.
