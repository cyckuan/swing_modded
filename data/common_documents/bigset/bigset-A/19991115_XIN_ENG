from Rome to Pristina, capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed on Friday morning, just before it was due to
land in Pristina.

CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Sunday held talks with his South Korean counterpart Hong
Soon-young on bilateral ties and regional issues of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Hong are expected to review the outcome of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's visit to South Korea last April and the
implementation of the agreements signed between the two countries,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers will seek ways of bolstering bilateral
relations in various fields, especially as regards economy, trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
Hong arrived in Cairo late Saturday on a four-day visit. He is
the first South Korean foreign minister to visit Egypt since the
two countries established diplomatic relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume stood at 590 million U.S. dollars between
Egypt and South Korea in 1997. South Korea has so far invested 160
million dollars in Egypt and has expressed readiness to invest
more in the North African country.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Hong will exchange views on a number of issues in
the Middle East, Asia, the Korean Peninsula and other regions,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations that the South Korean official may ask
Egypt to mediate between South Korea and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK). Egypt maintains traditional relations
with DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid met with
Hong and discussed with him regional issues of mutual interest and
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
After his trip in Egypt, Hong will attend a summit of the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe that will be
held on Thursday and Friday in Istanbul, Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Iran Signs Major Oil Contract with Shell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The National Iranian Oil
Company (NIOC) on Sunday signed a multi-million-U.S.-dollar
contract on buy-back scheme with the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell
to develop two offshore oil fields in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Shell will invest about 800 million dollars
for the implementation of the project concerning the Soroosh and
Nowrooz oil fields, which were severely damaged during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The repayment will start after the project comes on stream, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed in defiance to the 1996 U.S. Iran-Libya
Sanctions Act, which bans investment of more than 20 million
dollars by any third country in Iranian and Libyan energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The project includes complete development of two offshore
fields, including comprehensive studies and surveys of the
potential reservoirs, establishment of full production and
processing facilities at offshore location, establishment of the
centralized storage and export facilities in the Soroosh field
and drilling of a total of 29 wells.
</P>
<P>
The NIOC will take over the full responsibility of operation
immediately after completion of the development process, the
report said. The project will be implemented within 45 months of
the date the contract was signed.
</P>
<P>
The production will initially be started after 24 months at
the rate of 60,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the Soroosh field
and it will reach 190,000 bpd by the end of development process,
with 100,000 bpd from Soroosh field and 90,000 bpd from Nowrooz
field.

WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
left Sunday for Turkey to start his one-week tour of European
countries which also include Bulgaria, Greece, Italy and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The president will also tour the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
and meet the U.S. soldiers stationed there at the end of his
visit, which Belgrade objected.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 7.2 on the open-ended Richter shook the
Bolu region of northwestern Turkey Friday. However, Clinton's
planned arrival in Ankara at night was unchanged by the quake.
</P>
<P>
In Turkey, Clinton is expected to meet Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit with an aim to
increase Turkey's role as a pro-Western link to the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will also attend a summit of the Conference for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will travel to Greece on November 18 and 19. His stay
there will be shortened at the recommendation of the Greek
government because mass demonstrations against Clinton caused
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Washington is trying to persuade Greece and Turkey to settle
their disputes over the island of Cyprus, which was invaded and
divided by Turkey in 1974.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia is regrouping its units
and formation in east Chechnya, preparing for an offensive on
Grozny, while federal air raids on the capital of the breakaway
republic continued Sunday, said Russian media reports.
</P>
<P>
Following the liberation of Chechnya's second largest city of
Gudermes, "the federal forces are regrouping their units and
formation in the east of Chechnya, preparing for an offensive on
Grozny, when federal planes are following the movement of rebel
vehicles towards Georgia," said the press center of the federal
eastern grouping in the North Caucasus, cited by the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian aircraft flew about 70 sorties into Chechnya before
dusk Sunday, of which front-line Su-24 bombers and Su-25 fighters
made about 40 raids, said the Russian army headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Federal warplanes have intensified strikes on the Argun gorge
through which the rebels are moving towards Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The military said that struck most were rebels at the Chechen
third biggest town of Argun, at the district center of
Urus-Martan, at the village of Bamut as well as in the Argun
canyon.
</P>
<P>
Besides, army aviation backed up ground troops in Chechnya.
Mi-24 helicopter gun-ships took off more than 30 times to shell
the reinforced rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
The situation was relatively calm in the liberated areas
Saturday night and Sunday morning.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Papers Disclose Seoul's Longer-Range Missile Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. intelligence analysts
have discovered evidence that South Korea is trying to develop
longer-range ballistic missiles, the New York Times said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Pentagon analysts as saying that U.S. spy
satellite photos last year showed that South Korea had built a
rocket-motor test station without notifying the United States.
</P>
<P>
The station, which includes a large concrete or tempered steel
cradle in which rocket motors are locked for firing tests,
appeared to have been built secretly as part of a larger South
Korean ballistic missile program.
</P>
<P>
In April, South Korea conducted a short flight test of a new
missile that appeared to violate its agreements with the United
States, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's apparent efforts to develop a strategic capacity
of its own have raised the prospect of a regional arms race, the
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's missile ambitions prompted President Bill Clinton
to discuss the issue with President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea in
July, and Defense Secretary William Cohen also raised the issue
during a trip to South Korea later that month.
</P>
<P>
Although the Clinton administration showed its concern over
South Korea's missile program, it has signaled that Seoul can make
limited improvements on the range of its ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
Under a bilateral agreement, South Korea has restricted the
range of its missiles to around 110 miles (about 180 km). Now the
Clinton administration has told Seoul that it will accept an
increase in the range of its ballistic missiles to 180 miles
(about 300 km). But according to the U.S. officials, South Korea
appears to be developing missiles with ranges of 300 miles (about
480 km).
</P>
<P>
While expressing concerns over South Korea's missile program,
the United States showed some "understanding" and State Department
spokesman James Rubin has said that Washington was "sympathetic"
to Seoul's needs for a bit longer-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
That is in contrast to the U.S. attitude toward the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Washington has threatened more
severe containment and sanctions upon the DPRK if it conducts
missile launch tests.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Summons British Ambassador on Journalist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 14 (Xinhua) -- British Ambassador to Moscow
Andrew James Wood Sunday was summoned to the Russian Foreign
Ministry over an attack on Russian reporters in London, said
Russian diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The correspondents of the Russian TV stations ORT and NTV
Saturday were beaten in London by a group of local Islamic
extremists who had organized a rally in support of the Chechen
terrorists. Four journalists got severely injured.
</P>
<P>
The British ambassador was handed a note, which expresses
indignation over the attack on the Russian journalists.
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's talk, the Russian Foreign Ministry circulated a
communique which says, "the British ambassador was informed that
the Russian correspondents were attacked after they had made a
series of reports about intensive activity in Britain of Islamic
extremist groupings which are openly recruiting mercenaries and
raising funds for the Chechen rebels."
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry demanded that the British
authorities "immediately investigate this outrageous incident,
punish those guilty of it and ensure the protection of and normal
working conditions for the Russian journalists accredited in
Britain."
</P>
<P>
It also urged the British authorities to curb the activity of
organizations openly assisting the international terrorists who
are committing crimes in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the ministry had stated that this incident will not be
left without consequences, demanding official explanations from
the British authorities, as well as measures against those who
attacked the Russian reporters.

<TEXT>

HARARE, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Poverty and lack of dentists
have worsened the oral health situation in most parts of
sub-Saharan Africa, World Health Organization regional adviser
for oral health Samuel Thorpe said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Problems of tooth decay and gum diseases were on the rise in
most parts of the region, and severe tooth diseases like noma,
oral cancer were now critical in some parts of the region, Thorpe
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was urgent need to arrest the deteriorating
situation which was threatening the lives of many people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures was the training of dentists, he told the
Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the population ratio of dentists to patients was as
high as one to 200,000 in some parts of Africa.
</P>
<P>
There were 23 dental schools in 12 sub-Saharan African countries
which trained dentists in various disciplines.
</P>
<P>
"These have not been given enough focus. Training has to be
preventive- oriented than treatment," he said.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Formula Offers Early Government: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A coalition government will be
formed in Northern Ireland in two weeks if parties accept a peace
formula on offer at mediation talks, Ireland's national
broadcasting network RTE reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting "authoritative unionist sources," it said the powerful
pro-British Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) would be able to suspend
the government if Irish Republican Army guerrillas did not start
disarming by the end of December.
</P>
<P>
"RTE news has learned from authoritative unionist sources that
the new Northern Ireland Executive is to be formed in the next two
weeks provided the deal receives the endorsement of all the
pro-agreement parties," the network reported.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who supports
the peace pact, may gamble his political future by calling a
meeting of the party's 850-member policy-making council on
November 27 in a bid to get backing for the new formula.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator George Mitchell adjourned the talks last Friday
amid confusion and Sinn Fein claims that the unionists had
rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Unionists refuse to share power with Sinn Fein unless the IRA
starts to hand in arms -- a stance which they term "no guns, no
government."
</P>
<P>
A senior IRA figure would be appointed to liaise with the
province's "decommissioning commission" which is headed by former
Canadian General John de Chastelain, who would then "be able to
report that the process of decommissioning had started," it said.
</P>
<P>
The deal would also allow for the creation of new all-Ireland
political institutions, something which was mapped out in the 1998
Good Friday accord, to proceed without delay, RTE added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N.-imposed aviation
and financial sanctions against Afghanistan's biggest warring
faction Taliban entered into force Sunday for its failure to hand
over Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed by the U.N. Security Council on
October 15, 1999, the one-month deadline for compliance.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were approved unanimously by the Security
Council, requiring all states to ban arrivals or departures by
aircraft owned, leased or operated by or on behalf of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The only exceptions are humanitarian flights, including those
carrying religious pilgrims, authorized in advance by a sanctions
committee to be established by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
All states are also required to freeze funds and other
financial resources owned or controlled by Taliban, except for any
that the sanctions committee exempts on humanitarian ground.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden has been accused by the United States for plotting
the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year in
which at least 225 people were killed.

<HEADLINE> UAE-U.S. F-16 Deal Remains Mystery at Dubai Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Whether the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) and the United States will sign their long-delayed
8 billion-U.S.-dollar warplane deal during the five-day Dubai 2000
air show remained a mystery on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Martin, manufacturer of the F-16 Fighting Falcon
combat aircraft, said on the first day of the show that nothing
had been scheduled with the UAE side about signing the final
contract.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing to talk to representatives of the UAE
government," said a spokesman, refusing to give further details.
</P>
<P>
Other reliable U.S. sources, however, disclosed that the deal
might be signed next Tuesday, depending on the UAE government
giving their final blessing.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's order of 80 most advanced U.S. F-16 planes was
announced about 18 month ago. But it has been delayed mostly
because of the U.S. reluctance to give the UAE full control over
source codes and master keys for weapons systems for the planes.
</P>
<P>
In October, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said while
visiting the UAE that technicbe announced during this year's
Dubai air show.
</P>
<P>
Once the deal is inked, the UAE will have one of the world's
most advanced and capable fighters in the world, known as the
"F-16 Block 60."
</P>
<P>
The new F-16 will have an unrefueled interdiction radius of
630 nautical miles (about 1,167 kilometers) - approximately the
distance from Dubai or Abu Dhabi to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
It is designed for precision strike at night and in bad
weather, and to protect itself against surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's strategic goal is to make a substantial contribution
to a coalition response to aggression, most likely from Iran or
Iraq. A high-tech fighter force is the best way to do this, given
the UAE's small size and population, analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes over 176 Tons of Drugs in 7 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official said on
Sunday that over 176 tons of illicit drugs were seized in Iran
during the first seven months of the current Iranian calendar year
(starting March 21).
</P>
<P>
Director of an anti-drug research center Reza Sarami said that
the security and intelligence forces seized over 152 tons of
drugs, including 133 tons of opium, 10.5 tons of hashish, six tons
of morphine and 2.5 tons of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Some 24 percent of the drugs were seized in three eastern
provinces of Khorasan, Sistan-Baluchestan and Kerman, he said,
this was an indication of Iran's significant investments in the
eastern borders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iranian army also confiscated 24 tons of
various narcotics during the period, he said, quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sarami complained that the area under opium cultivation in
Afghanistan has increased by 43 percent this year and total
production of narcotics was 120 percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the European countries would render more
support to Iran in its combat against narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to combat drug trafficking, several
committees have been formed in the country in the areas of border
patrol, training, prevention, advertisements and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
However, Secretary of the anti-drug headquarters Mohammad
Fallah said earlier this month that Iran has seized 163 tons of
drugs since the beginning of the Iranian calendar year.
</P>
<P>
He said 130,000 people were arrested in connection with drug
issues in the same period while the country lost 125 soldiers in
fighting with drug traffickers in the seven months.
</P>
<P>
Iran started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the
Majlis, or parliament. passed an anti-drug law authorizing
capital punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Fallah said last month that the country spends over 8,000
billion rials (about 2.67 billion U.S. dollars) annually on
fighting drug trafficking.

<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth
Heads of Government Meeting adopted a Declaration on Globalization
and People- Centered Development on Sunday, stressing that the
benefit of globalization should be shared equally.
</P>
<P>
The 47 heads of government attending the Commonwealth summit
concluded the declaration during their traditional retreat in
Fancourt Estate of George Resort some 1,000 kilometers away from
the summit venue in Durban.
</P>
<P>
The document is also called "Fancourt Commonwealth
Declaration". The declaration said: "Despite the positive side,
the benefits of globalizaiton are not shared equitably,
prosperity remains the preserve of the few."
</P>
<P>
"The persistence of poverty and human deprivation diminishes us
all. It also makes global peace and security fragile, limits the
growth of markets, and forces million to migrate in search of a
better life," it said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said: "The greatest challenge facing us today
is how to channel the forces of globalization for the elimination
of poverty and the empowerment of human beings to lead fulfilling
lives."
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth leaders said that expanded capital flows have
also brought with them the risk of greater financial instability,
undermining the hope that a commitment to open markets can lift
the developing world, especially the least developed countries out
of poverty and debt.

<HEADLINE> Israel Postpones Next Troop Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's second-stage troops
withdrawal from the West Bank will not take place as scheduled
Monday, said a senior Palestinian official Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat met in Jerusalem
Sunday evening with his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran, but they
failed to iron out the differences over which areas Israel has to
hand over, said the official, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand retrieving some populated Arab areas
east of the West Bank city of Hebron, but which were not included
in the map prepared by Israel of the targeted lands for incoming
transfer, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are scheduled to discuss the issue in the next
few days, but it is not clear whether the Israeli side will change
its mind, the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Erekat had held several meetings over the past few days with
Eran to solve this issue, but failed.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed early September,
Israel should transfer 5 percent of the West Bank land to the
Palestinians Monday, with 3 percent from full Israeli control,
Area C, to jointly-ruled Area B, and 2 percent from Area B to
fully-Palestinian-controlled Area A.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved the redeployment map on Wednesday,
but Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat refused to sign the map,
asking why some populated Arab areas east of Hebron were not
included in the map.
</P>
<P>
Israel transferred 7 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians during the first withdrawal on September 10.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Willing to Mediate Between Two Koreas: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Sunday expressed his country's willingness to mediate
between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Seoul last April, President Hosni Mubarak
voiced readiness to help mediate a peace agreement between the two
Koreas, Moussa told reporters after talks with visiting South Korean
Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young.
</P>
<P>
But Moussa conditioned the mediation on a formal request made
by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak "is still interested in this issue," Moussa said. But
he stressed that Egypt "will not take a step" until after the two
sides express desire for this.
</P>
<P>
Egypt maintains traditional relations with DPRK and has also
set up close ties with South Korea since establishing diplomatic
relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the foreign ministers dealt with regional issues
in the Middle East and East Asia, and bilateral economic relations
and steps taken so far in implementing the agreements reached
during Mubarak's April visit.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean minister said his country sees Egypt as an
important partner in the Middle East and that his current visit is
aimed at sustaining dialog and constructive consultations.
</P>
<P>
Hong lauded Egypt's opening up to foreign investments, a move
he said would promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Hong witnessed the signing of two agreements between
Egypt and South Korea, the first on the peaceful use of nuclear
power and the second, a protocol on cooperation between diplomatic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Hong arrived in Cairo on Saturday for a four-day visit. He is
the first South Korean foreign minister to visit Egypt since the
establishment of the diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume stood at 590 million U.S. dollars in 1997
between Egypt and South Korea, which has so far invested 160
million dollars in the North African country.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
named Prime Minister Vladimir Putin the best candidate for the
next Russian president Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Putin, Yeltsin said that with each day he
becomes more and more confident that Putin's candidacy for head of
state in the 2000 general elections "is the only option for
Russia."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin stressed that no one but the current prime minister,
"can, being president, lead Russia, which will not turn off its
way."
</P>
<P>
"Just look at his efficiency, analyze his actions. How logic,
clever, and strong they are from the view point of intellect,
will, and analysis," said the president, whose pre-recorded
statement was televised on the RTR Zerkalo of Mirror program
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, my support for his (Putin's) candidacy was
and is, and what is more, remains, and my confidence mounts with
each day," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He is pleased that Putin's recognition as prime minister is
rising, and the level of this recognition, "if not equals the
president's so far, stands close to it."
</P>
<P>
"I am glad that my forecasts, my proposal, his agreement to run
for president of the Russian Federation at the elections on June
4, 2000 are coming true well," said Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> Dialog Among Civilizations Universal Concept: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official stated here on
Sunday that dialog among civilizations initiated by Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami does not only belongs to Iran, but a
universal concept.
</P>
<P>
Giandomenico Picco, the personal representative of the U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, said at a press conference that many
governments have announced their support, even financial
assistance for the dialog since his appointment in August.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the U.N. General Assembly to designate the
year 2001 as "the year of dialog among civilizations" indicated
that the idea is much close to that of the U.N. and the
international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Picco underlined that universality and diversity are two
concepts of dialog among civilizations, saying that the most
important step which has to be taken is to encourage governments
or members of the U.N. to focus on the two concepts.
</P>
<P>
Dividing civilizations in the world into two groups, one seeing
diversity as a threat and the other as an enrichment and growth,
he said "dialog is an exchange of ideas, we should welcome any
good ideas from any sides. There is no teacher in dialog among
civilizations."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official also rejected the suggestion that the dialog
would be confined to dialog between Islam and Christianity, or
eastern and western civilizations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.N. specific steps to carry out the
initiative of dialog, he said that he has made some proposals to
Annan and the U.N. would announce detailed steps.
</P>
<P>
Asked about obstacles to the dialog, Picco said that obstacles
are probably coming from those who fear growth and change.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had already met and conferred with President
Khatami, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and a number of other
officials on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. cannot settle the world problems only
with money regardless of difference in cultures and religions of
the nations.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the objective of dialog among civilizations
is to reach mutual understanding among the cultures and voiced
Iran's readiness to cooperate with the U.N. in this respect.

<HEADLINE> Talks between Cyprus' Two Divisions to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
accepted an invitation from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
attend "proximity talks" in New York on December 3 with Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has also accepted the
invitation for the talks, to be held under the auspices of the
U.N., reported the Cyprus News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, who is currently in Durban,
South Africa, for the Commonwealth Heads of Government
Meeting, accepted Annan's oral invitation, CNA said.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks will lead to direct negotiations between
the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Direct negotiations between the two sides have not been held in
the past two years because of preconditions set by the Turkish
side for the recognition of the breakaway state in northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Sunday in New York, Annan welcomed the
acceptance by the two sides for proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders in Cyprus have criticized the U.N. for asking
for an immediate response and not allowing time for
consultations.

<HEADLINE> Barclays Bank To Close 200 Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Barclays Bank, one of the
biggest commercial banks in Britain, is planning to close up to
200 branches next year in a dramatic acceleration of its cost
cutting campaign.
</P>
<P>
The bank is thought likely to start closing the branches in the
spring although details of the exact number and their locations
have yet to be completed.
</P>
<P>
BBC quoted a spokesman from the bank Sunday as saying that the
closures would be part of a larger program of refocusing the
group.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the move is first evidence that Mathew Barrett,
who took over as chief executive in October, is determined to step
up the the pace of cost cutting.
</P>
<P>
Barclays has a network of 1,900 branches, the second largest
after Lloyds TSB. But it has been slower to slash branches than
many rivals.
</P>
<P>
While some 4,000 branches have disappeared from Britain's high
streets since 1990, Barclays has closed about 150.
</P>
<P>
Barclays has the largest internet banking business with over
400,000 regular users and more than 5,000 customers signing up
each week.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that the closures by Barclays will lead to
cost savings of more than 20 million pounds a year since many of
the branches will be small, local offices.

<HEADLINE> German Mediator Urges More Compensation For Nazi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The German government and
business must raise their offer to compensate the Nazi slave labor
victims to avoid a deadlock of negotiations in the coming round,
Germany's top mediator Otto Graf Lambsdorff said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lambsdorff told the ZDF television, "If we stick to the 6
billion mark offer just like the previous round, it is clear that
the negotiations will fail."
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot give a better offer, things will be complicated,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a chance -- but only one chance," stressed
Lambsdorff.
</P>
<P>
Germany has offered a fund of 6 billion marks, 4 billion from
the business and 2 billion from the government, in earlier
negotiations. But victims' lawyers rejected the offer as
"insufficient."
</P>
<P>
The German side is talking about raising the offer by 2 billion
marks, 1 billion from the government and the business each,
Lambsdorff said.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Germany and victims' lawyers are scheduled to
begin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, Lambsdorff criticized German business for
unwillingness to raise its offer. The group of about 30 German
companies has not yet accepted the government's initiative to
raise its contribution by 1 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
"The enterprises will face public mental problems if they do
not give a better offer," he told the Focus news weekly.
</P>
<P>
"We would stand better only if the new offer -- that's really
our last one -- were rejected," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Central Bank Governor Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Israel Governor
Jacob Frenkel announced Sunday night that he would resign early
next year, a move seen by some as being taken over his dispute
with the government on the economic policy.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference also attended by Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, Frenkel said he would
step down on January 2, 2000, about 18 months before the end of
his second five-year term, because he had achieved his major goals.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel defended his tight monetary policy adopted during his
latest term, citing the record low inflation rate, which some
experts predicted would end up under 3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The government set a target inflation rate of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although Frenkel's confidants at the Bank of Israel said there
was nothing personal in his decision, it is a known fact that the
governor has been at odds with the Finance Ministry over his
monetary policy since the new government of Barak was formed in
July.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel has angered the treasury and entrepreneurs by keeping
a high interest rate in order to slash the inflation.
Industrialists have urged him to lower the rate, which would
encourage investment, to stimulate the economy after a three-year
recession.
</P>
<P>
Barak has also been criticized for failing to keep his promise
to curb unemployment, which stands at 8.6 percent, and stir up the
growth.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate stands at 11 percent after a 0.5 percentage
cut in August.
</P>
<P>
Barak said at the news conference that he also supports a
tight monetary policy, but stressed that the policy must provide
a basis for "a renewed growth in our economy."
</P>
<P>
The impact of Frenkel's resignation on the market would to a
large extent depend on how quickly Barak would appoint a
successor to Frenkel, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Barak and Shohat have already begun
the search for a successor. One of the candidates is Aharon Fogel,
a former Treasury director-general, the report said.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Send Aid to Chechen Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Red Crescent Society
(RCS) of the United Arab Emirates will deliver immediate aid to
Chechen refugees fleeing to the Chechen-Ingushetia boders in the
ongoing war in the Russian republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed
Al Nahyan, who is also president of the RCS, ordered the assistance
on Sunday, the official WAM news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The RCS has received reports and appeals for help from a
number of international organizations calling for immediate aid
for the refugees to help alleviate their sufferings, which have
been made worse by the harsh weather conditions, Khalifa Nasser Al
Suweidi, board chairman of the RCS, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the RCS will soon airlift the relief, including
foodstuffs, clothings, blankets and other necessary items for the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Russian forces have been at war with rebel Chechnya since
October. The military operations are intended to crush militants
who twice invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan and were
responsible for apartment bombings that killed about 300 people in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has sent special envoys to the UAE and
other major Islamic countries to explain its operations in
Chechnya, where most of the residents are Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Calls for Poverty Eradication, Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth
leaders called for debt relief for poor countries and concerted
global action against poverty on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said in a declaration that the greatest challenge
facing the world was channelling the forces of globalization to
eliminate poverty and empower human beings to lead fulfilling
lives.
</P>
<P>
"The persistence of poverty and human deprivation diminishes us
all," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"It also makes global peace and security fragile, limits the
growth of markets, and forces millions to migrate in search of a
better life. It constitutes a deep and fundamental structural flaw
in the world economy," it said.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 54 member states of the Commonwealth -- all in
Africa -- are among the 41 states listed by the World Bank as
heavily indebted poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, read out to the media by the organization's
outgoing secretary general Emeka Anyaoku, said the benefits of
globalization were not being shared equitably, and the poor were
being marginalized.
</P>
<P>
It called on all countries to implement commitments made during
the Uruguay round of World Trade Organization negotiations to
dismantle trade barriers, and said the next round should have a
pronounced focus on development.
</P>
<P>
"We also call on the global community to... urgently initiate
reform of international financial architecture to minimize
financial instability and its impact on the poor.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the elimination of poverty is achievable --
but only if we take determined and concerted action at national
and international levels," the document said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that good governance was "key to the expansion of
human capabilities", and that the leaders reaffirmed their
commitment to the pursuit of greater transparency, accountability,
the rule of law and eliminating corruption in government and the
private sector.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Mannesmann Organizes Itself Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Mannesmann AG, Germany's largest
mobile phone service provider, is working on its defense strategy
to avoid a possible hostile take-over by British Vodafone
Airtouch, a company spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for everything that could happen. That is our
duty," said Manfred Sohnlein, spokesman for Mannesmann said at the
company's headquarters in Dueselldorff.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman refused to comment on a report in Saturday's New
York Times that said Vodafone Airtouch would offer 117 billion
U.S. dollars (220 billion marks) to acquire Mannesmann this
Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the world's second largest corporate take-over
action behind the 130-billion-dollar acquisition of Sprint by MCI
Worldcom (both in the U.S.)
</P>
<P>
But if the Mannesmann executive rejects this offer, Vodafone
Airthouch will prepare a hostile take-over, the report said.
</P>
<P>
That means the British firm will buy Mannesmann stocks in the
open market to achieve a majority in stake.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper said the hostile take-over
plan would be rejected by influential fonds since the stock price
of the Mannesmann was "extraordinary high" and the company had
"many measures" to protect itself. The market price of the
Mannesmann stocks grew to 140 billion marks Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone Airtouch, the largest mobile network connector in
Britain, had been a long-year cooperator with Mannesmann. But the
cooperation has become competition after Mannesmann offered 66 the
billion marks earlier this month to take over the Orange PLC,
third largest British mobile phone service provider.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Mannesmann would surely be decomposed if the
only in its mobile phone unit, the D2 network.
</P>
<P>
The German government was also against the take-over.
Politicians in the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) said
Germany would lose thousands of jobs if Mannesmann were taken over
by Vodafone Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
"The politicians should not sit in sofa and let this operation
go uncontrolled," Rudolf Dressler, an SPD parliamentary fraction
leader, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. He demanded that
international anti-trust authorities intervene in the acquisition.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Peace Deal Within Reach: Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Irish republicans said Sunday
that a deal to revive Northern Ireland's stalled peace process was
within reach.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully tomorrow we will see, I believe, both sides have
crossed the Rubicon," Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political ally, told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks chaired by U.S. mediator George Mitchell, which
have already lasted 10 weeks, are to resume Monday.
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin said Sinn Fein had outlined its position in great
detail to Ulster Unionist Party leaders who were relaying it to
their members over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"There will be decisions made tomorrow and hopefully it will be
positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ken Maginnis, senior negotiator for the UUP, said Sinn Fein had
to signal that "the war is over" for progress to be made.
</P>
<P>
"There is no good in saying the guns are silent. We've had
silent guns before. They have reawakened with a tremendous clatter
and people died," he said.
</P>
<P>
Maginnis hinted that his party was willing to back off its
long-standing demand that the IRA hand in or "decommission" the
weapons it used to wage a 30-year guerrilla war against British
rule before Sinn Fein could sit in a planned coalition cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair told Sky Television from South
Africa, "I think it is a very, very critical and important
moment.... I just hope that we can make every effort in the next
few days to bring it all together."
</P>
<P>
A rescue package for the deadlocked peace process, kept tightly
under wraps, is thought to contain a series of step-by-step
gestures by all sides.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers reported over the weekend that a deal brokered by
Mitchell involved some scrapping of arms within eight weeks of the
establishment of an executive.
</P>
<P>
Another proposal is said to be that the IRA would appoint a
member to liaise with the province's disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted a report of Glasgow's Sunday Herald newspaper as
outlining five key elements for disarmament:
</P>
<P>
-- An IRA statement supporting the Sinn Fein leadership and
announcing a go-between to liaise with Canadian General John de
Chastelain, who is overseeing the decommissioning process;
</P>
<P>
-- A Sinn Fein statement condemning all political violence and
accepting that peace cannot be achieved without disarmament;
</P>
<P>
-- Nomination of proposed ministers in early December;
</P>
<P>
-- A report from de Chastelain early in the new year confirming
the IRA had appointed a negotiator and agreement on how
disarmament would be carried out;
</P>
<P>
-- A second report by the general in late January stating that
disarmament had begun.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Targets Tyson After Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- British boxer Lennox Lewis
targeted Mike Tyson as his next opponent in the new millennium
after becoming Britain's first undisputed world champion of the
century on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was too early and mentally draining for the Lewis camp after
the historic defeat of Evander Holyfield to even contemplate a
showdown with Tyson who, in any case, must get his own act back in
good working order.
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of Lewis-Tyson was an inescapable conclusion
following the Briton's unanimous points victory at the Thomas and
Mack Center, eight long months after the Madison Square Garden
draw controversy.
</P>
<P>
It emerged as the richest and most appealing fight available
once the WBA and IBF warrior Holyfield had been vanfully we can
get the fight made. Boy, yes I'd welcome the chance to box Tyson.
I'd definitely fight him," said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, for his part, could be fighting in Cardiff or Germany in
mid-January and then has a date planned with Lewis-victim Shannon
Briggs in late February.
</P>
<P>
Rising American star Michael Grant and WBO champion Vitaly
Klitschko are other options now that Lewis has settled his
unfinished business with Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
Lewis took the verdict clearly, thought ringside opinion made
the re-match closer than the Nevada officials. Judge Jerry Roth
carded 115-113, Chuck Giampa 116-112 and Bob Graham 117-111, which
gave Lewis no cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
His 6,000 supporters though were rarely in full voice as they
had been in New York in March, with Holyfield raising his game and
landing some solid shots on the new triple champion's features.
</P>
<P>
"This time around was different because Evander was doing
different things," added Lewis. "He was trying to steal the rounds,
not doing much at the beginning but more at the end."

<HEADLINE> Scholes Vows to Win for the Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- England's two-goal hero Paul
Scholes has revealed the squad's determination in the squad to
transfer trophy success at club level onto the international stage.
</P>
<P>
And the Manchester United star, whose double blast against
Scotland has taken England to the verge of the Euro 2OOO finals,
hit out at critics who claim players are more interested in
playing for club than country.
</P>
<P>
Scholes and Old Trafford team-mates like David Beckham, Andy
Cole and Phil Neville have a cabinet full of honours along with
the Arsenal contingent of Tony Adams, David Seaman and Martin
Keown.
</P>
<P>
But for everyone in the squad the cupboard is bare in terms of
England medals after the agony of losing out on Euro '96 in a semi-
final penalty shoot-out against Germany at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
Now Scholes want to put that right next summer - always
assuming they kill off the Scots challenge in the second leg of
the play-off at Wembley on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scholes said: "There is a void in terms of England not having
won a lot for a while whereas a lot of the lads in the club have
tasted a lot of success with their clubs.
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep going but it would be nice to win something
for the nation as well - that's something we want to put right.
</P>
<P>
"We are not taking anything for granted with Scotland. It is
only half-time and there is still a long way to go in the tie. We
have to reproduce the same sort of performance at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
"But getting to Euro 2000 would be a great experience for us
and if we do get there hopefully we will have a chance of winning
the competition. Playing for our country does mean a lot to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
"It's not true to say that players don't feel as much for their
country as they do for their club. Everyone gives 100% when they
go out and play for England."

<HEADLINE> Keegan Urges Restraint from Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- England football team manager
Kevin Keegan has made a direct appeal to England fans ahead of
Wednesday's game against Scotland at Wembley not to respond in
kind to the deafening booing of the national anthem at Hampden
Park.
</P>
<P>
The cacophony of boos and jeers which rung around Hampden
rendered it impossible to even hear the tune or the words sung by
the England team and more than 5,000 visiting supporters.
</P>
<P>
Given that it was the British national anthem being played -
not the English national anthem, as the match programme stated -
the reaction of the Scottish fans has led to criticism in several
quarters following the game.
</P>
<P>
Keegan himself would not publicly be drawn beyond expressing
his "disappointment" at the amount of booing, which was the
loudest that many observers had ever heard inside a sporting arena
during a national anthem.
</P>
<P>
The England coach routinely issues an appeal immediately before
matches at Wembley over the public address system for the visiting
team's anthem to be respected by home supporters - with only a
certain measure of success.
</P>
<P>
But on this occasion he felt the need to issue a public
statement three days before the game urging restraint from England
fans to ensure the Scottish players are not given any extra
inspiration to overturn the 2-0 deficit from the first leg.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "While we were all disappointed by the national
anthem being booed on Saturday, it did help make our players even
more determined.
</P>
<P>
"So before anyone thinks about booing Flower of Scotland on
Wednesday night, just think what it may do to their players.
Please make yourself heard cheering on England rather than
inspiring Scotland's players."

<HEADLINE> Business Circles in Guangdong Hail Sino-US WTO Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The business circles in
south China's Guangdong Province today welcomed the Sino-U.S.
agreement on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Businessmen in the province, whose foreign trade makes up 40
percent of the country's total, expressed their satisfaction after
learning the news of the agreement, saying that it will accelerate
the process of China's WTO accession and will more closely connect
China and the world economy.
</P>
<P>
At the forefront of China's reform and opening up, Guangdong
has maintained a high growth rate in the past two decades.
Currently, the province has more than 60,000 foreign-invested
enterprises and its foreign trade value reached 130 billion U.S.
dollars last year. The province's gross domestic product (GDP)
accounted for 10 percent of China's.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only an opportunity but also a challenge for China
to enter the WTO, and we have to increase our competitiveness,"
said Shi Yilun, general manager of Guangdong Food Import and
Export Group.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhiyong, manager of the overseas marketing department of
the Guangdong Kelong Group, said that it's not such a bad idea to
let foreign companies and products to enter China's market.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be afraid to face market competition," Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
The household appliance group achieved a 30 percent annual
growth rate in fierce market competition over the past 15 years. "
We realized that competition will help us gain more success,"
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
For Huang Peilian, general manager of the Zhuhai Lizhu
Pharmaceutical Group Ltd. Com., the entry into WTO is a test of
the company's technology, management and marketing expertise. "We
can learn a lot from foreign firms in competition," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhuoyun, a well-known economist in the province, theorized
that China's entry into WTO will have a different impact on
different industries. The capital-intensive industries will be
affected more than labor-intensive ones.
</P>
<P>
China's telecom and financial industries, the most influenced
by today's development, must adjust their management policies and
improve service quality. And the country's agricultural policies
should also be regulated to promote agricultural technology
development and increase competitiveness in the sector, said the
economist.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Adopts Policy Document on EU Ties With Macau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday that it has adopted a policy document on relations between
the European Union (EU) and Macau.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said the EU, as one of Macau's major
international partners, has a key role to play in contributing to
the territory's smooth return to China on December 20, 1999, and
to "a stable, prosperous development of the territory thereafter".
</P>
<P>
The policy document develops the idea that the key to Macau's
future stability lies in the "one country, two systems" policy,
the commission said, adding it proposes to strengthen EU-Macau
economic relations, notably by encouraging EU companies to invest
in the territory.
</P>
<P>
It noted the existing bilateral EU-Macau trade and cooperation
agreement should be continued and supported the accreditation of a
Trade and Economic Office of Macau to the EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Co-ordinator for Afghanistan Monday expressed its "extreme
concern" over the destruction of U.N. property during recent
demonstrations in Afghanistan by Protesters who were angry at the
sanctions imposed on the country by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the Office of the U.N.
Co-ordinator for Afghanistan, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) office in Farah of southwestern Afghanistan was
attacked by the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
U.N. offices in Kandahar, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kabul, Herat and
Jalalabad and other locations have also been attacked. In some
areas, offices have been forcibly entered and vehicles and
equipment damaged.
</P>
<P>
However, no U.N. staff have been injured in these attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban provided guards and police to U.N. offices, but
they proved powerless against such large crowds," said Erick de
Mul, U.N. Co-ordinator for Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, we believe that the authorities are not doing enough
to discourage these demonstrations in the first place," he added.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Taliban to support and protect U.N. premises
and staff, who work to provide much needed humanitarian assistance
to poor and vulnerable Afghans.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has protested to the Taliban and has
requested the militia to respect existing security agreement, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic and financial sanctions were imposed on Afghanistan
Sunday after the Taliban failed to hand over the suspected
terrorist Osama bin Laden for trial, but U.N. humanitarian
activities will continue in the war-ravaged country.

<P>
SINGAPORE, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Share prices surged up to
new record high on Singapore Stock Market Monday fueled by another
record close on Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Time Index (STI) jumped up 40.09 points
to end at 2,225.91 points, piercing through previous record close
of 2,222.45 points on July 2.
</P>
<P>
The volume totaled 489.84 million units worth 810.46 million
Singapore dollars (about 486.25 million U.S. dollars) with rising
issues outpacing decliners by 282 to 54 and the remaining 116
counters staying unchanged.
</P>
<P>
AsiaDeckor topped the actives chart of the day registering a
turnover of 126.92 million units. AFP was the second most
heavily- traded stock with 51.83 million done. Eagle was the next
with 30.27 million counters changing hands.

electronics counters, which were swept along by the U.S. high-tech

DHAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was shot to
dead and 10 others received bullet injuries on Monday in the
by-election to parliament in northwestern Bangladesh's Tangail
district, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Bangladesh Rifles and police opened fire to
disperse supporters of rival candidates in the Tangail-8
constituency, about 80 kilometers northwest of here, with at least
one killed and 10 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Polling in four out of 82 polling centers were suspended by the
Election Commission due to violence and alleged rigging, the
reports said. Thirty-six centers were declared "most vulnerable"
and the rest were identified as "vulnerable" by the Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The voting started at 8 a.m. and ended at 4 p.m., and the
results would be announced later Monday night. Independent
candidate Abdul Kader Siddiqui was leading in one poling center,
the official BSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 candidates contested for the parliament seat, but
the fight was mainly between ruling Awami League (AL) candidate
Shawkat Momen Shahjahan and independent candidate Abdul Kader
Siddiqui, an expelled AL leader.
</P>
<P>
Kader Siddiqui was leading in one poling center, the official
BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The seat fell vacant on August 29 when Kader Siddiqui resigned
from the 330-seat parliament after he was dispelled from the party
for "violating party discipline."
</P>
<P>
Major opposition parties, such as the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP), the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jatiya Party, boycotted
the election.
</P>
<P>
A record of 151 magistrates were sent to the constituency and a
3,500-strong force comprising the police, the Army and the
Bangladesh Rifles (border forces) were deployed in the
constituency to ensure security during the polling hours.

COLOMBO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition

for its leader and presidential candidate Ranil Wickremesinghe
after an explosion at a rally on Sunday.
</P>

Addressing a press conference here, UNP general secretary

<HEADLINE> Win-Win Results After Arduous Negotiations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Today marked the end of the
marathon negotiations between China and the United States for
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, China's minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
signed a bilateral agreement on China's accession to the WTO on
behalf of their respective governments this afternoon, removing
key barriers for China to join this largest global trade system.
</P>
<P>
Even though the stubborn negotiators today raised champagne
glasses and exchanged toasts, few could forget the difficulties
they encountered during scores of rounds of negotiations over the
past 13 years, which sometimes seemed headed for a dead end.
</P>
<P>
On July 10, 1986, Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations
organizations in Geneva Qian Jiadong issued an application to
resume China's status as a signatory member of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), later transformed to be the
WTO. Little did he know he had started what would become 13 years
of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
After a dozen bilateral consultations between China and major
signatory members between 1986 and 1989, China reached compromises
with these countries on core issues for China's reentry into the
GATT. A draft paper on China's accession was nearly ready for
release.

<P>
However, the situation took a downward slide from 1989 to 1992,
when the U.S. and other Western powers imposed economic sanctions
against China, one of which stressed blocking China out of the
GATT. Bilateral consultations and multi-lateral negotiations were
virtually deadlocked during the period.
</P>
<P>
Not until February of 1992 did China restart talks. The ensuing
three and a half years were said to be a key period for deciding
China's rights and obligations in the global trade system.
</P>
<P>
China in the same period scored marked economic growth and set
the goals to establish a market economy and modern enterprise
system. The prosperous economy should have provided the
opportunity for China to reenter the GATT. Major signatory parties,
nevertheless, decided to gradually increase their offers
regardless of China's economic development level.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations sank into a vicious circle that turned out to
be never-ending for China.
</P>
<P>
Starting from November 1995, China's GATT reentry negotiations
were transformed into talks on its accession into the WTO. Even
though China made major compromises, the final results were still
colored with uncertainty due to the irrational requirements of the
U.S. and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
During Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's trip to the U.S. last April,
China-U.S. negotiations scored substantial progress. Even so, the
impractical offer asked by the U.S. side still impeded the inking
of an agreement.

BRUSSELS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
start talks with China soon on its access to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) after the United States and China signed an
agreement earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Gooch, spokesman of the European Commission, said that
the European executive body will review the Sino-U.S. deal and
make further response later.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sino-U.S. agreement is a breaking news for EU, and
the European Commission is now contacting all parties concerned to

</P>
<P>
He described the agreement as a very important move, which will
be conducive to the strengthening of the world's multilateral

</P>
<P>
Gooch told reporters that the coming talks between EU and China
will merely focus on the bilateral trade differences since about
80 percent of the content in the Sino-U.S. talks is similar to EU'
s demand over the trade issue.
</P>
<P>
He said EU will start talks with China on the basis of the Sino-
U.S. accord. EU and China are differing in the fields of banking,
services, industrial tariff, insurance and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Gooch also stressed that EU has been always supporting China's

GENEVA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Director-general of the World

accord on China's accession to WTO, calling the bilateral
agreement a significant step.

"This is a major step forward in China's accession to the WTO,"

However, the WTO chief cautioned that substantial work remains
before China becomes a full member of the organization, which now

"China must still reach agreement with other member governments
and we need to complete important technical talks before China can
take her rightful place at the table of great trading nations," he
said.

"But this significant breakthrough has certainly given this
process real momentum," Moore said, adding, "a door to history has

<P>
Before the start of the just-ended negotiations, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton talked on
the telephone on November 7, deciding to accelerate the pace of
the negotiations so that a mutually-beneficial agreement could be
reached.
</P>
<P>
The agenda for the negotiations continued past the originally
scheduled two days because knotty problems over certain key issues
could not be properly resolved. The talks ultimately lasted six
successive days and nights.
</P>
<P>
Again, under the close attention paid by top leaders between
the two countries and in line with the spirit of mutual
understanding, mutual compromise and equal consultation, the two
sides eventually reached an agreement that is satisfactory to both.
</P>
<P>
As the press release issued after the signing the bilateral
agreement pointed out, the document is "not only an agreement of
commercial importance, but also important for the development of
the world economy." More importantly, both sides agreed the
results are "win-win" for the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said the signing the agreement is of realistic
and historic significance, conducive to China's accession to the
WTO, and beneficial to the full growth of Sino-U.S. economic and
trade cooperation and the stability and development of Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
"It injected new momentum into the development and prosperity
of the world economy," one pleased expert said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said that China's entry into the
WTO is needed by the country for ensuring economic growth and
driving reform and opening-up. Meanwhile, the WTO also needs China,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Without the participation of China, a country with 1.2 billion
people, the WTO is incomplete," he said, adding that China's
absence in the WTO is also not beneficial to the growth of the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
He again stressed that China can only enter the WTO as a
developing country with balanced rights and obligations. "China
will not accept conditions that exceed China's tolerance," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has concluded its bilateral negotiations with 12
WTO members, including Japan and Australia. However, its bilateral
negotiations with the European Union are still not settled.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Protests at Commonwealth Summit Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Monday expressed
its anger at the Commonwealth Summit communique issued in Durban
Sunday which focused on concern over the democracy process in
Pakistan after the coup last month.
</P>
<P>
"Ignoring ground realities in Pakistan," the communique used
"unacceptable" words in its characterization of the change in
Pakistan on October 12, said an official press statement here.
</P>
<P>
"The summit has lost sight of substance and dwelt on the form
of democracy. Nor does it take into account the declared
determination of the government to move expeditiously and
simultaneously on twin tracks of reform and democratization," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's present government is determined to move forward
with the process of electoral reforms along with its efforts for
economic stabilization, strengthening of the federation and
transparent accountability, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Summit earlier decided to suspend Pakistan's
membership of the organization as a consequence of the dismissal
of the former civilian government in the south Asian country last
month.

<HEADLINE> Unsafe Sex May Worsen AIDS Epidemic in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China's battle against HIV/
AIDS could become more formidable once unsafe sex replaces drug
use as the main form of virus transmission, health experts here
warned today.
</P>
<P>
Millions of people who have more than one sex partner, and also
innocent spouses and babies, will be at risk for contracting HIV,
the virus of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 70 percent of China's estimated 400,000 HIV
carriers are intravenous drug users who are often infected because
of sharing needles.
</P>
<P>
However, unsafe sexual contact has led to three-fourths of the
HIV/AIDS cases worldwide, far more than the number caused by
intravenous drug use, infected blood transfusions, and mother-to-
infant transmission.
</P>
<P>
"China will be on the same road (of sexual transmission) if
rampant prostitution and the rising incidence of sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs) are not curbed," warned Chen Xianyi,
an official with the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Chinese police arrested 420,000 prostitutes and their
clients, but that is only one-tenth of the actual total, according
to an estimation of the police.
</P>
<P>
Prostitutes have greater risks of both contracting and
transmitting HIV because they are more vulnerable to sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs) and often don't get treatment, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 630,000 STD patients were reported last year, an
increase of 37 percent over the figure in 1997 -- still only one-
eighth or one-tenth of the true figure.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, statistics show that HIV infection is becoming a
serious problem among people having multiple sex partners.
</P>
<P>
"More seriously, knowledge of AIDS prevention and self
protection can't reach them. And the situation will be graver if
they bring the virus to their spouses and babies are infected by
mothers," said Dai Zhicheng, with the Chinese Association of STD
and AIDS Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
China wants to reduce the number of HIV carriers to under 1.5
million by 2020, mainly through lowering the numbers of drug users
and STD patients.
</P>
<P>
However, health workers whose job is to persuade high-risk
groups to have protected sex still have a difficult task ahead of
them, Dai said.

LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell

<P>
Mitchell said in Belfast, capital of Northern Ireland, he would

concerns and requirements far better than before and are committed

a way will be found to do so," he said in a statement.
</P>

All parties involved in the talks have agreed that guerrilla
disarmament and the establishment of a power-sharing
administration should proceed "as quickly as possible".

commission monitoring disarmament to make its findings public and

<HEADLINE> PML Challenges Dismissal of Sharif Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Major Pakistani political
party, the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), Monday challenged in the
Supreme Court the army action of the dismissal of the government
of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani army led by General Pervaiz Musharraf, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and chief of the Army
Staff, toppled the 31-month-old Sharif government on October 12 in
a military coup.
</P>
<P>
PML lawyer Zafar Ali Shah filed the petition in the apex court,
arguing the army action was "unconstitutional and illegal," the
News Network International reported.
</P>
<P>
The petitioner pleaded for the restoration of the Sharif
government and the suspended national and provincial assemblies.
</P>
<P>
The petition was received by Buddha Khan, assistant registrar
of the Supreme Court. However, it was not confirmed whether or not
the petition was admitted for hearing.
</P>
<P>
Zafar Ali Shah was of the opinion that General Musharraf had
acted against an elected government in violation of the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Zafar Ali Shah, in his written petition, also described as
illegal and unfounded the case against Nawaz Sharif on plane
hijack charges, and pleaded to the court to declare Sharif's
arrest as unconstitutional.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Residents Can Buy, Sell Public Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Following in the footsteps of
Shanghai and Guangzhou, Beijing residents for the first time will
be allowed to buy or sell their government-allotted housing.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people flocked to the Beijing Real Estate
Trade Center today to register for the opportunity to buy or sell
their public housing units, said an official of the housing market.
</P>
<P>
Those eligible were Chinese with an identification card and
housing property certificate. Acceptance notices will be issued
within three weeks of application, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing has 160 million square meters of
residential housing.
</P>
<P>
The marketing of public housing will be economical and
practical for residents, help improve the country's real estate
market and expand domestic demand, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of families in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou
suggests that more than one-third of them are unsatisfied with
their existing housing. About 83,000 urban families in Shanghai
have bought their homes with help from 4.6 billion yuan in loans.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has worked out policies aimed at
transforming the previous public housing allocation into a
commercial system.
</P>
<P>
Since June this year, China has instituted a series measures to
help home buyers, such as offering long-term loans, eliminating
trade tax for housing, lowering tax on titles, and encouraging
people to buy and sell housing on the market.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and Guangzhou have already opened their markets for
the purchase and sale of public housing units.

launched then has played a major role.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 remote sensing ground stations are now running
parallel with a considerable number of meteorological ground
stations for acquisition of environmental data in about 30
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day ministerial meeting is scheduled to begin on
Thursday immediately after the senior officials meeting which will
end on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials meeting will review the progress of
implementation of the Beijing Declaration on Space Technology
Application for environmentally Sound and Sustainable Development
in Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
It will also evolve strategy and an action plan on space
technology application for sustainable development in the region
and mechanism for effective regional cooperation, and review the
draft ministerial declaration on space technology application for
improved quality of life in the new millennium that will be
submitted to the ministerial conference for adoption.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Longshoremen Accept Terms to End Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The longshoremen in Vancouver,
Canada, have agreed to accept federal recommendations to end a
week-long lockout of North America's third largest port city.
</P>
<P>
The longshoremen's union said Sunday that the 2,000 dockworkers
will return to work as soon as the employers' association agrees
to lift the lockout.
</P>
<P>
Tom Dufresne, president of the union, said they could be back
to work as early as 4:30 P.M. Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Maritime Employers' Association said Sunday night that it
would wait until Monday before announcing its own decision.
</P>
<P>
On November 13, Canadian Labor Minister Claudette Bradshaw gave
both parties an ultimatum to come to terms by Sunday noon,
threatening to table back-to-work legislation in the Commons on
Monday if otherwise.

November 7 after failing to reach a new settlement over the wage
issue with the union.
</P>
<P>
The lockout has cost the Port of Vancouver 68 million U.S.
dollars per day, with about 5,000 containers of goods stuck there.

progress in primary education with the net enrollment of children
at primary schools rising to 82 percent and completion of their
education to 60 percent from 60 percent and 43 percent
respectively in 1990.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Media Urged to Improve Country's Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan journalists have been
urged to help improve the country's image on the international
stage and thus promote its economic development.
</P>
<P>
Nuwa Wamala-Nnyanzi, chairman of the Uganda Artists'
Association, made the appeal at a press conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bwindi incident, in which eight foreign tourists
were killed by Interahamwe rebels from the Democratic Republic of
the Congo in early March, has created a very negative image for
Uganda internationally. It has greatly hampered the country's
development because it scares off potential investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Journalists are people who inform and influence the general
public and therefore are responsible to help rectify the tarnished
image," he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's tourism industry is the sector which suffers most from
the Bwindi incident. Tourism is currently the country's second
largest foreign exchange earner and it has dropped to the all-time
low because of the killings, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong announced today the launch of its Growth Enterprise Market (
GEM), an alternative stock exchange for emerging companies to
raise funds for business development.
</P>
<P>
The stated mission of GEM is to become a successful stock
market in its own right known for its quality, level of
transparency, level playing field, orderly transactions as well as
investor protection, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said at the
GEM launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"It targets at growth enterprises from all industries and of
all sizes, with the objective of allowing these enterprises easier
access to capital," Tsang stressed.
</P>
<P>
The concept of creation of a second stock market in Hong Kong
was first mooted in 1987, and the exchange has already admitted
more than 30 firms as approved GEM sponsors and received nine
formal listing applications.
</P>
<P>
"This is encouraging," Tsang said, adding that he was sure that
the exchange would keep up the good work and develop GEM to its
full potential before long.
</P>
<P>
GEM will benefit not only the emerging enterprises in Hong Kong,
but also those in the mainland, in the region and elsewhere in the
world, he said.

important role as the major fund-raising center outside the
mainland for the mainland enterprises, Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that a successful GEM will help attract venture
capital to Hong Kong and gives retail investors a new opportunity
to invest in rapidly growing companies and to share the profits of
their success.

</P>
<P>
"It is at this signing that leaders from the East African
countries and the Great Lakes region will fix a tentative date for
the summit. Most heads of state from the region will be invited to
the ceremony," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The year-long Burundi peace talks aimed at ending the conflict
have come to a standstill following the death of Tanzanian former
president Julius Nyerere last month.
</P>
<P>
Recently, parties involved in the Burundi conflict have spelled
out different qualifications for the new facilitator, which has
become the core issue on restarting the peace process.

<HEADLINE> HK's Third Quarter Domestic Exports Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
domestic exports classified to four major industries decreased in
the third quarter of 1999, according to statistics released by the
Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department today.
</P>
<P>
The four major industries are textiles; wearing apparel;
machinery, equipment, apparatus, parts and components; and
consumer electrical and electronic products.
</P>
<P>
The value of exports classified to the four industries
accounted for 78 percent of Hong Kong's total domestic exports of
manufactured goods in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The value of domestic exports classified to the wearing apparel
industry decreased by about one billion Hong Kong dollars (128.2
million U.S. dollars) or nine percent to 10.1 billion HK dollars (
1.29 billion U.S. dollars) compared with the same quarter in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Exports classified to the machinery, equipment, apparatus,
parts and components industry decreased by about 0.9 billion HK
dollars (115.35 million U.S. dollars) or 11 percent to 7.6 billion
HK dollars (974.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of domestic exports classified to the consumer
electrical and electronic products industry decreased by about 0.6
billion HK dollars (76.9 million U.S. dollars) or 13 percent to 3.
8 billion HK dollars (487 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Exports classified to textiles industry decreased by about 0.3
billion HK dollars (38.46 million U.S. dollars) or two percent to
14.7 billion HK dollars (1.88 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As for other industries, notable decreases in the value of
domestic exports were recorded for the professional and optical
equipment industry by about 1.3 billion HK dollars (166.6 million
U.S. dollars) or 39 percent to 2.1 billion HK dollars (269.2
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The chemicals and chemical products industry decreased by about
0.1 billion HK dollars (12.8 million U.S. dollars) or nine percent
to 1.4 billion HK dollars (179.5 million U.S. dollars); and the
plastic products industry by about 0.1 billion (12.8 million U.S.
dollars) or 20 percent to 0.6 billion HK dollars (76.9 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman pointed out that the
continuous decline in domestic exports in the third quarter was
related mainly to the on-going structural shift in export
structure towards re-exports and offshore trade.

<HEADLINE> Japan Fails in Launching Multipurpose Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan failed Monday in launching
a multipurpose satellite for weather forecasting and air traffic
control after the main engine failure of a rocket carrying the
satellite, Japan's space agency said.
</P>
<P>
The main engine of the No.8 H-2 rocket stopped about four
minutes after the launch at the Tanegashima Space Center, located
in Kagoshima Prefecture in southwestern Japan, at 4:29 p.m.(local
time), the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) said.
</P>
<P>
Ground control then issued an order to destroy the domestically
developed rocket, which subsequently crashed 150 kilometers
northwest of Ogasawara Islands, about 1,250 kilometers southeast
of the launch site.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the engine failure is not yet known, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the satellite was originally scheduled for August,
but was delayed several times due to trouble with the rocket and
changes made to the satellite, it said.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose satellite, procured by the Japanese Transport
Ministry at a cost of some 10 billion yen (about 95 million U.S.
dollars) from a U.S. manufacturer, was intended to replace the
current "Himawari" weather satellite, which will reach its
durability limit of five years next March.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the launch, the second in recent two years, is
expected to deal a serious blow to Japan's space program. A
Japanese-made H-2 rocket failed to send a test satellite into
orbit in February.

<P>
LAGOS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has resolved to establish a power pool
project to link all its 16-member nations.
</P>
<P>
All member countries were "desirous" of the speedy
actualization of the proposed power pool to link them up, New
Nigerian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Energy ministers of Nigeria, Benin and Togo met in the Nigerian
capital Abuja last week to find ways of actualizing the proposed
power lines to link the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The lines will serve as nucleus of the proposed regional power
project to link the whole West African region, said a communique
issued at the end of a recent meeting of ECOWAS energy ministers
held in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
It said that within a short time, an inter-utility project
development committee will be set up to develop commercially
viable projects under the regional proposed project.

<HEADLINE> Macao-Guangdong Flight Information Network Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China today launched a high-
tech project meant to speed up transmission of flight information
between airports in Macao and south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Airspace over the Zhujiang River Delta is one of the world's
busiest air navigational routes due to the number of major
airports in Hong Kong, Zhuhai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The low-speed transmission connection used in the area has long
been inadequate for the increasing number of flights there.
</P>
<P>
To develop its aviation information service and improve flight
safety, China has set up a network connecting flight data between
major airports in central and south China.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, airports in Macao will also be
hooked up to the network, which can provide a variety of
information services including automatic telegraphing, telephone
call exchange, radar info, pager messaging, telecontrol info and
weather database information.
</P>
<P>
The airports in Hong Kong joined the network in October,
increasing the telegraph transmitting speed between Hong Kong and
Guangzhou from 75 bits to 2,400 bits.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Denies Report of Developing Secret Missile Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Monday denied a
report by New York Times that U.S. spy satellites have detected
fresh evidence that Seoul is trying to develop longer-range
ballistic missile under a secret program.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government has not conducted secret tests to
develop longer range missiles in violation of the agreement
reached with the United States, which limits Seoul's missile
capability to 180 kilometers, said the Ministry of Foreign Affair
and Trade.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times report said the U.S. spy satellite photos
revealed last year that South Korea had built a rocket motor test
station without notifying the United States.
</P>
<P>
The station, which includes a large concrete or tempered steel
cradle in which rocket motors are locked for firing test, appeared
to have been built secretly as part of a larger South Korean
ballistic missile program.
</P>
<P>
In April, South Korea conducted a short range test of a new
missile that appeared to violate its agreements with the United
States, the report said quoting U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
However, a ministry spokesman said, "we notified Washington in
April our test-firing a missile along the west coast and it
accepted our explanation."
</P>
<P>
Seoul has reportedly been negotiating with Washington to revise
the agreement to extend South Korea's missile capability up to 500
kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes Jospin's Remarks on Iranian Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- An official from the Iranian
Foreign Ministry on Monday criticized recent remarks by French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on the 13 Iranian Jews arrested on
espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified official termed Jospin's remarks as "immature"
and a gesture caused by "overflow of his personal emotions," the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said at a Jewish institute in France on Saturday that
the issue of 13 Iranian Jews is the hurdle to Tehran's return to
the international community. He demanded the release of the
Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
The official said that such remarks which are mostly consumed
locally and at times of factional disputes in France are void of
attraction and credit.
</P>
<P>
It is wise that the French minister respects the national
sovereignty of other countries and seriously refrains from
interfering in the internal affairs of others, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Jews were arrested in April for allegedly working
for Israeli and the U.S. intelligence services. Both Israel and
the U.S. denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Improve its Credit Guarantee System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's credit
guarantee system would continue to undergo changes and
improvements to meet future requirements of the economy, its Bank
Negara (central bank) Deputy Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the pressing need for the adequate availability
of credit guarantees on the back of increasing acceptance of such
a mechanism by both participating financial institutions and
borrowers, she said at the 12th Asian Credit Supplementation
Institution Confederation (ACSIC) conference held here Monday.
</P>
<P>
She said this was especially apparent among small and medium
scale enterprises (SMEs) as it was shown that credit guarantees
played a crucial role in their development, and this was all the
more so during the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The significance of the credit guarantee system was further
established when the country's economic scenario was marred by the
cautious stance taken by lending institutions in view of the rise
in non-performing loans, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that keeping the credit guarantee system in mind, the
government had taken several initiatives as part of the
comprehensive measures to address this cautious mood, which
included putting in place the institutional framework to
specifically deal with it, the provisioning of additional funding
via special funds and enhancing the responsibilities of the credit
guarantee corporation.
</P>
<P>
The central bank official said the lending institutions now
readily accepted the credit guarantee system as it enabled them to
grant loans to borrowers who had viable projects but were without
the necessary collateral.
</P>
<P>
The conference, themed "Challenges for the Guarantee System
During Economic Uncertainties and Measures to Address Them,"
discussed policy issues and ideas of common interest.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Begins Official Visit to France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein left here Monday for France on a four-day official visit
to promote bilateral economic ties and for talks on the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The monarch is expected to meet French President Jacques
Chirac and other senior French officials in a bid to partly write
off or reschedule the payment of some 700 million U.S. dollars of
debts owed to France by the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
France is one of the major creditor countries to Jordan, which
has registered a record 6.8 billion dollars of foreign debts so
far.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is also expected to rally French support for the
Middle East peace process for which Jordan has been an active
player since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The king will attend an event to name one of the main streets
of Paris after his father, the late King Hussein Ibn Talal, to
commemorate his role in promoting the Middle East peace process,
Jordan's official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is accompanied by Queen Rania Al Abdullah, Prime
Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh and a powerful delegation of
Jordanian businessmen on his trip.

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Indignation at Anti-China Remarks by Japanese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China expressed its strong
indignation at the "wanton remarks" made in Taiwan by Governor of
Metropolitan Tokyo Ishihara Shintaro, Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Sun Yuxi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the Ishihara's so-called "visit of
condolence" to Taiwan, Sun said that the Japanese official's
wanton reference to Taiwan as "a state" has again exposed his anti-
China nature and ulterior motives of undermining China's
reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
The actions of Ishihara, as governor of Japan's capital, have
set a bad precedent for the contacts between Japan and Taiwan, Sun
said.
</P>
<P>
We demand the Japanese government earnestly abide by its solemn
commitment to the Chinese side concerning the Taiwan issue in the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and
Friendship and last year's Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration, Sun
said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government should take immediate and effective
measures to diffuse the damage done to Sino-Japanese relations
resulting from Ishihara's remarks and prevent the recurrence of
further thoughtless comments, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rebuffs Western Pressure on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said here Monday that Moscow would ignore Western pressure
and continue its military campaign against rebels in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The West "has no right to blame Russia for destroying bandits,
thugs and terrorists on its territory," the Itar-Tass news agency
quoted Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he would head the Russian delegation to the
summit meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) scheduled for November 18-19 in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Russia is expected to face strong pressure from the United
States and other Western countries in Istanbul for it to ease the
military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The military operation started more than seven weeks ago
following armed incursions by the Chechen militants into
neighboring Daghestan and a spate of terrorist bombings that
killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has accused Chechen warlords Shamil
Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only by his last
name, of staging the incursions and masterminding the blasts.
</P>
<P>
"We will not stop until not a single terrorist remains in our
territory," Tass quoted Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who met Yeltsin Monday,
also stressed that Chechnya is Russia's internal affair that
brooks no outside interference.
</P>
<P>
"We shall rebuff most resolutely all the attempts to interfere
in the domestic affairs of the Russian Federation," Ivanov told
reporters after his meeting with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"A struggle is being waged there (in Chechnya) against
international terrorism and to defend the interests of Russian
citizens," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of Russia's State Duma (
lower house of the parliament), blasted Western pressure on the
Chechen issue, saying "Russia should go through with the operation
in Chechnya. We can no longer tolerate the humiliation of the
Russian state and the Russian army."
</P>
<P>
"Not a single NATO country had the right to lecture us on what
we should do in our own country after the mess they hashed in
Yugoslavia," Seleznyov said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Hold 2000 Presidential Elections as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said Monday that the next presidential elections would be
held as scheduled on June 4, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The polls will take place "exactly on time, as should be under
the law passed by the State Duma (lower house of parliament),"
Yeltsin said before a meeting at the Kremlin with Alexander
Veshnyakov, Chairman of the Central Electoral Committee, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Besides the presidential race, Yeltsin and Veshnyakov will
also discuss the coming parliamentary elections slated for
December 19.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin denied as groundless the rumors that he had rifts with
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, saying he "supported and will
strongly support Vladimir Putin as a presidential candidate," the
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The denial came amid media speculation that Yeltsin has grown
cold toward Putin, whom he appointed as his preferred successor in
the upcoming presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The approval rate of Putin, who was little known to the
Russian public before being appointed premier on August 9, has
been rising steadily in opinion polls since federal forces
launched a major offensive against rebels in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya some seven weeks ago.

<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Southern African
Development Community (SADC) has agreed to speed up assistance to
the Angolan government in its fight against rebels, official
sources told reporters here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The SADC leaders, attending the Durban Commonwealth summit, met
in George in the Western Cape, some 1,000 kilometers away from the
summit venue, and held a two-and-a-half-hour meeting on Angola and
other regional issues on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
They discussed pressing regional political issues, with Angola,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho and Zambia on the
top of the agenda, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed that they should do more to help the Angolan
 government fight the rebel movement National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) under Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
A real and dynamic co-ordinated program should be put in place
to deal with the Angolan government's humanitarian request, they
said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Angolan government has not asked the SADC to send
troops to the country to help fight the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Angola is a SADC member but not a member of the Commonwealth.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Health Ministry has
confirmed that about 20,000 people may have been affected by
radiation due to a 21-kilometer section of road containing
radioactive compounds in Coast Province of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Workers unknowingly scooped tons of rocks containing thorium in
the nearby Mrima Hill and used it in May to repair the
21-kilometer road, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of the Health Ministry Julius Meme has
directed that people who could have been exposed to the
radioactive substance be medically examined.
</P>
<P>
Radiation experts have taken soil and water samples from the
road and the mineral-rich Mrima Hill for further tests.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the affected area have urged the government to
immediately close the road and set up mobile units to screen those
possible victims.
</P>
<P>
More areas in Kenya are being suspected to have radioactive
compounds, according to a report by Kenya's Mines and Geology
Department.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United goalkeeper
Mark Bosnich has returned to England for treatment on an injured
hamstring, after being ruled out of Australia's second friendly
against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich, the Australian captain, played in the opening 2-0 loss
on Sunday, but was replaced in the second-half.
</P>
<P>
Celtic striker Mark Viduka withdrew from the game with a thigh
strain and remains in doubt for game two in Melbourne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Coach Frank Farina said: "I spoke with Manchester United on
Monday morning, explaining why Bosnich had come off.
</P>
<P>
"I explained that my medical staff didn't believe he would be
fit in time for Wednesday night's game and it has been determined
that it was in Mark's best interest for him to go back to
Manchester United."
</P>
<P>
The match was Bosnich's first as captain of the national team,
and after the game, he said: "The hamstring tightened up on me
early in the game and I was a little concerned."
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coach, Wanderley Luxembergo, labeled the Australian
team "unsporting", and criticized the high count of illegal
challenges in the match.
</P>
<P>
Luxembergo said midfielder Marcos Paulo was head-butted while
several other players were subjected to "violent" tackles.
</P>
<P>
"I disliked a lot of scenes before a free-kick is taken when
Marcos Paulo gets hit by an Australian with his head," Luxembergo
said.
</P>
<P>
"That is very unsporting. I was surprised by the violent
tackling of some of the Australian players."

<P>
Barshefsky told Jiang that she had made a phone call to
President Bill Clinton before the two sides signed the agreement.
President Clinton entrusted her to extend gratitude to President
Jiang on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
According to Barshefsky, President Clinton considered the
agreement is possible just because President Jiang views and
handles the bilateral negotiations for China's WTO entry from a
strategic perspective.
</P>
<P>
Sperling said the agreement was inked based on the great
sincerity of both sides. It is a good agreement for both sides and
one of historic significance for the development of U.S.-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the signing of the agreement between China and
U.S. fully demonstrates the two sides should examine and handle
major events that are closely related to the interests of both the
Chinese and American peoples and the people of the world as well,
from the strategic perspective geared to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said since he first met with President Clinton in Seattle, U.
S., in 1993, they have frequently exchanged views on China's entry
into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, later the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He again made a phone call on November 7 this year to President
Clinton, during which they decided to quicken the pace of
negotiations between the two countries and make efforts for a good,
mutually beneficial agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, both sides have adopted an overall point of
view and made unremitting efforts in line with the spirit of
equality, mutual benefit, mutual understanding, mutual compromise,
and seeking common ground while leaving difference aside. It is
just because of this that we have overcome all difficulties,
properly handled and resolved all differences, and finally
achieved the "win-win" results, he said.
</P>
<P>
It can be said that as long as both the Chinese and U.S. sides
take firm hold of the fundamental interests of the two peoples,
respect each other, treat each other with sincerity, we are
certain to push the bilateral ties forward steadily, Jiang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- England defender Martin Keown
has warned about the danger of a "wounded and hurt" Scotland at
Wembley on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But huge games such as the Euro 2000 qualifier second leg no
longer hold any fears for the Arsenal star, who finally believes
he has got what it takes to perform on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old center-back was beginning to blossom when an
injury against Brazil in Paris during Le Tournoi during the summer
of 1997 checked his progress.
</P>
<P>
Now he feels he has all the qualities required to do the
business at the highest level after becoming a regular since Kevin
Keegan took over as England coach.
</P>
<P>
That was clearly evident on Saturday when Keown was a defensive
rock as two goals from Paul Scholes left Craig Brown's Scotland
team with a mountain to climb.
</P>
<P>
Keown said: "Maybe that was the most important game I have
played in for England but I wanted the chance to show that I could
perform in high-pressure games.
</P>
<P>
"Saturday was just right for me. I was ready for it. You need
to prove in big games to yourself and to people what you can do.
Maybe it has taken me longer in my career for whatever reason.
</P>
<P>
"Things were going really well internationally for me at the
time of the Brazil injury and that was snatched away. But I now
feel I've got everything I need to play at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
"I was mentally ready for it and if you ask all top sports
people most of them will say the game is played in the head. I'm
now realising I can do the business at this level - and do it
regularly.
</P>
<P>
"It's not suddenly happened for me at international level. It's
been a progressive thing. I played in the Euro '92 finals and that
was a difficult exercise for me with so many young players in at
the same time," he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Begin Legal Proceedings Against French Beef Refusal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The British Government is set
to formally ask the European Commission to begin legal proceedings
against France for its refusal to lift the ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture minister Nick Brown, scheduled to meet his French
counterpart Jean Glavany Monday in an 11th-hour bid to avert the
crisis, appears unwilling to compromise.
</P>
<P>
"I shall be handing a formal note to the Commission on Monday
morning for them to consider formal infraction proceedings on
Tuesday," Brown told the BBC's On The Record program.
</P>
<P>
"I said at the beginning we were only allowing a matter of days
on this process... If there is not a clear way forward to the
French lifting the ban then on Tuesday, the commission will have
to consider infraction proceedings," he said.
</P>
<P>
Infraction proceedings are the mechanism under which European
Union member states are taken to court for breaching treaty
provisions.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he would "specifically" be asking for the
proceedings to be expedited quickly.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture minister also made clear his anger at the
French Government's demands for new safeguards on beef, saying he
was "shocked and dismayed" they had suspended their parliamentary
procedure to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the UK or me who is in the wrong over this. I am the
person who is trying to sort this out and I am trying to do it in
a measured and rational way," Brown added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday he
would rather talk France into lifting its beef ban than resort to
the courts but would not hesitate from taking legal action if
persuasion failed.
</P>
<P>
"We can use the law and, of couse, we should and will if the
French refuse to abide by the proper law and the proper science.
But in the end it would be better to do this by persuading them
because then we've got a better chance of selling the beef," Blair
said in an interview also to BBC radio.

BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical industry
registered some 1.3 billion yuan in profits from January to August
this year, up 42 percent from the same period last year.

production during January-August period, with some giant steel
makers taking the initiative.

from the same period last year, and the Pudong Iron and Steel
Company under Baoshan Complex cut their output by a hefty 30
percent.

equipment and improved their management.

<HEADLINE> 42 Percent of OFWs Come Home Sick: Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 42 percent of the
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who return home need immediate
medical attention or hospital confinement for various physical or
mental illness sustained abroad, a Manila lawmaker said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nestor Ponce, House legislator, made the remarks in a interview
with the Philippine News Agency, citing three factors why these
worker usually encounter these difficulties and hardships.
</P>
<P>
"The long hours of labor, poor living conditions, the
loneliness attendant to working overseas and the fortune spent to
get a job are just a few of the reasons why these workers come
home sick," Ponce was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result of such findings, Ponce filed House Bill 5209
seeking to establish a special hospital for overseas contract
workers and their dependents.
</P>
<P>
Deemed as heroes of the Philippines, the overseas Filipino
workers, amounting to 4 to 5 million, send home a sum of 6 to 7
billion U.S. dollars each year out of their earnings abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Among others, we must ensure that we provide full protection
to labor, both local and overseas, to protect their interest and
promote their well-being," he said.
</P>
<P>
This includes their families and dependents by providing social
and welfare services for them, the lawmaker added.
</P>
<P>
Ponce said the present package of service under the Medical
Care Program for these workers and their dependents being provided
by the government is somewhat limited to curative medical services
only.
</P>
<P>
Ponce said his bill aims to complement the present package to
include supplementary provisions for preventive, primitive,
diagnostic and rehabilitative programs to ensure a comprehensive
health care for the OFWs and their dependents.

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran has been held responsible
for a car bombing Saturday targetting its Baghdad-based opposition
group, Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO), which wounded several
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, outlawed in Iran in 1980, has issued a statement
claiming that Iranian agents set off a car bomb near one of its
vehicles south of Baghdad by remote control, according to local
Baghdad Observer newspaper on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorist dispatched by the Iranian regime detonated a
pick-up laden with explosive at 3:15 p.m. (1215 GMT) on Saturday
on the Baghdad-Kut highway as cars belonging to MKO were passing
by," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the cars had been en route to the group's Faezeh
military camp, some 250 kilometers south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not mention any casualties on MKO members,
but said several Iraqi citizens travelling on the same road had
been injured and that one of its own vehicles had been badly
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, MKO said Iran had fired a Scud missile at
one of its camps in southern Iraq, killing six of its members and
one Iraqi and injuring dozens of others.

</P>
<P>
With more than 110 sugar refineries and some 100,000 workers,
Guangxi, in southwest China, produced over 40 percent of China's
total sugar output in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
It is not only China's largest producer of sugar, but ranks
ninth in the world.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, Guangxi has attached great importance to
developing its sugar industry with support from the central
government.
</P>
<P>
At present, 20 million peasants, more than half of the total
agricultural population in Guangxi, are working on sugar
plantations. Some 4.5 million people are employed in the sugar
industry in Guangxi.

<HEADLINE> Estonia Becomes 135th Member of WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Estonia has become the 135th
member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), trade officials said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Estonia notified the Geneva-based WTO Secretariat Saturday that
it had completed its national ratification proceedings.
</P>
<P>
WTO accession negotiations for Estonia concluded successfully
on May 21, 1999 after WTO's General Council adopted Estonia's
Working Party Report and Protocol of Accession.
</P>
<P>
WTO's General Council concluded that the Working Party on
Estonia's accession had completed its work on the package of
accession documents (Working Party Report, Protocol of Accession,
and Market Access Schedules of Concessions on Goods and Services),
allowing Estonia to sign the accession protocol.
</P>
<P>
The working party on Estonia's accession to WTO was established
in March 1994 and was transformed into a WTO working party in 1995.
The Working Party met for the first time in November 1994. In
April 1999, it adopted by consensus the draft report, protocol of
accession and the schedules of concessions on goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Estonia has agreed to bring its economic and trade regime into
conformity with WTO rules and obligations in all areas. It will
sign on to all multilateral and plurilateral agreements, that is,
the government procurement agreement and the agreement on trade in
civil aircraft, without any transition periods.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Supports Syrian Stance on Talks With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has reiterated that Egypt stands by Syria's just demands
and rights in its peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian stance is absolutely sound and pivotal in any
negotiations, said the minister, adding that any peace agreement
must be based on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
Golan Heights to the 1967 border lines.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the pledge of Egyptian support in an interview
Sunday evening with the Syrian television.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks have been stalled since February
1996. Syria demands that the talks be resumed from where they were
left off whereas Israel wants the talks to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
The issue of security could not possibly be considered by one
party alone, nor could it be tackled from one specific angle,
because any breach of security by one party would affect the
security of the other and of the region as a whole, Moussa was
quoted as saying by the Syrian newspaper Al Thawra on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, security has to be reciprocal and equally
guaranteed. It is not an Israeli issue alone, but a principal
issue with paramount importance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called on the Israeli government to take realistic
measures in its negotiations with its Arab neighbors, saying that
"mere talk on peace is not enough, not can we talk about peace at
a time when settlements are being constructed," and the expansion
of such settlements is detrimental to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is unacceptable to talk about multi-lateral negotiations
before fulfilling bilateral negotiations and having them
implemented on the ground, said the Egyptian minister.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's stance on this issue has always been clear and firm,
said Moussa. Israel has accused Egypt of blocking Arab countries
from entering into multilateral talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Until negotiations are resumed on the Israeli-Syrian and
Israeli-Lebanese tracks, the conditions are not ripe for the
commencement of multilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli now occupies Syria's Golan Heights captured during the
1967 Middle East war. It also has been holding a border strip in
southern Lebanon of about 1,100 square kilometers since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, a power broker which deploys about 30,000
troops in Lebanon as peace-keepers, have insisted on the
integration of their talks with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Rages in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Helicopter gunships and
artillery fires pounded Muslim rebels trying to occupy some
villages in southern Philippines as fighting between government
forces and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) entered the
third day Monday.
</P>
<P>
The military rushed more troops to two provinces of North
Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat, central and south Mindanao, where
heavy fighting erupted anew starting Saturday, Philippine News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The troops are backed up by two armored vehicles, one tank and
one fighting vehicle aside from two MG-520 helicopter gunships and
artillery fires from 105mm howitzers.
</P>
<P>
MILF guerrillas stormed on Sunday in Cotabato where they held
hostage some 100 civilians. The hostages were later freed.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Angelo Reyes said army
soldiers from the 15th Infantry Battalion overran a MILF camp
complete with bunkers that can accommodate 100 persons in a
village in Sultan Kudarat Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers were wounded when heavy fighting broke out during
the attack of the MILF camp.
</P>
<P>
The report did not mention of any casualty on the MILF side
during the air strikes conducted by the gunships.
</P>
<P>
The military said that since late September, MILF forces were
monitored in some areas of Sultan Kudarat trying to build more
camps.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the latest incidents in
Cotabato are indicative that the MILF is bent on expanding their
areas before the December 31 deadline for the recognition of MILF
camps expires.

<HEADLINE> EDS-More Added Chinese President Meets U.S. Government Delegation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today highly praised Chinese and U.S. negotiators for their hard
work which led to the signing of a bilateral pact on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He said the signing of the agreement is of "great realistic and
historic significance" and will help accelerate the process of
China's entry into WTO.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a meeting with the U.S. government
delegation headed by Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and
National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling, this afternoon
at Zhongnanhai, the site of China's central government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation is here to hold negotiations with the
Chinese government delegation led by Shi Guangsheng, minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation, on China's WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that "You have held negotiations with the Chinese
delegation headed by Minister Shi Guangsheng during the past days
and nights. It is delightful that China and U.S. have eventually
reached the agreement thanks to our concerted efforts."
</P>
<P>
"Where there is a will, there is a way," the president said,
quoting an old Chinese proverb. The signing of the China-U.S.
bilateral agreement on China's WTO accession "is of realistic and
historic significance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his belief that the signing of the agreement "
will help accelerate the process of China's entry into WTO and
promote the overall development of China-U.S. trade and economic
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
It will also be conducive to the improvement and development of
China-U.S. relations, and bring about a new driving force for the
development and prosperity of the world economy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Euro 2000 Director Welcomes England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Euro 2000 director Alain
Courtois said on Monday that England's qualification will make the
tournament a better competition.
</P>
<P>
But he also expressed concern that England's qualification for
the European Soccer Championships in Belgium and the Netherlands
would increase hooliganism fears.
</P>
<P>
"(With England) there is no doubt Euro 2000 will be a World Cup
without Brazil and Argentina," Courtois told Belgian daily Het
Laatste Nieuws.
</P>
<P>
England are well-placed to qualify after beating Scotland 2-0
in the first leg of their play-off on Saturday. The second leg is
at Wembley on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Courtois said English fans, despite their violent reputation,
would be welcome at Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
"As long as they know we'll crack down hard (on hooliganism)
through swift 'administrative' arrests," he said referring to
special powers given to the mayors of towns hosting Euro 2000
matches to arrest fans whom the authorities fear could spark
trouble.
</P>
<P>
As the man in charge of organizing Euro 2000, Courtois said he
was delighted at the prospect of having England join France,
Germany, Italy and Spain, all of whom have already qualified for
the finals which kick off on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Courtois said the organizers would now step up their internal
communication over the hooligan issue.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economic Slump Seen Going Into Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The slackening economic
activity in Kenya is anticipated to continue into the year 2000,
the Central Bank of Kenya said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing measures by the government in improving
infrastructure and fiscal discipline do not show effects
immediately and are expected to boost the flagging economy in a
long term, The People daily newspaper Monday quoted the report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Most sectors in Kenya's economy are performing dismally,
according to the November edition of the Monthly Economic Review
by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, a pillar industry in the east African country,
still remained depressed with a rate of 1.4 percent in the last 12
months.
</P>
<P>
The service sector expanded at a growth rate of 2.6 percent in
the last 12 months . The figure for the previous 12 months was 8.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
Finance, insurance and real estate are estimated to grow at 2.7
percent this year, down from 3.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kenyan economy can only recover quickly when the
government rebuilds good relations with the donor community, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund suspended a 205 million U.S.
dollars loan in July 1997, which has triggered off a continuous
decline in Kenya's economic growth in the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Economy Sees Signs of Improvement: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's ailing economy is
showing signs of improvement after its parliament passed the
long-awaited 1999 budget in June, the Daily Star newspaper Monday
quoted an official report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The optimism on the country's economic health is based on lower
interest rates on Treasury bills, a sharp drop in public spending
and higher tax revenues, said the report issued by the finance
ministry.
</P>
<P>
It said the number of tax payers rose to 94,000 in May 1999
from 63,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The budget broke all taboos for the first time because it
exempted lower income families who earn less than 700 U.S. dollars
a month from paying direct tax while raising the tax burden on
companies and individuals with big earnings.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministry cooperated with the Central Bank to reduce
interest rates on two-year T-bills by 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
But, the report said the current 14 percent interest rate on
T-bills was "catastrophic" for the country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is struggling to bring down the huge public debt of 20
billion dollars, or around 120 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP), one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
It was largely accumulated by former governments of Rafik
Hariri through issuing high-interest-rate T-bills to rebuild the
country's infrastructure devastated during the 1975-1990 civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The report said the ministry cooperated for the first time
with the Central Bank to stabilize the Lebanese pound, adding
such cooperation did not exist before.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the ministry successfully issued the 712
million eurobonds in September, of which 34 percent were ordered
by European and U.S. firms.

<P>
KAMPALA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government forces
 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have launched an
offensive on rebel positions in the northwestern Equator province.
</P>
<P>
These attacks took place on three fronts, Ugandan State
Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi confirmed at the
weekend, according to Monday's Monitor daily.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it is hoped that DRC President Laurent
Kabila does not have the intention of an all-out war, but the way
he is acting shows that he does not care whether he is violating
the cease-fire stipulated in the Lusaka agreement signed in July
and August this year.
</P>
<P>
The violations of the truce in the DRC have drawn serious
concern of the signatories to the Lusaka agreement and the
international community. The Organization of African Unity has
decided to send round 30 military observers into the country to
verify the violations and come up with proposals.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash is to meet Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides in New York,
which he called as "a last chance" to resolve the issues on the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
Denktash announced on Monday that he would attend "proximity
talks" on December 3 with Clerides, at the invitation of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Denktash will join in the talks which will lead to direct
negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
leaders. He was quoted by local Daily News as saying that he
agreed to attend the talks provided that they are held at the
U.N. building and not a hotel or American military facility.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Direct negotiations between the two sides have not been held in
the past two years because of preconditions set by the Turkish
side for the recognition of the breakaway state in northern
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Boosts Non-traditional Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has accelerated its pace
 in developing non-traditional exports such as textiles, flowers,
vegetables and tobacco, a news release reaching here on Monday
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report from the Export Board of Zambia, the
European Union (EU) has become the largest market of Zambia's
non-traditional exports, which earned the country about 106
million U.S. dollars last year as a result of non-reciprocal free
access.
</P>
<P>
The second largest market for Zambia in non-traditional exports
is COMESA (the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa),
which earned the country 86 million U.S. dollars in 1998. The
African country also earned about 28 million dollars from Asia and
some 93 million dollars from other markets.
</P>
<P>
The British market is the largest single one in EU and accounts
for 36.6 percent of Zambia's total non-traditional exports, while
the German market accounts for 26 percent and the Netherlands for
24 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been trying hard in recent years to improve its non-
traditional exports in an effort to diversify its economy and to

<HEADLINE> EDS-Adds Background China, U.S. Sign Market Access Agreement (More Details Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China, U.S. signed a market
access agreement here Monday afternoon, concluding their bilateral
negotiations on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (
WTO).
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (
MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky signed the agreement on behalf of their respective
governments, following six days of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides said they have reached agreement on the terms and
conditions of the access to China's market, including specific
pledges on the access to China's market in areas of the industrial
products, agricultural produce and the services sectors.
</P>
<P>
Minister Shi said that the negotiations between the two sides
have had the great attention from leaders of the two countries,
and they have worked very hard in the principles of win-win,
mutual compromise and consultations on equal footing.
</P>
<P>
"I think the agreement China and the U.S. signed is in the
common interests of our two countries," Shi said in a speech
following the signing of the agreement. "It will help China join
the WTO at a sooner date and conducive to the stability and
development of Sino-U.S. relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese trade minister said that he expects China to join
the WTO within the year. He pledged that China as a WTO member
will assume its due obligations while enjoying its rights, and
contribute to the prosperity of world trade along with other WTO
members.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said in a short speech that "This is a profound
historic moment in U.S.-China relations."
</P>
<P>
China has tried for 13 years to enter the multi-lateral trade
body formerly known as GATT. Important progress was made during
Premier Zhu Rongji's April visit to the U.S. But negotiations
virtually stopped following the U.S.-led NATO missile attack
against the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last May.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. agreed to resume WTO talks last September.
China has stressed that it can join the body only as a developing
country and that its rights and obligations should be given equal
status.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has closed bilateral negotiations with 13 WTO
members including Japan, Australia and Chile. It has yet to
complete negotiations with other members including the European
Union.

<HEADLINE> UAE Readies for Possible Y2K Air Emergencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A special air traffic
control center has been set up in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
to deal with possible air emergencies caused by the Year 2000
millennium bug, also known as the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The fully equipped National Air Traffic Management Center,
based in Abu Dhabi, will be functional for just 14 hours,
covering the most crucial time of the computerized world, between
8 p.m. on December 31, 1999 and 10 a.m. on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The newly set up center will work together with UAE's existing
Air Traffic Control Operations Center, which handles an average of
700 flights a day, said Riis Johansen, director of air navigation
services of the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA).
</P>
<P>
The center will be operating as an additional safeguard
against millennium bug aviation-related events, to ensure the
safety and continuity of civil aviation during the transition to
the year 2000, Johansen was quoted by the Gulf News daily on
Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The center has a nine-member team to keep a close watch on the
functioning of air traffic control, communication, electronics,
radars, engineering and other vital aviation systems.
</P>
<P>
A special satellite communications system has also been set up
to maintain contact with neighboring countries in case of a break
down in the normal telephones, radio communication and the
existing direct telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
The GCAA and all the six international airports in the UAE
have already done comprehensive computer checks. "We have been
through all system checks and are well ahead of the game. In
short, we are year 2000 compliant. It will have no impact on us,"
Johansen said.

<P>
YINCHUAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's
effort to promote the education of girls in poverty-stricken areas
has paid off, according to a recent symposium on education of
girls held in northwest China city of Yinchuan, capital of the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 97 percent of school-age girls in 11 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities in western China entered
into schools, compared with 92 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Chinese government
sponsored an education program for girls in poverty-stricken areas
in cooperation with the U.N. Education, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, the U.N. Children' Fund, the U.N. Development
Program and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
A three-year experimental program in 28 primary schools in 16
poverty-stricken counties in Ningxia, and the provinces of Guizhou,
Gansu and Qinghai, has proved successful.
</P>
<P>
Now 93.6 percent of the school-age girls in the counties have
enrolled in schools compared with 70.9 percent before the program
started.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
vowed to ensure the country a drug-free nation, Times of Zambia
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) Raphael Mungole
was quoted as saying that the government welcomes the
participation of the civil society and Non-Governmental
Organizations in the fight against drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner made the remarks while officially inaugurating
the first Mr and Miss Anti-drug for the Copperbelt region at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
He urged youths to help solve the drug abuse related problems,
especially among the peers and communities.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of youths in the fight against drug trafficking
and abuse in society is a cardinal step to solve the problem which
has a devastating effect on the moral fibre of the people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DEC senior assistant commissioner Aaron Zulu
appealed to the business community and other interested parties to
support the government's steps to wipe out drug abuse in
communities.
</P>
<P>
"As a department to succeed in the programs, we need financial
and material support as the government has not sufficient
resources to handle such programs alone," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zulu observed that drug abuse in learning institutions has
undermined the pupil's academic ability and performance.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Heat claimed their
fifth straight victory when Alonzo Mourning led Miami past the
New York Knicks for a 94-88 victory on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mourning scored 25 points and P.J. Brown added 21 to help the
Heat (6-1) for the triumph, which handed the Knicks (4-4) their
third loss in a row in this season's first instalment of one of
the NBA's most bitter rivalries.
</P>
<P>
Miami jumped in front 4-2 on Jamal Mashburn's layup just over a
minute into play and never trailed thereafter. They led by eight
after the first quarter and first half and by 13 after three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
Knicks guard Latrell Sprewell had a rough night, managing just
six points on 2-of-14 shooting in 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Shaquille O'Neal returned from a one-game
suspension and paced the Lakers with 23 points and 11 rebounds in
a 93-88 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
Isaiah Rider had 24 points but missed a potential game-tying 3-
pointer in the closing seconds as Atlanta's spirited rally fell
short.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks trailed by as many as 20 points in the fourth quarter
but used a 17-4 run and climbed within 91-88 on Dikembe Mutombo's
layup with 47 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Chris Webber scored 32 points and grabbed 12
rebounds and Jon Barry helped the Kings to a strong fourth quarter
as they beat the Denver Nuggets 126-116.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Visitors to Be Educated about Traffic Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to Sydney during the
Olympic Games will be educated about Australian traffic rules to
reduce road deaths next year, an official of the Australian
Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said on Monday in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Diverting the overseas emergency "911" number to "triple O",
distributing a road map with traffic rules to hotels and car hire
agencies and placing "keep left" stickers on car dashboards are
among the road safety strategies being considered by the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael McFadden from the ATSB said that a lack of
understanding and general disregard for traffic rules among
tourists attending the Sydney Olympic Games was expected to
increase visitor deaths by up to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speeding, drivers miscalculating distances between towns,
unfamiliarity with driving on the left-hand side of the road,
infrequent use of seatbelts and motorists not used to rural roads
were named as contributing factors.
</P>
<P>
Tourism NSW figures indicated around 300,000 additional
tourists will visit the New South Wales (NSW) state next year,
with the majority in Sydney, NSW's capital, for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Research showed that most accidents involving head-on crashes
occurred among motorists who came from countries where they drove
on the other side of the road.
</P>
<P>
Tourists often failed to wear seatbelts because this was often
not necessary or poorly enforced back home.
</P>
<P>
Speeding was also a problem with drivers, mainly from Europe,
miscalculating the distances between Australian cities.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic road safety campaign will involve three key
messages, including looking first right before crossing the road,
wearing a seatbelt and keeping to the left-side of the road when
driving.
</P>
<P>
The dangers of speeding and driving while fatigued would also
be part of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Messages would be displayed in public areas and on plane
arrival videos.

NANNING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese frontier guards in
Beihai in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region announced
today that they have intercepted 118 Chinese citizens attempting
to sneak into New Zealand.
</P>

The guards quickly mobilized manpower and stopped the boat that
left the harbor in Beibu Gulf. The group, consisting of 74 males
and 44 females, were led by four "snakeheads", or organizers of
the illegal immigration. They are mostly from coastal areas
including Fujian Province and Beihai and Qinzhou in Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
The boat, as well as some goods and materials, were confiscated
by the guards. The four "snakeheads" were later detained by local
police. Other members of the group were sent home after being

"We have to formulate policy that will encourage investors to

<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the national capital,
plans to spend 21.5 billion yuan (2.6 billion U.S. dollars) to
resolve water pollution by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The program aims at getting rid of rubbish floating on 30
rivers and 600 hectares of lakes in the city, planting trees along
the banks, and allowing fresh water fish to return to the lakes.
</P>
<P>
A survey reveals that 80 percent of Beijing's lakes and rivers
have been polluted and the city has become one of the most
seriously polluted cities in the world. Many residents in Beijing
dare not to use running water and have to buy purified water.
</P>
<P>
According to a new regulation, the Beijing city government will
severely punish those work units and persons who dump harmful
waste products into rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, factories that might cause water
pollution will not be granted construction permits.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is now bidding for the 2008 Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> More Investment for Shennongjia Nature Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China will inject about 19
million yuan for the second phase construction of the Shennongjia
State Nature Reserve in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
During the second phase, construction of open-air protection
and ecological monitoring facilities will be given priority, and
basic water and power supplies and roads will be improved.
</P>
<P>
The second phase construction, approved by the State Forestry
Administration, is scheduled to be finished by 2003. Located in
the northwestern part of Hubei Province, Shennongjia State Nature
Reserve is one of the country's five major nature reserves listed
for construction.
</P>
<P>
Local officials believe that implementation of the second phase
project will not only greatly improve the protection of
Shennongjia -- China's most important gene bank of animal and
plant species -- but also produce a favorable and significant
impact on the Three Gorges water control project located just 35
km away from the nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
Protection of forest resources at Shennongjia will help improve
the ecological system in nearby areas by reducing the amount of
silt in the Three Gorges reservoir area. The second phase project
will also create good conditions for improving tourism at the
Nature Reserve, which will in turn raise funds for protection
efforts. From January to September this year about 300,000 people
visited the reserve, said Xie Dengfeng, a local official.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1982, some 19 million yuan has been spent on
building outside protection networks and ecological monitoring
systems at Shennongjia. As a result, some rare and endangered
animals and plant species have markedly increased.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, there were only 500 golden monkeys at Shennongjia but
the number has risen to 760 in 1998. A new golden monkey
domestication and propagation center, the first of its kind in the
world, is being built at the nature reserve to protect and look
after golden monkeys.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, Chinese scientific researchers have found
32 new plant species at the Reserve, including five endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 70,000 hectares, Shennongjia State Nature
Reserve has a favorable climate and has a diversity of plant and
animal species. The Reserve has more than 3,000 kinds of plants
and about 500 kinds of vertebrates. Thirty-four species of plants
and seventy species of animals are listed under state protection.

<HEADLINE> Use of Agricultural Pesticides in New Zealand Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The use of agricultural
pesticide in New Zealand has shown an overall reduction, according
to a research released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The research, carried out by Dr. Pat Holland of NZ HortResearch
and Dr. Anis rahman of NZ AgResearch, showed that total pesticide
use rose between 1984 and 1994, reaching a peak of about 3,700
tons of active ingredient per annum, and has since declined to the
1998 total of 3,300 tons.
</P>
<P>
About two thirds of total use is concentrated in four classes
of pesticides (phenoxy hormones, phosphonyls, inorganic
fungicides, dithiocarbamates) which have excellent records of very
low human and environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
For the agriculture and forestry sectors as a whole, the
research said, control of weeds is often the main priority with
herbicides continuing to be the most cost-effective technology.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Beats Hingis for Advanta Tennis Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- American Lindsay Davenport
served notice that she is ready for next week's Chase
Championships with a convincing 6-3, 6-4 victory over world No. 1
Martina Hingis of Switzerland in today's Advanta Championship
final in Pennsylavania, the United States.
</P>
<P>
In what may be a preview of the final at the season-ending
event in New York, Davenport fired seven aces en route to her
sixth WTA Tour title of the year and her second win of the season
over Hingis, who dethroned Davenport for the No. 1 ranking on
August 9. Hingis leads the WTA Tour with seven titles in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"I just felt great playing and I went for my shots," Davenport
said. "My serve definitely kept in the match today. To win this is
pretty exciting."
</P>
<P>
Both players held serve in the second set until the 10th game.
With Hingis serving at deuce she committed a backhand error which
forced match point. But the Swiss teenager fired an ace to
Davenport's backhand side which kept her alive. Hingis managed to
save a second match point, but faced a third after hitting a
forehand wide. Off her second serve, Hingis hit a backhand into
the net to give Davenport the victory.
</P>
<P>
In her first event since aggravating a wrist injury last month
in Filderstadt, Germany, Davenport lost only one set en route to
the title, including an impressive 6-1, 6-2 semi-final victory
over world No. 3 Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
Davenport pocketed a first prize of $80,000 for winning her
25th career title. She holds an 8-7 lead in the all-time series
with Hingis, including a 6-4, 6-3 victory in the final at Sydney,
Australia in January in their only previous meeting this season.
</P>
<P>
Davenport will be the second seed at the Chase Championships,
which gets under way on Monday, and will face Amelie Mauresmo of
France in the first round. Davenport lost to Hingis in last year's
final.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Hingis was appearing in her tour-best 12th
final of the year, but posted her second straight runner-up finish.
She lost to Venus Williams in the final of her home event in
Zurich three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Hingis will be the top seed at the Chase Championships and will
meet Sandrine Testud of France in the first round.

<HEADLINE> One in 10 teens in New Zealand Tries Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- One in 10 young New
Zealanders tries to commit suicide, according to guidelines for NZ
doctors released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, released by New Zealand Youth Affairs Minister
Tony Ryall, have been developed by the Royal New Zealand College
of General Practitioners because of concerns about New Zealand's
high youth suicide rate.
</P>
<P>
On average one in 4,000 young people aged 15-24 commits suicide
and in 1997 there were 142 suicide deaths in that age group.
</P>
<P>
However, up to one in 10 will attempt suicide. Most attempts
are minor and do not require medical attention, but one in 500
leads to hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
The figures have been compiled from the New Zealand Health
Information Service and other research projects.
</P>
<P>
Guidelines project leader Bruce Adlam said the research shows
that many youths visit their general practitioners (GPs) shortly
before thinking about committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
Often suicidal thoughts are linked to mental disorders and
stressful life events, such as relationship breakdowns, according
to the research.
</P>
<P>
Doctors are advised to create youth-friendly offices, including
being flexible enough to see youth patients quickly if required.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines will be sent to GPs and practice nurses, school
nurses, psychologists and psychiatrists around the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Economy Recovers Moderately in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy
recovered moderately in the first half of 1999, with gross
national product (GNP) growing at 2.9 percent and gross domestic
product (GDP) increasing by 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government predicted that GDP for the whole year
of 1999 will increase by about 3 percent while GNP grow by 3.3 to
3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the country's moderate recovery in 1999 was based
on favorable performance in agriculture and services, expansionary
monetary policy, as well as a sizable public spending stimulus.
</P>
<P>
Nourished by favorable weather conditions and the robust growth
of the livestock subsector, agricultural production grew by 6.18
percent in the first nine months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture accounts for 20 percent of GDP, the sum of all
goods and services produced in the country, excluding the earnings
of overseas Filipino workers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the services sector posted moderate growth at 3.5
percent during the first half as consumer confidence improved due
to the relative stability of domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
Experts expected the agriculture and services sector to expand
by around 6 percent and 3 percent respectively for the whole of
1999.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the monetary policy, the gradual easing of interest
rates since late 1998 has created an environment conducive to
business.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of 1999, the central bank of the Philippines
has cut its overnight interest rates for 21 times, bringing the
overnight lending rate to 11 percent from 15.375 percent while
lowering the borrowing rate to 8.75 percent from 13.375 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has also adopted a so-called "two-tier"
approach, where the central bank pays a lower rate on commercial
bank deposits exceeding 3 billion pesos (75 million U.S. dollars),
to encourage credit expansion by commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Another measure taken by the central bank was cutting the
reserve requirement imposed on commercial banks. From the start of
the year, the central bank has cut the reserve requirement rate
from 17 to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that a one-percentage-point reserve cut is
likely to free up to some 11 billion pesos (275 million dollars)
in fresh liquidity into the financial system, and boost banks'
holdings which they can lend to borrowers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government continued its pump priming
activities, specifically on basic services, primarily on
education, health and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, government expenditure is planned at 380.6 billion
pesos (9.5 billion dollars), 10.5 percent higher than that of
1998. In the first half of 1999, government consumption
expenditure grew by 6.9 percent compared to the same period of
last year. The government expenditure for next year will increase
by 10.9 percent to 415.8 billion pesos (10.4 billion dollars) from
that of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to the recovery of the economy
include a steady increase of the country's exports, a stable peso
and the falling inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Exports posted an increase of 17.0 percent during the first
nine months of 1999, thanks to the ongoing recovery of Asian
neighbors and the rising demand in major industrialized markets.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso has stabilized at between 39 to 40 pesos.
Inflation for the first 10 months averaged at 7.2 percent, which
is below the target of 8 percent to 9 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said, some challenges remain if the country
wants to walk out of the financial crisis and attain a sustainable
growth.
</P>
<P>
One major challenge is the increasing fiscal deficit which
poses a downside risk to macroeconomic management.
</P>
<P>
As of October, the government incurred a deficit of 96.8
billion pesos (2.4 billion dollars), 13.5 billion pesos (337.5
million dollars) higher than the planned 83.3 billion pesos (2.08
billion dollars) due to the higher expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said if the government cannot control the ballooning
deficit, interest rates would go up. They said it is crucial for
the government to take new tax measures and reform the state-owned
enterprises to bring the fiscal deficit down to sustainable
levels.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge comes from the country's industry sector,
which contracted 1.4 percent in the first semester, higher than
the negative growth rate of 0.3 percent in the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investments generated by the government fell to
212.4 billion pesos (5.31 billion dollars) in the first half, down
by 5.7 percent compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
To attain sustainable growth, analysts said, more concerted
action is also required to bring down the incidence of poverty,
which stands at 32 percent in 1997, and the level of unemployment,
at 9.6 percent in 1998. These are among the highest in the region.

<HEADLINE> Britain Expected to Raise Pension for Gurkhas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government will
increase the pension for former Gurkha soldiers before the
Christmas, the Kathmandu Post Monday quoted Foreign Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I am assured that the pension of former Gurkha soldiers will
be significantly increased," Mahat said Sunday at a function
organized by Nepal Ex-Serviceman's Association.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said he had urged British Prime Minister Tony Blair to
bring a package that would be satisfactory for the Gurkhas who
served in the British Army.
</P>
<P>
About 450,000 Gurkha soldiers had fought for the British Army
in various wars and 15,000 of them were killed in wars. More than
3,000 Gurkhas are still in active service for Britain.
</P>
<P>
After retirement, a Gurkha soldier receives 32 U.S. dollars for
pension per month, while his British counterpart receives 760 U.S.
dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
Retired Gurkhas and their families have been pressing the
British government for equal pensions with their British
counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government Borrows Heavily From Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government
borrowed 16.14 billion taka (322.8 million U.S. dollars) from the
scheduled banks in the country on Sunday, the highest amount in a
single day during the last two years, The Financial Express
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
But such borrowing was necessary for the government to meet its
current expenditure following a shortfall in its revenue income,
the newspaper quoted banking sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the total borrowing, 14.70 billion taka (294 million
dollars) was borrowed against 28-day government treasury bills
through an open auction conducted by the Bangladesh Bank on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rate of such government borrowing was low as most
commercial banks offered lower rates to the government to reduce
the amount of their idle funds that bear costs, the report said,
quoting fund managers.
</P>
<P>
A number of commercial banks have long been facing problems
from surplus liquid funds and tried to park their money in
government treasury bills, because of lower investment activities
and higher deposit growth, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
But experts feared a rising inflation rate and a lowering
growth rate at the end of the year as the government's borrowing
had an inflationary pressure and such money was being spent in
unproductive sectors.
</P>
<P>
The government collected 148.37 billion taka (2.967 billion
dollars) of revenue in the July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year, 5.5
percent short of the original target of 157 billion taka (3.14
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Absorbs 7 Bln Dollars of Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar had drawn a total of
7.101 billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment as of the end of
July this year since it opened to foreign investment in late 1988,
according to the latest issue of "Advertisement and Market
Directory" published locally.
</P>
<P>
The investment, from 24 countries and regions, cover a total of
317 projects.
</P>
<P>
Of the projects, those in the oil and gas sector drew the
largest amount of investment, reaching 2.30 billion dollars,
followed by manufacturing (1.46 billion dollars), hotels and
tourism (1.04 billion dollars), real estate (997.14 million
dollars) and mining (507.25 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that Singapore ranked the first among
foreign investors, injecting into the country 1.49 billion
dollars, followed by Britain (1.35 billion dollars), Thailand
(1.25 billion dollars), Malaysia (587 million dollars) and the
United States (582 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar adopted the open-door market-oriented economic
policy in late 1988, the investment environment has gradually
improved for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the impact of the Asian financial crisis, the
inflow of foreign investment into Myanmar has dropped steadily.
For instance, investment from member countries of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) fell by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Myanmar received only 1.26
billion dollars of foreign investment in 1997, 248.26 million
dollars in 1998 and 11.82 million dollars in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The declining foreign investment inflow has brought about
negative effects on the country's economy.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports Increased Export to Asia, Europe and North America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- During the first ten months
of 1999, the exports of Shanghai reached 35.4 billion US dollars,
up 19.8 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>

The imports of general trade have also increased drastically by

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded at a
presidential election rally of the main opposition United National
Party (UNP) on Sunday evening, killing one person and injuring 37
others, police sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A sub-inspector and seven other police constables who were on
duty at the venue at Eppawela in North Central Province were among
the injured, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga has directed the
police to immediately investigate the bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
Opposition and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe had left the
venue earlier after delivering his speech earlier than scheduled,
as he had to keep another appointment, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe is the candidate of the UNP in the presidential
election slated for December 21.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded at the time Wickremesinghe had been due to
speak. He later told journalists in Colombo that it had been an
attempt on his life.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day at Eppawela, about 210 km north of the
capital Colombo, there had been the burning of tyres and the
destruction of party posters indicating the possibility of
violence, UNP officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since last Friday, two election offices of the UNP had been
attacked. UNP officials have expressed fear that the incidents of
violence will mount as the election day approaches.

<HEADLINE> Biodiversity Flourishes at Shennongjia Nature Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Cold, rainy weather and
complicated geography that have kept man at bay have proved
blessings for the eco-environment of Shennongjia State Nature
Reserve in central China.
</P>
<P>
Location, above all, has been the major reason rare and ancient
plant and animal species at Shennongjia have flourished, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed a "Noah's Arc" for animals and plants in the glacial
period, the Shennongjia area in modern-day Hubei province remained
virtually unchanged during the Quarternary Period some 2.5 million
years ago, when glacier activity was prevalent elsewhere in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese botanist Zheng Zhong said that Shennongjia has
preserved an array of plants that existed in the Tertiary Period
and is widely called a home of living plant fossils.
</P>
<P>
According to zoologist Yang Qiren, Shennongjia has about 60
species of state-protected animals and is the place where albino
animals roam and the legendary Bigfoot originated.
</P>
<P>
The shifting of the Himalayan mountains produced Shennongjia
and left the area full of mountains, ravines and forests.
Shennongjia also served as a vital passage for migrating animals.
</P>
<P>
Animals and plants have been well protected since China started
construction on the 70,000-hectare nature reserve at Shennongjia
in 1986. The reserve has 2,280 kinds of vascular bundle plants,
including 50 kinds of rare and endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Shennongjia Nature Reserve is recognized by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as one
of the world's biosphere preservation zones in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists are taking advantage of the rich wild plant
gene resources at Shennongjia. The Agricultural Modernization
Institute of Hubei Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences has
specially built an artificial plant resource gene bank where more
than 11,000 plant samples obtained from Shennongjia reserve are
kept for transgenic experiments.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu Changyi, the head of the institute, they have
successfully developed a fine-quality maize strain and high-
nutrition, high-output spinach by transplanting plant genes from
Shennongjia.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Introduces New Promotion Scheme for Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) has agreed to add rubber, coffee, tea and
beans and peas to a new five-year scheme promoting ASEAN
agricultural and forest products, the Jakarta Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN said in a press statement issued by the association's
secretariat here that the new scheme superseded the one signed in
1994, which had already included 11 other agricultural and
forestry products.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to add four additional products was reached
during a meeting of ASEAN ministers of agriculture and forestry
held recently in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei.
</P>
<P>
The new scheme is aimed at improving the competitiveness of
these products in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, ASEAN would undergo joint efforts in
negotiations and bargainings, including addressing issues and
problems faced by member countries in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, guidelines within the scheme would be established
to counter campaigns against ASEAN products and to overcome
discriminatory and unfair practices imposed by importing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The scheme would also promote inter-ASEAN trade of these
agricultural and forestry products, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Already included in the 1994 scheme are carrageenan and other
seaweed, frozen chicken, tapioca, frozen prawns, canned tuna,
canned pineapple, palm oil, coconut oil, cocoa, forest products
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore,
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia
and Laos.

BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- World champion Maria Butyrskaya
won the third title for Russia when she claimed victory in the
women's event at the Sparkassen Cup figure skating tournament in
Gelsenkirchen, Germany, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Butyrskaya skated to the classic "Swan Lake" but was spotty in
her technical elements. She stepped out of a triple flip and had
trouble with landings on two other jumps.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Butyrskaya managed marks between 5.3 and 5.7
for technique which had four good triple jumps in all. For
artistry she had marks between 5.6 and 5.8.
</P>
<P>
Elena Liashenko of Ukraine was second with two-time European
champion Irina Slutskaya of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russians earlier took the men and pairs titles as Yevgeny
Plushenko completed eight triple jumps and barely missed a quad to
capture the men's event.
</P>
<P>
Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov took the pairs crown for the
second consecutive year here.
</P>
<P>
Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz won their first
event outside of their country in seven years as they took the ice
dance title with some jazzy steps to Harry Connick Jr. crooning.
</P>
<P>
The next Grand Prix meet is the Lalique Trophy in Paris
starting on Thursday with the Cup of Russia in St. Petersburg the
following week.
</P>

BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- FC Kaiserslautern announced in
Kaiserslautern on Sunday that it has extended the contract of
coach Otto Rehhagel for two years until 2002.
</P>
<P>
Rehhagel, 61, took over the German club in 1996 and guided the
side to the Bundeslia title in 1997 as the first ever newly-
promoted club to claim the championship.
</P>
<P>
The decision of Rehhagel came as a surprise to many since other
clubs were reportedly interested in his services.
</P>
<P>
His authority has been hurt by losing a power struggle with
Swiss player Ciriaco Sforza earlier this season. Kaiserslautern
also has struggled since reaching the Champions Cup quarter-finals
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But the club won both in the Bundesliga and reaching the UEFA
Cup's third round.
</P>
<P>
Rehhagel also led Werder Bremen to two German titles and a Cup
Winners Cup title in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Hold Surprise Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat held surprise talks late Sunday night amid uncertainty over
a scheduled Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Barak met this evening with Chairman Yasser
Arafat in the Tel Aviv area. The meeting is part of the ongoing
dialogue... in which they discussed ways to advance the
negotiations," Barak's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
failed to resolve a dispute over the second phase of Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank scheduled for Monday under a latest
peace accord signed in September.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Sunday that the
planned Israeli troop pullout from 5 percent of the West Bank,
stipulated in the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, would not go ahead
Monday because of the dispute over the details of the land
involved.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel should hand over 3 percent of the
West Bank to Palestinian civil control and 2 percent to full
Palestinian control at the second of three stages of troop
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel has relinquished 7 percent of the West Bank in the first
phase.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet and parliament have approved the map of the
second withdrawal, but the PNA rejected the map, insisting that
more populated areas be included in the land. Arafat has refused
to sign on the map.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether Israel would carry out the withdrawal
unilaterally or not. Israeli Internal Security Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami said earlier Sunday that Israel would carry out the
redeployment as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami stressed that it was up to Israel to designate the
areas it would transfer to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio reported that Barak and Arafat discussed the
withdrawal issue but reached no agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached
an agreement on the agenda for the "final-status" talks, which
began last Monday with an aim of reaching a framework accord by
February 2000 and a permanent peace by September.
</P>
<P>
At a 90-minute meeting in the village of Neveh Ilan, 15
kilometers west of Jerusalem, the two sides agreed to divide each
of their negotiating team into four sub-teams which will discuss
separately the status of Jerusalem, the final borders, the fate of
Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements, and the sharing of
water resources.
</P>
<P>
As the Israeli and Palestinian teams bargain on the negotiation
tables, reports said Barak and Arafat have established a parallel
"back channel" in order to resolve dispute emerged from the talks
and defuse tensions.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from both sides have admitted the existence of
direct dialogue between the two leaders, but said that it would
not substitute the public negotiations.

STOCKHOLM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A late goal from Mehmet
Scholl lifted Germany a 1-0 victory over Norway in a soccer
exhibition game of the millennium in Oslo, Norway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Germans were not able to produce more than a couple of
scoring chances in the first half until the Bayern Munich player
fired a free kick from over 20 meters past Norway's goalie in
extra time.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian forward Jan Derek Sorensen had many excellent attacks
into the German defense line but they missed the final punch.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Lothar Matthaeus played his 143rd international for
Germany and tied former Swedish national team goalkeeper Thomas
Ravelli atop the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
Ravelli was one of Sweden's biggest heroes in the 1994 World

eventual world champion Brazil 1-0 in the semi-finals and later
won the bronze-medal game.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- After a 10-year effort, the
Qomolangma Nature Reserve in the Tibet Autonomous Region has done
much work to clean up the mountain environment and preserve the
area's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the nature reserve, which was set up in
1989 to protect the environment and wild animals and plants,
attracted 5 million U.S. dollars from seven international
organizations to use for a batch of projects, in addition to 10
million yuan from the local government.
</P>
<P>
Now the reserve, the country's third largest, has sound
transportation, telecommunications, tourism and other
infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
The 8,848-meter Mount Qomolangma is the world's highest
mountain peak. The nature reserve has been threatened by
increasing mountaineering and tourism activities.
</P>
<P>
The reserve covers an area of 35,000 square kilometers and has
a population of 82,300. It includes Tingri, Nyalam, Dinggye and
Gyirong counties. It was listed as a state-level nature reserve in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve now aims to be included in the World
Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, the local people have cleaned up a
big amount of rubbish left behind by visitors.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that over 6,000 mountain climbers,
expeditions, and tourists visit the nature reserve annually.

GUANGZHOU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou Customs in south
China's Guangdong Province recently foiled a big auto smuggling
case involving cars valued at over 6.2 million yuan (about 740,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The country's biggest attempted car smuggling case so far this

Customs officers also seized a truck and a crane which were ready

</P>
<P>
Customs is investigating the case and the smugglers are still at
large.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the Guangzhou Customs has cracked 24 auto

<HEADLINE> North China Tackles Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, one of
China's heavy industry bases, will build 19 sewage plants by 2000
capable of treating two-thirds of the wastewater produced by the
whole province.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, a coastal province along the Bohai Sea, an interior
sea in northeast China, already has nine sewage plants under
construction.
</P>
<P>
A newly-built sewage plant with a capacity of handling 220,000
tons of untreated water daily has been put into operation in
Anshan city, China's steel empire.
</P>
<P>
Currently more than half of the polluted water in the province
runs directly from factories into rivers.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has asked eight cities located in the
drainage area of Liaohe River, which runs across the province, to
build sewage plants. Any cities that do not have sewage plants
will be forbidden to built new hotels, restaurants and other
buildings.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 30 administrative decrees on environmental
protection and had 500 water pollution control projects for a
number of major coastal cities and lakes during the Ninth Five-
Year Plan (1996-2000), which called for 56 billion yuan in
spending.
</P>
<P>
China spent more than 80 billion yuan (about 9.6 billion U.S.
dollars) last year on the environment, more than one percent of
the country's GDP.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- At the foot of Mount
Motian, 60 kilometers northwest of Wu'an in north China's Hebei
province, everyone lives to be 85 or older.
</P>
<P>
Aihaoping Village has another mystery: Everyone dies of natural
causes. No cases of serious illness have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The long-life village has more than 30 households with more
than 130 people.
</P>
<P>
Villagers attribute their longevity to breathing fresh mountain
air, eating chemical-free food, and drinking especially high-
quality spring water.
</P>
<P>
Near the village are three spring-water natural wells, from
which about 260 cubic meters of cool water flows all day long,
despite the season of the year, drought or floods.
</P>
<P>
The wells are fringed by more than 1,600 hectares of primitive
forest, where in excess of 200 varieties of wild medicinal herbs
and plants grow.

<HEADLINE> Excavation of Bronze Age City in China Progressing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists in northeast
China have excavated over 4,000 sq.m. of a stone city erected
during the Bronze Age, about 3,500 to 4,000 years ago, in what is
now Beipiao City.
</P>
<P>
The large-scope dig, sponsored by the Liaoning Provincial
Institute of Archaeology, will benefit the study of the city's
construction, its social conditions and people's daily life in
north China in ancient times, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The project's leader said that the stone city was built wide at
the bottom and narrow at the top. It is circled by a moat 3.5 to 4
meters deep.
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, the archeologists have unearthed
more than 180 meters of city walls and two sections of the moat
east and south of the city, 19 stone building sites, five stone-
supported caves in the west part, and three stone walls and a
stone cave in the northeastern area.
</P>
<P>
Also uncovered were over 1,000 of rare relics, including stone
and bone ware, said the archeologists.

<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China's positive fiscal policies and consumption expansion
measures have produced good results, with the gross domestic
product (GDP) growing at a rate of 7.4 percent for the first three
quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
-- The paper's commentary calls on the grassroots units of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) to stand at the forefront of the

 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"

 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Crude oil production in China is predicted to remain stable
next year, to fuel economic growth widely anticipated to strike
seven per cent or more, said a senior government official, adding
the widening gap between demand and domestic output, however, is
to be narrowed or filled by increases of imports as expected
around the world.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albania to Take Emergency Steps to Solve Power Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Ilir
Meta asked the government on Sunday to take emergency steps to
tackle the serious power shortage in his country.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting, Meta said the government must work out an
emergency plan to import electric power from neighboring countries
and make rational use of domestic resources to overcome the
current difficulties. He also asked the government to seek other
kinds of energy as alternatives to electric power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister criticized the electric power
department for not taking effective measures. He said the
government would look into the responsibilities of those who
neglect their duties.
</P>
<P>
Albania's electricity production, mainly hydropower, has
dropped sharply because of little precipitation this year.
Electricity is imported daily, but still cannot meet 70 percent of
the demand. The country has to impose control of power supply and
to cut power supply time by more than 10 hours a day in some
places.

<HEADLINE> Over 50 Kilos of Heroin Flood Indonesia Every Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The total amount of heroin
smuggled into various cities in Indonesia may be up to 50
kilograms per month, the Indonesian Observer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Wilhelmus Laturete, head of the drugs and narcotics
division at the Indonesian police headquarters, was quoted as
saying that police had received information from the Drug
Enforcement Agency (DEA) that at least one member of international
drug syndicates entered Indonesia every day carrying around 1.5
kilograms of heroin.
</P>
<P>
In certain instances, there were up to three persons per day
with a total of 4.5 kilograms, he said, adding that most of the
drugs came from the golden triangle of Thailand-Laos-Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Laturete said city couriers carried the drugs from the main
distributors in Jakarta to other cities and to consumers in
various night clubs and bars.
</P>
<P>
Data from the DEA indicated that foreign couriers consider
security at airports in Indonesia is not good, and they believe
they can enter easily without being detected.
</P>
<P>
"We need sophisticated electronic means to detect drugs at the
airport, and we also need more detectives and more funds to
support the special operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Data from Jakarta police as well as from Customs offices in
other big cities indicate that police were only able to confiscate
around 15 kilograms of heroin each month, which suggests they may
have failed to apprehend dozens of drug syndicate members carrying
around 40 kilograms of drugs per month.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta police calculate that if one gram is used by a consumer
per month, it means the number of total users may reach 40,000 per
month or around 480,000 per year, most of them from the younger
generation.
</P>
<P>
Many ecstasy pills, amphetamines, marijuana and cocaine are
sent by certain individuals from Nigeria, Thailand and Singapore
to Indonesia through air cargo and post offices, packed so
sophisticatedly that even police dogs can not detect them, the
report said.

STOCKHOLM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Thomas Enqvist became the
first Swede to capture the Stockholm Open three times on Sunday
when he routed fellow Magnus Gustafsson 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 for the
winning title.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist, ranked seventh in the world, improved his head-to-head
record with Gustafsson to 6-2.
</P>
<P>
"I played good tennis today and hit the ball really well," said
Enqvist, who won titles here in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to be the first Swede to win here three times."

Adelaide and then reached the Australian Open final a week later,
only to lose to Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Davenport Edges Hingis in Philadelphia Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- American Lindsay Davenport
won her final tuneup for this week's season-ending Chase
Championships with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over number one-ranked
Martina Hingis of Switzerland in the final of the Advanta tennis
championships in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
The win was the number two-ranked Davenport's sixth tournament
title of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Davenport injured her left wrist in a match in Filderstadt,
Germany, in early October.
</P>
<P>
Davenport was forced to pull out of her doubles match Saturday
night when her wrist swelled up, but she was able to bounce back
Sunday and play an efficient, controlled match against Hingis,
whom she has now defeated in five of her last seven tries dating
back to the beginning of 1998. The two hadn't played since the
beginning of 1999 at a tournament in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Davenport countered Hingis' assortment of drop shots, lobs and
hard groundstrokes with varied placement on her serves that had
Hingis off-balance for much of the match. Davenport lost her serve
in the second game of the match and not thereafter.
</P>
<P>
A service break in the fifth game of the first set was enough
for Davenport to carve out an advantage she held until the ninth
game, when she broke Hingis again and won the set when Hingis
netted a forehand.
</P>
<P>
The second set proceeded on serve as both players saved break
points by serving and volleying, Hingis in the second game and
Davenport in the fifth. Serving at 4-5, Hingis saved one match
point with a service winner, and Davenport shanked a backhand
return on a second match point before winning the match when
Hingis netted a backhand.
</P>
<P>
Hingis and Davenport are seeded number one and two,
respectively, for this week's Chase Championships.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Wants Commonwealth's Focus on Terrorism, Child Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar has called on the Commonwealth to focus on
terrorism and its effects globally as well as child soldiers, the
Government Information Department said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that Kadirgamar made the appeal on
Saturday at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM)
presently underway in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar emphasized the need for the international community
"to intensify their collective action against terrorism" as Sri
Lanka has suffered from the devastating phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old war between
government troops and rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) who demand a separate state in the country's north and
east.
</P>
<P>
The government has usually branded LTTE rebels as terrorists as
they have allegedly been involved in suicide bombing,
assassinations and other kinds of terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the widespread use of child soldiers, Kadirgamar
urged the Commonwealth countries to address the problem and
emphasized that "everything possible should be done to stop this
abominable phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention to the problem of child soldiers in Sri
Lanka, he said children as young as 10 years "are being used in
combat" by the LTTE guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In May 1998, the LTTE hierarchy gave an undertaking to the
United Nations special representative for children and armed
conflict Olara Otunnu that they would stop conscripting children
under 17 years of age.
</P>
<P>
But military officials said the LTTE has reneged on their
pledge and was continuing to use children as combatants in the
armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
They said the latest proof was the recovery of bodies of 49
child combatants, including 32 girls, in the 11 to 15 age group
during a search operation following a fierce battle at Ampakamam
in northern Sri Lanka in October.
