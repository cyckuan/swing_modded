EDITORIAL: A WEDGE IN THE CUBAN EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Feb. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Cubans have been told for many years that the decades-long U.S.
trade embargo against their country prevents them from buying even
aspirin from their northern neighbor. President Fidel Castro has
long used U.S. restrictions on the sale of medicines and medical
supplies to Cuba as an example of Washington's apparent inhumanity
_ and a source of his own legitimacy. So last week's U.S. health
care exhibition in Havana raised eyebrows, if not actual sales. The
exhibition was evidence of incremental changes in the embargo over
the last few years that suggest the Clinton administration knows
what ought to be done even as it avoids actually doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 companies sent representatives to last week's
exhibition, the first U.S. trade show in Cuba since the embargo was
imposed four decades ago. In turn, some 8,000 Cuban medical
professionals got a look at everything from sophisticated surgical
equipment to Pepto-Bismol.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act, medical supplies are
technically eligible for sale to Cuba. But they are subject to a
complex web of licensing and certification requirements that have
made it all but impossible to make an actual sale. Over the last
several years the Clinton administration has quietly eased some of
these requirements. But significant obstacles remain _ not least
the embargo's prohibition against direct banking relationships
between the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition shows that U.S. businesses are eager to open the
Cuban market. The administration's policy of nibbling away at an
obsolete embargo merely cedes a potentially lucrative market to
foreign competitors. The time is long overdue for a bolder form of
engagement.

BIBBY COMPLAINS ABOUT OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Henry Bibby is unhappy with the
officials again following the Trojans' road trip to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said Oregon State forward Jason Heide threw an intentional
elbow at Trojans center Kostas Charissis near the end of the
Trojans' 82-69 victory over the Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our guys got elbowed again and there was no action
taken,'' Bibby said. ``I was appalled by that. The kid should be
suspended. If my kid did it, he should be suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Charissis: ``I was running and he hit me with his elbow in
the chin.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Pacific-10 Conference reprimanded Arizona forward
Michael Wright and put him on probation for the rest of the season
for an elbow he threw at USC forward Abdullah Elmagbari.
</P>
<P>
   Lineup changes: Bibby said he still will probably start
Charissis over guard Nate Hair when the Trojans play bigger teams
like Stanford, who scored 27 points in two games in Oregon. But
Hair is expected to start Thursday when the Trojans face Cal, which
starts three players who are 6-foot-5 or smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a big team, we'll go with Kostas, if it's a small team
we'll go with Nate,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Step forward: Bibby said he took more from the Trojans' loss
against Oregon than their victory over Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It told me a lot about our team when we played Oregon, to go
there and be in a nip-and-tuck battle and not be rattled,'' Bibby
said. ``We hung in there. It's not that they beat us, I think we
beat ourselves. We had a chance to win that game on the road --
that was probably more encouraging than the victory over Oregon
State.''
</P>
<P>
   No comment: Bibby was asked if he knew the number of games USC
needed to win the Pac-10 to earn an NCAA bid? ``I do, but I'm not
going to share that with you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, ESPN.com's mock tournament bracket lists USC as a No.
9 seed playing Kent in the first round in the East region.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 warning: Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hansen sent out a memo
this week warning coaches not to touch or have bodily contact with
an official after a game, responding to the ending of last
Thursday's USC-Oregon women's basketball game at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   USC won, 74-73, on a last-second shot, and Oregon coach Jody
Runge protested the allowance of Women of Troy guard Tiffany
Elmore's jump shot at the buzzer. Runge allegedly grabbed an
official and held him by the shirt after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area bound: USC's women's basketball team (8-9, 3-4) travels
to Cal and Stanford this week. USC forward Denise Woods, who ranks
third in the Pac-10 in blocked shots (2.1 per game) is making her
homecoming after transferring from the University of San Francisco.

EDITORIAL: FOR NOW, A REAL CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Feb. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain's big victory in New Hampshire's Republican
presidential primary and Vice President Al Gore's narrow triumph on
the Democratic side send a powerful message. Voters are not ready
to anoint, at least for now, the candidates picked by each party's
establishment. As a result of this rebuff to the entitlement
strategies of Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, Americans may get to
witness one of the more competitive nomination battles in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sailed into the Granite State backed by practically every
leading Republican in the nation, not to mention his own family.
But McCain won the hearts of New Hampshire voters with a gabby,
joyful insurgency that emphasized personal character and moderate
fiscal policies. As for the Democrats, many experts counted Bill
Bradley out only a week ago, but his close showing against Gore
amounts to a license to prolong his challenge despite the animosity
of the party's Washington establishment. Because of their money and
support around the country, Bush and Gore still rate as the
front-runners for their parties' nominations. But the fight will be
tougher than might have seemed possible until recently. The vote
could be read as an invitation to the rest of the country to
experience a real campaign, complete with weekly debates, town
meetings and encounters with voters.
</P>
<P>
   The most extraordinary showing was certainly McCain's. The GOP
establishment will see the outcome as the work of independents
rather than genuine Republicans. But McCain's victory, built around
his challenge to the party's sterile reliance on tax cuts, special
interests and soft money, will force Washington Republicans to take
a searching look at Bush and may compel him to begin personal
attacks against McCain as they move into South Carolina. McCain
needs to keep rolling up victories there and elsewhere to compete
on March 7 in the decisive races in California and New York, where
it is more important than ever that he be allowed on the ballot.
New York Republicans, by the way, should flood the office of Gov.
George Pataki with telephone calls and letters demanding that he
abandon his authoritarian effort to prevent them from selecting
from a full roster of candidates in the state primary.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley showed impressive toughness and
determination. Gore secured an important victory, but it did not
come easily, nor was it large enough to end the Bradley challenge.
The former New Jersey senator surged ahead this winter but stumbled
with his shaky performance at the Iowa caucuses in January. He
engaged in an embarrassingly public soul-searching over whether to
attack Gore for his campaign distortions and fund-raising abuses in
1996. He finally did, but at first that only seemed to send his
ratings down. But over the weekend Bradley's message caught hold,
portending an even more contentious Democratic contest in the weeks
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, New Hampshire is a famous incubator of short-lived
political rebellions, of dreams that eventually get crushed. But
this year's insurgencies have a different root system, having been
nurtured in an atmosphere largely free of the anger of years past,
when the state suffered from recessions or the hollowing out of its
old industries. This year, after the dispiriting scandals of the
Clinton administration, the voters were taking a fresh look at
leadership and character. They were also thinking about what to do
with the budget surpluses and how to shore up the nation's
retirement, health care and education systems. On all these issues,
New Hampshire voters have had their say and, more important, set
the stage for a broader, longer national debate.

DAVIS ROLLS OUT EDUCATION REFORM PROPOSALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ &UR;  &LR; Continuing the state's push for education
reform, Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders Tuesday unveiled
five new bills to attract and train new teachers and promote higher
student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Davis told reporters at a news conference the $852 million
package builds on four initiatives he pushed last year that focused
on accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The package of bills will be carried by five Democratic
lawmakers, all members of the Latino caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders were unable to offer a detailed response to
the proposals because the governor's staff did not allow them to
attend the briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, chairman of the Republican
caucus, said the GOP is supportive of most of Davis' proposals.
Some, including Davis' plans to provide computer access for
elementary schools, ``reflect proposals we made,'' Brulte said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, will introduce a $228
million student achievement bill that will include providing merit
scholarships to 100,000 high school pupils a year and expanding Cal
Grant awards, which are given on the basis of need and merit, to
7,000 more students.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal Grant expansion came after Davis was criticized by some
who called the merit scholarships a ``subsidy for the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis on Tuesday defended the merit scholarships, saying that
those critics ``haven't spent a lot of time in the public schools''
which house many lower and middle-class students.
</P>
<P>
   Polanco, who did not attend the news conference, issued a
written statement that stressed the need for both types of aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without competitive merit, we cannot have a great society and
a strong economy,'' Polanco said. ``Without support for those who
have both merit and financial need, we will create a bifurcated
society where merit does not give access to opportunity. Clearly,
we need a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Van Nuys, will carry a $188 million
teacher recruitment bill that provides financial incentives to
attract veteran and new credentialed instructors.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides a one-time $2,000 award to each of 20,000 new,
credentialed teachers who take jobs at low-performing schools. It
also provides a forgivable home loan of $10,000 for 5,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child in the state of California deserves to have a
teacher who is fully qualified to teach,'' Alarcon said in a
statement. ``Far too many students are being taught by teachers
with emergency credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next eight years, California will need 300,000 new
teachers, according to state estimates. Some 28,500 teachers in
classrooms are not credentialed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Martha M. Escutia, D-Montebello, will introduce a $161
million bill to increase teacher training in reading, math and
instruction of English language learners.
</P>
<P>
   It also will provide money to expand the college preparatory
Advanced Placement courses in high schools. Davis said he wants
each high school to have access to at least four AP courses by the
2001 academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, will
introduce a $75 million bill to create three institutes for science
and innovation at three University of California campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Sarah Reyes, D-Fresno, will introduce a $200
million initiative that hopes to close the ``digital divide'' in
classrooms. The bill would provide money to purchase computers and
to train school staff to use them.

NEW NYC LAW DRAWS MORE CAMPAIGN DONORS WITH SMALLER GIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city's revised program for public financing of
election campaigns is reshaping the pattern of political
contributions, with candidates tapping a wider array of donors for
smaller amounts of money, figures compiled by the Campaign Finance
Board show.
</P>
<P>
   The board's analysis of the candidates' financial filings
indicates that, as of January, the 10 candidates who raised the
most money for next year's municipal elections received 21 percent
more in contributions from a base of donors that expanded by about
a third, compared with the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The increases are in large measure fueled by the law that took
effect at the end of 1998, under which the city matches
contributions of up to $250 on a four-to-one basis. Under the old
law, individual contributions up to $1,000 were matched two to one.
The result is that candidates are discouraged from seeking larger
contributions, because a $250 contribution is worth $1,250 after
matching, while a $1,000 contribution is only worth $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot more people making contributions, and I
believe that contributors are understanding that their smaller
contributions mean more to the candidate,'' said Nicole Gordon, the
executive director of the Campaign Finance Board, the city agency
that distributes the matching funds. ``What we're seeing is that
the smaller contributors are not going to be squeezed out by
wealthy contributors or by special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with four years ago, about three times the number of
candidates in the 2001 election have enrolled in the voluntary
public financing program, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor contributing to the increase is the city's term
limits law, which has barred the mayor, the public advocate, the
comptroller, 4 of the 5 borough presidents and 36 of the 51 City
Council members from seeking third terms.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the candidates seeking to fill those positions have said
that the new campaign financing law has helped neophyte candidates
with few political connections. ``The campaign finance law was
designed to encourage not just more candidates, but more citizen
participation in campaigns,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new law also reduced the maximum contribution a participant
in the program could accept in a citywide contest, from $7,700 to
$4,500, a change that is reshaping contribution patterns.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, the average contribution was $790, the board
said, compared with an average contribution of $685 recorded in
January for candidates running next year. Comptroller Alan G.
Hevesi, who is planning to run for mayor, had the highest number of
contributors _ 3,983, compared with the approximately 3,000 donors
the two leading candidates _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Ruth W.
Messenger _ each had in the last mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Democrats who will seek the mayoralty next year _
City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, Public Advocate Mark Green
and Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer _ each had slightly
more than 2,000 contributors. Vallone had the highest average
contribution _ $972 _ while the other three candidates reported an
average contribution ranging between $816 and $866.
</P>
<P>
   The law also bans candidates who receive matching funds from
accepting corporate contributions, sets the limit for individual
contributions at $4,500 and caps total spending by each candidate
on the mayoral primary at $5,501,000.

ANALYSIS: N.H., RELISHING ITS ROLE, UPSETS THE APPLE CART _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: INSERTS new 2nd graf of background.) 
 (With NH-REPUBS, NH-DEMS and sidebars) 
(nk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ It was not a great night for the dauphins of
2000, though worse for George W. Bush than for Al Gore, and the
results suggested strongly that both parties now face long, costly
struggles for their presidential nominations. As they have so often
before, the voters of New Hampshire upset the apple cart of
conventional wisdom, throwing both races into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, it seemed at least possible that Bush and Gore
could dispatch their rivals in short order, bringing the entire
process to an end when only a few hundred thousand Americans,
living in small states, had had a chance to vote. That clearly will
not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of Texas, has far more money than the man who
trounced him here, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and he has better
organizations in most of the states whose Republican primaries come
next. For now, he remains the favorite, but McCain's victory _ not
only the fact but also the size of it, which staggered the Bush
camp _ dealt a painful blow to Bush's principal stock in trade: the
notion that his nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Bush get much traction from the argument, constantly
voiced by his supporters if not by the candidate himself, that he
is the Republicans' most likely winner in November. Voters in the
Republican primary split nearly evenly as to whether Bush or McCain
would make the stronger nominee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won because voters in the Republican contest said that
what mattered most to them was finding a man of unshakeable
character, willing to stand up for his convictions. McCain filled
that bill for them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won by a relatively narrow margin, and a win is of course
better than a loss. But he had hoped to blunt the challenge of
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey in the Iowa caucuses and the
primary here, and in that he failed. As a result he now faces
clusters of tests in states across the country, starting in early
March. Gore has the organizational edge, but Bradley can come close
to matching him dollar for dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides expect a bruising struggle, with more of the mutual
questioning of motives that marked the final week here, even though
Bradley expresses disdain for what he calls ``politics as usual''
(read mud-slinging). The more personal and belligerent the contest
becomes, of course, the greater the potential damage to the
eventual victor. In years past, such damage has proved a major
handicap in the big show in November.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore told his followers late Tuesday night, ``I will never
make a negative personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, a Democrat, built a
seemingly unstoppable campaign on the same basis as Bush did this
year, amassing handfuls of endorsements from party bigwigs. But he
did poorly in New Hampshire and never managed to regain his
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll asked
Republicans who expressed a preference for Bush whether they would
consider switching to McCain if he began to win primaries. More
than 40 percent said they would.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush promised Tuesday night in his concession statement to
campaign in all 50 states, dismissing New Hampshire as a mere
``bump in the road.'' He said he would be a better candidate for
having faced competition here, and described South Carolina, where
Republicans vote on Feb. 19, as Bush country.
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the nation behaves like New Hampshire, this could
prove to be an outsiders' year. But this state's electorate is
quirky, with an unquenchable thirst for mavericks and rockers of
boats. In the past it has often come to idiosyncratic conclusions,
at least partly because it gets a much closer look at the
candidates than any of the other states do.
</P>
<P>
   For example, former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachustts won the
Democratic primary here in 1992, but had trouble repeating his
victory elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has never been particularly kind to candidates
with names made famous by their relatives. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., did poorly here. So did former Gov. Jerry Brown of
California and, much further back, Sen. Robert A. Taft of Ohio.
Eugene J. McCarthy, the anti-war insurgent, did well enough in the
momentous 1968 Democratic primary to help drive President Lyndon B.
Johnson from office.
</P>
<P>
   Another atypical aspect of New Hampshire is its election law.
Independents, those voters who are registered in neither party, can
vote in either the Republican or the Democratic primary, and exit
polls indicated that those voters had been crucial in McCain's
astonishing sweep.
</P>
<P>
   More than four voters in 10 in Tuesday's Republican balloting,
not much less than half, said that they were independents. McCain
beat Bush by better than 3-1 among those voters, providing most of
his margin of victory. Among registered Republicans, McCain
prevailed more narrowly, the exit polling showed.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern will not be repeated in most of their subsequent
contests, simply because most states exclude independents from
primary elections. But if McCain could somehow win the nomination _
a gargantuan ``if,'' to be sure _ his strength among independents
would be a significant advantage in the general election,
especially against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Exuberant, McCain said the results here marked ``the beginning
of the end for the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also benefited from the votes of independents, but fewer
of them voted in the Democratic than in the Republican race. Nearly
two in 10 of the Republican voters said they had flirted with
voting for Bradley before deciding, many at the last minute, to
back McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, independents voting in the Democratic contest, some of
them people who said they were exasperated with Clinton, gave
Bradley an indispensable lift. Without them, Gore, with strong
backing from union members, hard-core Democrats and women, would
have swamped him.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Andrew Smith, the director of the University of New
Hampshire Survey Center, said that McCain's Vietnam War record and
his backing of campaign-finance reform had convinced New Hampshire
voters that he was ``a stand-up guy.'' Campaign finance itself was
not a big issue, he said, but McCain's willingness to buck his
party redounded to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last week,'' Smith said, ``the Republican side looked
like the closer race, and more independents went that way'' _ even
though the Democratic contest eventually proved to be tighter, in
part because of the independents.
</P>
<P>
   A number of voters said that they had voted tactically.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ciarla, a 26-year-old teacher from Derry, explained: ``I'll
be voting for Al Gore in the general election, but I voted for the
next best guy today, John McCain, so George Bush doesn't show
strongly in New Hampshire. A lot of people think Bush is a shoo-in.
If it turns out to be Gore and McCain when I vote for president in
the fall, I'll be a happy man.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was by no means the first time that independents pouring into
the Republican race have played a major role in the New Hampshire
primary, the first in the nation. In 1996, they divided their votes
between Lamar Alexander and Pat Buchanan, which effectively denied
Bob Dole a victory. Similarly, in 1992, independents divided their
votes between President George Bush and Buchanan, shocking the
party, emboldening Buchanan and contributing to Bush's defeat that
November by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory was not only broad but deep. He was preferred,
according to the exit polls, by men and women, young and old, rich
and poor, those with advanced educations and those without, those
who had served in the nation's armed forces and those who had not.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was different in the Democratic balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore held the line among traditional Democratic groups, notably
trade union members, and ran strongly among women. More men voted
for Bradley, as did those with graduate degrees, presumably
including a significant share of the workers in the state's
expanding high-tech industries. Those with college degrees and
those with no degrees at all tended to opt for the vice president.

 MCCAIN STUNS BUSH  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the help of independent voters, John McCain trounced GOP
frontrunner George W. Bush in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday,
surprising political observers and making the Texan's nomination
appear less than inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory by a wide margin tied the Republican presi
dential race at one apiece after Bush won last week's Iowa cau
cuses.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was euphoric. ``Last June, I asked the people of New
Hampshire to make room in this election and in our party for the
forces of reform,'' McCain told a packed room of supporters in
Nashua. ``Well, thanks to you, my dear friends, we made room - and
we have sent a powerful message to Washington that change is
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected him to win, and I half-expected him to win handily
- but I never expected him to slaughter Bush,` Clark Hubbard, a
political scientist at the Univer sity of New Hampshire, told The
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   At press time, McCain had received about half of all the votes
cast, or 49 percent. Bush was second with just under a third of the
votes, or 31 percent, and publisher Steve Forbes fol lowed with 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the evening was one to be relished, perhaps the
biggest political victory of his life. Supporters and campaign
workers crammed into a Nashua ballroom and sang songs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bush rally, supporters listened to band music, but there
was little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush fund-raiser who at tended the rally said he felt as
though he has been ``socked in the face'' by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm floored. It doesn't add up,'' said Jeff Greenblum, a Texan
who traveled to New Hampshire to help the Bush campaign. ``There's
no spin here. He lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Bush rally, supporters registered their disbe
lief at the wide margin of Mc Cain's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! There's going to be a lot of gloom come over this room,''
said Jack Rueppel, 74, of Hooksett, who said he voted for Bush
because he believes he will improve the U.S. military. ``This may
not kill Bush, but it won't help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's top aides insisted they would charge forward without
making major adjustments to their campaign, but Greenblum and
others at the rally suggested the loss should serve as a wake up
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to re-jigger some thing, that's for sure,'' Green
blum said. `This is the oddest primary I have ever seen.`
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush supporters were subdued, the candidates' aides were
already looking beyond the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected there would be a bump in the road in this cam
paign, and the bump is New Hampshire - but this road will run
through 49 other states to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,` said Mark
McKinnon, Bush's media adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Voters said they were won over by McCain's personal his tory as
a Vietnam prisoner of war and by his blunt talk.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Whissel, a disabled Navy veteran who voted for McCain in
Nashua, said, ``McCain is honest. I like straight talk. And if he's
got a temper, that's fine. We need someone to stand up for us.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's focus on campaign-fi nance reform also seems to have
caught fire with New Hampshire voters. Four out of five voters
thought reform could help the country, and registered Republi cans
who felt that way voted for McCain by a 2-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also had a little help from the weather. Instead of
climbing through snow drifts to find their polling places, New
Hampshire voters enjoyed near-balmy temperatures and clear skies on
election day. McCain was relying on robust participa tion by the
generally less com mitted independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Independents voted three to one in favor of McCain, accord ing
to the exit polling by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   But registered Republicans also broke for McCain, which shocked
most campaign experts and led to talk of a wake-up call for the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues to hold a heavy fund-raising advantage and is
widely favored in all national polls. But now he must worry about
stopping McCain in the upcoming primaries in South Carolina and
Delaware, Arizona and Michigan. The test becomes whether McCain can
replicate his New Hampshire showing in those more populous states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain can generate enough interest among Republi can party
regulars to pull sup port away from Bush, I think the Republicans
might need to re-evaluate the candidates,'' said the University of
New Hampshire's Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from the first time New Hampshire voters cut against
the political grain to vote for a maverick. In 1996, Pat Buchanan
came from behind to upset the eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole with
his populist appeal to the ``peasants with pitch forks.''
</P>
<P>
   This time it was McCain, rid ing across the tundra in his white
``Straight Talk Express'' cam paign bus to 114 town halls, who
catered to New Hampshire's taste for folksy and untraditional
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Given the vast resources and time McCain devoted to New
Hampshire, most believed he had to win here just for his candidacy
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   That led the Bush campaign to suggest that McCain's victory was
less than overwhelming, con sidering all he had placed on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically had a fishing license and a hunting license and a
driver's license in New Hamp shire, and it paid off,'' McKinnon
said. ``We had a decision to make: We could either do the same
thing or try to get organized in 49 other states, and we chose to
get organized elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to both Bush and Forbes said they are now looking ahead to
the Delaware and South Caro lina primaries, where they be lieve
McCain will be vulnerable because his tax-cut proposals and stance
against abortion rights are less aggressive than his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   `His problem there will be that the social conservative base
does not trust him, and that's a hard thing to fix in three or four
weeks,` said Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col. `We and Bush
will capitalize on that.`

   NASHUA, N.H. _ Steve Forbes' disappointing third place finish in
the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday makes it even more difficult
for him to establish himself as his party's conservative
standard-bearer, especially in light of the lavish amounts of time
and money he spent here.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' showing was close to the 12 percent he gained here four
years ago. And it was well under the 20 percent that the Forbes'
campaign had earlier predicted he would get after his solid second
place showing in the Iowa caucuses last week.
</P>
<P>
   With Forbes digging deep into his own personal fortune, his
campaign says that he still has the money, and the message, to keep
his candidacy going into the next ground of primaries. And, they
say Sen. John McCain's decisive victory here opens the field to any
number of unexpected outcomes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   At around 9:30 Tuesday night, Forbes appeared to greet
supporters in a room that was only about half filled. While
congratulating McCain, he repeated that he was still in the race.
And he sounded a new campaign theme: that conservatives who
supported Bush because he was the front-runner should now consider
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make this appeal to conservatives who may have backed other
candidates because of their inevitability: Please come home,''
Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big problem in New Hampshire has been stripping
conservative voters from Bush,'' said Greg Mueller, the Forbes'
campaign communications director. ``A lot of people voted for him
because they thought he was the inevitable candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's loss ``opens up the whole conservative field,''
Mueller added. ``It will be tough, but doable.''

THE CASE OF JOHN DEUTCH 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 2:
</P>
<P>
   John Deutch was an effective and enlightened head of the CIA.
But his handling of classified information was sloppy, and he was
stripped of his high security clearances last August, more than two
years after he returned to a teaching post at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Now it is disturbing to learn that
Deutch's former colleagues at the CIA may have tried to shield
their former boss from an immediate and exacting investigation when
they first learned of his misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch was a demanding director, willing to examine past CIA
abuses and take corrective action. That earned him enemies at the
agency and may have influenced his decision to work with classified
material at home, where colleagues could not see his critical notes
and analyses. But by placing these files on unsecure home
computers, he left the information vulnerable to outside viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch's conduct came to light as he was preparing to leave the
top CIA job at the end of 1996. When he sought permission to
continue using the agency-owned computers in his home, CIA security
experts discovered the files and informed their superiors. An
internal inquiry was begun. But, according to a report by the CIA
inspector general, that inquiry was slowed by the actions of top
agency officials. In particular, the report faulted Michael
O'Neill, then the CIA's general counsel, and Nora Slatkin, who was
the agency's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Both deny delaying the investigation, as does the CIA's current
chief, George Tenet, who served as Deutch's chief deputy before
becoming his successor. The CIA has rightly set up a special panel
to examine whether these and other top officials handled the
investigation appropriately. An independent review by the Senate or
House intelligence committee may be needed as well.
</P>
<P>
   As far as can be determined, none of the data Deutch moved to
his personal computers were read by outsiders. Deutch has been
appropriately punished by having his security clearances suspended.
Still, any mishandling of classified national security information
is a serious matter. All such cases should be investigated
rigorously and promptly, even when they involve former directors of
central intelligence.

WATSON: UCLA PLAYS TOO NICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA won't have suspended forward JaRon Rush
anytime soon. But to beat No. 2 Stanford on Thursday, the Bruins
must play with the reckless abandon that defines Rush's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we fight hard enough,'' Bruins point guard Earl
Watson said. ``If Stanford comes in here, they have to be the ones
leaving hurt or banged up. That's the mentality we have to have. I
think we play too nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``JaRon has that warrior's mentality. He's always on the ground.
We have to have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially against Stanford, the biggest, toughest, deepest team
in the Pac-10. The Cardinal has four players 6-8 or taller,
including all-conferemce power forward Mark Madsen, who had 16
points and seven rebounds in Stanford's 13-point victory last year
in Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal (17-1, 6-1) leads the Pac-10 in blocked shots,
rebounds, rebounding margin, defensive rebounds, 3-pointers made,
scoring margin, scoring defense, field goal defense and 3-point
field goal defense. Not bad for a team with four first-year
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford also has won two straight in Pauley Pavilion. (Cal,
from 1993-95, is the only Pac-10 team to win three in a row in
Pauley.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play physical for 40 minutes, that's the Stanford
key,'' Watson said. ``We can't play anymore (games) where we give
up. Stanford will exploit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if senior Sean Farnham made that point in his lockerroom
tirade after the Oregon loss, Watson smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but it's been said plenty of times this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foul play? The Cardinal uses flawless footwork and positioning
to overpower opponents without fouling. Can the Bruins (12-6, 3-4)
match Stanford bump for bump without racking up the fouls?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the hyper-aggressive Bruins committed a season-high
35 fouls and had four starters foul out in the 72-59 loss. Stanford
made 32-of-49 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Double trouble: Beating Stanford means containing former
Harvard-Westlake stars Jason and Jarron Collins, who combine for 22
.1 points and 12.7 rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   Jarron, a junior forward, averages 27 minutes. Jason, a freshman
center, averages 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just like they were in high school, except they've
gotten stronger,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``It's
double-trouble with those two on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup update: Junior Rico Hines did not practice Tuesday
because of a sprained toe and is questionable for Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Billy Knight, who had 13 points and six rebounds at
Oregon, will start at shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Oregon) was the best game of his career,'' Lavin said. ``He
played under control, and he played better defense. He has improved
as much as anybody in the program other than Jerome (Moiso).''

GIULIANI CRITICIZES PALESTINIAN ROLE ON MONASTERY AND BACKS MOVE ON
AUSTRIAN PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was criticized for
sharing a dais last month with the controversial Austrian
politician Jorg Haider, expressed support Tuesday for the European
Union's efforts to prevent Haider's anti-immigrant political party
from joining the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who is preparing to run for United States Senate
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, also ventured into another
foreign-policy thicket Tuesday, condemning the Palestinian
Authority for its role in a dispute over a Russian Orthodox
monastery in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani exhorted the Clinton administration to take a more
hands-on role in both situations. And the mayor's top campaign
adviser, Bruce Teitelbaum, said the first lady herself should urge
the State Department to put pressure on the Palestinians to settle
the property dispute between the Russian Orthodox here and in
Russia over the monastery in Jericho in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should not have to be having this press conference; this
press conference should have occurred in Washington and it should
have occurred a number of days ago,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the Clinton administration had been ignoring
the dispute over the monastery and had not done enough to protect
two American nuns still living there.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said Tuesday that the secretary of
state, Madeleine Albright, had urged Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
president, to resolve the monastery dispute peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, David Leavy, said, ``We have made clear
to the Palestinians that this is an issue that has to be worked
through the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   In siding with the European Union, the mayor also sought to
deflect criticism about his attendance last month at a Martin
Luther King Jr. Day dinner, where he sat on the dais with Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani admitted shaking hands with Haider but said that he did
not realize who Haider was and that if he had, he might not have
gone to the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him,'' Giuliani said Tuesday. ``I spoke to him, but I
didn't know who he was. He was introduced to me along with about 50
or 60 other people. At the time, I had no idea who he was. I go to
a lot of dinners. I shook hands with him. Actually, when he was
introduced to me, someone introduced him to me as someone who had
participated in the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   News accounts of the dinner, which was sponsored by the
Coalition for Racial Equality, reported that the group's national
chairman, Roy Innis, introduced Haider on the dais and referred
specifically to his reputation of right-wing notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, the leader of the anti-immigration Freedom Party in
Austria, stirred controversy in the 1990s by praising Hitler's
``orderly employment policy,'' and describing veterans of elite
Nazi SS troops as ``men of character.'' He has apologized several
times for those remarks.

ROLE OF MEDIA JOURNAL IN WEB SITE PARTNERSHIP IS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that allies a media-watchdog magazine with several of
the major industry players it covers, Brill Media Holdings _ the
company that publishes Brill's Content magazine _ has agreed to
form a partnership with CBS, NBC, Primedia, Ingram Book Group and
EBSCO, a company that provides magazine subscription services and
databases of already-published magazine content.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership will introduce a Web site called
Contentville.com in the second half of the year. The site will sell
books, magazine subscriptions, transcripts, scholarly monographs
and access to previously published magazine articles, among other
materials.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, a limited partner, will own a 35 percent equity position in
exchange for $40 million in advertising and promotion over three
years. Brill Media Holdings, the managing partner, will own 34
percent. NBC, Primedia, Ingram and EBSCO will each own 5 percent to
10 percent of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The site will allow consumers to search across categories for
subject matter and to have guidance from experts, said Steven T.
Brill, chairman of Brill Media Holdings and the editor in chief of
Brill's Content magazine. For example, Clay Felker, a former editor
of New York magazine, will offer his opinion on which magazines are
worth reading, and which are not. (Other contributors include Wendy
Wasserstein, the playwright, and George Plimpton.)
</P>
<P>
   David Kuhn, the editorial director of Contentville, compared the
site with Amazon.com, but without the marketing arrangements with
booksellers that have allowed better placement of books on the site
for a fee. ``Editorially, Contentville will be a place where you'll
hear lots of opinion, but you won't be marketed to in any way,''
Kuhn said.
</P>
<P>
   But the venture raises the issue of whether Brill is
compromising the magazine's independence. Robert W. McChesney, a
professor of communications at the University of illinois, who has
written extensively about media industry consolidation, said
Brill's Content would never be able to avoid the appearance of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot give the appearance of a conflict of interest as a
press critic,'' he said. ``And alliances with broadcast networks
look like a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goldstein, dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism, which oversees The Columbia Journalism Review, said
there was no way to determine if Brill would be successful at
maintaining independence. ``This partnership raises a host of
issues which he is going to have to work through,'' Goldstein said.
``You can build all sorts of structures in advance but this will
have to be worked out by trial and error. All those structures
won't assure independent criticism until you see them in effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill said the magazine he founded in 1998 would not be
influenced by the Web site partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of companies that invest in ventures like this are
media companies, and there's no getting around that,'' he said. But
he added that each partner had signed an agreement not to exert any
kind of influence over the magazine. In the case of Primedia, he
said that magazines from many companies would be sold on the site
and Primedia's would not be given special consideration.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bill Kovach, who critiques Brill's Content each month in
the magazine, would monitor conflicts of interests regarding the
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Brill said the two enterprises would be separate. However, he
said some of the editorial and business staff of the magazine would
work in tandem with the editorial and business staff of
Contentville, and would share floors in Brill's new offices
overlooking Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Contentville partnership will take a percentage of each
sale. Brill said the operation would be profitable, in part because
it would not warehouse books, but rely on Ingram to handle all the
back-office operations.

SHAQ DOESN'T EXPECT A TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO -- The NBA's Feb. 24 trade deadline is creeping up,
but Shaquille O'Neal doesn't expect the Lakers to make a move. Nor
does he think they need to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even thinking about it. Like one of my good reporter
friends told me, nobody's going to give us something to make us
better,'' O'Neal said. ``Right now we're a power. Nobody's going to
give us anything to make us a powerhouse. Personally, I don't look
for any changes to go down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to play with what we've got,'' he said. ``We've
got the guys. Guys just have to step up and do it. We haven't been
playing well, we haven't been shooting well, we haven't been
playing defense, but we're going to wake up. We always do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Lakers could find a willing trade partner, O'Neal
thinks the team is fine as is and has enough to win the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think so. We've got to play with what we've got,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' most glaring need is a backup center to spare O'Neal
from 4 5-minute games, but he said, ``I don't have any problem
with'' the extended playing time. As for acquiring a center, he
said, ``It would be a wish, but ... I don't see it going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc a Blazer?: Lakers coach Phil Jackson has made no secret of
his interest in Chicago Bulls forward Toni Kukoc, but the Portland
Trail Blazers might preempt a Kukoc trade to L.A. The Chicago
Tribune is reporting that Kukoc may be headed to Portland in
exchange for center Jermaine O'Neal, guard Bonzi Wells and a
first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wouldn't say whether the Lakers are involved in talks
with the Bulls, but said, ``I know that there was some interest
there. But we'll see what happens. I heard the same rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   If the deal happens, Jackson said, ``It'd disappoint me in a
way, but it looks to me like Portland's just doing it as a
defensive measure. It's one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   En fuego: The Lakers, who endured rowdy world-trade protests
outside their hotel in Seattle earlier this season, had another
hotel disturbance Monday night -- a fire in the basement of La
Mansion Del Rio .
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt, and after being evacuated and herded into the
hotel restaurant, the Lakers finally got back into their rooms
sometime after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   All of them except Derek Fisher, who never left his room.
Several players never heard the fire alarm, but most were notified
with a knock on th e door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard some sirens,'' Fisher said, ``but I didn't think they
were coming to where we were. ... I was watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Fisher wasn't even aware of the incident until
Tuesday's shootaround, and admitted, ``I wasn't too freaked out --
but a little bit.' '

 MCCAIN STUNS BUSH  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the help of independent voters, John McCain trounced GOP
frontrunner George W. Bush in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday,
surprising political observers and making the Texan's nomination
appear less than inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory by a wide margin tied the Republican presi
dential race at one apiece after Bush won last week's Iowa cau
cuses.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was euphoric. ``Last June, I asked the people of New
Hampshire to make room in this election and in our party for the
forces of reform,'' McCain told a packed room of supporters in
Nashua. ``Well, thanks to you, my dear friends, we made room - and
we have sent a powerful message to Washington that change is
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected him to win, and I half-expected him to win handily
- but I never expected him to slaughter Bush,` Clark Hubbard, a
political scientist at the Univer sity of New Hampshire, told The
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   At press time, McCain had received about half of all the votes
cast, or 49 percent. Bush was second with just under a third of the
votes, or 31 percent, and publisher Steve Forbes fol lowed with 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the evening was one to be relished, perhaps the
biggest political victory of his life. Supporters and campaign
workers crammed into a Nashua ballroom and sang songs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bush rally, supporters listened to band music, but there
was little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush fund-raiser who at tended the rally said he felt as
though he has been ``socked in the face'' by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm floored. It doesn't add up,'' said Jeff Greenblum, a Texan
who traveled to New Hampshire to help the Bush campaign. ``There's
no spin here. He lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Bush rally, supporters registered their disbe
lief at the wide margin of Mc Cain's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! There's going to be a lot of gloom come over this room,''
said Jack Rueppel, 74, of Hooksett, who said he voted for Bush
because he believes he will improve the U.S. military. ``This may
not kill Bush, but it won't help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's top aides insisted they would charge forward without
making major adjustments to their campaign, but Greenblum and
others at the rally suggested the loss should serve as a wake up
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to re-jigger some thing, that's for sure,'' Green
blum said. `This is the oddest primary I have ever seen.`
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush supporters were subdued, the candidates' aides were
already looking beyond the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected there would be a bump in the road in this cam
paign, and the bump is New Hampshire - but this road will run
through 49 other states to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,` said Mark
McKinnon, Bush's media adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Voters said they were won over by McCain's personal his tory as
a Vietnam prisoner of war and by his blunt talk.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Whissel, a disabled Navy veteran who voted for McCain in
Nashua, said, ``McCain is honest. I like straight talk. And if he's
got a temper, that's fine. We need someone to stand up for us.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's focus on campaign-fi nance reform also seems to have
caught fire with New Hampshire voters. Four out of five voters
thought reform could help the country, and registered Republi cans
who felt that way voted for McCain by a 2-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also had a little help from the weather. Instead of
climbing through snow drifts to find their polling places, New
Hampshire voters enjoyed near-balmy temperatures and clear skies on
election day. McCain was relying on robust participa tion by the
generally less com mitted independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Independents voted three to one in favor of McCain, accord ing
to the exit polling by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   But registered Republicans also broke for McCain, which shocked
most campaign experts and led to talk of a wake-up call for the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues to hold a heavy fund-raising advantage and is
widely favored in all national polls. But now he must worry about
stopping McCain in the upcoming primaries in South Carolina and
Delaware, Arizona and Michigan. The test becomes whether McCain can
replicate his New Hampshire showing in those more populous states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain can generate enough interest among Republi can party
regulars to pull sup port away from Bush, I think the Republicans
might need to re-evaluate the candidates,'' said the University of
New Hampshire's Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from the first time New Hampshire voters cut against
the political grain to vote for a maverick. In 1996, Pat Buchanan
came from behind to upset the eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole with
his populist appeal to the ``peasants with pitch forks.''
</P>
<P>
   This time it was McCain, rid ing across the tundra in his white
``Straight Talk Express'' cam paign bus to 114 town halls, who
catered to New Hampshire's taste for folksy and untraditional
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Given the vast resources and time McCain devoted to New
Hampshire, most believed he had to win here just for his candidacy
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   That led the Bush campaign to suggest that McCain's victory was
less than overwhelming, con sidering all he had placed on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically had a fishing license and a hunting license and a
driver's license in New Hamp shire, and it paid off,'' McKinnon
said. ``We had a decision to make: We could either do the same
thing or try to get organized in 49 other states, and we chose to
get organized elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to both Bush and Forbes said they are now looking ahead to
the Delaware and South Caro lina primaries, where they be lieve
McCain will be vulnerable because his tax-cut proposals and stance
against abortion rights are less aggressive than his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   `His problem there will be that the social conservative base
does not trust him, and that's a hard thing to fix in three or four
weeks,` said Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col. `We and Bush
will capitalize on that.`

GAILEY JOINS WANNSTEDT ON MIAMI STAFF
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deposed Cowboys coach Chan Gailey has joined Dave Wannstedt's
staff as offensive coordinator of the Miami Dolphins, with no
particular instruction on how to handle Dan Marino if he comes back
for an 18th NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hasn't come up,'' said Gailey by telephone from Miami.
``The only time \RMarino\S was discussed at all, Dave said it will
be handled at a later time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, fired Jan. 11 after only two seasons (18-14, plus 0-2 in
the playoffs) into a five-year contract with the Cowboys, believes
that he has found a good fit with a Dolphins team that he feels is
``close to being a true contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt, who replaced Jimmy Johnson after the Dolphins' 62-7
playoff-elimination loss to Jacksonville, has filled his top two
staff positions with a pair of former Cowboys coaches. Defensive
line coach Jim Bates was named Dolphins' defensive coordinator two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was hoping to get a second chance right away at being an
NFL head coach. But that ended Thursday when New Orleans hired
Seattle's Randy Mueller as Saints general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller apparently has narrowed the Saints' coaching search to
Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Jim Haslett and Denver offensive
coordinator Gary Kubiak. Mueller earlier this week met with Kubiak
in Denver and Haslett in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to get another head-coaching job, I've got to go
earn it,'' said Gailey. ``That's what I plan to do ... go back out
there and fight again.''

RECORD-SETTING RUNNER FOCUSING ON TCU AND HIS FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK HERRIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Long before fans arrived to watch Irving High
School play L.D. Bell at Pennington Field on Oct. 30, 1998, Tyson
Thompson sat alone near midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his white No. 33 jersey, the Irving running back looked
toward the sky and poured out his heart, for reasons he still can't
explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up in the sky and said I am giving it all to you,
Lord,'' said Thompson, the jewel of TCU's 2000 recruiting class.
``I was giving respect for everything. I was thanking him for
things he has given me now and in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the night was as close to perfection as Thompson has
had in his 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the then-junior bewildered Bell, rushing for a
state Class 5A-record 525 yards, including seven touchdowns, all on
runs of 50 or more yards. Overnight, Thompson's name spread
nationwide among college recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Thompson found even more magic. His parents,
separated since Thompson's early childhood, attended the game
without his knowledge. Or each other's. They had come, separately,
to surprise their son. Thompson was both shocked and thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant the world to me,'' Thompson said. ``It made it the
greatest game of my life because my parents were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Thompson, his trek to becoming one of the
nation's top high school running backs has been much more difficult
than that one dreamlike night.
</P>
<P>
   He comes from a broken home held together by his mother. He has
struggled academically and struggled to cope with the attention
given a top football recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to be a great football player and an average
kid at the same time,'' said Thompson's school counselor, Robin
Shrode, who has worked closely with the player for six years. ``It
just doesn't happen that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson isn't a teen-ager who likes to reveal his emotions.
He's a silent thinker, tough to decipher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always been that way,'' said Myra Campbell, Thompson's
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson spent most of his childhood without a father. He did grow
up with an older half-brother, Doug Campbell, a former standout
running back at Irving. Myra Campbell filled some of the void, but
Tyson admits he missed not having a father figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him around real bad,'' Thompson said of his father,
Rufus Thompson. ``You can share some things with your mom, but
there's certain things you can relate to more with your dad.''
</P>
<P>
   His father sometimes ``sneaks'' to his games, as Thompson says,
such as he did for the L.D. Bell game. Rufus Thompson made contact
with Tyson after his historic performance with a wave from a
distance, but he did not talk with his son. Rufus and Tyson's
mother were never married. They separated when Tyson was young.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and his mother, however, have a wealth of support from
non-family members.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's second family comes from his girlfriend, Ashley
French, a former Irving cheerleader who is now a freshman at TCU,
and her mother, Candy. They help with transportation for Myra
Campbell and Thompson, neither of whom has a car.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also knows he can seek family with the Frenches. His
mother usually works into the late evening at an Irving nursing
home and supports Thompson despite limited financial means. The
Frenches also help provide financially when needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have stuck by me and Tyson through thick and thin,'' Myra
Campbell said. ``If we're up or down, they have always helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Thompson, ``If I ever needed anything, they would be sure
to get it for me. They have been part of my family. \RCandy
French's\S door is never locked.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Shrode's counselor's office.
</P>
<P>
   She provides Thompson with academic help, personal direction and
is also his biggest fan, wearing her No. 33 Thompson jersey to
every game.
</P>
<P>
   Shrode has been close to Thompson since he walked into her
office six years ago in junior high. They have cried together and
laughed together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am his emotional support,'' Shrode said. ``When I have a kid
that doesn't have a family, I make it a point to show someone is
there for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vital to see someone cheering for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrode is also playing a vital role in helping Thompson prepare
to pass college entrance examinations. She works with Thompson on a
daily basis, going over practice test questions.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has yet to meet NCAA requirements to play next season.
He did not qualify after taking the ACT and is awaiting the results
of the SAT he took on Jan. 22. There will be more chances to take
the test again if he needs to. Thompson has met NCAA
core-curriculum requirements after overcoming a poor year
academically as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm good in the class, I'm just a terrible test-taker,'' said
Thompson, who will be the first in his family to attend college.
``I could be an `A' student and still get a 15 on the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does not get a high enough test score, Thompson can
attend TCU as a partial qualifier, though he would have to sit out
his freshman season. With the proper training, Thompson is
confident he can reach the needed test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can run for 300 yards in a game, I can pass a test,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than TCU, the only school Thompson visited was Arkansas.
But he said that was more of making sure TCU was the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just fit in so well there,'' Thompson said. ``I was like,
`Why go anywhere else?' I was just something I experienced. I don't
know what it was, but I didn't get that feeling at Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   What separates the 6-foot-2, 195-pound Thompson from most backs
is his combination of size, speed and vision. He doesn't lack in
any of those areas, though his vision allows him uncanny cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we don't coach,'' Irving coach Jim Bennett
said with a grin. ``We never told him where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Thompson, ``When I run, I see feet and arms. I have this
awesome peripheral vision. I just have these quick eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson can make defenses slide into the field as if they were
in quicksand, much as he did against Bell. He rockets past the
offensive line when he spots the hole, has the strength to break
tackles and the speed _ sub-4.5 seconds over 40 yards _ to break
free.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting swarm began after his 525-yard game. He received
more than 500 letters from college recruiters. Thompson ended the
recruiting process early, committing to TCU on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   It will be his new home and more of his extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had my mom there, I just want a bigger family,''
Thompson said. ``Everything's coming together for me.''

DEFNINING BLACK DANCE, IN ITS DIZZYING VARIETY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dance and music were considered the best ways of
keeping slaves healthy and thus salable as they traveled to America
in packed slave ships. ``The men could only jump up and rattle
their chains but the women were driven in one among another all the
while singing or saying words that had been taught them,'' an
observer noted in 1789. ``But there was another time when the women
were sitting by themselves, below, when I heard them singing other
words and then always in tears. Their songs then always told the
story of their lives and their grief at leaving their friends and
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the ``other song'' has been prevalent in attitudes
toward art created by black Americans. The notion of otherness
implicit in the term ``black dance'' insures that it has remained a
loaded and highly controversial concept a good two decades or more
after it was coined.
</P>
<P>
   Is black dance work created by artists who happen to be black?
Is dance ``black'' because it draws from black Caribbean or West
African cultural forms and traditions or black American social
history?
</P>
<P>
   ``Any serious attempt to (italics)study(end italics) Black dance
demands a study of African and New World Black cultures,'' Brenda
Dixon-Stowell, a dance scholar, writes in ``The Black Tradition in
American Modern Dance,'' a 1993 publication by the American Dance
Festival. ``Any attempt to (italics)evaluate(end italics) Black
dance _ or the Black dance elements in White forms _ on the concert
stage,'' Dixon-Stowell continued, demands that viewers approach the
material from the point of view of the culture under consideration
in order ``to understand the phenomenon also in the context of its
Black origins, and not only in the context of the White, western
frame of reference.''
</P>
<P>
   The arts organization 651 Arts, which was founded in part by the
Brooklyn Academy of Music and identifies itself as an
African-American performing arts presenter, has bitten the bullet
with a dance program called ``Black Dance: Tradition and
Transformation'' that runs Feb. 16 through 19 at the BAM Harvey
Theater, the headquarters of 651. One of the missions of 651 has
been to present unusual dance programs. This new yearly series will
examine the past, present and future of black choreography with
performances, master classes, lectures and discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Each year's festival will feature one established troupe and
several new ones, including both American and foreign groups. This
year's older group is the Philadelphia-based Philadanco, founded by
Joan Myers Brown in 1970. The newer companies are the Bre Dance
Theater of Riverside, Calif., founded in 1991 by Clifford J.
Breland; M'Zawa (pronounced mm-ZA-wa) Danz, founded in 1995 in New
York City by Maia Claire Garrison, and the Union Dance Company of
London, founded by Corrine Bougaard in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most immediately striking aspects of the lineup of
companies and pieces they will present is the sheer variety in the
roster. The history of ``black dance'' will be encapsulated in an
opening program by Philadanco that offers an overview of three
generations of dance by black choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   Talley Beatty will be represented by his 1947 ``Southern
Landscape,'' a piece set to spiritual and folk music that examines
the end of the Reconstruction period in the American South and
includes a stark signature solo called ``Mourner's Bench.'' Milton
Myers' 1998 ``Echoes: A Celebration of Alvin Ailey'' pays tribute
to a more recent major modern master. Dwight Rhoden, the youngest
of the three, simply celebrates ``the soulful sounds of
Philadelphia International Records'' in his new ``Tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   That history began formally with the establishment of the New
Negro Art Theater Dance Group in 1931 by Edna Guy, who had trained
with Ruth St. Denis, and Hemsley Winfield, a visionary young actor
and dancer. The troupe grew out of the heady artistic climate of
the Harlem Renaissance and the new American art of modern dance
forged by white choreographers who included St. Denis, Martha
Graham, Doris Humphrey and Helen Tamiris, who in 1929 had
choreographed a stylized, emotion-filled dance called ``Negro
Spirituals.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Dunham followed, making a popular art of Afro-American
and Afro-Caribbean dance. The next major figures were Pearl Primus,
who eventually focused on African dance, and Beatty, who drew upon
American subjects and jazz dance. They were followed, in the middle
period, by Donald McKayle, Alvin Ailey and Eleo Pomare, who in
varying degrees chose to work with black American themes but might
not have considered themselves ``black choreographers.''
</P>
<P>
   The urge to embrace a nourishing past or validating mythology
plays an important part in the arts in America today. The
present-day interest in African and Caribbean dance developed in
the '70s, following on a wave of new moderns that included Garth
Fagan, Bill T. Jones and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Philadanco and the Dayton Contemporary Dance
Company, which slightly preceded the Philadelphia troupe, marked
the emergence of the regional or national black modern-dance
repertory companies of today.
</P>
<P>
   Like Beatty, Myers turned away from the classical ballet she had
trained in when it became obvious there would be no jobs for her as
a black dancer. With the exception of the Dance Theater of Harlem,
black dancers remain largely tokens in ballet today. But while
financing is still a problem, the aesthetic possibilities seized by
black choreographers today are almost dizzyingly wide-ranging. That
is a message of ``Black Dance: Traditions and Transformations.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the inspirations of the Union Dance Company's ``Dance Tek
Warriors,'' excerpts from which will be presented in the festival,
was the PlayStation computer game Tekken. ``The computer graphics
contain very sophisticated martial arts moves,'' Bougaard said. ``A
lot of the moves are very well thought through and beautifully
choreographed.'' Bougaard is also intrigued, she said, by the way
this ``kind of blurs the boundaries of high and popular art.''

CONSPIRACY THEORIES STILL RAGE OVER LAND 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Religious duty, economic rivalry, cultural fric tion and the
vacillation of the federal government _ these forces have driven
the Navajo-Hopi land dispute for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   But some Navajos and their supporters also blame another, more
sinister factor: White cor porate greed.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the ``coal-conspiracy theory'':
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Navajo relocation charge that Peabody Coal Co. worked
secretly for legislation to evict the Navajos and clear the way to
strip-mine millions of tons of coal that remain key to the
explosive growth of the South west.
</P>
<P>
   This claim burst onto the screen in Broken Rainbow, a 1985
Oscar-winning documentary narrated by actor Martin Sheen.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, one non-Indian group flatly declares on the In
ternet that Navajos are being moved ``so that Peabody Western Coal
Company can mine their coal-rich land.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as flatly, Peabody spokes woman Beth Sutton denies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying until I'm blue in the face that Peabody has
nothing to do with the dispute,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   The theory also exasperates Hopi officials, who say it trivial
izes Navajo-Hopi history. As tribal spokesman Eugene Kaye says,
``This land issue has been here a long time before Pea body.''
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona Republic examina tion found that no direct evi dence
that Peabody or any other commercial interests applied po litical
muscle during the Nava jo-Hopi fight in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 25 years since relocation became law, thousands of
Navajos have relocated, but Peabody has not extended its mining
beyond the area it leased in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said Peabody has more than enough coal under lease to
meet its customers demands far into the future. She rejects the
Navajo claim that the company has its eye on Big Mountain, the
center of resistance to relocation. Pointing out that Big Mountain
is 15 miles from the mining opera tions, she suggests that the
claim is geographically implausible.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Peabody's his tory in Navajo-Hopi country is open
to serious question. It is a history replete with apparent
conflicts of interest _ on the part of government officials, a
tribal attorney and a high-rank ing Department of Interior offi
cial who played a key role in the land dispute and then went to
work for the coal-mining com pany.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence that the company allied itself with the
Hopis in the early 1970s, when both encountered the Navajos'
aggressive new chairman, Peter MacDonald. &QL; 
A HEAVY LODE
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this swirling cloud of charges and suspicions
is Black Mesa coal, millions of tons of fuel that for nearly three
decades have been vital to the fortunes of Los Angeles, Las Vegas,
Phoenix and other major Southwestern cities.
</P>
<P>
   Five million tons annually come from the mine that lies on land
caught up in the Navajo-Hopi disputes. The mine flushes the coal
through a 273-mile un derground pipeline to the Southern California
Edison's power plant on the Colorado River at Laughlin, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody takes an additional 7 million tons from exclusively
Navajo land to power the Navajo Generating Station at Lake Pow ell.
Operated by the Salt River Project, the plant sends much of the
power to homes around Phoe nix.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is co-owned by the federal government, which uses some
of the electricity to power Central Arizona Project pumps that
bring water from the Colo rado River to Phoenix and Tuc son.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody signed leases with the Navajos and Hopis in the 1960s,
after federal courts ruled that the tribes were joint owners of 1.8
million acres of land centered on Black Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   A 1964 article in the Oil and Gas Journal noted that the rul
ings finally opened up an area long believed to contain vast energy
storehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 35 years, oil explorers have been frustrated by
disputes over land bound aries,'' the article noted. The same was
true for coal compa nies until the two tribes were able to work
together to sign the Peabody lease.
</P>
<P>
   But that lease quickly came under fire for providing the tribes
with rock-bottom royalty rates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Peter MacDonald was elected Navajo chairman and be gan
talking tough. MacDonald said he wanted to renegotiate with
Peabody. He also vowed to protect the environment from the mines
and power plants spring ing up around the edge of the Navajo
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not turn our land into another Los Angeles, and we
won't let anyone else do it,'' MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hopi tribal chairman was speaking as a friendly
Indian who would never dream of threatening the supply of
electricity to Phoenix air-con ditioners and swimming-pool pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a real sense, we consider ourselves fortunate to have these
power plants developed in the areas around our reservation,''
Clarence Hamilton said in a 1972 statement.
</P>
<P>
   It is here, in Hamilton's ap proach to the coal issue, that
links emerge among the Hopis, the coal and the land dispute. &QL; 
UNCLEAR INTERESTS
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's 1972 statement, for example, was prepared by the Salt
Lake City public-relations firm of Evans and Associates. The firm
was hired by John Boyden, the Hopis' Salt Lake attorney.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Evans who, accord ing to the Washington Post, ``vir
tually stage-managed a range war on the borders of the Hopi
Reservation'' to convince journal ists that Congress must intervene
in the Navajo-Hopi land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   As the Hopis' attorney, John Boyden, was active in pushing
Congress to intervene for the Hopis. His list of clients included
Peabody Coal Co.
</P>
<P>
   Boyden's dual role represent ing both the Hopis and Peabody was
a clear conflict of interest, according to University of Colo rado
law Professor Charles Wil kinson. Wilkinson said Boyden's dual
loyalty could have compro mised the Hopis, pushing them to accept
Peabody's royalty offer.
</P>
<P>
   But it also could have given Boyden and the Hopis a powerful
ally in Peabody in the push for relocation of Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another potential link between Peabody and the land
dispute surfaced in the per son of Harrison Loesch, a U.S.
Department of Interior assistant secretary and supervisor of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   According to former Interior lawyer Graham Holmes, it was Loesch
who in 1972 changed the Interior Department's long-stand ing policy
of neutrality in the Navajo-Hopi dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Holmes recalled that Loesch ordered BIA
Commissioner Louis Bruce to testify for Boyden's bill at a
congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Fired from Interior in 1972, after Indian militants seized the
BIA headquarters in Washington, D.C., Loesch joined the Republi can
staff of the Senate Interior committee, which in 1974 passed the
relocation legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He later became a Washington lobbyist for Peabody Coal.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the early 1970s, critics charge, that Peabody was
working behind the scenes to assure itself the best possible deal
on its coal leases, regardless of the impact on the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Alvin Josephy pointed to Black Mesa coal devel opment
as a prime example of federal failure to protect Indian rights. In
1971, Josephy reported that the ``negotiations and lease contract
signings . . . were car ried out so quietly that they provide a
classroom example of how serious has become the lack of
accountability by government agencies working hand-in-glove with
industry in the United States today.'' &QL; 
ROYALTY LAWSUIT
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the Navajo Tribe itself weighed in, claiming in a
lawsuit against Peabody that the firm conspired against the tribe
by hiring a lobbyist to derail a 1984 federal plan that would have
boosted Peabody's royalty pay ments at Black Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1964 lease, the Navajos were receiving a 2 per cent
royalty on the coal. But the lease allowed the government to adjust
the royalty rate after 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the suit contends, Interior staffers determined that
the royalty should rise to 20 per cent. But that proposal never saw
the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims it was quietly killed by Interior Secretary Don
ald Hodel after Peabody hired as a lobbyist former Interior
official Stanley Hulett, Hodel's close friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajos, working without knowledge of the 20 percent
recommendation, agreed to a 12.5 percent royalty. They are now
charging Peabody with fraud and with subverting the Interior
Department's fiduciary duty to the Navajos. They claim the scheme
has cost them $600 million in royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody and Hodel, now a consultant in Colorado, both re ject
the conspiracy charge. The company claims that in hiring Hulett, it
was merely exercising its right to lobby. Hodel claims he never
lost sight of his fiduciary role.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such denials, the law suit continues to make its way
through the federal court in Washington, where trial is pend ing.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the lack of conclu sive evidence against Peabody
Coal, the corporation's controver sial history makes it a
convenient target for coal-conspiracy theo rists. &QL;

 NEW YORK: popular art.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That blurring of boundaries and appropriation of low culture is
a distinctive feature of the dances and aesthetic philosophies of
all three of the younger troupes, who share the festival's second
program. Hip-hop and tap have been incorporated into the styles of
each company.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison is known for the dissection and combining of
traditional West African, hip-hop and modern dance to create a
style she calls Neo-African Dance. Breland, of Bre Dance Theater,
grew up dancing to the television program ``Soul Train'' in rural
Picayune, Miss. Today he talks of working with the ways ballet
creates line, modern dance breaks it and jazz dance supplies ``a
ferocious energy.''
</P>
<P>
   There is now a vital community of black dance that is very
different from the world faced by Brown of Philadanco when she
organized the first International Conference of Black Dance
Companies in 1988. She expected five or six people to respond but
80 attended the first conference, held in Philadelphia. There were
600 attendees at the last conference, held in Dallas late last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each place we get people who wouldn't come to New York,''
Brown said. ``Each time we find new people with new ideas and new
companies.'' It was at one of the conferences that national
presenters, including Maurine Knighton, executive director of 651
Arts, got their first look at the Bre Dance Theater, which will
make its New York debut at the festival.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers, at least, are exposed to a variety of new and
familiar black American dance troupes. In March, 651 Arts will
burrow into the mother lode with ``Africa Now! _ Changing the
Landscape of Dance in Africa.'' ``But most places we go, if there
is a concert series, there is only one black company, if any,''
Brown said. ``People say to me, `Oh, who else is out there like
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   A comparable problem exists in England, a center, with France,
for traditional and modern dance by black African and West Indian
immigrants. (Hip-hop is popular in Belgium and particularly in
France.) In England, there tends to be more government support for
companies performing traditional African dance, even when many of
their dancers are West Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Still, modern-dance companies continue to spring up and there
has been a yeasty experimentation with styles, especially in Asian
companies in England. Bougaard, who was born in Cape Town, is of
mixed European, African and Indonesian lineage and considers the
style of her Union company to be as much Asian- as
African-influenced.
</P>
<P>
   Bougaard brought in Doug Elkins, a white American modern-dance
choreographer who draws on hip-hop, to create one of two excerpts
from ``Dance Tek Warriors'' that will be seen at 651 Arts. (The
other choreographer is the company member Michael Joseph.) The
company has also worked with Zollar and Jones as well as Shaolin
monks.
</P>
<P>
   The point, Bougaard says, is representation, not categorization.
``One can't dismiss what one is. It's important to keep one's
identity. You can't be becoming if you don't think you're equal.
But I question the word `black.' I'm not sure if it's an English,
European or Western way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   What then is ``black dance''? ``I don't know,'' Maurine
Knighton, executive director of 651 Arts, said forthrightly.
``That's one of the points of this program, which has been designed
to examine that question, but also to acknowledge people of African
descent who have made significant contributions to the field and
who continue to do so.'' Brown is content, she said, to describe
Philadanco simply as ``an American company.''
</P>
<P>
   Could ``black dance'' be created by white people? Garrison asks.
``Is it still black dance? Well, yes, if it deals with black
material.''
</P>
<P>
   For Breland, ``black dance'' is an aesthetic. ``As a black
person, I would like to be able to say there is such a thing,'' he
said. ``I think it has to do with the spiritual level it comes
from. It comes from the heart. A lot of times we do something to be
accepted, but I think this is something inside of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a product of your environment. I am a product of black
society in the South. When I hear certain syncopations and drum
beats, I can tell if they were enunciated by a black American. I
can identify tap done by a black person. Some prefer just
`choreographer,' but I don't have any problems being labeled a
black choreographer.''

FLIGHT 261 HAD CORROSION INSPECTION SCHEDULED FOR JUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISE OLSEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Alaska Airlines jet that crashed Monday had not
yet undergone a special corrosion inspection ordered last May for
all MD-80 horizontal stabilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has completed the Federal Aviation
Administration-required inspection on 10 of its 35 MD-80s _ and was
in June to check the plane used on Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   The mandatory inspection involves removing the stabilizer _ the
fin in its distinctive ``whale tail'' _ and checking for corrosion
in and around parts where it is attached.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash is unknown, and the National
Transportation Safety Board rules nothing out without months of
painstaking investigation. However, early attention has gone to the
stabilizer because the pilots said it was jammed minutes before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   If corrosion was severe enough to cause some part of the
mechanism to fall off, it could cause the stabilizer to jam,
according to a pilot certified for the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   An airlines spokesman said inspections of other planes revealed
little corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``A handful had some insignificant, mild corrosion; they were
simply cleaned and reassembled,'' said Alaska spokesman Greg
Witter. ``All indications are that this is completely unrelated (to
the crash).''
</P>
<P>
   The plane that crashed was a 7-year-old McDonnell Douglas MD-83.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's inspection order, called an airworthiness directive,
came after three unidentified airlines complained to the
manufacturer that they had discovered corrosion in MD-80 series
planes that had flown 15,000 to 30,000 hours. The plane that
crashed Monday had logged 26,584 hours of flight time, according to
Alaska. Airlines have until fall to make the check.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is anchored to the tail of the aircraft with
bolts through holes, called lug bores, in thick metal plates. The
stabilizer, bolted to the plates, pivots as the pilot adjusts it in
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA attributed corrosion in the lug bores to a
manufacturer's error. Significant amounts of corrosion can threaten
a plane's structural integrity, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspections cost about $7,000 and take about 117 work hours
per plane. Excessive corrosion would force replacement of the
parts, but no carriers that have completed the inspections have had
to replace the hinge plates, said FAA spokesman Mitch Barker.
Barker could not say how many carriers had completed the work.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that crashed had received a routine check by Alaska
mechanics in Seattle on Jan. 30th. No problems affecting flight
safety were found. Before that, it had received a more thorough ``A
check'' on Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Its last ``C Check'' _ the airline equivalent of a major tune-up
_ was performed on Jan. 13, 1999, in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's office in San Francisco has convened a grand
jury to review allegations of falsification of maintenance records
in Oakland that stem from complaints by John Liotine, a mechanic
there.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA report concluded that records were falsified on two
MD-80s that made 840 flights in late 1998 and early 1999. Because
of the altered records, the aircraft were considered
``unairworthy,'' FAA documents said.
</P>
<P>
   John Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Alaska Airlines,
said the plane that crashed was not involved in the investigation.
An airline spokesman said the investigation focused on record
keeping, not the safety of the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors Tuesday declined to comment on the
investigation, citing grand jury secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Prisco, a colleague who has represented Liotine in labor
matters, said the mechanic knows nothing about the ill-fated plane.
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporter Tracy Johnson and the Associated Press contributed
to this report.

NON-INDIAN INVOLVEMENT REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL

<P>
   Her laptop is powered by a windmill generator. Her workplace is
a tiny mobile home dropped into the vast ex panse of northeastern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marsha Monestersky turns on her computer and taps into a
decades-long wave of in ternational protest over an issue most
Americans have never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   A former student radical and labor organizer, Monestersky calls
herself a ``consultant'' to the Sovereign Dine Nation _ as some
Navajos resisting reloca tion label themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At 47, she's perhaps the most visible member of an interna
tional community of non-Indians protesting relocation.
</P>
<P>
   She's also the most controver sial.
</P>
<P>
   Monestersky's presence here points up the sensitive issue of
non-Indian involvement in this long-running Native American land
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Some Navajos who resist loca tion praise her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your back is against the wall,'' said Marie Gladue of Big
Mountain, ``you look for support wherever you can find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others call her a troublemaker who has exploited the Navajos
while posing as their savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is like a bowling ball. She just destroys things,'' said
Helena Begay, who says Monestersky has divided families and stirred
conflict across the disputed land.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, she embodies the passion outsiders from around the
world have felt for this relatively obscure clash over an isolated,
starkly beautiful land that is sacred ground to the Navajos and
Hopis.
</P>
<P>
   Such critics have demon strated on the East and West Coasts,
picketed U.S. embassies in Japan and several European countries,
and organized a letter-writing campaign to warn Con gress that
relocation ``can only bring further tragedy and na tional
disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Flagstaff-based Black Mesa Indigenous Support
has sent dozens of young volunteers to herd sheep, chop wood and
haul water for the elderly resisters.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also assisted several dozen Europeans and
Japanese who came to protest Tuesday's relocation deadline for
Navajos who live on Hopi land and have refused to sign an
``accommodation agreement'' _ or AA _ with the Hopi Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors were lured in part by overheated Internet rumors.
</P>
<P>
   A Minnesota group warned last month that mass evictions were
imminent. Others have predicted that Black Mesa is about to become
``the next Waco,'' with federal marshals moving in to evict the
resisters.
</P>
<P>
   Such rhetoric prompted Hopi leaders and federal officials to
declare earlier last month that there will be no evictions any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   They will, however, seek evic tion orders through the courts.
That process is expected to take at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harald Mueller has come from Germany with his wife and
two small children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the side of the human rights,'' Mueller said. He
acknowledged that he hasn't been able to study the complex history
of the Navajo-Hopi dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think it is a human-rights violation to relocate these
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Goes of Sweden's Green Party said she came to the dis puted
land as a human-rights observer. She condemned reloca tion as
``cultural genocide'' and pledged to take the resisters' stories to
the European Parlia ment.
</P>
<P>
   Monestersky, Mueller and Goes are continuing a tradition of
protest against the 1974 federal law that is pushing Navajos off
nearly a million acres of land long claimed by the Hopis.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, a group called the Big Mountain Legal
Offense-Defense Committee was sending out 20,000 copies of its
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The group warned that unless Congress repealed the law, relo
cation ``will add yet another chapter to the disgraceful history of
abuse that Indians have suf fered at the hands of the U.S.
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The repeal effort failed. But the protesters helped Navajos file
a federal lawsuit that became the starting point for a 1996
agreement that allows Navajos to stay if they accept Hopi jurisdic
tion.
</P>
<P>
   Monestersky has told resisters that if they reject the
agreement, they may yet win back their land. She is working with
lawyers who promise to do all they can but who apparently lack a
concrete strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But Betty Tso, a Navajo tribal employee who works with sign ers
of the agreement, fears fur ther resistance will only produce more
heartache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Marsha is offering them a false hope,'' said Tso,
whose mother signed the agree ment after years of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Monestersky's activism has an tagonized the Hopi Tribe, which
has asked the tribal court to banish her from the reservation. Her
trial is set for March.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are Navajo officials sup portive.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo President Kelsey Be gaye, a strong critic of reloca tion,
has said repeatedly he thinks the outsiders should leave.
</P>
<P>
   Begaye also said those who resist relocation fail to under stand
that there is no real pros pect for a repeal of the federal
relocation law.
</P>
<P>
   While eviction would be ``a bitter pill to swallow,'' he said,
it may be inevitable. &QL;

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ From her front porch, Michele Blake
thought Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was just another of the remote
control planes that frequently fly over her home in the Ventura
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   She gave it little thought as she watched the plane turn nose
down, and plunge toward the Pacific Ocean, its wings fluttering
back and forth. She didn't even get up from her chair to see it hit
the water.
</P>
<P>
   But then she realized something was wrong. It had been too
quiet. The plane had never made that all-too-familiar buzzing
noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no sound,'' Blake recalled Tuesday, looking toward
the horizon where Coast Guard ships went about their grim work.
``There was no smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake was among the hundreds of people in this beach community
of about 20,000 who Tuesday found themselves staring out at the
Pacific Ocean, the day after it claimed the lives of more than 80
people, many from the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   Some looked out at the swells that rolled gently toward Hueneme
(Why-NE-Me) Beach with the wild hope that they just might spot a
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Others held their children a little tighter.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the city pier that stretches 1,000 feet into the
Pacific, Ellann Putnam, of nearby Oxnard, turned to her 7-year-old
daughter Kaley, and said gently, ``Let's say a prayer for the poor
people.''
</P>
<P>
   With her daughter in her arms, she looked over the railing and
bowed her head.
</P>
<P>
   When she turned back, tears streamed down her cheek, spilling
out from under her wrap-around sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder what they were thinking, and did they even have time
to think,'' said Putnam, 40. ``I was just thinking about the
victims, and their families, and the innocent children.''
</P>
<P>
   The victims and their families seemed to be on nearly everyone's
minds. The night of the crash, local residents said they cast
flowers into the ocean in the hope of a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, they built flower memorials at on the beaches, beyond
the reach of the surf. At Hueneme Beach, a sign planted among the
flowers said, ``Remembering those lost. Pray for the families.''
</P>
<P>
   At Silver Strand Beach in Oxnard, just north of Port Hueneme, a
cross rose from the sand, flowers and stuffed animals at its foot,
rosaries and a stuffed dolphin hanging from above.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Holtke, 29, and her daughter, Kayley, 4, brought
chrysanthemums. Holtke kneeled down in the fading light, the sun
setting behind Santa Cruz Island, and held her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure she understands it all,'' Holtke said. ``But it
makes you appreciate everday you have.''
</P>
<P>
   At the pier, Pam Hoffman, said her 4-year-old knew something bad
had happened, but wasn't quite sure what it was. Her older daughter
thought differently.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, Hoffman said, her daughter, Annesa, 12, had a
picture in her mind that plane was intact, but just underwater. The
people, with plenty of oxygen, could be rescued, Aneesa figured.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman had to explain to her daughter that the plane's hull
crumbled under the impact of crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of ended her innocence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Point Hueneme is a diverse community, of well-to-do
professionals and retirees, as well as blue-collar workers and
longshoreman who labor at the Port of Hueneme, the only deepwater
port between Los Angeles and California.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked between two navy bases, it is marked by palm trees, and
wide sandy beaches. Named after an Indian princess, Hueneme means
``place of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who saw the plane go down, Tuesday talked of the serenity
of the sea. When Flight 261 went down, the surf was up, breaking in
sets of eight waves, splashing over the jetties.
</P>
<P>
   A cardiac nurse, she wondered if she could have done more to
help. If she had realized it was a jet going down, not a toy plane,
maybe, she said, she would have called emergency services. Maybe
that would have helped.
</P>
<P>
   She came to the water twice Tuesday. She dreamed that she just
might have her chance to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I could only go to the end of the pier,'' she
said. ``If I could only see somebody, I could rescue them.''

CALIFORNIA'S EARLIER PRIMARY PAYING OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary
out of the way, much of the nation's attention will now turn to
California, thanks to its electoral heft and early primary.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the California primary stands to
be a major factor in the presidential nominating process,
fulfilling the hopes of those who pushed to move it up to March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be more than two candidates going into California,
but there will only be one coming out,'' said Dan Schnur,
communications director for the campaign of Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is going to decide the Republican nominee for
president. No ifs, ands or buts. This is the first time in a long
time that California will decide this. It's the size of the state,
the number of delegates at stake and its timing on the primary
calendar that give California an absolutely decisive role.''
</P>
<P>
   It is equally as important for Democrats, with Vice President Al
Gore arriving in Burbank tonight for a two-day swing and former
Sen. Bill Bradley arriving Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At stake for Republicans are 162 delegates _ out of the 1,100
needed for the nomination _ in a state where the winner takes all.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have a proportional basis for assigning delegates, but
it still could be a sizable number with 495 delegates to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
   While the voters can now cast ballots for either party despite
their registration, only those from Republicans will count in GOP
delegate selection and only those from Democrats in that party's
delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is coming to the state this week to attend the California
Republican Party convention in Burlingame, as are other GOP
contenders, including Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is not attending, but his brother _
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush _ is appearing as a surrogate for him. Bush's
campaign said the candidate will be at several locations in
California, probably later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hampered by the stronger-than-expected challenge from
McCain and is being forced to spend more time in South Carolina and
other states holding Republican primaries before the California
election.
</P>
<P>
   California is getting similar attention from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to arrive at 8 tonight at Burbank Airport for
an event on health care. He also is expected to be campaigning in
Los Angeles on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will be in Northern California on Thursday as part of a
monthlong effort in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley both plan to attend the state Democratic
Convention beginning Feb. 11 and are scheduled for a debate in Los
Angeles on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also announced the formation of a sort of
California kitchen cabinet, drawing on many of the supporters of
President Clinton to help him in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the list are longtime activists Bill Wardlaw,
Henry Cisneros, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown Jr., former Rep.
Mel Levine and John Emerson. Garry South, who was Gov. Gray Davis'
campaign manager, is heading up the group.
</P>
<P>
   California playing a role in presidential politics has long been
a dream of officials tired of seeing the state used as the ATM of
campaigns without having a say in the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, four years ago, the state pushed up its traditional
June primary to late March, but other states countered by advancing
their primaries. California struck back by moving its election up
to March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made California the gorilla in national politics,'' said
USC professor Eric Schockman. ``California voters are watching what
happens in Iowa and New Hampshire, and there is finally a real
sense of anticipation that we will play a role in the nominating
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But some complications remain.
</P>
<P>
   California voters two years ago approved what is known as a
blanket primary allowing members of one party to vote for
candidates in another party's primary, and allowing independents to
vote for partisan candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties threatened to not allow the California
vote to count until Secretary of State Bill Jones won approval for
a system to allow only Democratic and Republican votes to count for
their party's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, what it does is give us a chance to remind voters to
register for a party,'' said Schnur. ``We are telling people if
they want their vote to count, they have to register as a
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the primary is only half the political battle, with
both sides wanting to do well for November and the chance to win
the state's 54 electoral votes _ 20 percent of what's needed to win
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum said the state is particularly
important for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to win the White House, they have to win
California,'' Hoffenblum said. ``Republicans can win without
carrying California.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if the past two elections are any indication, the
Republicans had better try harder in California. Not only did
Clinton carry California _ and win the White House _ in 1996, but
Democrats had a near clean sweep in 1998 with the election of Davis
and taking control of both houses in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``What California Republicans want is the top of the ticket to
at least try here,'' Hoffenblum said. ``They want to get a base of
support to have a chance. And, if the top of the ticket carries
California, that would mean they are winning everywhere else.''

 McCAIN WINS BIG VICTORY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE  
 (Subs for new lede and updating and additional details throughout;
story grows by about 300 words)  
 (sw)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain swamped Gov. George W. Bush
on Tuesday in the New Hampshire Republican primary, piling up the
widest margin here since Ronald Reagan defeated Bush's father 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,'' an elated McCain
told a raucous crowd of supporters Tuesday night as he embraced a
victory that his advisers hope is the first step to blocking Bush's
once seemingly unstoppable march to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's triumph was particularly exceptional because surveys of
voters Tuesday found it was built not only on a core of
independents but also on wide and deep support among faithful
Republicans whom the Bush campaign considered its most reliable
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the race turns to Delaware, South Carolina, and then to
Michigan and Arizona, Republican strategists say the question is
whether McCain can propel his victory into a genuine challenge to
Bush. For months, the Texas governor has been widely viewed as the
front-runner because of his towering financial advantage and his
vast endorsements from elected Republicans, even before his victory
in the Iowa caucuses last week.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain and Bush have sparred for weeks over the size of
their tax-cut proposals and the depth of their opposition to
abortion, the surveys of voters found that the most crucial factor
among the Arizona senator's backers was that they viewed him as a
candidate of unshakable character who was willing to stand up for
his convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but be amazed by the size of this,'' McCain
said from his hotel suite in Nashua after being told he had won.
``It's across the board, came from all sectors _ conservatives,
moderates liberals, women. It was a win for the message.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally later, McCain, smiling broadly as he stressed his
insurgent message. ``We have sent a powerful message to Washington
that change is coming,'' he said. ``This is a good thing. And it is
the beginning of the end of the truth-twisting politics of Bill
Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 91 percent of the votes counted about midnight,
McCain held a lead of more than 18 percentage points _ about 40,000
votes _ over Bush. New Hampshire accounts for 17 of the 1,034
delegates it takes to win the Republican Presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The results stunned Bush and his advisers, who for days had
happily predicted they would win here. Even Tuesday morning, Bush
confidently said, ``I'm going to win.'' Tuesday night, at a rally
in Goffstown, Bush emphasized that he was ready to compete
nationwide. ``The road to the Republican nomination and the White
House is a long road,'' he declared to subdued but cheering
supporters. ``Mine will go through all 50 states _ and I intend it
to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that McCain won not because of the issues but because
he campaigned here practically nonstop for months, Bush, flanked by
his wife, Laura, and his twin teen-age daughters, said, ``He spent
more time in this great state than any of the other candidates, and
it paid off. Tonight is his night and the night of his supporters.
And we all congratulate him.'' Bush campaigned here 36 days; McCain
65.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first political loss for the two-term governor
since his defeat in his first run for office, a bid for the House
from Texas in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain were remarkably respectful of one another before
the cameras Tuesday night. But behind the scenes, Bush's aides said
they were considering significantly turning up their attacks on the
senator by painting him as a moderate as the contest turns south
for the South Carolina primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to walk right into our punch in South Carolina,''
said one Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome also set off a furious round of finger pointing
among Bush's advisers over whether he neglected New Hampshire too
long; was too passive in his commercials _ and even whether he
erred in campaigning here with his father on Saturday. Some
advisers suggested that by standing on stage with the former
president, Bush reinforced questions about whether he was too
reliant on his father's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides, seeking to capitalize on an outcome that was far
more lopsided than they had anticipated, immediately sought to step
up their fund-raising as a first step to quickly assembling
organizations in several states. They acknowledged that they could
never amass as much money as Bush, who has collected nearly $69
million, compared with nearly $14 million for McCain. But they said
they want to raise enough to compete aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   The results Tuesday night affirmed McCain's decision to skip the
Iowa caucuses. Steve Forbes, who finished second to Bush in that
contest, placed a distant third Tuesday in New Hampshire. They were
trailed by Alan Keyes, the former State Department official, and
Gary L. Bauer, a prominent religious conservative who aides said
was weighing whether to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Bauer praised McCain for his ``incredibly
strong'' showing and, suggesting he would soon withdraw, said,
``I'm not delusional.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stunning win for Senator McCain,'' said Steve Duprey,
chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. He added: ``The
danger for Bush of an insurgency campaign is that McCain has a
brush fire that he's going to try to turn into a wildfire. If
Governor Bush had beaten Senator McCain decisively, it would have
crippled, if not mortally wounded his campaign. Governor Bush may
well survive a loss. His challenge is to make sure that Senator
McCain doesn't score a series of victories.''
</P>
<P>
   An important factor in McCain's victory was that independents
turned out in force for him. More than 4 in 10 votes, according to
the surveys, said they were independents, an increase from 35
percent four years ago. Six in 10 of those independents voted for
McCain, while fewer than 2 in 10 backed Bush _ and even fewer than
that voted for Forbes. The surveys were conducted by Voter News
Service, a consortium created by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News,
NBC News and the Associated Press. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republican voters, half described themselves as
conservatives and they divided their votes evenly between McCain
and Bush. About 1 in 6 voters described themselves as very
conservative, about the same proportion who said they were part of
the religious right. Bush did well among this group, but not
resoundingly so. He captured about 3 in 10 voters of religious
conservatives while McCain and Forbes each took about 2 in 10 of
their votes.
</P>
<P>
   For all the wranGling over abortion, the issue in the end did
not seem to have played a role in the voters' decisions. Only 1 in
20 said it was the issue that mattered most to them. Asked directly
what their views were, 1 in 10 Republicans said abortion should
always be illegal. They voted for Bush but, again, not resoundingly
so. But among those with other views on abortion _ those who said
it should be illegal in most cases, legal in most cases or legal in
all cases _ backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys found that people credited McCain with saying what
he believed no matter the political consequences. The voters said
they were not swayed more by the tax issue or by social concerns
but believed that both should be priorities of the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Several McCain supporters said in interviews that they found his
history as a war hero in Vietnam and his no-nonsense disposition
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided at the last minute,'' said Jim Arruda, 55, a program
manager from Derry. ``My plan was to vote for John McCain or
against Al Gore. And I voted for McCain. I have a better sense for
who McCain is. And on the Republican side, George Bush just seems
to have no substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim McLaughlin, 41, an electrical engineer, put it this way:
``It was a toss-up between McCain and Bush. I watched the debate
last week, and I was swayed toward McCain. His military experience
was important, he came across as an intelligent man, and someone
who was passionate about his message.''
</P>
<P>
   This campaign was unique in that McCain and former Sen. Bill
Bradley, a Democrat, put themselves forward as reformers and
appealed to a tiny pool of some of the same independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of Republican voters Tuesday said they had
considered voting for a Democrat at one time or another. More than
1 in 10 said they had mulled backing Bradley; less than 1 in 10
said they thought about Gore. But most of those who toyed with
voting vote Bradley decided, in the end, to back McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Bush's father won 23 percent of the vote in the New
Hampshire primary, compared to 50 percent for Reagan, who went on
to win the White House. Bush, at the time, congratulated Reagan,
saying, ``You beat the hell out of us.''

IN SPORTS, RIGHTS ARE LOSING IN A ROUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Between the one-two punch of major-league baseball
and the NCAA, the United States Constitution has taken a worse
beating the past couple of days than Julius Francis did last
Saturday at the hands of Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   First, MLB commissioner Bud Selig suspended Atlanta reliever
John Rocker for his incendiary statements in a Sports Illustrated
article, as if the First Amendment were like baseball's strike zone
and need not be consistently applied.
</P>
<P>
   That was Monday. On Tuesday came the news the NCAA has slapped
UCLA forward JaRon Rush with a 29-game suspension after he spoke
openly and truthfully before a Kansas City grand jury, as though
his Fifth Amendment rights could be as arbitrarily applied as the
palming rule.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you wonder what today will bring: the swift
expulsion, perhaps, from the NFL of Baltimore Ravens linebacker and
accused murderer Ray Lewis by a jury of one _ a red-faced Paul
Tagliabue _ in clear violation of Lewis's Sixth Amendment rights?
</P>
<P>
   Rush accepted $6,125 from his Amateur Athletic Union
traveling-team coach Myron Piggie, a mistake the sophomore forward
then compounded by not procuring legal representation before
admitting he accepted the money. He made the admission while
testifying in front of a Missouri grand jury investigating Piggie
on charges of mail fraud, income tax invasion and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Any lawyer worth his Armani suit would have advised Rush to
plead the fifth rather than risk incriminating himself. Rush
reportedly didn't think he had anything to hide, believing the
money he received from Piggie really came from the deep pockets of
Piggie's employer and Rush's longtime benefactor, Tom Grant.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA had investigated and cleared Rush's relationship with
Grant during the time Rush was being recruited by colleges. So Rush
had reason to believe he had nothing to lose by telling the truth
to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is being punished much more severely for accepting
gifts from someone who's like family to him than Florida State
receiver Peter Warrick was for accepting severely discounted
clothing from a virtual stranger.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Rush needs something, he should just steal it. Is
that the message the NCAA means to send?
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to think like Oliver Stone to wonder if the
20-year-old isn't getting the bum's Rush from the NCAA because the
AAU coaches that the organization dearly would love to regulate
remain, for now, largely outside its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   High-ranking officials within the NCAA have discussed
eliminating summer basketball recruiting so as to diminish the
influence of the Myron Piggies of the basketball world.
</P>
<P>
   There's a double solid line a few AAU coaches have been known to
cross between looking out for the all-everything player and looking
out for No.1. Maybe it's the glare that gets in their eyes from
being included in the circle of college roundball's version of the
Algonquin round table. A little mingling with college basketball's
best and brightest coaches can go a long way toward feeding an AAU
coach's sense of self- importance.
</P>
<P>
   From guiding players to steering them, it's a slippery road,
fraught with blind curves. As long as AAU coaches can be seen
slapping backs with coaches after games, why should we be surprised
if they're also slipping greenbacks into their players' pockets?
</P>
<P>
   The system is so contaminated, it probably should be thrown out
like yesterday's garbage. But a player's constitutional rights
ought not to be trashed in the process. UCLA is right to file an
appeal on Rush's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Not just because Bruins boosters are clamoring for it. But
because no less than the U.S. Constitution demands it.
</P>
<P>
   Allow those in athletics to run roughshod over the first 10
amendments and our Bill of Rights inches one step closer to
becoming just another bill of goods.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore held off a strong
challenge by former Sen. Bill Bradley in the New Hampshire primary
Tuesday, but both candidates vowed a long, tough fight for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, despite a solid victory in the Iowa caucuses eight days
ago, now faces the critical month of March, when more than half the
party's convention delegates will be elected on the first two
Tuesdays, with a dead serious fight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In a quasi-concession speech Tuesday night, Bradley
congratulated Gore without using the words ``victory'' or
``defeat,'' saying, ``We have made a remarkable turnaround, but
there is still a tough fight ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Gore replied, ``We have just begun to fight.'' He
called Bradley ``a tough competitor who made us fight for every
vote.'' He told cheering supporters in Manchester that they had
overcome a Bradley lead maintained for 14 weeks, and promised to
lead them ``all the way to victory in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Those brief speeches, given before Bradley left for Hartford,
Conn., and Gore flew to New York, displayed the edge the two have
shown each other that has become increasingly obvious in recent
weeks, and is likely to become even plainer.
</P>
<P>
   One critical reason why the fight will be rough is that,
according to a poll of Tuesday's voters, Bradley got a substantial
majority from those who decided in the last few days, when he was
most combative. Those poll results may push him toward
confrontations in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the election districts reporting just before
midnight, about 6,000 votes separated the two Democrats. Gore had
73,210 votes, or 52 percent, to Bradley's 67,017, or 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After this brief moment of voter participation, the Democratic
campaign will shift back to an inside game, with no caucuses or
primaries for the rest of the month. The fields of competition, as
they were all last year, will once again be fund raising,
organization and message, and each candidate will be able to spend
about $20 million more.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, neither candidate achieved all he could logically
have hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley expected to do better than he had in Iowa, where Gore
won, 63 percent to 35 percent. He did do better, but this was a
state where in the fall, at least, Bradley's earnest, low-key
style, honed and exhibited in more than 60 town-hall meetings, had
been expected to propel him to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he lost again.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting with joy, Gore claimed to have done better than the
Tennessee Titans, who lost the Super Bowl on Sunday. He said that
during the day some people thought they might emulate the Titans
and ``fall a yard short.'' But, Gore said, ``this Tennessean is in
the end zone and it feels great.''
</P>
<P>
   But a victory by 5 percentage points is something less than a
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Before the polls closed Tuesday, an upbeat Bradley challenged
Gore to debate him once a week between now and the March primaries.
Previously he had spurned Gore's suggestion of twice-weekly
debates, coupled with a mutual agreement not to use 30-second
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sent a letter to Gore that said nothing about
commercials but concluded, ``I am certain that these debates will
provide a useful road map to the voters as to where the Democratic
Party will take the country in this new century.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter Eskew, Gore's senior strategist, complained that Bradley
was not proposing ``getting rid of ads,'' adding: ``He has gone
halfway. Maybe he'll go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Eskew said, ``We'll enter discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire contest, for 22 of the 4,339 delegates to the
Democratic National Convention, was never likely to be decisive,
although Gore partisans had hoped that a second straight defeat
would discourage Bradley and his backers. And they had begun to
orchestrate appeals by other Democrats for Bradley to halt negative
and personal campaigning in the interest of party unity.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who retired from the Senate after three terms in
which he represented New Jersey, had insisted all along that he
would stay through what he called the ``national primary'' next
month, when 1,625 delegates will be chosen on March 7 and another
673 on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   One Bradley supporter, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., predicted early
Tuesday that whatever the New Hampshire result, Bradley would not
withdraw. ``I hope he stays in all the way to the convention,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another former colleague, retired Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., who
often worked across party lines with Bradley, said dryly, ``The
party unity argument would not be a strong one with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the results came in the party establishment started in
on Bradley. David J. Worley, the Democratic chairman in Georgia,
said: ``I think he should drop out. I hope he won't be encouraged
by this mediocre showing to continue these negative attacks from
last week. That's not good for him and it's not good for the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Bradley's claim of a ``turnaround,'' Worley said,
``Any more turnarounds like this and he'll be out of the race for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's primary is March 7, and the entire party apparatus
supports Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Calls like Worley's overlook the fact that a continuing element
of Bradley's campaign has been that he is the Democratic candidate
independent of the Democratic president. About a fifth of the
party's voters surveyed by a consortium of five television networks
and The Associated Press as they left polling places Tuesday said
that Gore's ties to President Clinton were very important to them.
Bradley did quite well among those voters. He also did well with
those who had an unfavorable view of Clinton personally.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did best among groups that Democrats depend on in general
elections, including union members and women. (Gore is popular with
many black voters, but this state has a negligible black
population.)
</P>
<P>
   But the other ingredient of general election victory, support
from independents, favored Bradley. Independents cast about
one-third of the Democratic ballots Tuesday, and Bradley got almost
three-fifths of them. He also did best among voters with graduate
degrees and those 18 to 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a third of the Democrats said they wanted a candidate who
would stand up for principle. Bradley got two-thirds of their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   But a slightly smaller group, about one-fifth, said they wanted
a candidate with experience. Almost all of them voted for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate profited from the issue he had emphasized. Those
voters most concerned about the nation's schools preferred Gore;
those troubled about health care went for Bradley.

ROCKER WRONG _ AND SO WAS PUNISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What John Rocker said was ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's response was hardly more enlightened.
</P>
<P>
   Ordering him to have his head examined? As if an ink-blot test
will tell baseball that Rocker is significantly more mushbrained
than many of his teammates and rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Fining him? Hey, some baseball players spend $20,000 a year in
hotel-room movies.
</P>
<P>
   Suspending him with pay? ``Oh, please don't throw me in the
br'er patch.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that baseball offered up Monday will make any material
difference with Rocker. The steps were pure spin, trying to score
points with a public that doesn't much understand the right to free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who makes a living in the First Amendment, I'm
obviously biased about clamps on free speech, no matter if that
puts me in uncomfortable league with the KKK or the Nation of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of words that jeopardize public safety, no line can be
drawn between cruel expressions and the American belief that
unimpeded public discussion is vital to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer Rocker's overt declarations to similar words whispered
by athletes, coaches and media members I've heard in countless
locker rooms and press boxes. Before spilling his contempt to
Sports Illustrated, I assumed from afar that Rocker was merely a
colorful sort with a fastball as serious as his competitive
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know more. Thanks, John.
</P>
<P>
   While the First Amendment precludes government interference, it
does not prohibit a business or an employer from sanctioning an
employee for behavior that brings the company into disrepute.
</P>
<P>
   That is baseball's opening to punish Rocker. The opening was
botched.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Commissioner Bud Selig said, ``Major League
Baseball takes seriously its role as an American institution and
the important social responsibilities that go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, good for you, Bud _ if you meant it. That claim would be
taken a lot more seriously if he were as agitated over the nickname
of Rocker's team, or expressed some anger over the Confederate
flag's appearance in the state flag of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The moronic prattlings of one ballplayer _ and merely an
employee, not an employer, policymaker or someone of influence _
are far less troublesome than the institutionalized American
acceptance of racist symbols such as mascots and flags.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of nicknames, the symbols persist because Native
Americans have the least political and economic clout among those
peoples whose history and lives have been screwed over in this
country. In other words, the group is easy to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the flag, the Confederate faithful are too big to
challenge. If baseball were serious about its ``social
responsibilities,'' it would give Georgia two years to dump the
stars and bars, or baseball would cease to play in the state.
</P>
<P>
   That's called being proactive, not reactive. Baseball will also
see it as way too costly, in money, time and controversy. So it
will never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the vision is a little grand for a game that took 125
years to get around standardizing its strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's much more convenient for baseball to demonstrate its
``social responsibilities'' by coming down on a punk.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was so massively insulting that not only did he make
himself an easy target, he eclipsed any reckoning for his original
foes _ Mets fans, whose anonymity and status as customers
apparently protect them against accountability for their oral
vileness, as well the hurling of batteries and cups of urine.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rocker should be subject to consequences. But the
options available to punish Rocker are limited by the bargaining
agreement with the players union.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is there are only two things that could have
meaningful influence on Rocker's attitude:
</P>
<P>
   -- Contempt from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   -- Contact with the people he insulted.
</P>
<P>
   The teammates he offended will deal with Rocker, in ways that
will be more hurtful to him that any baseball legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the real impact would come if, instead of sitting in his
back yard serving a suspension, he were required to make
community-service appearances at an AIDS hospice, and visits to
single-parent homes and immigration service centers.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker might find it illuminating to meet the people behind his
stereotypes. He might find out that ``foreigners'' are a national
bedrock, who also include maybe half his teammates. He might find
out that the people he dismissed are just John Rockers without the
breaks of whiteness, wealth and health.
</P>
<P>
   Such contact guarantees nothing in terms of enlightenment. The
only guarantee is that baseball's announced punishment is
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   A creative solution would have required some statesmanlike
cooperation between Selig and the union beyond the usual limits.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the sides seem pitched for yet another tedious,
embarrassing labor/management confrontation that will produce a
compromise satisfying to no one.
</P>
<P>
   In this mess, Rocker is the biggest miscreant. But if baseball
people fail to turn the episode into an opportunity, he won't be
the only one.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6)  
 (af)  
 By JESSE MCKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In her three and a half years as the artistic
director of the Encores musical concert series, the choreographer
Kathleen Marshall has become something of an expert in the fine art
of instant entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Productions at Encores, after all, rarely rehearse for more than
10 days before showing off the results for 3,000 spectators a night
at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine her surprise last fall when she found herself working
on the revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' a project two years in the
making whose rehearsal schedule stretched out over six weeks, a
period unthinkable for any Encores veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept having to say to myself, `Slow down,''' Marshall said.
```They're not going anywhere.'''
</P>
<P>
   That statement may have added meaning considering the rave
reviews the show _ and Marshall's choreography _ received after
opening in November. But while the troupe of ``Kiss Me, Kate'' is
settling in for a long run at the Martin Beck Theater, Marshall has
had little opportunity to stay and savor that success.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even as ``Kate'' was opening, Marshall was casting
``Saturday Night,'' the early Stephen Sondheim musical now in
previews at Second Stage. That wasn't her only project: she was
also reading dozens of scripts for the Encores series, which stages
concert-style revivals of little-seen or lesser-known musicals. She
was also doing advance work on ``Seussical,'' the Dr. Seuss musical
with a score by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, which Marshall is
choreographing and which is expected to open on Broadway in
October.
</P>
<P>
   This week alone she will be simultaneously overseeing the final
previews of ``Saturday Night,'' which opens on Feb. 14, and the
five performances of this year's first Encores show, ``On a Clear
Day You Can See Forever,'' which runs from Thursday to Sunday.
(Thankfully, she's not directing that; Mark Brokaw is.)
</P>
<P>
   Why is Marshall so much in demand?
</P>
<P>
   ``She's developed an amazing craft over a number of years,
working at Encores, and now her time has come,'' said Michael
Blake-more, the director of ``Kiss Me, Kate.'' ``Everybody's had
their eyes on her for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of late, Marshall's eyes have been focused on ``Saturday
Night,'' which is making its New York debut 45 years after Sondheim
completed it. The show tells the story of a young man from Brooklyn
who yearns to be rich at any price and the young woman who falls in
love with him. It was first produced in London in 1997 and in this
country last summer in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the call, my first thought was, `How can I do
this?''' Marshall said. ``My second thought was, `How can I
(italics)not(end italics) do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   In a strange way, ``Saturday Night'' marks something of a
milestone for Marshall; it is the first full-scale production she
has directed and choreographed. (Encores shows are presented with
minimal sets and with the actors holding their scripts.) Is she
nervous?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, oh yeah,'' she said, with a laugh. ``It sort of hits
you like cold water in the face. All of a sudden you think, `Oh,
God, there's going to be people watching this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marshall, a youthful 37-year-old with a dancer's
physique, comes to the project with a host of skills polished at
Encores.
</P>
<P>
   And not surprisingly, her creative crew is filled with Encores
veterans, including her two closest collaborators: Rob Ashford, her
associate choreographer, and Rob Fisher, the acclaimed musical
director of the concert series. She also cast several Encores
alumni, including the young cabaret star David Campbell, whom she
had worked with last year on ``Babes in Arms,'' the 1937 Rodgers
and Hart musical, at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the two Robs, Marshall set about researching the
piece in much the same manner as they have dusted off ``forgotten''
musicals like ``Du Barry Was a Lady'' and ``Call Me Madam'' for
Encores. What they discovered in the case of ``Saturday Night'' was
the curious process of staging a ``new'' musical that was more than
40 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience knows it was written 45 years ago, but they come
in instinctively expecting a new musical,'' Marshall said. ``So
it's kind of in between a revival and something completely new.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange, too, is the show's historical mood; it is set in 1929,
but was written in 1954-55. So, according to Marshall, it has a
certain ``Jimmy Dean'' feel, especially in the book, which was
written by Julius Epstein and edited by Sondheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard with the designers to keep it in the '20s,''
Marshall said, adding that they did extensive photographic research
to get the look of the show right.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and Fisher already knew much of the score _ they had,
in fact, considered ``Saturday Night'' for Encores several years
ago. One invaluable tool they found were two tapes from the show's
original backers' auditions, on one of which the score is sung by
Sondheim himself. ``It was amazingly helpful,'' Marshall said.
``because you can hear the phrasing he had in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What surprised her about the musical, she said, was how complex
it is, considering it came from the mind of a 24-year-old. This had
its advantages, of course, but also led to challenges in the
staging. ``There are eight or nine people moving in every scene,''
she said. ``It's not like the comic character comes on and then
disappears. He's there throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   As a director, Marshall's demeanor is steady; she is at once
serious and playful, friendly but focused. When she watches actors,
she often keeps one foot folded under her for comfort, her other
foot on the floor to tap out the rhythm. She wears dance shoes, and
her style might easily be described as hands _ and feet _ on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite her workaholic tendencies, she has a calming
sense about her; she calls her cast ``guys'' and usually prefaces
her notes with the phrase ``I think ...''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent rehearsal, she sat between a giant tub of Ricola
throat drops and Ashford, smiling a little as Campbell, who plays
the eager-to-be-rich Gene, and Lauren Ward, as Helen, the woman who
loves him, walked through a dance. The first steps worked, but then
things stalled. Marshall jumped up and walked through it with
Ashford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something about that feels funky,'' she said. The actors
agreed. ``Maybe,'' she said, pivoting with Ashford, ``it's left,
right, left.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. She sat, and the scene continued.
</P>
<P>
   Apparent, too, is her love of detail, or what Blakemore called
``little bits of business that bring out the personality of a
character.'' For the ensemble dance pieces in ``Kiss Me, Kate,''
she created individual characters for each dancer _ the diva, the
dance captain, the girlfriends _ to add to the flavor of the
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It tends, her actors say, to make even the most insignificant
characters seem more important. Part of that care may come from her
past dancing days.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest child of three, Marshall was brought up in
Pittsburgh, where her parents are academics. She says she
distinctly remembers putting on ``little music theater revues'' in
her living room, including a karaoke-style version of ``Kiss Me,
Kate.'' Her collaborator was her older brother, Rob, who has also
grown up to be a Broadway choreographer, having set the steps for
``Cabaret,'' and ``Damn Yankees,'' on which Kathleen was his
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, Marshall earned her Equity card at the Pittsburgh Civic
Light Opera, and after getting a degree in English literature at
Smith College, she migrated to New York to try to become a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Though she had some degree of success, and even toured with
``Cats,'' by the early 1990s she had given up performing and was
working as an assistant choreographer. In 1994, she was noted by
critics who saw her work in the revue ``Swinging on a Star'' at the
Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut, and shortly thereafter was
approached about choreographing ``Call Me Madam'' for the Encores
series, then relatively unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The show rehearsed during a blizzard and opened to rave reviews.
Critics took special note of Marshall's eclectic work. Writing in
The New York Times, Stephen Holden said the show's ``frothy survey
of Broadway dance styles'' left ``the audience cheering.'' It also
drew the attention of commercial producers, especially after
``Swinging on a Star'' moved to Broadway later that same year.
</P>
<P>
   Several more Encores shows (``Li'l Abner,'' ``The Boys From
Syracuse,'') followed, as did consistently strong reviews. After
Walter Bobbie resigned as artistic director of the series in 1996,
Marshall was the first choice to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   It is a job, she said, that is surprisingly rigorous,
considering that there are only three concerts a year, performed
for only four days each. The process of picking the shows begins
almost as soon as the previous season ends, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But this month will certainly be more hectic than most,
considering that the closing night of this year's first Encores
concert is Feb. 13 and the opening of ``Saturday Night'' is the
very next day.
</P>
<P>
   Not, of course, that Marshall is complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be busy,'' she said with a smile, ``is not a very big
complaint to have.''

 Graham Fuller is the movie columnist for Interview magazine and the
editor of ``Loach on Loach,'' about the director Ken Loach.  
 By GRAHAM FULLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three days into the last century, the wife of a San Francisco
cafe owner gave birth to a child who would grow up to be the lone
female filmmaker of Hollywood's golden era.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Arzner will not receive a fraction of the tributes
accorded that other recent centenarian, Alfred Hitchcock. But
Arzner warrants a place in film history, and not simply because she
broke into the super-macho profession that movie directing was in
the '30s and '40s. Looked at today, Arzner's films are startling in
their pre-feminist probings of women's place in American society.
</P>
<P>
   They are also irreverent, sharp and amusing, the kinds of movies
that make a mockery of contemporary notions of political
correctness. In that respect, they probably took their cue from the
director herself, a lesbian who posed for a famous studio
photograph with one of her stars, Clara Bow, sitting on her lap,
and who was posthumously accused by another, Esther Ralston, of
sexual harassment during filming.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston aside, Arzner's actors liked her. She was said to be
unflappable on the set and won the friendship of no less a diva
than Joan Crawford, for whom she directed Pepsi-Cola commercials
during the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Arzner was the kind of director who, in ``Christopher Strong''
(1933), had the nerve to present the 24-year-old Katharine Hepburn
as a pioneering English aviatrix breezing into a room wearing not
leathers and goggles but a silvery, clinging one-piece suit
complete with moth's-head helmet and antennae _ to the bewilderment
of the staid married diplomat who is falling for her.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dance, Girl, Dance'' (1940), Lucille Ball, as a stripper,
conquered her burlesque audience with one sensational come-hither
glance and the aspiring artiste Maureen O'Hara read the riot act to
the crowd of baying men. It is not the least virtue of Arzner's
work that it is packed with such compelling ambiguities.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Christopher Strong,'' which is screening at Brooklyn
Academy of Music's Rose Cinemas on Feb. 21 in New York City as part
of an all-too-brief tribute to Arzner, Hepburn's character, Lady
Cynthia Darrington, is invoked as a spirit of devil-may-care female
emancipation. It is all the more perplexing, therefore, to see her
turning up in the one-piece get-up, an outfit with the androgynous
lines of the one worn by Marlene Dietrich in ``Dishonored'' (1931)
and the Art Deco shimmer of Jean Harlow's raciest gowns. Try to
imagine Amelia Earhart, on whom Lady Cynthia was modeled, similarly
attired.
</P>
<P>
   Is this costume a sexual advertisement or a proclamation of
feminine strength? It seems to be both and neither.
</P>
<P>
   Thus clad, Lady Cynthia tells her diffident suitor, Sir
Christopher (Colin Clive), that she has no sex appeal: ``I'm not
attractive that way,'' she says, as if personal magnetism were
something one bought at Harrods. He doesn't believe her (nor do we)
and some months later they begin an adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   But the self-effacing remark suggests an unconscious desire on
the part of this virginal young woman to fend off the predatory, if
outwardly genteel, father figure.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, Lady Cynthia tells Sir Christopher that, despite his
entreaties, she can never quit flying. They then make love for the
first time _ offscreen, of course. We see her hand stretch out in
the middle of the night and we watch, by the light of a bedside
lamp, as she admires the diamond bracelet he has given her and says
she will renounce her dangerous vocation after all.
</P>
<P>
   The bracelet, Arzner implies, is a mark of sexual ownership; in
losing her virginity, Lady Cynthia will be losing much more.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes ask more questions about a woman's psyche than they
answer. As such, they epitomize the Arzner touch. After all, if
Ernst Lubitsch, Hollywood's master of sexual innuendo, should have
a ``touch,'' why shouldn't Arzner? It is often manifested in scenes
that show how women's behavior affects the women around them.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Bride Wore Red'' (1937), a prostitute (played by
Crawford) who pretends to be a lady when she is given an unexpected
taste of Tyrolean high life basks in the attention paid to her by a
feckless playboy while his pretty, passive longtime fiancee suffers
beside them. Arzner targeted not just man's insensitivity to woman
but women's unkindness to women. And for every independent woman in
her films, there is a gold digger.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Arzner waited tables in her father's stage-door
restaurant and learned not to be impressed by the movie stars who
ate there. She drove ambulances in France during World War I,
studied as a pre-med student at the University of Southern
California, worked on a newspaper and entered the film industry as
a stenographer in the Famous Players script department.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated to script clerk, film cutter, then film editor.
The director James Cruze was so impressed with her inventive
editing of the bullfight sequences in the Rudolph Valentino vehicle
``Blood and Sand'' (1922) that he hired her for his next picture,
an epic Western of 1923. ``It was her association with `The Covered
Wagon,''' wrote Kevin Brownlow in ``The Parade's Gone By,'' ``that
brought Arzner's name into the film history books, the only editor
from the entire silent period to be officially remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   She was writing scripts when Paramount gave her a shot at
directing, beginning with ``Fashions For Women'' (1927), starring
Ralston. Arzner then directed Bow as a saucy gold digger trying to
snare an aristocrat in ``Get Your Man'' (1927) and as a saucy
college girl trying to snare the anthropology professor in ``The
Wild Party'' (1929), which BAM is showing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``The Wild Party'' (which is unrelated to Joseph
Moncure March's 1926 poem or to the two forthcoming musicals it
inspired), turns on Bow's character's decision to admit to a
misdemeanor she did not commit, thus protecting a guilty fellow
student who is dedicated to an academic career.
</P>
<P>
   The story is ludicrous, but retrospectively fascinating _ and
delightfully naughty _ as a time capsule of an age when
student-teacher relations were not steeped in the kind of paranoia
that informs, say, David Mamet's ``Oleanna'' (though Fredric
March's prissy professor has an inkling that he and the eager Bow
should not be caught).
</P>
<P>
   Arzner was probably attracted to this tale of one woman's
loyalty to another _ but perhaps also to the opportunity it
afforded her to celebrate (italics)girls,(end italics) whom this
dapper director admired as much as did any of her male
counterparts. A burst of untrammeled feminine energy from beginning
to end, ``The Wild Party'' never trivializes the mercurial Bow or
the imperatives of young womanhood in the late '20s.
</P>
<P>
   Arzner found her niche directing so-called ``women's pictures''
in the '30s and early '40s, a successful cycle of films that did
not simply tell women's stories but challenged the notion of
patriarchy and often ended on an ironic note. Her best movies are
now considered to be ``Craig's Wife'' (1936), a critique of family
life in which Rosalind Russell plays a shrewish housewife
tragically obsessed with her home, and ``Dance, Girl, Dance,''
which concludes as a fierce condemnation of sexism.
</P>
<P>
   As a stylist, Arzner was erratic. ``Dance, Girl, Dance,'' for
example, is an awful stylistic mishmash, yet it packs an emotional
punch that the lush ``The Bride Wore Red'' _ full of bravura camera
moves _ does not. In ``Dance, Girl, Dance,'' O'Hara's character,
Judy, is hired to make a fool of herself dancing demurely in front
of the burlesque audience, thereby increasing its fervor for the
act, performed by Lucille Ball's sexy Bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Jeered at one too many times, Judy tears into the lecherous
spectators', reminding them that they do not fool their wives with
their antics. Sadly, after scrapping with Bubbles, Judy ends up in
the arms of a celebrated choreographer who shows every sign of
dominating her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, Arzner caught pneumonia after completing her 16th
full-length feature, ``First Comes Courage,'' and decided not to
resume her career after her recovery. She directed Women's Army
Corps documentaries during World War II and taught and directed at
the Pasadena Playhouse, later teaching at UCLA, where Francis Ford
Coppola benefited from her personal encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   She died in 1979, eight years after the death of her partner,
the dancer, choreographer and screenwriter Marion Morgan, with whom
she had lived for 41 years.
</P>
<P>
   Arzner was first championed by feminist film critics in the
'70s, although in interviews she distanced herself from their
claims. (Ida Lupino, Hollywood's only female director of the '50s,
made similar denials.) Exactly what Arzner's overarching intent was
as an ambiguous auteur and as a public personality given to butch
poses with her young, pretty actresses, is ultimately hard to
define, as Judith Mayne suggested in her 1994 study ``Directed by
Dorothy Arzner.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt, though, that Arzner, ideologue or not, cared
deeply about women and their right to a career, to their
individuality and to be respected by men. That no woman in today's
Hollywood has been able to address these themes so consistently as
a director reveals how vital a figure she was.

NOT YOUNG ANYMORE BUT STILL MISBEHAVING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ In his dressing room backstage after a sold-out show
here, Mark McKinney of the Kids in the Hall took off his jeans and
then, once his robe was secured, his pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   The Kids' sense of humor has always been layered, often with
women's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after their sketch-comedy television show, ``The Kids
in the Hall,'' went off the air, McKinney, Dave Foley, Scott
Thompson, Bruce McCulloch and Kevin McDonald have reunited for an
18-city tour of the United States and their native Canada. During
those years a strange thing has happened: these cult comedians seem
to have become quasi-rock stars, with enough fans to fill a
2,800-seat Toronto theater for three nights, a 4,000-seater in
Chicago and seven sold-out shows at Town Hall in New York from
Wednesday through next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Like the original ``Star Trek,'' the Kids are more popular now
than they ever were in their heyday, thanks perhaps to daily reruns
of their show on Comedy Central. And like ``Monty Python's Flying
Circus,'' they have obsessive fans who can recite entire sketches
by heart and happily preempt punchlines during the live show with
shouts of ``Chicken Lady!,'' ``Head Crusher!'' or simply, ``Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers, many of them female, have been loitering outside the
stage door every night here, as if the Kids were the next
Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   For five middle-aged guys who are, as the euphemism goes,
between projects, this must be about as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new generation of kids in their dorm rooms
watching us,'' Foley said in the green room of Massey Hall after
the show.
</P>
<P>
   The group's cherubic, sort of straight man, Foley is also its
most commercially successful member, having gone on to star in the
NBC sitcom ``NewsRadio.'' When they departed CBS's late-night
lineup in 1995, the Kids went their own ways.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Thompson, who came out long before Ellen DeGeneres, played
Hank's openly gay assistant on ``The Larry Sanders Show.'' Bruce
McCulloch, the musically inclined one, recorded an album called
``Shame-Based Man'' and directed two movies: ``Superstar'' and
``Dog Park.'' McKinney, after a stint on ``Saturday Night Live,''
has become a well-reviewed New York stage actor. And Kevin
McDonald, well, more on him later.
</P>
<P>
   The Kids are pushing 40, or past it, now. ``South Park'' on
Comedy Central and ``The Tom Green Show'' on MTV have eclipsed
these darkly mischievous Canadians on the outrageousness front. But
outrage was never really their goal. They were ``shocked that
people were shocked'' by them, Thompson said. Besides, they still
have a few tricks up their sleeveless dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-dressing is hardly all they do, but it became their
trademark transgression. Maybe it was because no one since Uncle
Milty had really made it a regular shtick on American television.
True to form, at the Toronto show, they arrived on stage in drag _
after a HAL-style voice-over warning the already overheated
audience of the ``burning sensuality'' to come.
</P>
<P>
   Then five giddy women skipped from the wings greeting each other
with vapid excitement and exchanging unpleasantries. The crowd went
nuts, laughing a little harder than was absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a greatest-hits affair, giving the fans the
``classic'' routines and characters they came to see, with some new
material to keep the Kids themselves interested. They wrote ``Jesus
2000,'' an infomercial for a ``self-worshipping'' God who requires
no actual prayer or church attendance, by e-mail before the tour.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the old characters have new dialogue. But the
targets of their strange, goofy satire are their familiar ones:
paternal authority figures, suburbia and, pace Python, men in suits
with silly walks.
</P>
<P>
   A few videotaped bits ran on the projection-screen triptych
behind them. Toronto bar-band rock played over the sound system
between skits. The music, like some of the material, had a
nostalgic twang _ another reminder that these jokes were not quite
as fresh as they once were.
</P>
<P>
   Lorne Michaels, the Flo Ziegfeld of sketch comedy, discovered
the Kids, or one of his local scouts did, performing in a downtown
Toronto bar in 1986. He gave them their shot, bringing them to New
York and eventually taping the pilot that landed them their own
show on HBO, then CBS.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What comic gold did Michaels see in them? ``They were fresh and
original, and all those other words that don't mean anything,'' he
said, on the phone from his Los Angeles office. ``Python is the
obvious comparison, but they were less laugh-driven.'' The Kids'
way of going deep into character reminded him of Lily Tomlin, whose
television shows he had written for in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kids in the Hall,'' huge in Canada, never quite translated
into boffo viewership for CBS. Too weird, or subtle, or gay. It
wasn't always funny _ what is? _ and didn't fall back on American
cultural references the way ``SCTV,'' an earlier Canadian export,
did. The reviews tended to be better than the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the same subsection of the culture watched us in the
States as here,'' Foley said. As did younger, so-called alternative
comics, like the defiantly unfunny Janeane Garofalo and the hipster
meta-humorists of the HBO sketch series, ``Mr. Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that the Kids were never self-conscious about
their subversiveness. They did not wear black leather or huge geek
glasses. ( Foley's recent flirtation with bottle-blond hair and a
goatee suggests that he may have spent too much time in Los
Angeles.) These were just nice-looking Canadian boys with a
slightly demented worldview. As Andrew Clark, the author of ``Stand
and Deliver: Inside Canadian Comedy,'' said, ``In Canada,
alternative comedy is just comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a tad too alternative for Paramount, the studio that
released ``Brain Candy,'' the Kids' 1996 movie about the awful
societal side effects of a pill that makes everybody frighteningly
happy. At issue was Cancer Boy, played by McCulloch. The
wheelchair-bound youth wore a baseball cap with the letter C on it,
and when he met new people, he would say things like ``Hi, my
marrow's low.''
</P>
<P>
   Some executives at the studio found this tasteless and wanted
the character cut. The Kids refused. After a minimal marketing
campaign, ``Brain Candy'' bombed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sunk it,'' McCulloch said. Foley added that the movie has
enjoyed a cultish afterlife on video.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting around the green room in one of their hometown's oldest
and most prestigious concert halls, the Kids affect a rec-room
bonhomie that belies the vicious in-fighting noted in every article
about them over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always fought leading up to a performance,'' Foley said.
Thompson corroborated: ``We acted like the entire universe hinged
on our every decision.'' Now there is less at stake. They can
afford to get along, with one another at least.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewing comedians is never a picnic. They are invariably
too serious or too funny or every comment comes with ironic ``air
quotes'' around it. The Kids run the gamut, from McCulloch, who in
his trademark scarf makes a sincere effort to answer questions, to
the chatty Thompson to Foley, who radiates smug boredom.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, upon being introduced, placed his hands together in
mock prayer and excused himself to spend time with his family at
the afterparty downstairs. The talented McDonald's refreshing
indifference to publicity may also explain why he is the group's
least well-known alumnus. Blink and you'll miss his bit part in
``Galaxy Quest.''
</P>
<P>
   The affable McKinney is arguably the star of the reunion. His
Chicken Lady and Head Crusher _ both of which must be seen for
their hilarity to be believed _ are its most requested characters.
They are also broad enough to play in a venue that occasionally
feels too big for the material.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a diplomat, McKinney concisely summarized the
reunion's slightly nostalgic, Eagles-concert feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``God we're fat!'' he exclaimed. ``We used to look like European
models!''
</P>
<P>
   So they're not kids anymore. The kids in the audience don't seem
to care.

PILOTS' STRUGGLE LASTED FOR MINUTES
</HEADLINE>

story.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For five fateful minutes, the crew of Alaskan
Airlines Flight 261 fought to regain control of the plummeting jet
before trying to turn around for an emergency landing at LAX.
</P>
<P>
   But by then it was too late for the 88 crew members and
passengers of Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought that they could maintain altitude, and they would
go on to LAX,'' said John Hammerschmidt, spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:16 p.m. Monday, just a minute after deciding to head to Los
Angeles International, the crew made its last radio contact and the
MD-83 jetliner disappeared from radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators intensified their search Tuesday for clues,
they provided a gripping account of the last 26 minutes of radio
transmissions and the crews' desperate struggle to avert disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Flying over the Santa Barbara Channel, some 20 miles from Los
Angeles International Airport, the five-member crew suddenly
noticed their plane was losing altitude and was difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   It would take them about 20 minutes before discovering the
culprit: a jammed horizontal stabilizer, responsible for
controlling the up-and- down motion of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, Capt. Ted Thompson and First Officer William
Tansky, seasoned former military pilots, spoke matter-of-factly as
they summoned all their experience and skill to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they told controllers the problem was ``kind of
stabilized,'' but moments later they conceded, ``we're still
working on it,'' according to Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   The last routine transmission came at 3:35 p.m., when the flight
out from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and Seattle was
cleared to fly at 31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, at 4:10 p.m., the pilots alerted
air-traffic controllers in Palmdale they were having trouble
controlling the plane. Within seconds, the plane suddenly dropped
from 26,000 feet and then to 23,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled by the sudden altitude change, air traffic controllers
asked the crew for its condition. The crew responded it had ``kind
of stabilized and was going to do some trouble- shooting,'' said
Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:14 p.m., controllers told the flight crew to let them know
if they needed anything.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15 p.m., the controllers in Palmdale handed off Flight 261
to another controller aware of the problem. Seconds later, the crew
discovered that the stabilizer was jammed and they were having
trouble maintaining altitude. It was then they decided to divert to
LAX.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:16 p.m., the flight crew advised that it was going to
10,000 feet and had to change flight configurations over the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to change flight configuration, to deploy the wing
flaps to slow the plane down,'' Hammerschidt explained. ``In a
cruise flight, the flaps are at a particular setting. They wanted
to change it to `approach setting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers gave that clearance and the flight crew
acknowledged that transmission.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:17, traffic controllers advised the flight crew to contact
another air traffic controller on a different frequency, but the
transmission was not acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:21, controllers lost radar contact with the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The plane slammed nose-first into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, Drew Gottshall was the first to report seeing
the crash as the plane plunged into the ocean about 2 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the aircraft, looked up, and followed its path
visually till it hit the water,'' said the National Parks Service
maintenance worker.
</P>
<P>
   Through binoculars, Gottshall watched debris and an oil slick
surface, as a fishing boat headed toward the crash site. ``Because
of the distance away and the slow travel time of sound, it was four
or five seconds after seeing the plane impact the water before I
heard the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point as I was watching the descent of the plane
where I felt hopeless. It had a finality that came very quickly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the plane hit the water and disappeared, there was just
me and seagulls out there.''

<P>
   The exhibitions that chronicle the activities of the Royal
Excavation Corps, a shadowy organization formed by demobilized
officers in the years following World War I and involved in
everything from intelligence gathering to archaeology to
parapsychology, constitute a compelling if little known slice of
history.
</P>
<P>
   Among the expeditions the corps scrupulously recorded in
panoramic photographs and firsthand accounts were an attempted
trans-Atlantic flight that ended in disaster and a secret mission
to Siberia in the closing months of the war.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs, often yellow with age, and the accompanying
journal entries provide vivid testimony of lives pushed to the
limit of endurance. As in most historical exhibits, a few artifacts
also help bring events to life.
</P>
<P>
   A display chronicling the wreck of the experimental glider
Albatross includes a single pair of boots, the sole evidence of the
doomed pilot and a chilling reminder of the narrow margin between
success and failure in the race for control of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   These displays record an earlier, more adventurous age when men
could test their mettle against the unknown. Or so it first
appears. Closer scrutiny reveals a stranger and more entertaining
truth. The photographs, texts and artifacts are not historical
documents at all, as the improbability of the stories ultimately
confirms, but rather elaborate fictions concocted by two artists,
Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick, both 35, who mimic with
perfect pitch the great adventure narratives of the past.
</P>
<P>
   This is the world of Stanley and Livingstone, of Amundsen and
Scott racing for the Pole. The black-and-white photographs possess
the neutrality of a documentary, and the prose has the laconic tone
of the explorer's diary in which even the most hair-raising
adventures are recounted with deliberate understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Kemmerer, an associate curator at the Addison Gallery of
American Art in Andover, Mass., who included Kahn and Selesnick in
a recent show titled ``Referencing the Past,'' recalls her initial
encounter with their work: ``Before I actually saw the work I
remember reading the narrative and falling for the story. I was
completely taken in. Then as I got deeper, I began to say: `What
(italics)is(end italics) this thing?'''
</P>
<P>
   This double take is an undeniable ingredient in the work, but
the artists are after something beyond the initial ``gotcha!''
``It's a fine line,'' says Selesnick, a lanky redhead who often
turns up in the photographs in the role of the REC's Bindon
MacRupert. ``We don't want to be seen primarily as perpetrators of
hoax. It's better if some people accidentally believe it, and some
people know it's fiction. It's not just a one-joke gag.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting beyond the one-liner is essential in their latest body
of work, ``Transmissions From the Schottensumpfkunftig
(Scotlandfutureborg)'' _ shown originally at Boston's Pepper
Gallery and coming to New York's David Beitzel Gallery on Thursday
for a five-week stay _ where the artists have pushed the story
beyond the breaking point of even the most gullible viewer.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest adventure, where our plucky heroes have managed
to leap forward to a bleak post-apocalyptic future, there is a
hilarious dissonance between the bizarre tale and the deadpan
manner in which it is presented. Scholarly weight is imparted by
German titles like ``Gedankenschnabelzug'' _ for a photograph of a
group of men carrying banners and sporting strange beaklike
appendages _ and ``Sumpffahrmann,'' which tempt viewers to scramble
for the bilingual dictionary until they read the equally opaque
English translations: ``Thoughtbeaktrain'' and ``Bogferryman.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all good forgers, Kahn and Selesnick authenticate
photographs with documentation and documentation with artifact,
though, unlike their criminal counterparts, they demonstrate a
gleeful disregard for plausibility. Items picked up at flea markets
can, with a little tweaking, strike just the right note, like the
19th-century potato masher that now serves in the more menacing
role of warrior's club.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, who plays the sober Ian Brockman to Selesnick's half-mad
MacRupert, sees a link between the profession of artist and forger.
``I got interested early on in creating a forged world,'' he
recalls. ``It seemed a natural vehicle for a three-dimensional
artist to do fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The affinity between art and fakery is not new, dating back at
least to the time of Plato, who regarded any art that mimicked life
as a dangerous fraud. Even Michelangelo was said to have gotten
into the act, passing off a Cupid he had carved as an ancient work
by burying it in the ground to achieve an antique patina.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other perpetrators of artistic fraud, Kahn and
Selesnick are less interested in deceiving than in exploring how
images, words and physical ``evidence'' conspire to manufacture the
appearance of reality. Their installations _ with vitrines chock
full of ``authentic'' artifacts, copiously documented _ are modeled
on those displays in ethnographic or natural history museums that
purport to provide an objective account of the world. (In an
earlier display devoted to the Siberian expedition, the artifacts
were provided, we were told, courtesy of the Novosibirsk Museum of
Ethnographic Studies.)
</P>
<P>
   By employing the authoritative institutional voice to narrate
such unlikely tales, the artists force viewers to examine how fact
is distinguished from fiction. For Selesnick this is a particularly
pertinent issue in the information age. ``With the proliferation of
the mass media,'' he points out, ``it's really easy to put out
completely erroneous material and have it disseminated and
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographs are crucial aids in the manufacture of reality,
which is exactly why they are so often faked. Their deceptive
potential has been scrutinized by contemporary photographers like
Cindy Sherman, whose images translate the childhood game of
dress-up into a very adult idiom, and Yasumasa Morimura, who
depicts himself in such iconic roles as Manet's Olympia to address
racial and sexual stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the photograph remains the medium of truth, no matter how
savvy we are about the ways that truth can be manipulated. As
Kemmerer explains: ``In the 19th century people believed that what
they saw in the photograph was what actually happened. Now we know
better than to trust the photograph, we know that it can be
doctored, but it still carries that conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kahn and . Selesnick, the ease with which reality can be
faked is hardly cause for despair. ``A lot of this is going back to
being an 11-year-old boy,'' says Kahn, who compares his
collaboration with Selesnick to a couple of kids playing pirates.
``When it's just a single artist it's more delusional, but when two
people create this world together, it builds a kind of energy. It's
so much like playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The element of play was evident last fall in a photography
session, in preparation for their latest exhibition, at Phillips
Academy in Andover, Mass., where the two were artists in residence.
In an on-campus studio, thickly carpeted with leaves collected for
the occasion, they set up an elaborate tableau with a large cast
(played gamely by students).
</P>
<P>
   The complex panorama _ when complete, it consists of three
6-foot-long sections with more than 100 figures _ is based on
Mantegna's ``Triumph of Caesar'' and is filled with typically
inscrutable Kahn and Selesnick motifs, including a wicker-clad
``sacrificial victim'' in his chariot and a parade of natives in
``thought beaks.''
</P>
<P>
   While Selesnick knelt behind the camera, hood thrown over his
head _ the old-fashioned field camera with its bellows and black
hood could have easily passed for REC standard issue _ Kahn
frantically adjusted the lighting, arranged the costumes and hunted
for missing props. It was, Kahn said, laughing in mock despair,
total chaos, but clearly everyone was having a great time.
</P>
<P>
   With everything finally in place, Selesnick snapped the shutter
and the students dispersed while the next shot was organized.
Later, using a computer, the artists combined the separate shots
into a single panoramic image and dropped in the appropriate
backgrounds, taken earlier on the Isle of Skye. With the evidence
of the photographs and artifacts set before our astonished eyes,
who would deny that this peculiar journey did indeed take place?
</P>
<P>
   It has often been said that truth is stranger than fiction, but
for Kahn and Selesnick, it is only when the two get mixed up that
things start to get interesting.

A GRITTY PORTRAYAL OF POLICE LIFE GETS A KIND OF CLOSURE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For seven years, ``Homicide: Life on the Street''
struggled to survive. The ensemble show about homicide detectives
in Baltimore had few car chases or shootouts. There was little of
the sexual drama of the far more successful ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' And
the show's time slot, Friday night at 10, was hardly choice.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the series ended last August, it had won three
Peabody Awards and three Emmys. Even NBC was a little reluctant to
let it disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never really did a final episode,'' said Preston Beckman,
the executive vice president of programming at NBC. ``We didn't
make the decision about `Homicide' until May, and by then it was
too late to go back. There was a feeling that there was a final
story still to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Homicide: The Movie,'' which will be shown next
Sunday on NBC. The film's plot is set in its opening scene. Lt. Al
Giardello, played by Yaphet Kotto, is a mayoral candidate in
Baltimore. On a street corner campaign stop, he is shot and
seriously wounded. The hunt for a mysterious gunman reunites the
old ``Homicide'' crew, including Andre Braugher, who played Frank
Pembleton, now a college teacher, and Kyle Secor, who was Tim
Bayliss, now back in Baltimore from New York and struggling to find
his bearings.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Fontana, the writer-producer who oversaw the series, said
that Garth Ancier, the president of NBC Entertainment, had asked
him to create a ``Homicide'' feature, but he was reluctant to do
so. ``I had turned off all those `Homicide' creative valves,'' said
Fontana, who also helped develop the HBO prison series ``Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   But the filmmaker Barry Levinson, who was Fontana's executive
producing partner on ``Homicide,'' urged him to make the movie.
Fontana agreed _ but only if all the actors would come back. They
agreed. Among the others who returned were Isabella Hofmann (who
played Megan Russert), Richard Belzer (John Munch), Clark Johnson
(Meldrick Lewis) and Melissa Leo (Kay Howard). Fontana and two
writers, Eric Overmyer and James Yoshimura, worked out the plot in
one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so glad I was talked back into it,'' Fontana said. ``For
all of us there was a real sense of loss about the end of the show,
a real sense of frustration that we didn't get to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a real sense, among the actors at least, that the
series was as creative as any network show on television but that
it was always treated as a bit of an orphan on NBC. (NBC executives
said that when a show faltered, its actors and creators often
blamed flawed network marketing and promotion, rarely the show
itself.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Homicide'' ended, its audience had reached 10.3
million. About 18 million viewers watch ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,''
according to Nielsen figures.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which began in 1992, was based on David Simon's
nonfiction book about Baltimore detectives, ``Homicide: A Year on
the Killing Street.'' From the beginning, it struggled: there were
only nine episodes in 1993 and four the next year. In 1993, it had
a brief, disastrous turn as a Wednesday night rival to the ABC
sitcom ``Home Improvement.'' In October 1994, it settled into its
Friday slot.
</P>
<P>
   What made the show engrossing was not only its complex cops _
they were often tormented and unpredictable _ but also story lines
that meandered and were sometimes unresolved. The fact that the
show took place almost entirely on the meanest streets of Baltimore
and was filmed with handheld cameras made it probably the grittiest
drama on network television. (Privately, some network executives
and viewers complained that the early shows, with their jerky
camera movements, caused dizziness.)
</P>
<P>
   Those cameras pulled the audience right into the action, said
Jean de Segonzac, who directed the ``Homicide'' movie and was the
director of photography on more than 60 episodes of the show.
``Everything was shot fast,'' he said. ``The actors would ask me
when they'd be on camera, and I refused to tell them. Everyone was
in the moment, everyone had to be on. It gave the scenes tremendous
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the show's strength was not based solely on camera
technique. Relationships and personalities on the show were quirky.
The detective played by Secor dabbled in Buddhism as well as
bisexuality. His partner, played by Braugher, had a stroke and
appeared to have a breakdown. (The Braugher character is fully
recovered in the movie.)
</P>
<P>
   And while the police in ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' are generally
presented in the most positive light _ even the troubled Dennis
Franz character _ the detectives in ``Homicide'' were somehow more
shadowy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sustained me during this series,'' Braugher said, ``and,
what I think, sustained most of us, was that we could dig deeper
and deeper into characters as complex as the people we live with on
a daily basis. They had a dark and a light side. They were yin and
yang. They were constantly in flux. They were hard-nosed and
unsentimental but mysterious. That was appealing to people. They
were contradictory _ sort of like life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann, who played a police captain, said that the show's
matter-of-fact realism gave it unusual credibility. In one episode,
when her character was promoted over the detective played by Kotto,
who is black, the dialogue centered on the fact that she was given
the job, in part, because she was a woman, and he accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a realistic look at homicide detectives that was quite
different from other shows,'' Hofmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Belzer, a comedian who played the three-times-married detective
John Munch, put it another way: ``What made the show so special was
that it was a unique and very personal take on crime and
punishment. I don't think audiences saw this kind of realism, what
detectives go through, the emotional toll it takes on them, the way
it affects the victims and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives, while obviously pleased with the critical
reception, never quite knew what to make of the show. The fact that
most episodes were not self-contained _ and that plot lines
wandered from week to week _ made ``Homicide'' difficult to repeat
on the network and therefore less lucrative than shows that
conclude neatly in an hour. Moreover, the series never matched the
highly publicized sex and nudity of ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Fontana said: ``On that show you had Jimmy Smits, David Caruso,
Kim Delaney _ all this sexual stuff going, in addition to Dennis
Franz, who's remarkable. To be wildly successful on episodic TV,
you have to be sexy. We were a lot of things, but we weren't
sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   But both its creators and NBC executives believe that
``Homicide'' was extraordinarily successful in its handling of
race. The police were a blur of nationalities, and so were the
victims and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we tried to deal with racism,'' Fontana said, ``it was on
its most subtle levels _ not a cross burning in the front yard but
a misspoken word, a thoughtless gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Johnson, a black actor who played a hip, straightforward
detective, agreed that the show dealt subtly with race issues. In
one episode, the police became alarmed about a Black Muslim
security force in a housing project until it was pointed out that
wealthy neighborhoods with private police are, of course, ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd indirectly comment on things from the headlines,''
Johnson said. ``This show tapped into the urban psyche better than
any I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who also directed a half-dozen ``Homicide'' episodes,
said he was convinced that one day the series would be seen as a
definitive network television show of the 1990s, that it will
endure because it was not mainstream. ```Homicide' cut to the
chase,'' he said with a laugh. ``It reflected the evolution of the
viewing audience. It was special. And it didn't pander to `The
Dukes of Hazzard' generation.''

ALASKA CREW STRUGGLED TO CONTROL DOOMED PLANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ The two veteran pilots struggled to control
their doomed plane for more than 10 minutes before it dropped from
radar and into the Pacific as they prepared to make an emergency
landing at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board said
Tuesday that the pilots of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 told
controllers they wanted to keep their MD-83 jet over water as they
readied it for landing. It was an act that aviation experts said
showed the crew knew they were in serious trouble and did not want
to go down over a populated area.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in their communication with air traffic controlers,
they reported a jammed stabilizer, a flight control surface on the
plane's tail that pitches the nose up or down.
</P>
<P>
   All 88 people aboard the Boeing jet were killed when it plunged
into the sea 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles at about 4:30 Monday
afternoon. The flight was bound Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to Seattle
with a stop in San Francisco. Alaska Airlines said 47 of the
passengers on Flight 261 were headed to Seattle, and the three
flight attendants were based there.
</P>
<P>
   While some 1,100 Navy and Coast Guard crew members scoured the
crash site, progress at recovering wreckage or bodies has been
slow. U.S. Coast Guard Vice Adm. Tom Collins said that only four
bodies had been recovered by late Tuesday afternoon _ an infant,
one adult male and two adult females. Otherwise, there was only
rubble, scattered belongings and some human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Although the search for survivors had not been officially called
off, there was little hope anyone would be found alive in the
58-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   As the search continued in the cold, choppy waters some 11 miles
off the California Coast at Port Hueneme, safety board
investigators based at the Port Hueneme Naval Center, said more
high-tech search gear is on it's way to help in the search.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NTSB investigators who arrived on the scene early
Tuesday have begun to piece together witness reports, air traffic
controllers tapes and maintenance records.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board member John Hammerschmidt Tuesday afternoon
released what he said is a summary of the communications between
Flight 261 and air traffic controllers until they lost contact with
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   He also said investigators hope to interview the pilots of four
planes that were flying near Flight 261 and may have seen
something. One of those planes was an Alaska Airlines flight on the
same route but behind Flight 261, Hammerschmidt said. A Skywest
flight was also in the area and that plane's captain was being
questioned by the safety board late Tuesday. Another plane was a
private Aerocommander, Hammerschmidt said. He did not identify the
fourth plane.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was commanded by Capt. Ted Thompson, 53, based in Los
Angeles, who was hired by Alaska on Aug. 16, 1982. He had a total
of 10,400 hours flying the DC-9, a rating that is also good for the
MD-83. He had served as a flight safety instructor.
</P>
<P>
   The first officer on Flight 261 was William Tansky, 57, based in
Los Angeles. He had 8,047 DC-9 hours with Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt said air traffic controllers at 3:55 p.m. had
routinely cleared Flight 261 to maintain its cruising altitude of
31,000 feet en route to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, at 4:10 p.m., the crew gave the first
report of a problem _ they radioed they were having difficulty
controlling the plane and had decended through 26,000 feet. A few
seconds later they said they were at 23,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   About a minute after their first report of a problem, the crew
said they had had some success in stabilizing the plane and were
going to trouble shoot the problem. They requested a ``block'' of
altitude between 20,000 and 25,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts said this meant the crew was still not sure
they could control the plane and wanted at least 5,000 feet of
maneuvering altitude to make sure they avoided other air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the crew reported a jammed stabilizer and
said they were having trouble maintaining altitude, but believed
they could make Los Angeles International Airport for an emergency
landing.
</P>
<P>
   The crew subsequently asked to be cleared to 10,000 feet and
said they would ``change configuration'' and wanted to do it over
the water. Aviation experts said this meant the crew was getting
the plane ready for landing, which could include reducing engine
power and lowering the wing flaps.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:21 p.m., radar contact with the MD-83 was lost. This was
some four minutes after air traffic controllers told the pilots
they could have their block of altitude. But there was no response
from Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   Although an Alaska Airlines spokesman had said Monday that the
crew reported a problem with the stabilizer ``trim,'' Hammerschmidt
would not confirm this. He said a more precise transcription of the
communications between the plane and controllers is needed.
</P>
<P>
   On and MD-83, stabilizer trim is controlled by the pilots or the
autopilot and keeps the noise of plane from pitching up or down in
flight. The trim must be adjusted throughout a flight.
</P>
<P>
   John Hansman, head of the aeronautics department at MIT, said
the plane might have experienced what's known as a ``runaway''
stabilizer, or it might have gone ``hard over'' and pushed the
plane nose down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stabilizer jammed, in theory, and it was not a hard
over, you should be able to control the plane with the elevators,''
he said, adding its it is difficult to speculate about the nature
of the problem until more information can be obtained from the
plane's two black boxes _ the flight data recorder and cockpit
voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes have not been found, though an electronic pinging was
located by a U.S. Navy underwater demolition team, said Collins.
Site-scanning sonar is on its way to assist in the recovery of the
black boxes, Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy boat designed for mine-hunting was dispatched from San
Diego, said Cmdr. Matt Brown, spokesman for the Naval Surface Force
Pacific Fleet. The boat carries a torpedo-shaped device that can be
towed underwater and uses sonar to detect shapes on the ocean
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt said the water at the crash site is about 300 feet
deep.
</P>
<P>
   So getting to the wreckage won't be easy, even if it can be
spotted in the murky water. Once located, the Navy boat can send
down a Remotely Operated Vehicle, a two-by-three-foot unmanned
device tethered to the ship. It can explore the ocean bottom and
send up video images as well as grab the flight data and voice
recorders.
</P>
<P>
   The two black boxes would then be transported from the crash
site to the safety board's laboratories in Washington, D.C., for
analysis. The flight data recorder contains information on the
plane's speed, altitude, and pilot inputs to various control
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   John Thom, Boeing's spokesman in Long Beach where the MD-83 was
built, said the flight data recorder that was on the plane when it
was delivered to Alaska in May 1992 was capable of monitoring 49
different flight parameters.
</P>
<P>
   That means the recorder should provide investigators with a
great deal of information to help them understand what happened,
including critical data about the operation of the stabilizer,
aviation experts said.
</P>
<P>

GM IS SAID TO PICK NEW CEO; COMPANY ALSO PLANS TO SWAP HUGHES
SHARES

<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. is expected to announce Wednesday
that it will promote G. Richard Wagoner Jr., its president and
chief operating officer, to chief executive as John F. Smith Jr.
relinquishes that job but stays on as the company's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Harry J. Pearce, the company's vice chairman, will remain in
that position, raising the possibility that he might still be named
one day to succeed Smith as GM chairman, a person familiar with the
board's decision said Tuesday night. The decision came at GM's
regularly scheduled board of directors meeting Tuesday, and is
expected to be announced in an employee broadcast Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, GM said it would distribute about half the
value of its Hughes Electronics stake in a complex deal that would
let GM's shareholders swap some stock tax-free for the Hughes
tracking stock. GM shares shot up nearly 6 percent in response to
the deal; analysts said the automaker had met investor demands that
it unlock some of the Hughes unit's value.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 61, has run the company since the directors installed him
in a boardroom coup in November 1992. Board members have said they
are happy with his tenure, during which GM has turned around its
money-losing operations and improved in many areas. But Smith has
been eager to retire.
</P>
<P>
   By splitting the chairman and chief executive jobs, the board
has signaled that Pearce, who is 57 and recovering from leukemia,
was not considered well enough for it. The move may also signal
that Wagoner, who turns 47 next week, is not considered ready for
it, a concern voiced by many on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   GM spokesman Steven J. Harris refused to comment on the matter
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As technology and communications stocks have boomed, auto stocks
have become wallflowers, leaving GM and others stuck with almost
embarrassingly low price-to-earnings multiples. Hughes, on the
other hand, has been a highflier, losing money even as it wins new
customers for its DirecTV subsidiary. GM shares rose $4.6875, to
$85.25 Tuesday, while the Hughes tracking stock _ the GM class H
shares _ rose $2, to $114.50.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic that the company has finally taken some
initiative here to unlock some of the value of Hughes,'' said David
Bradley, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities. He said there was
``a mild element of disappointment'' that GM did not distribute
more of Hughes, a move that could come next year. ``This is one
step along the road and there are other steps to come.''
</P>
<P>
   GM owns all the assets of Hughes Electronics, controls the
company, and says it intends to use Hughes technology to bring GM
cars into the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   But through the tracking stock, GM has distributed to investors
an interest in the Hughes earnings streams. Wall Street expects
Hughes, like many technology stocks, to lose money this year as it
recruits customers it expects to keep in future profitable years.
By contrast, GM earned a record profit of $6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction would cut the GM stake in Hughes from 68 percent
to 35 percent by midyear, when it is expected to be completed. The
deal has two main components.
</P>
<P>
   First, GM would use $8 billion of its Hughes stake to pay for
what amounts to a huge stock buyback. In it, current owners of GM
stock could swap their shares for shares of the Hughes tracking
stock at a ratio yet to be determined. GM also would contribute $7
billion of its Hughes stake to the GM pension and benefits plans.
The two moves would reduce GM's stake in Hughes to roughly $18
billion.
</P>
<P>
   A big lift to per-share earnings will come from the reduction of
$8 billion in outstanding GM shares. GM has already bought back $9
billion of its stock, amounting to 18 percent of the total, since
embarking on a repurchase program in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   GM now contributes about $700 million in pretax income to its
pension and benefits obligations that the transactions announced
Tuesday would finance all at once. GM's annual earnings should rise
by that amount.
</P>
<P>
   GM could have contributed the $7 billion in cash, but by using
its Hughes interest instead, the company keeps that capital handy
for other possible deals, including acquisitions. GM shareholders
will be able to swap their stakes for Hughes stock in a tax-free
exchange. And those who hold the Hughes tracking stock may benefit
from the rise in the stock's liquidity, which is now less than that
of the average large-capitalization, high-growth stock.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Smith, the chief executive of Hughes, who is the brother
of the GM chairman, said the deal announced Tuesday ``has no
impact'' on Hughes' business plans.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Hughes executives won the board's approval for a
new business plan that envisioned moving Hughes from diverse
businesses including satellite manufacturing toward service-based
digital entertainment, like DirecTV. In January, GM sold the Hughes
satellite manufacturing operations to the Boeing Co. for $3.75
billion.

<P>
   In one wild night, John McCain transformed himself from a pesky
insurgent into a real politi cal force.
</P>
<P>
   The critical next step for Mc Cain in his challenge to George W.
Bush's status as Republican presidential front-runner will be to
keep his momentum in the vastly different political climate of
South Carolina on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he will have to translate Tuesday's New
Hampshire primary victory into campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in anticipation of their victory, the McCain campaign
sent out 40,000 Federal Express envelopes to potential donors
asking for money even before all the ballots were counted Tuesday.
Americans love to get behind a winner, the thinking went, and
McCain was about to give them a reason to believe he can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will ramp it up,'' McCain political director John Weaver
said as he stood outside a Crowne Plaza hotel ballroom overflowing
with confetti and jubilant sup porters. The campaign was pre paring
to fly to South Carolina last night to begin campaigning in earnest
there.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected margin of Mc Cain's New Hampshire victory raised
unsettling questions for the GOP: Is Bush weaker than anyone
suspected? Has the Re publican Party come too far in rallying
behind the well-financed Texas governor to change course and
support McCain?
</P>
<P>
   The answers may not begin to appear until South Carolina's
``First in the South'' primary on Feb. 19 and Arizona's primary on
Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona voters will now likely be able to help decide whether
New Hampshire was a flash in the Yankee pan or a foreshadow ing of
something more signifi cant. Because McCain won by such a wide
margin in New England, he can now afford to lose by a larger margin
in South Carolina _ if he loses at all. That increases the
likelihood of both heavyweights, McCain and Bush, being around to
slug it out in Arizona before Super Tuesday (March 7).
</P>
<P>
   With Republican Gov. Jane Hull backing Bush, and with the GOP
rank and file divided be tween Bush and McCain, the primary could
be particularly intense. McCain will be deter mined not to lose his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a year ago that McCain targeted New Hampshire,
gambling correctly that he and the state were a perfect fit. He
connected with New Hampshire voters on a variety of levels. Voters,
espe cially independents, responded to his maverick image and back
ground as a POW during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolina poses en tirely new and different chal
lenges.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans there don't like McCain's campaign-finance
reform efforts, which many in the GOP establishment believe would
hamper the party's ability to raise money. Others in the state are
certain to remember McCain's proposed large tax on tobacco
companies to fund anti-cigarette programs aimed at kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I disagree with John on his (tobacco) proposal, but that's
not going to hurt him,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an
interview Tuesday night. Gra ham, one of McCain's top South
Carolina surrogates, had traveled here to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain parts of the state that it (the tobacco
issue) will resonate bigger than others, but they have got to watch
that issue, because most Americans believe the big tobacco compa
nies have been out of bounds. That's an emotional issue and it cuts
both ways,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   At his victory party Tuesday, it was the Arizonans in the crowd
who best understood how stun ning McCain's victory was in view of
his political history.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, McCain was rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee
for bad judgment for intervening with a federal agency on behalf of
Phoenix financier Charles H Keating Jr., a major campaign
contributor.
</P>
<P>
   It was thought at the time that McCain had lost any chance for
advancement in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain's family and friends, the scandal's shadows made
Tuesday's victory all the sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Aiken, vice president for federal affairs for Pinnacle
West Capital Corp., flew here to lend support to the McCain cam
paign. He has known McCain for 17 years.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: NO-NONSENSE WEATHER FORECASTS VITAL 
</HEADLINE>

   Wichita, Oklahoma City, Dallas, Shreveport, Little Rock,
Memphis; Birmingham, Atlanta and up the eastern corridor to
Washington, Philadelphia, New York City and into southern New
England and Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Smith may sound like a dispatcher in a big Amtrak
station, but he's actually the meteorologist who does the morning
travel reports on the Weather Channel, which is broadcast in 30
countries around the world and in the United States is carried on
6,500 cable systems. He was describing the remarkably wide area of
the country that was hammered by severe winter weather in the last
week. If you were one of the tens of thousands of business
travelers whose schedules spun off the road during the snow and ice
storms that snarled the air travel system and bogged down airports
from Dallas to New York and beyond, you may have turned on a hotel
television in the morning and encountered Dennis Smith's
three-minute travel segments.
</P>
<P>
   Most times, other people's weather is of only casual interest.
But when you're traveling on business, weather that is occurring
elsewhere suddenly shoots right up there with concepts like time
and distance as basic components of the itinerary. In December,
aware of the growing importance of the business-travel niche, the
Weather Channel bolstered its travel-weather reporting, hiring a
business travel consultant and broadcasting Smith's three-minute
reports _ which include extra national airlines and airport
information during bad weather _ four times each morning. Just in
time, it would seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just a two-hour or four-hour thing; it was almost
two full days of snow and sleet and freezing rain last week,'' said
Smith, who works at the channel's headquarters in Atlanta, where
staff members unable to get home on icy roads were scrounging for
hotel rooms made scarce by the demands of the Super Bowl last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers ``seem to want their weather information
farther out, like five, six and seven days out,'' said Smith, who
started as a local television weatherman in Oklahoma before joining
the Weather Channel when it began operations in 1982. But since
weather is of vital interest to them, business travelers tend to
understand that as a science, meteorology becomes more wobbly the
farther it is projected into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business travelers seem to have an understanding of the
capabilities of the science and what we can do with it,'' Smith
said. ``So we give it our best shot, knowing that in these
long-range forecasts people like to know the trends, the fact that,
say, it's going to be turning much colder, that there's a storm
developing in the Pacific Northwest. They like to have the
information that seems to give them more control of a situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Control, or the illusion of control, is one of the things
business travelers say they want to maintain most on the road.
While you can't do anything about the weather, it's useful to see
what's coming at you a couple of days ahead, even if it's an
educated guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give it the way we see it,'' Smith said. ``We can be level
with them and tell them what's going on _ even if it's quiet and
there's not much going on, we can give them a little more
information than they would otherwise be able to get. You try to
give them the best lead you can so they can make decisions, save a
few bucks and get there safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn on the television in your hotel room. Spend a few minutes
with one of those giggly local television weathermen for whom the
weather is usually just another way to get you to stay glued to the
set for the stomach-acid pill commercials. You'll see why the
Weather Channel has an avid following among business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have sex or murders to keep you interested,'' said
Smith, who is as no-nonsense about weather on the telephone as he
is on the air. ``You tune in to get what you want. You have a
predictable focus on when things come up and what you can expect
from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though business travelers are still trading stories about the
serious delays and snarls of the last week, which some called the
worst week for life on the road in many years, Smith resisted all
prodding to hype the story. ``The reaches of these storms and the
impact were very widespread, causing a lot of anxiety in the travel
industry,'' was as far as he would go.
</P>
<P>
   Star's Online Booking
</P>
<P>
   Star Alliance _ whose partners include Air Canada, Air New
Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Ansett Australia, Lufthansa,
Scandinavian Airlines System, Thai Airways International, UAL's
United Airlines and Varig Brazilian Airlines _ is about to start
promoting its online booking engine (www.star-alliance.com), which
provides customers with a confirmed reservation on participating
airlines as well as the cost of the ticket in local currency. Next
summer, Mexicana Airlines will also become a member of the group. &QL;

SOLEMN TIME PRECEDES POPULAR GOLF EVENT

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Payne Stewart would have celebrated his
43rd birthday last Sunday. And this week, he would have tried to
defend his championship at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of being able to joke with Stewart during Tuesday's
shoot-out for past champions, several PGA Tour players stood
solemnly on the first tee Tuesday afternoon during a brief memorial
service to honor Stewart, who was killed in a plane crash last
October.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament will begin Thursday. But Stewart left an
undeniable void.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' said Hal Sutton, a friend of Stewart's and a
teammate on last year's U.S. Ryder Cup team. ``His locker was
always close to mine because our names were so close in the
alphabet. Every week when I look up and don't see Payne, it's
strange. I think about him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's absence will be one of the subplots this week at
Pebble Beach, one of golf's most popular events, played in a
picturesque setting and featuring a world-class field.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the world's top-ranked players will compete, including
Tiger Woods, David Duval, Davis Love III, Vijay Singh, Sutton, Jim
Furyk, Tom Lehman, Phil Mickelson, Mark O'Meara, Justin Leonard and
Sergio Garcia, plus other notables such as Jack Nicklaus, Gary
Nicklaus and Casey Martin.
</P>
<P>
   With this year's U.S. Open being played at Pebble Beach in June,
this tournament will allow players to get an early peek at the
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will garner most of the attention, trying to become the
first player to win six consecutive tour starts since Ben Hogan won
six consecutive starts in 1948. Woods has played down the streak,
because it has stretched into a second calendar year and because he
lost in Thailand last November, and in Scottsdale, Ariz., last
month. But those were not official PGA Tour events, so until Woods
is beaten on tour, talk of his streak will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on a roll right now, and it's going to take somebody to
stuff it in his face a couple of times coming down the stretch to
knock him off of that,'' Love said. ``When he is down, he still
thinks he can win. At the end of every playoff he gets in, he
either hits a miracle shot, or somebody hits a bad shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woods' domination has triggered a ripple impact on
tour. More players are following rigid workout regimens, led by
Duval, who looks as if he locked himself in a gym for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Players are looking for any edge they can get to wrestle the No.
1 spot away from Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, however, is fiercely determined to remain on top. During
the past year, Woods has gotten stronger, and he has made
adjustments in his swing that have given him more distance control.
The results speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always told me, `Don't lift weights, you will lose your
feel and your touch,''' Love said. ``David and Tiger have proven
that you can keep your swing and keep your touch, and they are
better, stronger, golfers for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to find every little thing we can to get better.
Ten years ago, nobody talked to sports psychologists. Now,
everybody has got one. Nutritionists, I guess, will be next. You
look at other athletes, they do those things. We need to do the
same things to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   While Tuesday's weather was gorgeous, rain has become almost an
annual occurrence at Pebble Beach, which has been unable to
complete a 72-hole tournament in three of the last four years. Last
year's tournament was halted after 54 holes, and don't be surprised
if some players watch The Weather Channel this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the front of your mind,'' said Love, speaking of the
rain. ``But this place deserves a break.''

MAVERICKS FADE LATE, LOSE TO 76ERS

<P>
   DALLAS _ On a busy day when the Mavericks lost Leon Smith,
possibly gained Dennis Rodman, and learned that Michael Finley
earned an All-Star berth, the Philadelphia 76ers came to town and
spoiled the party.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson made two free throws with 17.1 seconds remaining
as the 76ers snapped the Mavericks' four-game winning streak,
101-100, before 13,506 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, void of timeouts, had an opportunity to win the
game at the end. But second-year forward Dirk Nowitzki passed up a
wide-open jumper, and instead flipped the ball to an unsuspecting
Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   With time running out, Nash could only toss up a running
10-footer from the baseline as the air went out of the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a wide-open shot to win the game, you've got to
take that shot,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said in reference to
Nowitzki. ``I just don't know what to say, other than he has to
learn that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think he would know that in that situation that the ball
has to be shot. Unfortunately, you learn the hard way often
times.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 76ers' final possession, Nelson and the Mavericks
protested a foul called on Cedric Ceballos, who apparently made
contact with Iverson as he drove to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hate to have a referee decide an outcome of a great
game like that,'' Nelson said. ``It's unfortunate that that's the
way it had to end, but we did have an awful good look \Rby
Nowitzki\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki, who scored 16 points on 6-of-17 shooting, said he
passed up the last shot because he saw two 76ers running at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Steve wide open, and I just passed him the ball,''
Nowitzki said. ``I didn't know I was almost open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have shot it, probably. I'm a guy who's not selfish.
Maybe I should have been selfish in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks led 85-75 early in the fourth period before
wilting down the stretch. Theo Ratliff scored eight of his
season-high 25 points in the fourth period, and George Lynch scored
a tough basket inside over Shawn Bradley late in the game as the
Mavericks slipped to 17-27 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who was named to the All-Star team yesterday, finished
with 21 points, five rebounds and seven assists. Ceballos led the
Mavericks with 26 points and 12 rebounds, and Bradley had 17 points
and four blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, a first-time All-Star Game starter, led all scorers
with 29 points on 12-of-28 shooting. Lynch, who makes his
off-season home in Plano, collected 14 points and eight rebounds,
and Eric Snow had 12 points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We competed hard, and we had the lead,'' Ceballos said. ``We
had an opportunity to win the game again, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers (25-20) outrebounded the Mavericks 54-39, an area of
the Mavericks' game a guy named Rodman can surely spruce up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a whale of a game,'' Nelson said. ``I like a lot of
things that we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``But unfortunately, at the end we had a wide-open shot and we
have a young player that should have shot it.''

   OXNARD _ Numb from grief, families of many of the 88 people
aboard doomed Alaska Airlines Flight 261 gathered Tuesday in Los
Angeles and along the Ventura County coastline as hope faded of
finding their loved ones alive after Monday's crash at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard rescuers still had not given up the search for
survivors in the cold, churning water near Anacapa Island, where
the plane nose-dived into the ocean after experiencing mechanical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue the search for human lives. I am not yet ready to
make the decision to stop searching,'' said Coast Guard Vice Adm.
Tom Collins.
</P>
<P>
   But as hours passed and the number of victims pulled from the
ocean rose, the chances of spotting survivors in the 58-degree
water grew slim. Instead, rescuers confirmed they found the bodies
of one man, two women and an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives poured into Los Angeles International Airport from San
Francisco and Seattle, planned destinations of the flight from the
Mexican resort of Puerta Vallarta. They met with counselors near
the airport and drove to the Ventura County coast to mourn beside
the ocean that swallowed the plane just before sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Janelle Davis of Santa Barbara wept on Port Hueneme beach
Tuesday in the arms of her boyfriend as she grieved for her sister,
lost in the crash. Nearby, someone had erected a 7-foot-tall
memorial cross on the beach, decorated with candles, flowers and a
rosary.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and her sister had been attending a family reunion in
Puerto Vallarta, and Davis took an earlier flight back. Her sister,
whom Davis declined to name because the passenger list had yet to
be made public, lived in Seattle and was engaged to be married
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just never know. You just never know,'' she kept repeating
as she fumbled with a bouquet of flowers she planned to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In Redlands, the family of pilot Ted Thompson thanked friends
for their support and said they grieved for all those lost on the
flight. Both Thompson and First Officer Bill Tansky were based in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure everyone knows that it would make my dad
happy to see how many people saw him as a father and a friend,''
said son Fred Thompson, 24, his voice shaking. ``Our hearts are
with the families and friends of the passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme,
federal investigators newly arrived from Washington, D.C., launched
their probe into the crash's exact cause.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many air disasters that leave few solid clues behind,
investigators had several leads to follow Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations between the flight's pilots and air traffic
control indicated that a stablizer used to keep the plane's nose
level malfunctioned, the National Transportation Safety Board
announced. For at least 10 minutes before the crash, the pilots
tried to maintain control over the aircraft, which lost altitude
several times before dropping from radar.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also reported detecting pings from the plane's
black box flight data recorder, now lying some 700 feet underwater.
And they announced that four other planes were flying in the area
at the time of the crash. The pilot of one was being interviewed
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the NTSB culled control tower transcripts, military and
civilian rescuers continued the grim work of searching the waters
off Point Mugu.
</P>
<P>
   The armada of private fishing boats, Coast Guard cutters and
Navy ships that converged on the scene Monday night was still there
at dawn. They continued their search throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Boat crews used gaff hooks and fishing nets to pull up debris.
Coast Guard helicopters circling overhead dropped green dye packs
where debris was heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Biscuit fishing boat snagged hundreds of tiny pieces of
insulation, a 3-by-1-foot section of a cabin wall with honeycombed
insulation still attached, a pink plastic hair roller and a woman's
black platform sandal, said skipper Bob Perron.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is starting to get sad,'' Perron said as he scooped up
the sandal with a hand net. ``It's getting personal now that it's
not plane parts. These things belonged to people. That shoe came
off somebody's foot when (the plane) hit.''
</P>
<P>
   All debris would be turned over to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt left many participants frustrated. For all the people
combing the waters, no one had found a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard because there's nothing really you can tell (the
families),'' said Steve Brescia, executive officer of a Las
Vegas-based Air Force unit searching the site by helicopter. ``They
all want to know what you've found, but you have to say, Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the coast was dotted with people bearing flowers and
mementos to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co. aircraft mechanic Ben Cruz drove up from Long Beach,
where he helped build MD-80 class airliners like the one that
crashed. He came to pray and place flowers at a memorial near the
Port Hueneme pier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to pay my respects,'' said Cruz, clad in a blue
McDonnell Douglas jumpsuit. He said his gesture was on behalf of
all plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become an emotional thing for many of us,'' Cruz said.
``These weren't 88 persons, they were 88 souls that's how we
classify people on aircraft. So our hearts go out to the victims
and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton echoed their sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout this difficult day, and in the days and weeks to
come, we will keep the passengers and crew of Flight 261 in our
thoughts, and let us hope that God's mercy will shine on them and
their families,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 family members met with Red Cross grief counselors
stationed at the Renaissance Los Angeles Hotel near LAX.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a hotel conference room, one family of eight sat in a
circle, some wiping their tears, others silently remembering their
loved one a schoolteacher from Mexico presumed dead in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the room, a religious counselor gently spoke with
another distraught couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many of the people have already come to the grim
conclusion that their family members have already persished in the
crash. Others are still holding out,'' said Chris Thomas, spokesman
for the Greater Los Angeles Red Cross.

   ``It's hard because there's nothing really you can tell (the
families),'' said Steve Brescia, executive officer of a Las
Vegas-based Air Force unit searching the site by helicopter. ``They
all want to know what you've found, but you have to say, Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the coast was dotted with people bearing flowers and
mementos to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co. aircraft mechanic Ben Cruz drove up from Long Beach,
where he helped build MD-80 class airliners like the one that
crashed. He came to pray and place flowers at a memorial near the
Port Hueneme pier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to pay my respects,'' said Cruz, clad in a blue
McDonnell Douglas jumpsuit. He said his gesture was on behalf of
all plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become an emotional thing for many of us,'' Cruz said.
``These weren't 88 persons, they were 88 souls that's how we
classify people on aircraft. So our hearts go out to the victims
and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton echoed their sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout this difficult day, and in the days and weeks to
come, we will keep the passengers and crew of Flight 261 in our
thoughts, and let us hope that God's mercy will shine on them and
their families,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 family members met with Red Cross grief counselors
stationed at the Renaissance Los Angeles Hotel near LAX.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a hotel conference room, one family of eight sat in a
circle, some wiping their tears, others silently remembering their
loved one a schoolteacher from Mexico presumed dead in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the room, a religious counselor gently spoke with
another distraught couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many of the people have already come to the grim
conclusion that their family members have already persished in the
crash. Others are still holding out,'' said Chris Thomas, spokesman
for the Greater Los Angeles Red Cross.

PILOTS' STRUGGLE LASTED FOR MINUTES

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For five fateful minutes, the crew of Alaskan
Airlines Flight 261 fought to regain control of the plummeting jet
before trying to turn around for an emergency landing at LAX.
</P>
<P>
   But by then it was too late for the 88 crew members and
passengers of Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought that they could maintain altitude, and they would
go on to LAX,'' said John Hammerschmidt, spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:16 p.m. Monday, just a minute after deciding to head to Los
Angeles International, the crew made its last radio contact and the
MD-83 jetliner disappeared from radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators intensified their search Tuesday for clues,
they provided a gripping account of the last 26 minutes of radio
transmissions and the crews' desperate struggle to avert disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Flying over the Santa Barbara Channel, some 20 miles from Los
Angeles International Airport, the five-member crew suddenly
noticed their plane was losing altitude and was difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   It would take them about 20 minutes before discovering the
culprit: a jammed horizontal stabilizer, responsible for
controlling the up-and- down motion of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, Capt. Ted Thompson and First Officer William
Tansky, seasoned former military pilots, spoke matter-of-factly as
they summoned all their experience and skill to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they told controllers the problem was ``kind of
stabilized,'' but moments later they conceded, ``we're still
working on it,'' according to Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   The last routine transmission came at 3:35 p.m., when the flight
out from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and Seattle was
cleared to fly at 31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, at 4:10 p.m., the pilots alerted
air-traffic controllers in Palmdale they were having trouble
controlling the plane. Within seconds, the plane suddenly dropped
from 26,000 feet and then to 23,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled by the sudden altitude change, air traffic controllers
asked the crew for its condition. The crew responded it had ``kind
of stabilized and was going to do some trouble- shooting,'' said
Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:14 p.m., controllers told the flight crew to let them know
if they needed anything.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15 p.m., the controllers in Palmdale handed off Flight 261
to another controller aware of the problem. Seconds later, the crew
discovered that the stabilizer was jammed and they were having
trouble maintaining altitude. It was then they decided to divert to
LAX.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:16 p.m., the flight crew advised that it was going to
10,000 feet and had to change flight configurations over the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to change flight configuration, to deploy the wing
flaps to slow the plane down,'' Hammerschidt explained. ``In a
cruise flight, the flaps are at a particular setting. They wanted
to change it to `approach setting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers gave that clearance and the flight crew
acknowledged that transmission.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:17, traffic controllers advised the flight crew to contact
another air traffic controller on a different frequency, but the
transmission was not acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:21, controllers lost radar contact with the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The plane slammed nose-first into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, Drew Gottshall was the first to report seeing
the crash as the plane plunged into the ocean about 2 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the aircraft, looked up, and followed its path
visually till it hit the water,'' said the National Parks Service
maintenance worker.
</P>
<P>
   Through binoculars, Gottshall watched debris and an oil slick
surface, as a fishing boat headed toward the crash site. ``Because
of the distance away and the slow travel time of sound, it was four
or five seconds after seeing the plane impact the water before I
heard the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point as I was watching the descent of the plane
where I felt hopeless. It had a finality that came very quickly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the plane hit the water and disappeared, there was just
me and seagulls out there.''

CALIFORNIA'S EARLIER PRIMARY PAYING OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary
out of the way, much of the nation's attention will now turn to
California, thanks to its electoral heft and early primary.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the California primary stands to
be a major factor in the presidential nominating process,
fulfilling the hopes of those who pushed to move it up to March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be more than two candidates going into California,
but there will only be one coming out,'' said Dan Schnur,
communications director for the campaign of Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is going to decide the Republican nominee for
president. No ifs, ands or buts. This is the first time in a long
time that California will decide this. It's the size of the state,
the number of delegates at stake and its timing on the primary
calendar that give California an absolutely decisive role.''
</P>
<P>
   It is equally as important for Democrats, with Vice President Al
Gore arriving in Burbank tonight for a two-day swing and former
Sen. Bill Bradley arriving Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At stake for Republicans are 162 delegates _ out of the 1,100
needed for the nomination _ in a state where the winner takes all.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have a proportional basis for assigning delegates, but
it still could be a sizable number with 495 delegates to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
   While the voters can now cast ballots for either party despite
their registration, only those from Republicans will count in GOP
delegate selection and only those from Democrats in that party's
delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is coming to the state this week to attend the California
Republican Party convention in Burlingame, as are other GOP
contenders, including Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is not attending, but his brother _
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush _ is appearing as a surrogate for him. Bush's
campaign said the candidate will be at several locations in
California, probably later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hampered by the stronger-than-expected challenge from
McCain and is being forced to spend more time in South Carolina and
other states holding Republican primaries before the California
election.
</P>
<P>
   California is getting similar attention from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to arrive at 8 tonight at Burbank Airport for
an event on health care. He also is expected to be campaigning in
Los Angeles on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will be in Northern California on Thursday as part of a
monthlong effort in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley both plan to attend the state Democratic
Convention beginning Feb. 11 and are scheduled for a debate in Los
Angeles on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also announced the formation of a sort of
California kitchen cabinet, drawing on many of the supporters of
President Clinton to help him in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the list are longtime activists Bill Wardlaw,
Henry Cisneros, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown Jr., former Rep.
Mel Levine and John Emerson. Garry South, who was Gov. Gray Davis'
campaign manager, is heading up the group.
</P>
<P>
   California playing a role in presidential politics has long been
a dream of officials tired of seeing the state used as the ATM of
campaigns without having a say in the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, four years ago, the state pushed up its traditional
June primary to late March, but other states countered by advancing
their primaries. California struck back by moving its election up
to March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made California the gorilla in national politics,'' said
USC professor Eric Schockman. ``California voters are watching what
happens in Iowa and New Hampshire, and there is finally a real
sense of anticipation that we will play a role in the nominating
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But some complications remain.
</P>
<P>
   California voters two years ago approved what is known as a
blanket primary allowing members of one party to vote for
candidates in another party's primary, and allowing independents to
vote for partisan candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties threatened to not allow the California
vote to count until Secretary of State Bill Jones won approval for
a system to allow only Democratic and Republican votes to count for
their party's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, what it does is give us a chance to remind voters to
register for a party,'' said Schnur. ``We are telling people if
they want their vote to count, they have to register as a
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the primary is only half the political battle, with
both sides wanting to do well for November and the chance to win
the state's 54 electoral votes _ 20 percent of what's needed to win
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum said the state is particularly
important for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to win the White House, they have to win
California,'' Hoffenblum said. ``Republicans can win without
carrying California.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if the past two elections are any indication, the
Republicans had better try harder in California. Not only did
Clinton carry California _ and win the White House _ in 1996, but
Democrats had a near clean sweep in 1998 with the election of Davis
and taking control of both houses in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``What California Republicans want is the top of the ticket to
at least try here,'' Hoffenblum said. ``They want to get a base of
support to have a chance. And, if the top of the ticket carries
California, that would mean they are winning everywhere else.''

DAVIS ROLLS OUT EDUCATION REFORM PROPOSALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ &UR;  &LR; Continuing the state's push for education
reform, Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders Tuesday unveiled
five new bills to attract and train new teachers and promote higher
student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Davis told reporters at a news conference the $852 million
package builds on four initiatives he pushed last year that focused
on accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The package of bills will be carried by five Democratic
lawmakers, all members of the Latino caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders were unable to offer a detailed response to
the proposals because the governor's staff did not allow them to
attend the briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, chairman of the Republican
caucus, said the GOP is supportive of most of Davis' proposals.
Some, including Davis' plans to provide computer access for
elementary schools, ``reflect proposals we made,'' Brulte said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, will introduce a $228
million student achievement bill that will include providing merit
scholarships to 100,000 high school pupils a year and expanding Cal
Grant awards, which are given on the basis of need and merit, to
7,000 more students.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal Grant expansion came after Davis was criticized by some
who called the merit scholarships a ``subsidy for the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis on Tuesday defended the merit scholarships, saying that
those critics ``haven't spent a lot of time in the public schools''
which house many lower and middle-class students.
</P>
<P>
   Polanco, who did not attend the news conference, issued a
written statement that stressed the need for both types of aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without competitive merit, we cannot have a great society and
a strong economy,'' Polanco said. ``Without support for those who
have both merit and financial need, we will create a bifurcated
society where merit does not give access to opportunity. Clearly,
we need a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Van Nuys, will carry a $188 million
teacher recruitment bill that provides financial incentives to
attract veteran and new credentialed instructors.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides a one-time $2,000 award to each of 20,000 new,
credentialed teachers who take jobs at low-performing schools. It
also provides a forgivable home loan of $10,000 for 5,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child in the state of California deserves to have a
teacher who is fully qualified to teach,'' Alarcon said in a
statement. ``Far too many students are being taught by teachers
with emergency credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next eight years, California will need 300,000 new
teachers, according to state estimates. Some 28,500 teachers in
classrooms are not credentialed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Martha M. Escutia, D-Montebello, will introduce a $161
million bill to increase teacher training in reading, math and
instruction of English language learners.
</P>
<P>
   It also will provide money to expand the college preparatory
Advanced Placement courses in high schools. Davis said he wants
each high school to have access to at least four AP courses by the
2001 academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, will
introduce a $75 million bill to create three institutes for science
and innovation at three University of California campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Sarah Reyes, D-Fresno, will introduce a $200
million initiative that hopes to close the ``digital divide'' in
classrooms. The bill would provide money to purchase computers and
to train school staff to use them.

<P>
   OXNARD _ Numb from grief, families of many of the 88 people
aboard doomed Alaska Airlines Flight 261 gathered Tuesday in Los
Angeles and along the Ventura County coastline as hope faded of
finding their loved ones alive after Monday's crash at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard rescuers still had not given up the search for
survivors in the cold, churning water near Anacapa Island, where
the plane nose-dived into the ocean after experiencing mechanical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue the search for human lives. I am not yet ready to
make the decision to stop searching,'' said Coast Guard Vice Adm.
Tom Collins.
</P>
<P>
   But as hours passed and the number of victims pulled from the
ocean rose, the chances of spotting survivors in the 58-degree
water grew slim. Instead, rescuers confirmed they found the bodies
of one man, two women and an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives poured into Los Angeles International Airport from San
Francisco and Seattle, planned destinations of the flight from the
Mexican resort of Puerta Vallarta. They met with counselors near
the airport and drove to the Ventura County coast to mourn beside
the ocean that swallowed the plane just before sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Janelle Davis of Santa Barbara wept on Port Hueneme beach
Tuesday in the arms of her boyfriend as she grieved for her sister,
lost in the crash. Nearby, someone had erected a 7-foot-tall
memorial cross on the beach, decorated with candles, flowers and a
rosary.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and her sister had been attending a family reunion in
Puerto Vallarta, and Davis took an earlier flight back. Her sister,
whom Davis declined to name because the passenger list had yet to
be made public, lived in Seattle and was engaged to be married
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just never know. You just never know,'' she kept repeating
as she fumbled with a bouquet of flowers she planned to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In Redlands, the family of pilot Ted Thompson thanked friends
for their support and said they grieved for all those lost on the
flight. Both Thompson and First Officer Bill Tansky were based in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure everyone knows that it would make my dad
happy to see how many people saw him as a father and a friend,''
said son Fred Thompson, 24, his voice shaking. ``Our hearts are
with the families and friends of the passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme,
federal investigators newly arrived from Washington, D.C., launched
their probe into the crash's exact cause.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many air disasters that leave few solid clues behind,
investigators had several leads to follow Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations between the flight's pilots and air traffic
control indicated that a stablizer used to keep the plane's nose
level malfunctioned, the National Transportation Safety Board
announced. For at least 10 minutes before the crash, the pilots
tried to maintain control over the aircraft, which lost altitude
several times before dropping from radar.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also reported detecting pings from the plane's
black box flight data recorder, now lying some 700 feet underwater.
And they announced that four other planes were flying in the area
at the time of the crash. The pilot of one was being interviewed
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the NTSB culled control tower transcripts, military and
civilian rescuers continued the grim work of searching the waters
off Point Mugu.
</P>
<P>
   The armada of private fishing boats, Coast Guard cutters and
Navy ships that converged on the scene Monday night was still there
at dawn. They continued their search throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Boat crews used gaff hooks and fishing nets to pull up debris.
Coast Guard helicopters circling overhead dropped green dye packs
where debris was heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Biscuit fishing boat snagged hundreds of tiny pieces of
insulation, a 3-by-1-foot section of a cabin wall with honeycombed
insulation still attached, a pink plastic hair roller and a woman's
black platform sandal, said skipper Bob Perron.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is starting to get sad,'' Perron said as he scooped up
the sandal with a hand net. ``It's getting personal now that it's
not plane parts. These things belonged to people. That shoe came
off somebody's foot when (the plane) hit.''
</P>
<P>
   All debris would be turned over to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt left many participants frustrated. For all the people
combing the waters, no one had found a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard because there's nothing really you can tell (the
families),'' said Steve Brescia, executive officer of a Las
Vegas-based Air Force unit searching the site by helicopter. ``They
all want to know what you've found, but you have to say, Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the coast was dotted with people bearing flowers and
mementos to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co. aircraft mechanic Ben Cruz drove up from Long Beach,
where he helped build MD-80 class airliners like the one that
crashed. He came to pray and place flowers at a memorial near the
Port Hueneme pier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to pay my respects,'' said Cruz, clad in a blue
McDonnell Douglas jumpsuit. He said his gesture was on behalf of
all plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become an emotional thing for many of us,'' Cruz said.
``These weren't 88 persons, they were 88 souls that's how we
classify people on aircraft. So our hearts go out to the victims
and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton echoed their sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout this difficult day, and in the days and weeks to
come, we will keep the passengers and crew of Flight 261 in our
thoughts, and let us hope that God's mercy will shine on them and
their families,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 family members met with Red Cross grief counselors
stationed at the Renaissance Los Angeles Hotel near LAX.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a hotel conference room, one family of eight sat in a
circle, some wiping their tears, others silently remembering their
loved one a schoolteacher from Mexico presumed dead in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the room, a religious counselor gently spoke with
another distraught couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many of the people have already come to the grim
conclusion that their family members have already persished in the
crash. Others are still holding out,'' said Chris Thomas, spokesman
for the Greater Los Angeles Red Cross.

MCCAIN VAULTS INTO GOP SPOTLIGHT

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ In an era of slick sound bites and big-money
campaigns, New Hampshire voters showed that straight talk and an
image of integrity are forces to be reckoned with in this year's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona draped himself in the
mantle of a reformer _ an honest crusader with rough edges who
would stand up to special interests _ to handily defeat Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the man embraced by the party's establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey talked
repeatedly of a ``new politics'' to come within 7,000 votes of
defeating Vice President Al Gore, who was forced to abandon his
well-rehearsed rhetoric for a more down-to-earth style.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1992 campaign was about ``the economy, stupid,'' New
Hampshire voters seemed to be saying the 2000 campaign ought to be
about ``character, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A great national crusade has just begun,'' McCain told
exuberant supporters at a victory party in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a choice between those who engage in the old politics of
rancor and division, of grandiose and unfulfilled promises, and
those who offer a new politics rooted in conviction and belief,''
Bradley told his supporters an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore still enjoy enormous institutional advantages.
Bush has endorsements of nearly all the nation's GOP governors, and
his campaign treasury is $30 million larger than McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has the help of organized labor and the endorsement of at
least 500 of the 800 party leaders known as ``super delegates'' who
are automatically granted voting privileges at this summer's
nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   And he also may have gotten a boost from Bradley's surge in the
polls, forcing the vice president to adopt a more combative and
less scripted style of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the showings by McCain and Bradley prolong the
campaign and open the possibility that both parties will engage in
a long and spirited contest that could last beyond March 7, when
California, New York and 15 other states hold primaries or
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   On matters of policy, Bradley and McCain have little in common
besides support for campaign finance reform. Yet, both appealed to
independents and those who expressed a distaste for traditional
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls found that both candidates did well among voters who
said character mattered more than positions on issues. A poll
conducted by the Associated Press found that about 1 in 3 voters
participating in the primary was not registered to either party,
and both McCain and Bradley greatly outpaced their rivals among
those independents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their vast political differences, McCain and Bradley
held an unprecedented joint campaign rally in December. And in the
final days of the campaign, Bradley supporters attended McCain
rallies in hopes of peeling away some of those independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight now shifts from the civic-minded hamlets of New
England to the tobacco farms of South Carolina, where Republicans
hold a primary February 19.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spent more than two months in New Hampshire over the
past year and held 114 town hall meetings, faces an uphill battle.
He trails Bush by 20 points in the  &LR; national polls, &LR;  and is far
behind in his  &LR; organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bush strategists hope to use the state as a firewall to stop
further damage to his campaign, as Bob Dole did in 1996 after he
was upset here by Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go to the next state, the next state and the next
state until I win the nomination,'' Bush said Tuesday, in a subtle
comparison to McCain, who has chosen selected states in which to
campaign and compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marathon,'' Bush said. ``It's a long haul. I'm a
patient man. I'm ready for what comes next.''
</P>
<P>
   The next GOP primary will be next week in Delaware, where only
eight delegates are at stake. Only Bush and magazine publisher
Steve Forbes are on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is counting on his victory in New Hampshire to shake up
the perception among party regulars that regardless of what happens
during the early primaries, Bush is the GOP's strongest candidate
and will eventually win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great majority of Bush support developed early on, when it
was understood that he was the only viable candidate in the race,''
said McCain spokesman Dan Schnur. ``That is no longer the case. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that (Bush) is not the only game in town, they will be
dropping off the bandwagon as fast as they jumped on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign hopes the victory will boost McCain's quest for
campaign funds, scheduling a fund-raiser in Los Angeles on Friday
and San Francisco on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest delegate prize is California. After his brief
appearance this weekend, McCain has no plans to return until after
the February 22 primaries in Arizona and Michigan. Bush has no
plans to come to the state until the final week of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have no contests between New Hampshire and March 7,
providing both candidates plenty of time to refine their messages.
</P>
<P>
   The most important contest will be California, where Bradley
trails by 20 points, and in New York, where his previous occupation
as a forward for the New York Knicks should make him quite
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released Monday, Bradley has $8.3 million
in his campaign treasury as compared to $5.7 million for Gore,
which will give both of them an opportunity to get their messages
out.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that no state will be as receptive to the
unpolished brand of politics of McCain and Bradley as contrarian
New Hampshire, with its tiny media markets and history of upending
the political establishment. Still, it is more likely that Bush and
Gore will look at the results and try to mimic their rivals.

PILOTS' STRUGGLE LASTED FOR MINUTES
</HEADLINE>

(Daily News Staff Writer Dominic Berbeo contributed to this
story.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For five fateful minutes, the crew of Alaskan
Airlines Flight 261 fought to regain control of the plummeting jet
before trying to turn around for an emergency landing at LAX.
</P>
<P>
   But by then it was too late for the 88 crew members and
passengers of Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought that they could maintain altitude, and they would
go on to LAX,'' said John Hammerschmidt, spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:16 p.m. Monday, just a minute after deciding to head to Los
Angeles International, the crew made its last radio contact and the
MD-83 jetliner disappeared from radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators intensified their search Tuesday for clues,
they provided a gripping account of the last 26 minutes of radio
transmissions and the crews' desperate struggle to avert disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Flying over the Santa Barbara Channel, some 20 miles from Los
Angeles International Airport, the five-member crew suddenly
noticed their plane was losing altitude and was difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   It would take them about 20 minutes before discovering the
culprit: a jammed horizontal stabilizer, responsible for
controlling the up-and- down motion of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, Capt. Ted Thompson and First Officer William
Tansky, seasoned former military pilots, spoke matter-of-factly as
they summoned all their experience and skill to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they told controllers the problem was ``kind of
stabilized,'' but moments later they conceded, ``we're still
working on it,'' according to Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   The last routine transmission came at 3:35 p.m., when the flight
out from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and Seattle was
cleared to fly at 31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, at 4:10 p.m., the pilots alerted
air-traffic controllers in Palmdale they were having trouble
controlling the plane. Within seconds, the plane suddenly dropped
from 26,000 feet and then to 23,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled by the sudden altitude change, air traffic controllers
asked the crew for its condition. The crew responded it had ``kind
of stabilized and was going to do some trouble- shooting,'' said
Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:14 p.m., controllers told the flight crew to let them know
if they needed anything.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15 p.m., the controllers in Palmdale handed off Flight 261
to another controller aware of the problem. Seconds later, the crew
discovered that the stabilizer was jammed and they were having
trouble maintaining altitude. It was then they decided to divert to
LAX.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:16 p.m., the flight crew advised that it was going to
10,000 feet and had to change flight configurations over the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to change flight configuration, to deploy the wing
flaps to slow the plane down,'' Hammerschidt explained. ``In a
cruise flight, the flaps are at a particular setting. They wanted
to change it to `approach setting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers gave that clearance and the flight crew
acknowledged that transmission.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:17, traffic controllers advised the flight crew to contact
another air traffic controller on a different frequency, but the
transmission was not acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:21, controllers lost radar contact with the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The plane slammed nose-first into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, Drew Gottshall was the first to report seeing
the crash as the plane plunged into the ocean about 2 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the aircraft, looked up, and followed its path
visually till it hit the water,'' said the National Parks Service
maintenance worker.
</P>
<P>
   Through binoculars, Gottshall watched debris and an oil slick
surface, as a fishing boat headed toward the crash site. ``Because
of the distance away and the slow travel time of sound, it was four
or five seconds after seeing the plane impact the water before I
heard the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point as I was watching the descent of the plane
where I felt hopeless. It had a finality that came very quickly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the plane hit the water and disappeared, there was just
me and seagulls out there.''

CALIFORNIA'S EARLIER PRIMARY PAYING OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary
out of the way, much of the nation's attention will now turn to
California, thanks to its electoral heft and early primary.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the California primary stands to
be a major factor in the presidential nominating process,
fulfilling the hopes of those who pushed to move it up to March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be more than two candidates going into California,
but there will only be one coming out,'' said Dan Schnur,
communications director for the campaign of Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is going to decide the Republican nominee for
president. No ifs, ands or buts. This is the first time in a long
time that California will decide this. It's the size of the state,
the number of delegates at stake and its timing on the primary
calendar that give California an absolutely decisive role.''
</P>
<P>
   It is equally as important for Democrats, with Vice President Al
Gore arriving in Burbank tonight for a two-day swing and former
Sen. Bill Bradley arriving Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At stake for Republicans are 162 delegates _ out of the 1,100
needed for the nomination _ in a state where the winner takes all.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have a proportional basis for assigning delegates, but
it still could be a sizable number with 495 delegates to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
   While the voters can now cast ballots for either party despite
their registration, only those from Republicans will count in GOP
delegate selection and only those from Democrats in that party's
delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is coming to the state this week to attend the California
Republican Party convention in Burlingame, as are other GOP
contenders, including Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is not attending, but his brother _
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush _ is appearing as a surrogate for him. Bush's
campaign said the candidate will be at several locations in
California, probably later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hampered by the stronger-than-expected challenge from
McCain and is being forced to spend more time in South Carolina and
other states holding Republican primaries before the California
election.
</P>
<P>
   California is getting similar attention from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to arrive at 8 tonight at Burbank Airport for
an event on health care. He also is expected to be campaigning in
Los Angeles on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will be in Northern California on Thursday as part of a
monthlong effort in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley both plan to attend the state Democratic
Convention beginning Feb. 11 and are scheduled for a debate in Los
Angeles on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also announced the formation of a sort of
California kitchen cabinet, drawing on many of the supporters of
President Clinton to help him in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the list are longtime activists Bill Wardlaw,
Henry Cisneros, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown Jr., former Rep.
Mel Levine and John Emerson. Garry South, who was Gov. Gray Davis'
campaign manager, is heading up the group.
</P>
<P>
   California playing a role in presidential politics has long been
a dream of officials tired of seeing the state used as the ATM of
campaigns without having a say in the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, four years ago, the state pushed up its traditional
June primary to late March, but other states countered by advancing
their primaries. California struck back by moving its election up
to March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made California the gorilla in national politics,'' said
USC professor Eric Schockman. ``California voters are watching what
happens in Iowa and New Hampshire, and there is finally a real
sense of anticipation that we will play a role in the nominating
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But some complications remain.
</P>
<P>
   California voters two years ago approved what is known as a
blanket primary allowing members of one party to vote for
candidates in another party's primary, and allowing independents to
vote for partisan candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties threatened to not allow the California
vote to count until Secretary of State Bill Jones won approval for
a system to allow only Democratic and Republican votes to count for
their party's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, what it does is give us a chance to remind voters to
register for a party,'' said Schnur. ``We are telling people if
they want their vote to count, they have to register as a
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the primary is only half the political battle, with
both sides wanting to do well for November and the chance to win
the state's 54 electoral votes _ 20 percent of what's needed to win
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum said the state is particularly
important for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to win the White House, they have to win
California,'' Hoffenblum said. ``Republicans can win without
carrying California.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if the past two elections are any indication, the
Republicans had better try harder in California. Not only did
Clinton carry California _ and win the White House _ in 1996, but
Democrats had a near clean sweep in 1998 with the election of Davis
and taking control of both houses in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``What California Republicans want is the top of the ticket to
at least try here,'' Hoffenblum said. ``They want to get a base of
support to have a chance. And, if the top of the ticket carries
California, that would mean they are winning everywhere else.''

DAVIS ROLLS OUT EDUCATION REFORM PROPOSALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ &UR;  &LR; Continuing the state's push for education
reform, Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders Tuesday unveiled
five new bills to attract and train new teachers and promote higher
student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Davis told reporters at a news conference the $852 million
package builds on four initiatives he pushed last year that focused
on accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The package of bills will be carried by five Democratic
lawmakers, all members of the Latino caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders were unable to offer a detailed response to
the proposals because the governor's staff did not allow them to
attend the briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, chairman of the Republican
caucus, said the GOP is supportive of most of Davis' proposals.
Some, including Davis' plans to provide computer access for
elementary schools, ``reflect proposals we made,'' Brulte said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, will introduce a $228
million student achievement bill that will include providing merit
scholarships to 100,000 high school pupils a year and expanding Cal
Grant awards, which are given on the basis of need and merit, to
7,000 more students.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal Grant expansion came after Davis was criticized by some
who called the merit scholarships a ``subsidy for the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis on Tuesday defended the merit scholarships, saying that
those critics ``haven't spent a lot of time in the public schools''
which house many lower and middle-class students.
</P>
<P>
   Polanco, who did not attend the news conference, issued a
written statement that stressed the need for both types of aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without competitive merit, we cannot have a great society and
a strong economy,'' Polanco said. ``Without support for those who
have both merit and financial need, we will create a bifurcated
society where merit does not give access to opportunity. Clearly,
we need a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Van Nuys, will carry a $188 million
teacher recruitment bill that provides financial incentives to
attract veteran and new credentialed instructors.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides a one-time $2,000 award to each of 20,000 new,
credentialed teachers who take jobs at low-performing schools. It
also provides a forgivable home loan of $10,000 for 5,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child in the state of California deserves to have a
teacher who is fully qualified to teach,'' Alarcon said in a
statement. ``Far too many students are being taught by teachers
with emergency credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next eight years, California will need 300,000 new
teachers, according to state estimates. Some 28,500 teachers in
classrooms are not credentialed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Martha M. Escutia, D-Montebello, will introduce a $161
million bill to increase teacher training in reading, math and
instruction of English language learners.
</P>
<P>
   It also will provide money to expand the college preparatory
Advanced Placement courses in high schools. Davis said he wants
each high school to have access to at least four AP courses by the
2001 academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, will
introduce a $75 million bill to create three institutes for science
and innovation at three University of California campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Sarah Reyes, D-Fresno, will introduce a $200
million initiative that hopes to close the ``digital divide'' in
classrooms. The bill would provide money to purchase computers and
to train school staff to use them.

CRUCIAL WINS FOR MCCAIN AND GORE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  MANCHESTER, N.H. _ In a stunning rebuke to the party's
front-runner, Republican voters delivered Arizona Sen. John McCain
a landslide victory Tuesday over Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the
first primary of the 2000 campaign.
<P>
   And, in the closest Democratic contest in New Hampshire history,
Vice President Al Gore narrowly defeated former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley, who vowed to continue on to California.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by McCain as well as Bradley's strong second-place
showing set the stage for a series of toe-to-toe _ and potentially
nasty _ battles in primaries to be held in South Carolina,
California and several other states over the next five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have sent a powerful message to Washington that change is
coming,'' McCain said last night, addressing ecstatic followers in
Nashua. ``It is the beginning of the end _ because today the
Republican Party has recovered its heritage of reform. And it is
the beginning of the end for the truth-twisting politics of Bill
Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   And the vice president, who found himself in the underdog
position in New Hampshire just weeks before the primary, was
clearly energized as he appeared before supporters in Manchester
last night. ``This Tennesseean is in the end zone, and it feels
great,'' Gore told supporters, in a reference to the Tennessee
Titans' nail-biting defeat in Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In both Republican and Democratic races, the fiercely
independent voters of New Hampshire _ whose state motto is ``Live
Free or Die'' _ flexed their muscle, confounding dozens of polls
that had suggested a far closer race on the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's calls for campaign finance reform and ``straight talk''
in politics were favored among independents, who voted Republican
almost 3 to 1, even as registered GOP voters slightly favored Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley, who also challenged ``politics as usual'' and
Gore's ``entrenched power,'' was supported by three of every five
independents who voted Democratic, even while losing to Gore among
registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome raises questions about the invincibility of Bush,
once considered the GOP's inevitable nominee. The Texas governor
has spent $34 million in his run so far _ and has relatively little
to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Bush saw his win in the Iowa caucuses blunted by Steve
Forbes' stronger-than-expected second-place finish. McCain's
victory Tuesday now suggests that Bush will have to battle every
step for the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coronation process ended tonight,'' said Representative &LR; .
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, where the next critical GOP
primary takes place in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a McCain supporter, said the New Hampshire contest
signals that Republican voters are now ``shopping around'' in
earnest for a 2000 presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the results of the hard-fought ``first in the nation''
primary became clear, the candidates were looking ahead to future
battlefields _ and for Gore, Bradley, &LR;  and McCain, that meant
California.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president arrives in Los Angeles tonight and will hold
an open meeting for voters. Bradley arrives tomorrow in San
Francisco for a noon public event at the Ferry Building.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will appear in Burlingame Saturday as the keynote speaker
to the state Republican convention. Bush will send his brother,
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, to speak on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other GOP candidates, Forbes earned 13 percent of the
vote in New Hampshire and indicated he has the money and will
campaign in Delaware, where the next Republican primary will be
held on Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ambassador Alan Keyes, who finished a surprising third in
Iowa, received 6 percent, and commentator Gary Bauer fell to the
back of the pack with 1 percent. Keyes and Bauer also vowed to
continue on in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking to supporters here last night, attempted to
downplay the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners, and this year is no exception,'' Bush told them.
``The road to the GOP nomination in the White House is a long road.
Mine will go through all 50 states _ and I intend it to end at 1600
Pennyslvania  &LR; Pennsylvania Ave.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, although clearly disappointed, Bradley signaled his
intentions to press on to California, where the next Democratic
primary will be held on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a remarkable turnaround, but there is still a
tough fight ahead,'' the former basketball star said, addressing
supporters in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   While congratulating the vice president on his victory, Bradley
told his supporters, ``We're smarter and better prepared, and we
need to continue the fight.'' He vowed ``to heal the wounds of
racial divide,'' to lift poor Americans from the chains of poverty,
and to ensure all American children have quality education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged last night that the battle with Bradley had
forced him to sharpen his own campaign. In preparation for both
Iowa and New Hampshire, Gore reorganized his campaign staff, and
his campaign style. After solidly defeating Bradley in Iowa last
week, Gore campaigned hard in New Hampshire, stumping the state
from top to bottom as the race went down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``For months, we were behind in the polls here. ... We were the
underdogs,'' Gore told followers Tuesday. ``I believe the contest
made us stronger. ... This is a better campaign, a more focused and
stronger campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, was criticized for coming late to the state,
and for writing off the first major debate between the GOP
candidates. Still, in the final weeks of the campaign, the governor
proved adept at the intense, one-on-one retail campaigning that New
Hampshire voters demand.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain _ even by Bush's concession _ worked New Hampshire's
hamlets and cities tirelessly, holding 114 town meetings across the
state in more than a year. By the end of the campaign this week,
New Hampshire voters piled into town meetings to see the man, who,
as a Vietnam War POW, spent 51/2 years in the Hanoi Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Many expressed their admiration of a man they called ``a true
American hero,'' listening to McCain argue that among Republican
candidates, his experience made him the candidate most prepared to
lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   Voter News Service exit polls showed that New Hampshire's
Republican voters cited a candidate who ``stands up for what he
believes in'' and ``a strong and decisive leader'' as the qualities
they sought most in their next president _ and McCain won both
those groups.
</P>
<P>
   A third of Republican voters believed Bush lacked the
``knowledge to serve effectively as president'' and only 13 percent
agreed with Bush that campaign finance reform would hurt the GOP,
those polls showed. On the Democratic side, Gore was the candidate
most favored by voters who cited education as their top concern,
while Bradley was favored by those voters who believed health care
was the most important issue.
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 Democratic voters who cited a candidate who ``stands
up for what he believes in'' as the most important quality favored
Bradley, but 90 percent of those who cited ``experience'' as the
most important factor voted for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who had dismissed Gore's request for regular debates,
Tuesday proposed weekly debates starting Sunday through March 7.
The vice president said he would consider it.

CALIFORNIA SEN. BOXER BACKS PERMANENT BAN ON INTERNET TAXES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Sen. Barbara Boxer joined a growing
movement in Congress Tuesday to enact a permanent ban on Internet
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's announcement comes as something of a surprise from a
Democrat known more for pushing liberal social causes than tax
cuts, indicating that a permanent ban is picking up momentum across
the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that a no-Internet-sales-tax policy will lead to
greater prosperity for the economy as a whole and have a beneficial
impact on revenues of all levels of government,'' Boxer said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer cited three reasons for supporting a permanent ban:
</P>
<P>
   -- Taxes on Internet sales ``could endanger the country's
technology-driven economic recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The justification for state and local sales taxes is to
``defray the cost of providing stores and shops with services such
as fire, police, sewer and water. These costs do not apply to sales
on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Because Internet sales still have to be shipped to consumers,
traditional retail stores do not face a cost disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's move follows a new push for a permanent ban by Rep.
Chris Cox, R-Newport Beach, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the authors
of the current three-year moratorium Congress imposed in 1998. That
legislation ordered a commission to issue a report on the matter
this April.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is deadlocked between advocates for states and
localities that depend on sales tax revenue, along with some
``brick-and-mortar'' retailers that fear being put at a competitive
disadvantage to Internet retailers, and those who say sales taxes
would stifle Internet commerce and prove to be an administrative
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a state budget analyst argued that California might
be losing as much as $200 million a year in sales taxes, estimating
that those losses could more than quadruple by 2003, to 4 percent
of state sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Cox countered that California sales tax revenues shot up 12
percent last year under the moratorium, while national retail sales
rose 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is now in,'' Cox said. ``Keeping discriminatory
taxes off the Net is good for consumers, entrepreneurs and the
governments that tax them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox and Wyden argued that there is a ``growing threat'' from new
Internet tax proposals, ranging from ``an inconsistent hodgepodge''
of state and local sales taxes to a new federal sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't squeeze the new economy into policies written for
smokestack industries,'' Wyden said, calling such proposals
``reckless, special taxing of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become a hot topic in the Republican presidential
race as well, with Arizona Sen. John McCain and Steve Forbes
calling for a permanent ban, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
advocating a more cautious extension of the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former
N.J. Sen. Bill Bradley, oppose a permanent ban, arguing that it
could drain tax revenue from states and localities.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
You could almost hear Cuttino Mobley and Steve Francis giggling.
Before long, they would wrap their arms around each other's
shoulders and skip and dance to midcourt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be only a matter of time before they would be singing
that song that hasn't gotten out of their like-minded heads lately,
the one about A.C. Green that always makes them laugh no matter how
many times they repeat its goofy chorus.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets threw all the improvisational genius of
All-Star Eddie Jones at the Rockets. But the Rockets had Jones
outnumbered. They had Francis and Mobley, and the Rockets best
buddies combined were one high-speed, high-flying guard too many
for the Hornets to match.
</P>
<P>
   With Mobley and Francis carrying them down the stretch, the
Rockets flew past the Hornets for a 99-83 win Tuesday night at
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the kid backcourt tandem combined for 14 of the
Rockets' last 16 points, a run from a five-point lead to the rout
completed when Francis threw a role-reversal, alley-oop pass to
Mobley for a final slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get each other going all the time, especially when we see
one of the good guard tandems,'' Francis said. ``That really gets
us going.''
</P>
<P>
   It drove them Tuesday to a stunning run past Francis' wayward
shooting and the Rockets' inability to hold the many double-digit
leads they had built. It drove them past the Hornets' great size
advantage inside.
</P>
<P>
   It was even too much for the Hornets' attempt to answer with
their collection of quick guards _ Jones, David Wesley and Baron
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a lot of energy from each other,'' Rockets rookie
forward Kenny Thomas said of Mobley and Francis. ``They're real
close. They feed off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the night, that was not enough to put away the
Hornets, winners of six of seven coming into Tuesday's game. The
Rockets had swept to a 19-point lead early in the second quarter
but let all but four points of that lead slip away. They repeatedly
built double-digit leads and led by as much as 10 again in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets controlled the Hornets' huge front line. Derrick
Coleman, Anthony Mason and Elden Campbell combined to make just
nine of 26 shots for 22 points. After blocking eight shots against
the Lakers on Sunday, the Rockets swatted nine, including three by
Matt Bullard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our young guys did a great job staying down
(defensively) and not going for their pump-faking,'' Rockets coach
Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``They were making guys make tough shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Said center Hakeem Olajuwon, ``We were excellent in the fourth
quarter making the big play, especially defensively. Defense was
the key.''
</P>
<P>
   If that represented one major change from the Rockets'
early-season troubles in the fourth quarter, the Rockets showcased
the other most obvious area of improvement, committing a season-low
eight turnovers against the NBA steal leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Hornets made their run, with Coleman completing a
three-point play to pull them within five, the Rockets guards and
especially Mobley took over.
</P>
<P>
   He nailed a 3-pointer to push the lead to eight. And after the
Hornets closed to within four, Mobley scored on a drive.
</P>
<P>
   Francis stripped Coleman and passed ahead to Mobley, who headed
for the rim. Davis broke up the dunk, but Mobley was fouled and hit
both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Cato slammed the Rockets to a 10-point lead, and after a
Campbell free throw Francis nailed a 3 from the corner to put away
the win. Francis' last shot gave him 22 points, to go with seven
rebounds, eight assists and five steals with just one turnover. But
he made just seven of 24 shots, leaving him lamenting his errant
shooting touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I was missing all those shots,'' he said.
``That's not cool. They just weren't falling.''
</P>
<P>
   But his buddy had picked up the offensive slack. When Mobley
added a late jumper and his final slam, he had scored 11 points in
the final seven minutes, finishing with a game-high 23 points, most
against Jones. He made nine of 15 shots in just 27 minutes off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to see Cuttino go one-on-one off the dribble,''
Olajuwon said. ``He was taking one of the best players in the
league. He has that kind of potential. He's so talented.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-on-one, he can take him any time. If they drop back, he
can take the pull-up (jumper). And he can create. He can always get
something.''
</P>
<P>
   If that endorsement was not enough, Mobley more than beat one of
the league's best players, an All-Star starter and a defensive
star. He beat the player he said had first made him understand he
could be an NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my mentor,'' Mobley said. ``I've looked up to him since I
was 15. He is like my big brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones showed why he is considered one of the league's best and a
free agent this summer sure to attract the largest contract
allowed. He finished with 20 points and four assists. But he made
seven of 22 shots and was unable to control his friend in the
opposing backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuttino played very well,'' Jones said. ``Normally, I kill
him. We get in the gym back in Philly and battle each other all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him like a brother and want him to do well. But I don't
want him to get overconfident when he plays us.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be too late to prevent that. If not, Francis will be
back in Mobley's ear with plenty to say _ unless Mobley beats him
to it.

FROM here, you don't even need to squint anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley, Steve Francis. Steve Francis, Cuttino Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like brothers already,'' Mobley said.
</P>
<P>
   All the projections about the future, the promise and the
potential of this slick, high-flying Rockets backcourt were as
clear as HDTV on Tuesday night at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   This oh-so-young Rockets duo with the hip-hop in their demeanors
and the high hops in their sneakers took a game that easily could
have slipped away against the Charlotte Hornets and turned it into
a jaw-dropping extravaganza of Rockets hope.
</P>
<P>
   This great transition season of the Rockets, which began with so
many silly mistakes and growing pains for this young backcourt, is
turning around.
</P>
<P>
   All those frustrations about losing that were only compounded
when Charles Barkley blew out his quadriceps tendon and Hakeem
Olajuwon underwent hernia surgery are fewer and farther between.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley and Francis are showing us more glimpses at the future
than painful reminders of how frustrating things can be in the
present. Tuesday night's 99-83 win over the Hornets was the
Rockets' eighth in their last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   And while the 18-27 Rockets probably still cannot make up enough
ground on the 25-18 Phoenix Suns to squeeze into the playoffs, it
no longer takes a wild imagination to understand exactly why coach
Rudy Tomjanovich marvels at the possibilities that lie ahead with
these two.
</P>
<P>
   It was right there for 14,391 fans to see. On a cool, damp
night, it was clear as day.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, the only thing Francis had a harder time
making than jump shots were layups. He was 5-of-19 from the field
through three quarters, and the Rockets were clinging to a
six-point lead as the Hornets chipped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have missed 10 layups,'' Francis said. ``It was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, on the other hand, had just 10 points through three
quarters. He had played just 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the fourth quarter, Mobley and Francis stretched their
wings and practically flew out of the place. Nothing might have
said more about how these two continue to mature and learn than the
high-speed display down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   They shook off the otherwise struggling night and starred _ like
veterans might do.
</P>
<P>
   With 5:43 remaining, the Hornets had cut the Rockets' edge to
four points, thanks mostly to the formidable talent of their own
young backcourt star, Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But from that point on, it was Mobley and Francis, Francis and
Mobley. There was a clutch, driving finger roll by Mobley, a steal
by Francis, an off-balance Francis 3-pointer, a running 19-footer
by Mobley and finally the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   Francis took the ball from Kelvin Cato on the break and flashed
down the court. Mobley sped ahead and soared. Francis lofted a
perfect alley-oop pass that Mobley jammed home.
</P>
<P>
   Ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of isolations with them,'' Tomjanovich said.
``You couldn't draw up some of the things they did.''
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't help but know that this is a tandem that in time
could carry the backcourt load with the best in the league. Francis
finished with 22 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. Mobley
finished with 23 points _ 13 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't help but see the recent streak of superb, clutch
play by Mobley and Francis as the Rockets keep winning and see the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Including Tuesday's win, either Mobley or Francis has led the
team in scoring in all but two of the Rockets' last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they're still so young. In the locker room, they still
frolic like a couple of kids on extended recess. After practice or
shootaround, they still hang around and make up shooting games or
bounce around reveling in the spectacle of their promising lives in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   After Mobley slammed one home on a fast break in the fourth
quarter and was fouled for a three-point play, he sprinted some 15
rows up the aisle in Section 101 behind the bucket and slapped
hands with fans. Right behind him was Francis, slapping his
teammate on the back.
</P>
<P>
   After the final alley-oop that sealed the Hornets' fate, Mobley
bounced upcourt, laughing with the crowd. Francis hopped on his
back for a celebratory piggyback ride.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a championship win or even a playoff win, but clearly
you could see those things from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having fun with the game,'' Mobley said. ``The veterans
did the same thing when they were young. It's just fun out there
with (Francis). I believe in him, and I know he believes in me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's never been more clear.

 McCAIN WINS BIG VICTORY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE  
 (Subs 8th graf for summary of vote tally; subs for new 11th and
12th grafs giving vote totals.) 
(sw)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain swamped Gov. George W. Bush
on Tuesday in the New Hampshire Republican primary, piling up the
widest margin here since Ronald Reagan defeated Bush's father 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,'' an elated McCain
told a raucous crowd of supporters Tuesday night as he embraced a
victory that his advisers hope is the first step to blocking Bush's
once seemingly unstoppable march to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's triumph was particularly exceptional because surveys of
voters Tuesday found it was built not only on a core of
independents but also on wide and deep support among faithful
Republicans whom the Bush campaign considered its most reliable
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the race turns to Delaware, South Carolina, and then to
Michigan and Arizona, Republican strategists say the question is
whether McCain can propel his victory into a genuine challenge to
Bush. For months, the Texas governor has been widely viewed as the
front-runner because of his towering financial advantage and his
vast endorsements from elected Republicans, even before his victory
in the Iowa caucuses last week.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain and Bush have sparred for weeks over the size of
their tax-cut proposals and the depth of their opposition to
abortion, the surveys of voters found that the most crucial factor
among the Arizona senator's backers was that they viewed him as a
candidate of unshakable character who was willing to stand up for
his convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but be amazed by the size of this,'' McCain
said from his hotel suite in Nashua after being told he had won.
``It's across the board, came from all sectors _ conservatives,
moderates liberals, women. It was a win for the message.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally later, McCain, smiling broadly as he stressed his
insurgent message. ``We have sent a powerful message to Washington
that change is coming,'' he said. ``This is a good thing. And it is
the beginning of the end of the truth-twisting politics of Bill
Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The results left McCain with a 40,000-vote edge over Bush in the
nation's first primary, a contest that drew more than 225,000
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The results stunned Bush and his advisers, who for days had
happily predicted they would win here. Even Tuesday morning, Bush
confidently said, ``I'm going to win.'' Tuesday night, at a rally
in Goffstown, Bush emphasized that he was ready to compete
nationwide. ``The road to the Republican nomination and the White
House is a long road,'' he declared to subdued but cheering
supporters. ``Mine will go through all 50 states _ and I intend it
to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that McCain won not because of the issues but because
he campaigned here practically nonstop for months, Bush, flanked by
his wife, Laura, and his twin teen-age daughters, said, ``He spent
more time in this great state than any of the other candidates, and
it paid off. Tonight is his night and the night of his supporters.
And we all congratulate him.'' Bush campaigned here 36 days; McCain
65.
</P>
<P>
   With 97 percent of the votes counted at about 12:30 a.m., the
vote was:
</P>
<P>
   McCain: 113,648 (49 percent)
</P>
<P>
   Bush: 71,212 (31 percent)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes: 29,871 (13 percent)
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes 14,981 (6 percent)
</P>
<P>
   Gary L. Bauer 1,635 (1 percent)
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire accounts for 17 of the 1,034 delegates it takes to
win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first political loss for the two-term governor
since his defeat in his first run for office, a bid for the House
from Texas in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain were remarkably respectful of one another before
the cameras Tuesday night. But behind the scenes, Bush's aides said
they were considering significantly turning up their attacks on the
senator by painting him as a moderate as the contest turns south
for the South Carolina primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to walk right into our punch in South Carolina,''
said one Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome also set off a furious round of finger pointing
among Bush's advisers over whether he neglected New Hampshire too
long; was too passive in his commercials _ and even whether he
erred in campaigning here with his father on Saturday. Some
advisers suggested that by standing on stage with the former
president, Bush reinforced questions about whether he was too
reliant on his father's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides, seeking to capitalize on an outcome that was far
more lopsided than they had anticipated, immediately sought to step
up their fund-raising as a first step to quickly assembling
organizations in several states. They acknowledged that they could
never amass as much money as Bush, who has collected nearly $69
million, compared with nearly $14 million for McCain. But they said
they want to raise enough to compete aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   The results Tuesday night affirmed McCain's decision to skip the
Iowa caucuses. Steve Forbes, who finished second to Bush in that
contest, placed a distant third Tuesday in New Hampshire. They were
trailed by Alan Keyes, the former State Department official, and
Gary L. Bauer, a prominent religious conservative who aides said
was weighing whether to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Bauer praised McCain for his ``incredibly
strong'' showing and, suggesting he would soon withdraw, said,
``I'm not delusional.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stunning win for Senator McCain,'' said Steve Duprey,
chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. He added: ``The
danger for Bush of an insurgency campaign is that McCain has a
brush fire that he's going to try to turn into a wildfire. If
Governor Bush had beaten Senator McCain decisively, it would have
crippled, if not mortally wounded his campaign. Governor Bush may
well survive a loss. His challenge is to make sure that Senator
McCain doesn't score a series of victories.''
</P>
<P>
   An important factor in McCain's victory was that independents
turned out in force for him. More than 4 in 10 votes, according to
the surveys, said they were independents, an increase from 35
percent four years ago. Six in 10 of those independents voted for
McCain, while fewer than 2 in 10 backed Bush _ and even fewer than
that voted for Forbes. The surveys were conducted by Voter News
Service, a consortium created by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News,
NBC News and the Associated Press. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republican voters, half described themselves as
conservatives and they divided their votes evenly between McCain
and Bush. About 1 in 6 voters described themselves as very
conservative, about the same proportion who said they were part of
the religious right. Bush did well among this group, but not
resoundingly so. He captured about 3 in 10 voters of religious
conservatives while McCain and Forbes each took about 2 in 10 of
their votes.
</P>
<P>
   For all the wrangling over abortion, the issue in the end did
not seem to have played a role in the voters' decisions. Only 1 in
20 said it was the issue that mattered most to them. Asked directly
what their views were, 1 in 10 Republicans said abortion should
always be illegal. They voted for Bush but, again, not resoundingly
so. But among those with other views on abortion _ those who said
it should be illegal in most cases, legal in most cases or legal in
all cases _ backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys found that people credited McCain with saying what
he believed no matter the political consequences. The voters said
they were not swayed more by the tax issue or by social concerns
but believed that both should be priorities of the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Several McCain supporters said in interviews that they found his
history as a war hero in Vietnam and his no-nonsense disposition
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided at the last minute,'' said Jim Arruda, 55, a program
manager from Derry. ``My plan was to vote for John McCain or
against Al Gore. And I voted for McCain. I have a better sense for
who McCain is. And on the Republican side, George Bush just seems
to have no substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim McLaughlin, 41, an electrical engineer, put it this way:
``It was a toss-up between McCain and Bush. I watched the debate
last week, and I was swayed toward McCain. His military experience
was important, he came across as an intelligent man, and someone
who was passionate about his message.''
</P>
<P>
   This campaign was unique in that McCain and former Sen. Bill
Bradley, a Democrat, put themselves forward as reformers and
appealed to a tiny pool of some of the same independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of Republican voters Tuesday said they had
considered voting for a Democrat at one time or another. More than
1 in 10 said they had mulled backing Bradley; less than 1 in 10
said they thought about Gore. But most of those who toyed with
voting vote Bradley decided, in the end, to back McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Bush's father won 23 percent of the vote in the New
Hampshire primary, compared to 50 percent for Reagan, who went on
to win the White House. Bush, at the time, congratulated Reagan,
saying, ``You beat the hell out of us.''

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
HONOLULU _ Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle Warren Sapp
expressed shock and outrage at the news that his close friend,
Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, would not be coming to the
Pro Bowl because he remained in an Atlanta jail Tuesday charged
with murder.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sapp, the NFL Defensive Player of the Year, who played with
Lewis at the University of Miami, insisted that Lewis would be
found innocent of the charges resulting from a post-Super Bowl
incident in which two men were stabbed to death near a nightclub in
Atlanta's trendy Buckhead area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've raised that kid since he was 18 years old, and he's not
that type of person,'' Sapp said after the NFC's practice at Aloha
Stadium. ``Ray will get you in a club and dance you to death, but
stab you to death? No way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked more than anything, because I know that's not him.
I know him better than that. That's brother. That's my little kid.
When everything's said and done, he'll be cleared of this. He was
in a crowd. He was the only face somebody recognized. It's a price
we pay sometimes for being the people we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who was voted to the last three Pro Bowls, was arraigned
Tuesday. He entered court with his hands in shackles. No bail was
set. He must remain in jail until a preliminary hearing Feb. 24. If
proved guilty, Lewis could get life in prison or the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you're in a situation where you know you haven't done
anything, and the eye of the storm is right where you are, there's
no calm for you,'' Sapp said. ``You're talking about a situation
where he was getting ready to enjoy himself with us and his family.
Now he has to deal with something like that. It's tough. My prayers
are with him, but I know he didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, six men fought and argued with the
victims before fleeing in a black limousine, firing at least five
shots as they drove away. Police found the limousine a few hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the position that he was in the wrong place at
the wrong time,'' Lewis' lawyer, Max Richardson Jr., said outside
court. ``From what I've gathered from law enforcement officers,
they know Ray didn't kill these unfortunate victims.''
</P>
<P>
   He said police were searching for other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know where the other two men who were involved are,
so they arrested Ray,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the second NFL player to be charged with murder in the
past month. Former Carolina receiver Rae Carruth was charged last
month with murdering his pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not shocked at all,'' Minnesota Vikings receiver Cris
Carter said. ``I'm very seldom surprised by anything. The
modern-day athlete has more influence than ever before, but there's
also more tragedy than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of Lewis' teammates with the Ravens are having a difficult
time coming to grips with his being charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was shock and disbelief,'' Baltimore
offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden said. ``I don't know all the facts.
All I know is what I've seen on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I know of Ray, though, it doesn't sound like something he
would do. I'm definitely going to take the innocent-until-proven
(guilty) approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravens outside linebacker Peter Boulware lines up next to Lewis
in practice and games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about it all day, and it doesn't sound like
something he would do,'' Boulware said. ``Ray's a great dude. It's
kind of hard for me to believe he would do anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a close friend involved in something like this,
you're worried about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravens free safety Rod Woodson added, ``That's my man. I hope it
isn't true. That's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will be replaced in the Pro Bowl by San Diego linebacker
Junior Seau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a bittersweet invite to the Pro Bowl,'' Seau
said. ``My heart goes out to Ray Lewis and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the players at the Pro Bowl, Giants defensive end
Michael Strahan had gotten to know Lewis in Hawaii after each
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Ray from just seeing him around here, and he seems like
a great guy,'' Strahan said. ``It's just hard to believe that
somebody with that much going for him would do something like that.
Since I know only half the story, right now, I'll give Ray the
benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy, who is coaching the NFC, said the
Lewis situation will cause coaches to use him as an example when
they are lecturing their players about life off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really shocked by what happened,'' Dungy said. ``We
talk to our players about situations like that, when they're out
late in crowds. We remind them to be careful where you go, who
you're with, and what's going on around you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have been an innocent bystander. He may have had a
great deal to do with it. No one knows right now. But the fact is
that he's the only one anyone knows about. The national story is
Ray Lewis, rightfully or wrongfully, and that's something you have
to be careful about.''

LAKERS ROUTED BY SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO -- Shades of May 1999: Tim Duncan scoring at will,
Avery Johnson gliding through the lane. And the Lakers withering at
every missed rebound and every slow defensive rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out things didn't change much when the calendar flipped
over with all those zeros.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to playing the San Antonio Spurs in the Alamodome,
the Lakers are still flummoxed, triangle offenses and MVP centers
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that very much resembled their last trip here, the
Lakers were thoroughly dominated by the Spurs Tuesday night and
suffered their worst margin of defeat this season, 105-81, before
25,589.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan got 29 points and 18 rebounds. Johnson finished with 22
points and nine assists. And the Spurs became just the second
Lakers opponent th is season to shoot better than 50 percent,
hitting 43 of 82 shots.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as bad as a playoff sweep, but it did enough damage
anyway: The loss, the Lakers' fourth in five games, knocked them
out of first place in the Pacific Division for the first time since
Dec. 13. The Portland Trail Blazers, who defeated the Chicago
Bulls, moved ahead by a half-game and snatched away the title of
the NBA's winningest team.
</P>
<P>
   The recent close losses, the Lakers accepted to a degree. But
this was a brand of pain not felt since last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose four close games to good teams down the stretch,
the last minute of the game, you don't second-guess your capability
to play with those teams, but it gets a little disheartening to
know that you can' t finish those games off with wins,'' said Rick
Fox. ``And you come into a situation like tonight, knowing that
you're playing the defending world champions, on their floor. You
know they're going to bring their best game, and we didn't respond
in any sort of fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lakers won the first meeting with the Spurs this
season, Dec. 25 at Staples Center, they no longer play the defense
that carried them through that victory and a 16-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   And they still can't match the Spurs' size. Duncan and David
Robinson combined for 30 rebounds as the Spurs took a 46-33
advantage on the boards. Shaquille O'Neal had 31 points (on
13-of-17 shooting) and five blocked shots, but he got into foul
trouble against the Twin Towers and finished with just seven
rebounds -- a season-low for a game in which he wasn't ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played conservative because he got himself in
foul trouble early in the game by reaching,'' said coach Phil
Jackson, ``and so as a consequence he had to tuck it in a little
bit and not play with the kind of aggression we need him to play
with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' offense clicked early and they were down by only a
point midway through the second quarter. Then the Spurs used an
18-7 run, with eight from Duncan, to pull ahead by double digits,
53-43, and they took a 10-point advantage into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Another surge later, and the Spurs were up by 18 in the third
quarter, and the Lakers never got closer than 13, early in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the offense had failed too. Kobe Bryant, who had
19 points, seven rebounds and eight assists, was the only other
Laker to score in double figures. Glen Rice was benched in favor of
Fox for the entire second and fourth quarters and finished with
five points on 2-of-7 shooting. Rice, who was upset over a lack of
scoring opportunities in Sunday's loss at Houston, declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, because he wasn't doing much, we wanted to get somebody
in there and see if somebody else could do something,'' Jackson
said. ``And we got Rick out there as a very quality, qualified
player to play a little bit and we did OK. But the reality is that
we just have to play ball together and that's part of the demise
right now of our winning streak, (which) has just gone right down
the tubes because we're just not playing well together.''

   OXNARD _ Numb from grief, families of many of the 88 people
aboard doomed Alaska Airlines Flight 261 gathered Tuesday in Los
Angeles and along the Ventura County coastline as hope faded of
finding their loved ones alive after Monday's crash at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard rescuers still had not given up the search for
survivors in the cold, churning water near Anacapa Island, where
the plane nose-dived into the ocean after experiencing mechanical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue the search for human lives. I am not yet ready to
make the decision to stop searching,'' said Coast Guard Vice Adm.
Tom Collins.
</P>
<P>
   But as hours passed and the number of victims pulled from the
ocean rose, the chances of spotting survivors in the 58-degree
water grew slim. Instead, rescuers confirmed they found the bodies
of one man, two women and an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives poured into Los Angeles International Airport from San
Francisco and Seattle, planned destinations of the flight from the
Mexican resort of Puerta Vallarta. They met with counselors near
the airport and drove to the Ventura County coast to mourn beside
the ocean that swallowed the plane just before sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Janelle Davis of Santa Barbara wept on Port Hueneme beach
Tuesday in the arms of her boyfriend as she grieved for her sister,
lost in the crash. Nearby, someone had erected a 7-foot-tall
memorial cross on the beach, decorated with candles, flowers and a
rosary.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and her sister had been attending a family reunion in
Puerto Vallarta, and Davis took an earlier flight back. Her sister,
whom Davis declined to name because the passenger list had yet to
be made public, lived in Seattle and was engaged to be married
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just never know. You just never know,'' she kept repeating
as she fumbled with a bouquet of flowers she planned to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In Redlands, the family of pilot Ted Thompson thanked friends
for their support and said they grieved for all those lost on the
flight. Both Thompson and First Officer Bill Tansky were based in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure everyone knows that it would make my dad
happy to see how many people saw him as a father and a friend,''
said son Fred Thompson, 24, his voice shaking. ``Our hearts are
with the families and friends of the passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme,
federal investigators newly arrived from Washington, D.C., launched
their probe into the crash's exact cause.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many air disasters that leave few solid clues behind,
investigators had several leads to follow Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations between the flight's pilots and air traffic
control indicated that a stablizer used to keep the plane's nose
level malfunctioned, the National Transportation Safety Board
announced. For at least 10 minutes before the crash, the pilots
tried to maintain control over the aircraft, which lost altitude
several times before dropping from radar.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also reported detecting pings from the plane's
black box flight data recorder, now lying some 700 feet underwater.
And they announced that four other planes were flying in the area
at the time of the crash. The pilot of one was being interviewed
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the NTSB culled control tower transcripts, military and
civilian rescuers continued the grim work of searching the waters
off Point Mugu.
</P>
<P>
   The armada of private fishing boats, Coast Guard cutters and
Navy ships that converged on the scene Monday night was still there
at dawn. They continued their search throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Boat crews used gaff hooks and fishing nets to pull up debris.
Coast Guard helicopters circling overhead dropped green dye packs
where debris was heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Biscuit fishing boat snagged hundreds of tiny pieces of
insulation, a 3-by-1-foot section of a cabin wall with honeycombed
insulation still attached, a pink plastic hair roller and a woman's
black platform sandal, said skipper Bob Perron.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is starting to get sad,'' Perron said as he scooped up
the sandal with a hand net. ``It's getting personal now that it's
not plane parts. These things belonged to people. That shoe came
off somebody's foot when (the plane) hit.''
</P>
<P>
   All debris would be turned over to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt left many participants frustrated. For all the people
combing the waters, no one had found a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard because there's nothing really you can tell (the
families),'' said Steve Brescia, executive officer of a Las
Vegas-based Air Force unit searching the site by helicopter. ``They
all want to know what you've found, but you have to say, Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the coast was dotted with people bearing flowers and
mementos to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co. aircraft mechanic Ben Cruz drove up from Long Beach,
where he helped build MD-80 class airliners like the one that
crashed. He came to pray and place flowers at a memorial near the
Port Hueneme pier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to pay my respects,'' said Cruz, clad in a blue
McDonnell Douglas jumpsuit. He said his gesture was on behalf of
all plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become an emotional thing for many of us,'' Cruz said.
``These weren't 88 persons, they were 88 souls that's how we
classify people on aircraft. So our hearts go out to the victims
and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton echoed their sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout this difficult day, and in the days and weeks to
come, we will keep the passengers and crew of Flight 261 in our
thoughts, and let us hope that God's mercy will shine on them and
their families,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 family members met with Red Cross grief counselors
stationed at the Renaissance Los Angeles Hotel near LAX.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a hotel conference room, one family of eight sat in a
circle, some wiping their tears, others silently remembering their
loved one a schoolteacher from Mexico presumed dead in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the room, a religious counselor gently spoke with
another distraught couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many of the people have already come to the grim
conclusion that their family members have already persished in the
crash. Others are still holding out,'' said Chris Thomas, spokesman
for the Greater Los Angeles Red Cross.

Francisco and Seattle, planned destinations of the flight from the
Mexican resort of Puerta Vallarta. They met with counselors near
the airport and drove to the Ventura County coast to mourn beside
the ocean that swallowed the plane just before sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Janelle Davis of Santa Barbara wept on Port Hueneme beach
Tuesday in the arms of her boyfriend as she grieved for her sister,
lost in the crash. Nearby, someone had erected a 7-foot-tall
memorial cross on the beach, decorated with candles, flowers and a
rosary.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and her sister had been attending a family reunion in
Puerto Vallarta, and Davis took an earlier flight back. Her sister,
whom Davis declined to name because the passenger list had yet to
be made public, lived in Seattle and was engaged to be married
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just never know. You just never know,'' she kept repeating
as she fumbled with a bouquet of flowers she planned to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In Redlands, the family of pilot Ted Thompson thanked friends
for their support and said they grieved for all those lost on the
flight. Both Thompson and First Officer Bill Tansky were based in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure everyone knows that it would make my dad
happy to see how many people saw him as a father and a friend,''
said son Fred Thompson, 24, his voice shaking. ``Our hearts are
with the families and friends of the passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme,
federal investigators newly arrived from Washington, D.C., launched
their probe into the crash's exact cause.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many air disasters that leave few solid clues behind,
investigators had several leads to follow Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations between the flight's pilots and air traffic
control indicated that a stablizer used to keep the plane's nose
level malfunctioned, the National Transportation Safety Board
announced. For at least 10 minutes before the crash, the pilots
tried to maintain control over the aircraft, which lost altitude
several times before dropping from radar.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also reported detecting pings from the plane's
black box flight data recorder, now lying some 700 feet underwater.
And they announced that four other planes were flying in the area
at the time of the crash. The pilot of one was being interviewed
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the NTSB culled control tower transcripts, military and
civilian rescuers continued the grim work of searching the waters
off Point Mugu.
</P>
<P>
   The armada of private fishing boats, Coast Guard cutters and
Navy ships that converged on the scene Monday night was still there
at dawn. They continued their search throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Boat crews used gaff hooks and fishing nets to pull up debris.
Coast Guard helicopters circling overhead dropped green dye packs
where debris was heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Biscuit fishing boat snagged hundreds of tiny pieces of
insulation, a 3-by-1-foot section of a cabin wall with honeycombed
insulation still attached, a pink plastic hair roller and a woman's
black platform sandal, said skipper Bob Perron.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is starting to get sad,'' Perron said as he scooped up
the sandal with a hand net. ``It's getting personal now that it's
not plane parts. These things belonged to people. That shoe came
off somebody's foot when (the plane) hit.''
</P>
<P>
   All debris would be turned over to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt left many participants frustrated. For all the people
combing the waters, no one had found a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard because there's nothing really you can tell (the
families),'' said Steve Brescia, executive officer of a Las
Vegas-based Air Force unit searching the site by helicopter. ``They
all want to know what you've found, but you have to say, Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the coast was dotted with people bearing flowers and
mementos to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co. aircraft mechanic Ben Cruz drove up from Long Beach,
where he helped build MD-80 class airliners like the one that
crashed. He came to pray and place flowers at a memorial near the
Port Hueneme pier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to pay my respects,'' said Cruz, clad in a blue
McDonnell Douglas jumpsuit. He said his gesture was on behalf of
all plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become an emotional thing for many of us,'' Cruz said.
``These weren't 88 persons, they were 88 souls that's how we
classify people on aircraft. So our hearts go out to the victims
and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton echoed their sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout this difficult day, and in the days and weeks to
come, we will keep the passengers and crew of Flight 261 in our
thoughts, and let us hope that God's mercy will shine on them and
their families,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 family members met with Red Cross grief counselors
stationed at the Renaissance Los Angeles Hotel near LAX.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a hotel conference room, one family of eight sat in a
circle, some wiping their tears, others silently remembering their
loved one a schoolteacher from Mexico presumed dead in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the room, a religious counselor gently spoke with
another distraught couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many of the people have already come to the grim
conclusion that their family members have already persished in the
crash. Others are still holding out,'' said Chris Thomas, spokesman
for the Greater Los Angeles Red Cross.

PILOTS' STRUGGLE LASTED FOR MINUTES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For five fateful minutes, the crew of Alaskan
Airlines Flight 261 fought to regain control of the plummeting jet
before trying to turn around for an emergency landing at LAX.
</P>
<P>
   But by then it was too late for the 88 crew members and
passengers of Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought that they could maintain altitude, and they would
go on to LAX,'' said John Hammerschmidt, spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:16 p.m. Monday, just a minute after deciding to head to Los
Angeles International, the crew made its last radio contact and the
MD-83 jetliner disappeared from radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators intensified their search Tuesday for clues,
they provided a gripping account of the last 26 minutes of radio
transmissions and the crews' desperate struggle to avert disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Flying over the Santa Barbara Channel, some 20 miles from Los
Angeles International Airport, the five-member crew suddenly
noticed their plane was losing altitude and was difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   It would take them about 20 minutes before discovering the
culprit: a jammed horizontal stabilizer, responsible for
controlling the up-and- down motion of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, Capt. Ted Thompson and First Officer William
Tansky, seasoned former military pilots, spoke matter-of-factly as
they summoned all their experience and skill to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they told controllers the problem was ``kind of
stabilized,'' but moments later they conceded, ``we're still
working on it,'' according to Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   The last routine transmission came at 3:35 p.m., when the flight
out from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and Seattle was
cleared to fly at 31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, at 4:10 p.m., the pilots alerted
air-traffic controllers in Palmdale they were having trouble
controlling the plane. Within seconds, the plane suddenly dropped
from 26,000 feet and then to 23,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled by the sudden altitude change, air traffic controllers
asked the crew for its condition. The crew responded it had ``kind
of stabilized and was going to do some trouble- shooting,'' said
Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:14 p.m., controllers told the flight crew to let them know
if they needed anything.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15 p.m., the controllers in Palmdale handed off Flight 261
to another controller aware of the problem. Seconds later, the crew
discovered that the stabilizer was jammed and they were having
trouble maintaining altitude. It was then they decided to divert to
LAX.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:16 p.m., the flight crew advised that it was going to
10,000 feet and had to change flight configurations over the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to change flight configuration, to deploy the wing
flaps to slow the plane down,'' Hammerschidt explained. ``In a
cruise flight, the flaps are at a particular setting. They wanted
to change it to `approach setting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers gave that clearance and the flight crew
acknowledged that transmission.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:17, traffic controllers advised the flight crew to contact
another air traffic controller on a different frequency, but the
transmission was not acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:21, controllers lost radar contact with the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The plane slammed nose-first into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, Drew Gottshall was the first to report seeing
the crash as the plane plunged into the ocean about 2 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the aircraft, looked up, and followed its path
visually till it hit the water,'' said the National Parks Service
maintenance worker.
</P>
<P>
   Through binoculars, Gottshall watched debris and an oil slick
surface, as a fishing boat headed toward the crash site. ``Because
of the distance away and the slow travel time of sound, it was four
or five seconds after seeing the plane impact the water before I
heard the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point as I was watching the descent of the plane
where I felt hopeless. It had a finality that came very quickly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the plane hit the water and disappeared, there was just
me and seagulls out there.''

CALIFORNIA'S EARLIER PRIMARY PAYING OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary
out of the way, much of the nation's attention will now turn to
California, thanks to its electoral heft and early primary.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the California primary stands to
be a major factor in the presidential nominating process,
fulfilling the hopes of those who pushed to move it up to March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be more than two candidates going into California,
but there will only be one coming out,'' said Dan Schnur,
communications director for the campaign of Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is going to decide the Republican nominee for
president. No ifs, ands or buts. This is the first time in a long
time that California will decide this. It's the size of the state,
the number of delegates at stake and its timing on the primary
calendar that give California an absolutely decisive role.''
</P>
<P>
   It is equally as important for Democrats, with Vice President Al
Gore arriving in Burbank tonight for a two-day swing and former
Sen. Bill Bradley arriving Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At stake for Republicans are 162 delegates _ out of the 1,100
needed for the nomination _ in a state where the winner takes all.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have a proportional basis for assigning delegates, but
it still could be a sizable number with 495 delegates to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
   While the voters can now cast ballots for either party despite
their registration, only those from Republicans will count in GOP
delegate selection and only those from Democrats in that party's
delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is coming to the state this week to attend the California
Republican Party convention in Burlingame, as are other GOP
contenders, including Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is not attending, but his brother _
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush _ is appearing as a surrogate for him. Bush's
campaign said the candidate will be at several locations in
California, probably later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hampered by the stronger-than-expected challenge from
McCain and is being forced to spend more time in South Carolina and
other states holding Republican primaries before the California
election.
</P>
<P>
   California is getting similar attention from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to arrive at 8 tonight at Burbank Airport for
an event on health care. He also is expected to be campaigning in
Los Angeles on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will be in Northern California on Thursday as part of a
monthlong effort in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley both plan to attend the state Democratic
Convention beginning Feb. 11 and are scheduled for a debate in Los
Angeles on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also announced the formation of a sort of
California kitchen cabinet, drawing on many of the supporters of
President Clinton to help him in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the list are longtime activists Bill Wardlaw,
Henry Cisneros, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown Jr., former Rep.
Mel Levine and John Emerson. Garry South, who was Gov. Gray Davis'
campaign manager, is heading up the group.
</P>
<P>
   California playing a role in presidential politics has long been
a dream of officials tired of seeing the state used as the ATM of
campaigns without having a say in the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, four years ago, the state pushed up its traditional
June primary to late March, but other states countered by advancing
their primaries. California struck back by moving its election up
to March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made California the gorilla in national politics,'' said
USC professor Eric Schockman. ``California voters are watching what
happens in Iowa and New Hampshire, and there is finally a real
sense of anticipation that we will play a role in the nominating
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But some complications remain.
</P>
<P>
   California voters two years ago approved what is known as a
blanket primary allowing members of one party to vote for
candidates in another party's primary, and allowing independents to
vote for partisan candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties threatened to not allow the California
vote to count until Secretary of State Bill Jones won approval for
a system to allow only Democratic and Republican votes to count for
their party's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, what it does is give us a chance to remind voters to
register for a party,'' said Schnur. ``We are telling people if
they want their vote to count, they have to register as a
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the primary is only half the political battle, with
both sides wanting to do well for November and the chance to win
the state's 54 electoral votes _ 20 percent of what's needed to win
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum said the state is particularly
important for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to win the White House, they have to win
California,'' Hoffenblum said. ``Republicans can win without
carrying California.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if the past two elections are any indication, the
Republicans had better try harder in California. Not only did
Clinton carry California _ and win the White House _ in 1996, but
Democrats had a near clean sweep in 1998 with the election of Davis
and taking control of both houses in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``What California Republicans want is the top of the ticket to
at least try here,'' Hoffenblum said. ``They want to get a base of
support to have a chance. And, if the top of the ticket carries
California, that would mean they are winning everywhere else.''

U.S. WOMEN'S TEAM REWARDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After forcing America's lovable U.S. Women's World Cup
championship team into a month-long boycott because of ridiculously
low wages, the U.S. Soccer Federation rewarded the women on Tuesday
with a lucrative five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is performance based, and will allow players to
earn roughly $130,000 in salaries and bonuses including $2,000 a
game through the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Carla Overbeck, who joins Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain and
others this week in Florida with new coach April Heinrichs, can
prepare now for Sunday's match against rival Norway in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love soccer and we love to play the game and with this new
contract we will be able to do that as a career,'' said Overbeck.
``It's also important for the younger kids because they won't have
to seek outside employment, they can train every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we had to seek outside employment, then come to
train every day. But with this new commitment from the Federation,
we can concentrate on soccer as a career.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Soccer president S. Robert Contiguglia called the deal
``historic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic agreement that continues to establish U.S.
Soccer as a leader in the fight for gender equity in the world of
athletics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The women earned $3,150 a month during the World Cup last
summer, but that contract expired last July.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their success and huge popularity during the World
Cup, the women sought a new deal worth $5,000 a month, plus $2,000
per game. However, the USSF declined that request last September
and asked them to re-sign under their old contract.
</P>
<P>
   That caused the team to walk out last month. The women boycotted
the Australia Cup, which the U.S. won with high school and college
players.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Soccer president Alan Rothenberg, who helped with
the negotiations last week in Los Angeles, said the contract
shouldn't have taken this long to iron out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some unfortunate misunderstandings and
communication as to when we would begin (talks),'' said Rothenberg.
``We had a few weeks where we did not meet and there was a lot of
miscommunication. Once we sat down to meet last week, and after a
lot of conference calls, we reached an agreement pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federation was heavily criticized by the media and fans for
not rewarding the women financially, but Contiguglia thinks it will
all be forgotten soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the damaging effects are as severe as people
thing they are,'' he said. ``I don't think the success of the World
Cup or our group of women will be belittled at all. Once we beat
Norway, all will be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones' goal in the 88th minute helped the U.S. National
men's team to a 2-1 victory in Chile Saturday, giving the U.S. its
first win on South American soil since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team gathers in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., Saturday in
preparation for the CONCACAF Gold Cup. The U.S. opens the
tournament Feb. 12 against Haiti, then meets Peru Feb. 16 in Group
B play at the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, the reigning Gold Cup champion, is the favorite in the
12-team biannual tournament. The U.S. won the inaugural Gold Cup in
1991, but Mexico has won the last three.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Cup semifinals take place in San Diego Feb. 23, with
the final at the Los Angeles Coliseum on Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer has signed three UCLA players, and all three
will be up for grabs at the MLS draft in Florida Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Nick Rimando, who played at nearby Montclair High
School, is bypassing his senior season at UCLA after plenty of
solid work with the U-20 U.S. National team and an amazing 0.67
career goals against average, the best in Bruin history.
</P>
<P>
   Corona's Sasha Victorine was a first team NSCAA All-American and
Hermann Trophy finalist after leading UCLA to the Final Four. The
6-foot-2 midfield general netted eight game-winning goals in his
career, including five as a senior this past fall.
</P>
<P>
   Defender Steve Shak of Cerritos went from a walk-on to a
four-year starter at UCLA. He was part of a defense that only
allowed 18 goals the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   New York/New Jersey added its second 38-year-old defender by
acquiring former U.S. National team standout Thomas Dooley from
Columbus for Mike Duhaney.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley, who spent most of his career in Germany, will join
German standout Lothar Mathaeus, also 38, forming the most
experienced backline in Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars, who had the worst record last season, also
re-signed midfielder Tab Ramos, 33, giving new coach Octavio
Zambrano the leadership he needs to blend with young players.

WILLIAMS LIFTS SONICS, DROPS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Gary Payton and Vin Baker both kept throwing
the big haymakers.
</P>
<P>
   But Shammond Williams KO'd the Utah Jazz. The 6-foot-1 backup
guard even took out his coach before the Sonics exited the Delta
Center Tuesday night with a 104-96 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Williams punched the Sonics' win with an ill-advised 3-pointer
that barely touched the net as it fell. Ill-advised? The Sonics had
a fresh 24-second shot clock when Williams launched the bomb with
35.4 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Barry had rebounded a Payton miss with the Sonics clinging
to a 99-96 lead. Sonics coach Paul Westphal yelled for Williams to
hold the ball and let time expire. When the basket fell through the
net, Westphal dropped to the floor and lay on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't believe Shammond took that shot,'' Westphal
said, smiling. ``Then when it went in, I just rolled back and
enjoyed it. ... I couldn't believe Dean Smith (Williams' coach at
North Carolina) taught him to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not realize the shot clock had been reset. He never
heard Westphal's plea, and was stunned when he turned and saw
Westphal rolling on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering what happened,'' Williams said, chuckling.
``Coach knows I hit those shots all the time. I'm a clutch player.
I've been a clutch player since college.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is life for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been easy or smooth the past 11 days. These are
called the dog days of an NBA schedule. For the Sonics, it's been a
bit crazy.
</P>
<P>
   In beating the Jazz, the Sonics won for just the second time in
six games. The Sonics had lost three consecutive road games, beat
New Jersey at the buzzer and lost to Milwaukee on a last-second
shot during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were in front of Utah, 95-84, with 3:46 left in the
fourth quarter. That's when the Jazz slapped the Sonics with a 10-0
run. Utah got within a point with 2:13 left, and that evoked
another thrilling finish for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Baker ended the Sonics' scoring drought with a pair of free
throws. He also scored a clutch 12-foot, fall-away jumper before
Williams' basket.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who struggled offensively last Saturday against
Milwaukee, had been bullish inside all night. He finished with 33
points and five rebounds. The 6-foot-11 forward was only topped by
Payton, whose game-high 35 points were just one shy of his season
high. Payton made 6 of 9 3-pointers and also finished with five
rebounds and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really came out aggressive offensively,'' Baker said.
``Gary and I took it on our own to come out and be more
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time this season both Payton and Baker each
scored 30 or more points in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can score 20 points together, we're straight,'' Payton
said. ``You see how good we were two years ago. If we can do that
every night, we're a nice team.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly impressive from the start was Baker. He took the
ball strong to the basket and attacked Utah's double-team defense.
Baker, Payton and Williams combined to make 30 of 54 shots. The
rest of the team went 6-for-22.
</P>
<P>
   Baker made 13 of his 22 shots and collected 17 points in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best he's played since I've been coaching the
Sonics,'' Westphal said. ``He was quick and explosive with his
moves. He was impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was, well, Payton. After a slow start, he delivered on 11
of his 17 shots, including a couple of clutch baskets in the
fourth. Payton's 13 points in the second also sparked a run when
the Sonics wrested control.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics outscored the Jazz 30-18 in the second after falling
behind 28-19 after the opening quarter. Payton's 3-pointer midway
through the period put the Sonics ahead 39-38 _ their first lead of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   They never relinquished the lead and took a 75-71 advantage into
the final period. Defensively, the Sonics disrupted Utah's pick and
roll. The Jazz settled for jump shots. When the Sonics rebounded
Utah's misses they raced up the court for layups.
</P>
<P>
   Utah missed 14 of 19 shots in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started to play defense better,'' Westphal said. ``We
were doing the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the Sonics found other people who could score.
Baker kept the Sonics from falling apart early by making five of
his first six shots. One reason Westphal employed Williams was
because Ruben Patterson and Barry were misfiring.
</P>
<P>
   Williams didn't hesitate to deliver the final blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to be the man, or anything,'' Williams said.
``I had the ball in my hands and the only thing I know to do is
capitalize.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After threatening to unleash a few new wrinkles on
offense, the Clippers seem to be begging for a return to the
ironing board.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the lukewarm karma of a one-game winning streak, the
Clips were creased, 107-76, Tuesday by the Golden State Warriors
before 10,409 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just terrible basketball,'' said Clips coach Chris Ford, who
knows it when he sees it. ``I don't have a whole lot to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the numbers are talking.
</P>
<P>
   After whipping New Jersey last Saturday, Ford's team made just
34.6 percent of its mostly selfish field-goal tries, was
outrebounded, 46-36, and credited with a miserly 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who usually find themselves on the wrong side of
any scoreboard voodoo, thought they had the Warriors' number -
seven.
</P>
<P>
   That number can be found on the jersey of Clippers rookie Lamar
Odom, who had averaged 22.5 points, 12 rebounds, 7 assists and 4
blocks in his team's previous two games with the Warriors - both
Clips' victories. But Odom's crucial number in Game Three was two,
which represents his personal-foul total with 6:31 left to play in
the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
   His closing line was 2 points, 5 rebounds and 0 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby, ahem, led the Clippers with 20 points, while
Antawn Jamison (24 points, 12 rebounds), Donyell Marshall (19
points, 13 rebounds) and John Starks (20 points) were the heroes
for Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell in the layup line if guys come out with energy,''
said Clipper point guard Eric Murdock, who noticed an alarming lack
of interest during the preamble to Tuesday's tip-off. ``Everybody
from one to twelve.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom's quick retreat to the bench didn't seem to matter, because
the equal-opportunity offensive sets demonstrated in Monday's
practice failed to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their disinterest in winning a game with layoff
implications and draft-lottery ramifications, the Clippers (11-33)
led the Warriors (10-32) by a 23-21 count after one quarter. They
trailed, 48-42, at intermission, and their 9-point third quarter (4
of 22 from the field) provided a 73-51 deficit leading into the
final period.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Just when you thought Brian Skinner would become the
first athlete forced to retire due to a high ankle sprain, the
Clippers activated the second-year backup power forward Tuesday.
Skinner injured his left ankle during the Dec. 14 disaster vs. the
Lakers and has missed the last 21 games. In the 22 previous games,
the 6-foot-9, 250-pounder averaged 6.7 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.9
blocks. ``I'm not sure how much I can do,'' Skinner said before the
game with Golden State. ``I just want to help.'' Skinner played
just seven minutes and dented the stat sheet with one foul.

<P>
   NH-ASSESS (Manchester, N.H.) _ It was not a great night for the
dauphins of 2000, though worse for George W. Bush than for Al Gore,

   LAW-FIRMS (Undated) _ In a stark demonstration of the lure and
the power of the Internet, some of the nation's top law firms have
raised pay for associates by as much as 50 percent in the last two
weeks. The move is the most recent part of a chain reaction that
began just before New Year's Day in Silicon Valley, where firms

spreading to the white-shoe firms of New York. By David Leonhardt.

</P>
<P>
   HOT-CHOCOLATE (New York) _ I am willing to bet that very few
people have whiled away hours thinking about hot chocolate. Why
should anyone? When it's cold, as these past few weeks have been,
it's an easy pleaser. You either order it in a cafe, where it's hot
and chocolatey and the fluff of steamed milk allows you to justify
the $4. Or you go home, pull out some cocoa, sugar and milk and
have some steaming hot in a matter of minutes. Either alternative
is pretty good. But the truth is that most of these are the hot
chocolate equivalents of instant Folger's. If people only knew how
good hot chocolate can be, they might not put up with all the bad
versions around the city. By Amanda Hesser.

<P>
   (ART ADV: Photo has been sent to NYT photo clients.)
</P>
<P>
   CREPINETTE (New York) _ A critic's notebook: A fifth columnist
has infiltrated the menus of Manhattan. It has a deceptively
attractive name, so close to another French name that it passes
almost unnoticed by most diners. Once on the plate, it has already
undergone a metamorphosis, so its identity remains obscure. The
time has come to unmask it. The culprit is something called a
crepinette. It sounds as if it might be a little crepe. Once you
find out that the word is derived from crepine, or caul fat, you're
in way too deep to turn back. Yes, it's the membrane encasing a
pig's intestine. And no, it's neither more nor less than fat, the
most-feared word in the culinary vocabulary. But in the hands of
the right chef, and stuffed with the right ingredients, this
rock-bottom, low-peasant article, which comes to the kitchen in a
big folded heap like a used dishcloth, can rise to dizzying
heights. By William Grimes.

TAKING THE FUN OUT OF SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Allow me a moment here to stake a claim for the
return of sports to the toy department.
</P>
<P>
   It is desperately needed. Sports is gurgling for air in an
ever-rising tide of (set ital) issues (end) outside its usual and
preferred domain, issues without the slightest hope of resolution,
either.
</P>
<P>
   When I go to a ball game, I don't care if John Rocker is a
screwball. I only care if he has one.
</P>
<P>
   When I attend a football game, I should not care or wonder where
the players parked their car, or if one is hiding in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   When I read a story about NBA star Shawn Kemp, I don't want the
box score to tell me he is five-for-eight, as in five mothers of
eight kids.
</P>
<P>
   Political correctness shouldn't be an issue in sports, and
neither should political incorrectness. I don't want my field or
court littered with any particular point of view, because it is not
essential to the reason I'm there -- to watch a game -- and
completely and utterly unresolvable.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand this. Felons shouldn't be allowed on the
field. But everything short of that seems open to wild
interpretation now, and therefore more grist for the mill, aka
sports talk radio, which is already intolerable because everyone is
screaming his take and nine out of ten have nothing to do with the
Dodgers chances of winning more games than the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   The culture police that dwells on the Rockers in sports would
have you believe there's a criminal, idiot or zealot behind every
jump shot. The real crime is that we waste our time worrying about
what John Rocker says or thinks.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves pitcher offended just about every minority group
there is during a rant for Sports Illustrated, leading baseball
commissioner Bud Selig, strengthened by a viagra-like injection of
power from the owners, to smack him with a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Resolution potential? None. Rocker has the right to be as much
of a jerk as he wants to be. There is no law against being
repugnant or a xenophobe. And baseball has the right to suspend him
for conduct, because this isn't a strict first amendment issue,
which applies to congress passing laws infringing the freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Selig would be better off letting the law of the jungle -- the
privacy of the Braves locker room -- settle this issue, in large
part because its involvement calls into question its own spotty
history, like tolerance for teams named Indians and Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Just to show you how confusing things can be, consider the name
of Rocker's team. When James Gaffney purchased the Boston
Beaneaters in 1912, he essentially renamed the team after himself.
He was a Tammany Hall chieftain in New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Tammany Hall was a politically-active society named after a
benevolent Delaware Indian who greeted William Penn when he first
visited what would become Pennsylvania. So Tammany Hall, and by
extant the Braves, was named in honor of an American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by the mid 1800s, Tammany Hall's political machine
was considered the epitome of graft and corruption. Sort of like
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocker case recalls baseball's move to unseat Marge Schott
as owner of the Reds because of her own insensitivities, which
included a collection of Nazi memorabilia and her infamous ``Hitler
started out good'' comment.
</P>
<P>
   Marge wasn't good for baseball and Hitler wasn't good for
anybody, but there's some hypocrisy at work here. History books say
World War II turned once America joined the battle. It probably
doesn't mention that America's 1930's laissez-faire world policy
was an asset in Germany's march on Europe and the Holocaust, or
that the Nazi party held rallies in plain sight in New York and
other major cities, or that many American newspapers hailed the
revival of the German economy under Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure Marge was any more of a danger or blight on
baseball than Braves owner Ted Turner, who promotes his Goodwill
Games but likes to make Polish jokes and the Tomahawk Chop, or his
adversary, Dodgers owner Rupert Murdoch, who's in bed with the
Chinese government as he seeks world satellite TV domination.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that whether you take the high road or low
road, whether you're P.C. or P.I., it detracts from the spirit of
play.
</P>
<P>
   This includes rushing to any kind of judgment on Baltimore
linebacker Ray Lewis, and indicting the NFL as consequence. Let's
wait awhile before breaking out the O.J. Simpson jokes.
</P>
<P>
   It includes taking either side of the Pete Rose story. Baseball
couldn't make its case in court, and Pete doesn't act like someone
who deserves a day in court.
</P>
<P>
   And it includes Rams quarterback Kurt Warner's praising Jesus
when detailing his rise from Arena Bowl to Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There is no topic more personal than religion, and it annoys me
to the core whenever Joe Jockstrap stops to praise the lord for his
good fortune or suggests that God was on his side in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Good lord, if there is a lord, he's probably not watching the
game. Was Warner's God out of town on business when he was stocking
shelves instead of chucking footballs? When he completes a pass to
Az-Zahir Hakim, does God turn the ball over to Allah in mid-flight?
</P>
<P>
   Does Warner share the same God as Reggie White, who made some
very Rocker-ish comments a year ago? Is he thanking the same god as
the Dodgers' Shawn Green, who is Jewish?
</P>
<P>
   Sports has enough problems of its own, like owners moving
franchises and student-athletes skipping school, without dragging
other hangups of society to the playing field. To paraphrase Rodney
King, can't we just play nice?

BUSH'S CAMP SURPRISED AT SIZE OF LOSS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to rewrite 11th and 12th grafs, bgng Until the very, with
more detail.)  
(With NH-REPUBS) 
(jw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush and his advisers were
never under any illusions.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that Sen. John McCain, who had put his entire
candidacy on the line in this state, could win. They knew that they
might wind up spending much of Tuesday night finding graceful ways
to accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But what took them by nearly complete surprise _ and guaranteed
that their efforts over the next weeks would be seriously
re-evaluated _ was the double-digit walloping that came their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unpleasant'' was the terse description that one adviser used
for the feeling when the first voter polls came in. His tone of
voice suggested that the sensation was actually worse than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser said, bluntly: ``I think we were prepared for a
5-to-7 point loss. The dimensions of this are troubling. We worked
very hard. We wanted it really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their shock and disappointment, Bush's advisers
exhibited little worry that McCain's success here would be repeated
in the next big primary, in South Carolina on Feb. 19, or that the
Texas governor would ultimately lose the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, too, seemed upbeat and unbowed when he addressed hundreds
of supporters in a gymnasium at St. Anselm College here at about
8:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners, and this year is no exception,'' Bush said,
referring to the state's famously quirky, contrary voters and their
habit of creating humbling surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then made an oblique reference to a fact that his advisers
underlined more boldly: McCain had focused his presidential
campaign almost relentlessly on New Hampshire, spending twice as
many days here as Bush did, and had done so at the cost of building
organizations in states with contests to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to the Republican nomination and the White House is a
long road,'' Bush said. ``Mine will go through all 50 states, and I
intend it to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the very end, Bush and his advisers had held out hope for
a victory here, and they had pulled out all the stops to make it
happen. They marshaled about 4,000 volunteers to distribute
literature and make phone calls over the last two days. They
outspent McCain on advertising by at least $1 million. On Saturday,
they even brought in Bush's parents, former President Bush, who won
the New Hampshire primary in 1992 with 58 percent of the vote, and
the former first lady, Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So the results represented something of a wake-up call that
would shape the campaign ahead, especially in South Carolina, which
is where Bush hopes to stop McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign plans to focus greater attention on the fact
that Bush has been endorsed over McCain by 35 of the 55 Republicans
in the U.S. Senate. It is their way of answering McCain's implicit
charge, in speeches and commercials, that Bush is not ready to lead
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers also blamed themselves for not doing a better,
more aggressive job of debunking McCain's assertion that Bush's
large tax cut left too little money for Social Security, and they
said they would not make the same mistake in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   There were other strategies being considered and hatched as
well. Campaign officials in South Carolina foresaw a rally on
Thursday, in Sumter, S.C., to showcase Bush's extensive support
from veterans groups, a sort of counterpoint to McCain's military
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser in South Carolina, Warren Tompkins, also said the
nature of the debate in that state would be influenced by a
Republican electorate in which social or religious conservatives
made up 30 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therein lies a problem for McCain,'' Tompkins said. ``He has a
number of inconsistencies on abortion and some explaining to do. I
don't like to discuss strategy, but there are some obvious
differences, and I promise you the flops and the meanderings, we're
not going to let him get away with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign's biggest insurance policy is money. While
Bush's advisers said that both candidates had spent around $1.5
million on advertising in South Carolina to date, Bush has the
financial resources to outpace McCain on that front from now on.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, however, Bush outspent McCain, and for all the
talk about the unusual sway of independent voters here, voter polls
suggested that McCain also beat Bush among registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Bush's advisers and several Republican analysts said
that Bush should have engaged McCain more directly and earlier in
the contest, and predicted a more aggressive approach from now on.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the results in New Hampshire suggested that voters
were choosing between McCain and Bush largely on grounds of
personality, and that it was hard to diminish McCain's story of
heroism and his appeal along those lines.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Warfield, press secretary for Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign, said Bush and his advisers faced another
potentially more serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Bush campaign didn't see this coming, what does it do
to the candidate's confidence?'' Warfield said. ``Obviously, the
defeat is a big external problem. But it can be an even more
disturbing internal one if it shakes the confidence of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers insisted that it had not and said Bush spent the
hours after learning of the first polls at 2 p.m. reaching out to
reassure his advisers and supporters that he was as optimistic as
he had always been.

FULL-FIGURED HOUSTON WOMAN STRIKES POSE FOR BIJAN ADS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Camryn Manheim won an Emmy for best supporting
actress in the television series ``The Practice,'' she shouted,
``This is for all the fat girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, a Houston-area software engineer is striking another blow
for full-figured women everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   She calls herself Bella _ Italian for ``beautiful'' _ and she's
the centerpiece of a much-talked-about &UR;  &LR; advertising campaign for
the designer Bijan.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which feature the rotund model wearing only high heels
alongside the fully-clothed designer in colorful surroundings, are
meant as a homage to master painters Peter Paul Rubens, Henri
Matisse and Fernando Botero, Bijan said from his Beverly Hills
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, every woman is beautiful. Short, big or tall, it
doesn't make a difference,'' the designer said. ``To me, Bella is
as beautiful as all those ladies in the fashion magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-something Bella, who moved from Southern California to a
Houston suburb two months ago to take a job as a Web site
developer, was in Los Angeles with Bijan late last week for
interviews with ``Entertainment Tonight,'' Entertainment Weekly
magazine and an appearance on ``Roseanne.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the attention seemed overwhelming because she doesn't
think of herself as a model. She never planned to pursue a modeling
career and has no agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't seek modeling jobs. They've found me,'' said Bella,
who declined to reveal her real name for this article to protect
her privacy. ``The only modeling I've done is for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Bijan found Bella on the Internet, where she had appeared on the
February 1998 cover of Dimensions, a print and online magazine
aimed at large-sized women (www.pencomputing.com/dim). Although she
is not a professional model, Bella had sent some photographs of
herself to the magazine, which arranged a test shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a photographer's dream,'' said Sandie Sabo, fashion
editor of Dimensions magazine. ``She's got this cherubic face and
the most beautiful blue eyes, and her personality just bubbled. It
just came right out of the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Bella said she was floored when Cynthia Miller, art director for
Bijan, telephoned and invited her to meet with the designer and
discuss the ad campaign. After meeting with the Bijan team, Bella
said she had no qualms about appearing in the nude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept was to create a work of art. That's what
they did,'' said Bella, who refused to reveal her weight or dress
size. ``I'm very happy with the results. It's something like you
can see on the wall of a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   In two of the three ads, her plump backside is revealed. The
third ad shows her in bed, wearing only a Mona Lisa smile, while
Bijan perches on the edge with his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Bella's thighs and hips are large, but flawless in the ads. No
cellulite is noticeable, which led some to question how much the
images were airbrushed. Miller insisted it was ``less than what I
would normally do'' in Bijan ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing they do to Cindy Crawford or anyone, for
that matter,'' she said. ``Our intention was for it to look like a
painting of a great artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Bijan, who designs high-priced men's clothing, is best known for
producing colognes with Michael Jordon that are among the
best-selling men's fragrances in history. He is famous for
outrageous ads in which he is prominently featured.
</P>
<P>
   But there was barely a ripple of protest in 1995 over an ad that
showed a middle-aged Bo Derek flashing Bijan and his young son; or
the one two years earlier featuring a veiled Muslim woman with the
caption: ``Jammal, you might as well know the truth. ... I'm in
love with Bijan.''
</P>
<P>
   However, when Bijan tried to place the ads featuring Bella, they
were rejected by a number of magazines.
</P>
<P>
   One magazine representative told him the images were visually
jarring. Others would not give a reason, so he doesn't know if they
were put off by Bella's size or nudity. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't suggestive. There are far more magazines ads that
are much more suggestive,'' said art director Miller. ``The only
thing we could gather is it must have been (her) size.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Bijan called his friend Tina Brown, the editor of Talk
magazine, and faxed her the ads. She loved them and referred him to
publisher Ron Galotti, who agreed to run all three _ ``Motel,''
``Siesta'' and ``Bella'' _ in the February issue. All three images
can be seen on Bijan's Web site, www.bijan.com/bella.htm.
</P>
<P>
   As word traveled through the gossipy magazine world, Bijan
received calls from magazines that had previously rejected his ads,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that industry people talk,'' Bijan said. ``Every magazine
that said no was asking me (to reconsider). Some even wanted to
publish it for free. I was a little annoyed. I chose who I wanted
to go with.''
</P>
<P>
   The February issues of Vanity Fair, Esquire and Departures
magazines each carry one of the series, which mention Bijan's
menswear, perfume and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ads have appeared, the designer has been flooded with
letters and e-mail from people praising his decision to feature an
overweight woman. One woman promised to buy a Bijan fragrance,
``even though I'm allergic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think Americans realize inside those (big) sizes
is so much beauty there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabo, who also serves as a spokesperson for the National
Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, isn't surprised that the ads
have struck a chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see ads like that, and it's time,'' she said.
``People need to understand that there are a lot of different
standards of beauty and fashion. The idea that beauty comes in one
size is ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Bella, who is taking a wait-and-see-attitude about future
modeling plans, says she did the ads mainly to serve as a positive
role model for big women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all big women feel good about themselves, and I do,'' the
Alabama native said. ``God blessed me with great parents who didn't
tell me I couldn't do something because I was too large. I'm very
thankful because not all women can say that.''

BUTTERFLY VINE IS RICH IN FEATURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I recently got a butterfly vine and need
information on proper care.
</P>
<P>
   A: Butterfly vine (``Mascagnia macroptera'') is a root-hardy,
moderate grower in sun or partial sun and a fertile, well-draining
soil. Evergreen during a mild winter, it demands little but gives a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   The glossy foliage is bright green and a complementary backdrop
for the spring-to-frost yellow blooms. The flowers are followed by
papery, winged, chartreuse seed pods that mature to tan and
resemble butterflies. The mature length of the butterfly vine is 15
to 20 feet. It is an ideal choice for a lamppost, mailbox or
trellis near the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are pecan leaves good or bad as mulch?
</P>
<P>
   A: Pecan leaves contain tannic acid, and this fact has perhaps
prompted rumors that the leaves will damage growing plants and
should not be used as a mulch or in compost. When this acid reacts
with alkaline soil, a neutral organic salt, calcium tannate, is
formed. But this is not harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Another misconception is that pecan leaves add too much acid to
the soil. Pecans grow here in alkaline soil and, according to
experts, organic materials produced from alkaline growing
conditions are mainly alkaline. (When we grow plants that prefer a
more acidic soil, such as azaleas, we add sulfur to boost acidity.)
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners like shredded pecan leaves in a mulch because
they are fibrous and decompose slowly. But since our soils are
alkaline, I prefer to mix pecan leaves with other organic matter
and make a compost to use as mulch. I've composted pecan leaves
with other materials for a long time, spread the finished product
in flower beds and never experienced any problems.
</P>
<P>
   One key to a successful compost heap is to balance organic
materials high in carbon with those high in nitrogen. The greater
the variety of materials you add to your heap, of course, the more
nutrient-rich the compost. Brown materials, such as dead leaves,
break down more slowly. Green materials, such as grass clippings,
are nitrogen-rich, and heat up quickly. But if you want to maintain
a heap that's primarily leaves, you might add a little manure or
bloodmeal to balance the high carbon levels.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a church garden where we like to plant annuals on two
tiers around a statue. It is shaded in winter, and the annuals
don't bloom as well as in spring and fall. We would prefer plants
not more than 12 to 16 inches tall and with good color.
</P>
<P>
   What flowering shrub would you recommend for a spot along the
south side of the building that does not need a lot of water but
has good color?
</P>
<P>
   A: If pansies fail to flower due to insufficient light, you
might try primroses and sweet alyssum. I prefer ``Primula
obconica,'' which produces clusters of flat, round flowers on
12-inch stalks in shades of purple, lavender, blue, deep rose, pink
and white. This annual/short-lived perennial performs well in
bright shade from late fall to spring. The alyssum could trail over
the tiers and scent the garden. This low-growing, mounding annual
is covered with teeny all-white or white and lavender fragrant
blooms. It works well with the primroses.
</P>
<P>
   Edging lobelia is only 6 inches tall and will trail over a tier.
This cool-season annual comes in brilliant blues.
</P>
<P>
   Hummingbird bush, ``Hamelia patens,'' is a
drought-and-heat-tolerant, billowy shrub with reddish-orange
tubular flowers that attract hummingbirds. The foliage becomes
increasingly bronzy red from summer into fall. Its mature height is
about 5 feet, but given recent mild winters, unpruned shrubs are
huge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you please give some background and instructions on how
to plant and grow air potato vines?
</P>
<P>
   A: The air potato, ``Dioscorea bulbifera,'' native to the
tropics, is a fast-growing vine with large, spade-shaped leaves.
The vine gets its name from the potatolike tubers that appear under
the foliage in late summer and fall. I understand these potatoes
are eaten in some countries, but we enjoy the plant only as an
ornamental.
</P>
<P>
   The potatoes are harvested before frost and planted in April in
a sunny spot in organically enriched, well-draining soil. Vines
freeze back and reappear in warm weather.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ For most of her life, Carolyn Kocsis has been a
natural blonde. But the 31-year-old accountant found that people in
the business world didn't take her seriously.
</P>
<P>
   So she dyed her hair dark brown and noticed a world of
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men and women tend to listen to me with more depth than when I
was blond,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She now has more clients and more professional respect _ and she
attributes it to her darker hair color.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk in the door (as a blonde), people automatically
think you got the job because of the way you look or that you're
really stupid. You have to always fight for who you are,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it may no longer be true that blondes have more fun.
From Hollywood to Houston, a growing number of women have recently
traded their golden locks for a darker, more natural-looking color
and praise the results.
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow, who wore her blond hair in a swept-back look
reminiscent of Grace Kelly at last year's Academy Awards and is a
blonde in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' has found a measure of
anonymity with dark hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally have more fun being a brunette because nobody
recognizes me. I've been sneaking out all over the place,'' she
told Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny McCarthy, who rose to fame as a ditsy blonde on MTV's
``Singled Out'' and ``The Jenny McCarthy Show,'' went back to her
dark roots last fall and plans to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely more of a respect issue. People listen to what
I'm saying more,'' she told Houston Chronicle film writer Louis B.
Parks. ``(Being) blond just draws so much attention. It's striking;
it's more head-turning. People notice. (As a brunette), I don't get
so much attention, and I prefer that, to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Diaz, who is the blond owner of a professional football
team in ``Any Given Sunday'' and is barely recognizable as a
frizzy-headed brunette in ``Being John Malkovich,'' keeps switching
her hair color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm more accessible as a brunette,'' Diaz said in
Cosmopolitan magazine. ``When I first went brown, guys who would
never talk to me were suddenly talking to me. I was like, `God,
where have you been?' ... I think brunettes have more fun anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Diaz recently went blond again while filming the movie
version of the hit 1970s television series ``Charlie's Angels.''
You be the judge which hair color works best for her.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   For years, Houston actress Mary Hooper was a platinum blonde and
found that people treated her differently than they do now that she
has auburn hair.
</P>
<P>
   As a blonde, ``People think you're dumb. Men think you're
easy,'' Hooper said. ``But you do get a lot more attention. It just
depends on what kind of attention you want.''
</P>
<P>
   One time at a cast party, Hooper remarked about a review she had
read in The New York Times. A woman eyed her platinum-blond hair
and asked her incredulously, ``You read the New York Times?''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when Hooper was up for the title role in a local
production of ``Evita'' a couple of years ago, ``I was ready to
bleach that hair, honey, at the drop of a hat,'' she said. ``Look
at what blond did for (Evita Peron). She was basically a little
Hitler, but she was beautiful and blond, so it came off
differently.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Stephane Guidry of Houston is a natural blonde who immediately
noticed the difference in how she was treated when she dyed her
hair black a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, yes. You get a whole lot more respect,'' said the
34-year-old color specialist at Belle Ami salon.
</P>
<P>
   She believes darker hair color is also empowering. One of her
clients recently went from blond to a darker shade and ``her whole
attitude totally changed from the time she was in the chair,''
Guidry recalled. ``She felt strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosanna Ley has enjoyed being a redhead and a blonde in recent
years. But she recently returned to her natural light-brown color,
in part because she plans to begin swimming regularly as part of
her exercise program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color bleeds out really fast, and if I bleach it, it may turn
green on me (from the chlorine in the water),'' said Ley, a
20-year-old makeup artist at Tint salon in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Friends like Ley as a brunette because her hair color matches
her skin tone better and her eyes are not so washed-out looking,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown helps me blend in a little bit more,'' she added. ``I
don't stand out in a crowd like I used to as a blonde or a redhead,
which is kind of nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston hairstylist Michael Kemper understands why Hollywood
celebrities and some Houston women are going dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a blonde says you're the sexy bombshell. Being brunette
makes you the everyday ordinary girl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper credits the move toward darker hair to Madonna, who
darkened her blond hair, slicked it down, and parted it in the
middle about the time her album ``Ray of Light'' was released in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, no one had a center part. Now every girl in the
mall has that center part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kemper doesn't seem to think much of the trend toward darker
hair and gives it about a two-year lifespan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just wanting to see something different, but I
don't think that cafe society or the upper professional woman is
going to fall for the trend,'' he said. ``The reality is the Texas
blonde is always going to be blond.''
</P>
<P>
   While many Texas women still believe in the adage that it's best
for their hair to be ``fried, dyed and shoved to the side,'' a
growing number are choosing a darker, more natural look that
doesn't need hair spray and hot rollers, said Riaro Gomez of the
Riaro (plus sign here, delete parenthesis) Jon salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fresh look. I think people love change. We're all ready
to look different in some way,'' he said. ``And it's cheaper than a
face lift.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gomez warns that anyone thinking of going brunette should be
careful, because haircolor that is too dark can make a person look
tired and old.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put dark brown on your hair, it can be a disaster
because it will look flat, shoe-polish looking,'' he said. ``When
you see the movie stars, it's not really a solid color all over.
It's dimensional darker colors with many little shades woven into
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Clark, a hairstylist at Jon Barton salon, says some
people are going back to a natural color in part out of boredom
with their current hairstyle and also to simplify their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being blond is a lot of maintenance, and changing your
haircolor is a lot of work. It's a commitment of time and money,''
he said. ``People are changing their priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   California congresswoman Mary Bono snipped her pale locks and
went to her natural darker hair color for that reason. Working on
Capitol Hill and commuting home to Palm Springs convinced her that
she ``really didn't have time to be blond,'' she told The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, a number of women are choosing to even return to their
original shade of gray because they are tired of spending hours
having their hair colored.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Curry, a fortysomething accounting supervisor for a
Houston law firm, had colored her hair for years. But with the
encouragement of her stylist, Angela Taylor at Jon Barton salon,
she decided to return to her natural silver-gray to save time and
money.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor cut Curry's hair in a trendy short cut that has drawn
compliments from strangers, particularly from women, who tell her
they wish they had the courage to follow her lead.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said her husband was skeptical at first, equating gray or
silver hair with old age. But he came around after overhearing a
hip young clerk at Borders bookstore tell her, ``I think your hair
looks so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry doesn't miss the hours she spent at the salon having her
hair colored.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're doing it every five to six weeks, that's (a lot
of) money,'' she said. ``But the main thing is time. With a cute,
wash-and-wear cut, you can just blow and go.''
</P>

HOME IS WHERE THE ART IS 
 
HOUSTON FAMILY PAINTS A PICTURE OF HAPPINESS 

</HEADLINE>

By BARBARA KARKABI 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's late in the afternoon and there's a peaceful,
mellow feeling in artist Gary Hernandez's studio.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and his son Tiziano have just settled down at their
easels for a few hours of quiet father/son painting and sketching.
</P>
<P>
   In the peach-colored living room that also serves as a gallery,
Josefa Hernandez serves coffee surrounded by her husband's and
son's art.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the Gary J. Hernandez Gallery and School
of Fine Arts is a family affair. During art openings, Hernandez's
mother-in-law pours drinks and serves home-cooked food. While
father and son create their art and Gary teaches, Josefa, known to
all as Josie, holds it all together.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez admits he's a happy man. At 46, the son of blue-collar
workers, his struggles are finally behind him. He's an artist and a
teacher, living the dream he's had since he was a child growing up
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had the desire to draw,'' Hernandez said. ``My mom
gave me an eggshell pad and pencil when I was 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez dates his dreams to a second-grade school visit to the
Museum of Fine Arts in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally drawn into the paintings, but I didn't know how
to be an artist,'' Hernandez recalled. ``Everyone in my family
worked as laborers.''
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile for Hernandez to pull it together, but he finally
did, and he credits his mom for his determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a tough woman, and she taught me how to work,'' he
said. ``She would tell me, `Don't give up your dreams and optimism.
Go out and get what you want, don't wait for it to come
knocking.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment he has passed on to his son Tiziano, 25, named
after the Italian artist Titian, and to his students.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's students, several of whom have been with him since
the early '90s, say they love his low-key but meticulous teaching
method.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes a serious, methodical approach, but he doesn't teach
by humiliation,'' said Diane McManus, an attorney. ``He is very
kind. And he says, `Don't be afraid to paint and take chances.'''
</P>
<P>
   Equally important to many of the students is the welcoming
feeling of the Hernandez home. Both students and collectors become
part of their large, extended family and seem to enjoy the shared
camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are available year-round, Monday through Wednesday
evenings. During breaks, Josie Hernandez serves coffee and a
dessert on the lace-covered dining table. Students can take a
break, sip a cup of coffee and visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josie is such a gracious host to us and makes us feel so
welcome,'' said Diana Rodriguez, who works with the Houston Fire
Department. ``It's like getting away to a whole other world.''
</P>
<P>
   The intimate, friendly atmosphere is one that Gary and Josie
Hernandez enjoy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the corporate world, and we like this one better,''
said Gary Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   But it took him years to get there. In high school, he was
involved in art classes and encouraged by a teacher to attend
college.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after graduation, Hernandez married Josie, his
high-school sweetheart, got a job as a graphic artist at a local
sign company and began pulling his way up the corporate ladder.
</P>
<P>
   But he hung on to his dreams and kept drawing, through the
births of two sons, Gary Jr., 27, and Tiziano. When Tiziano was 2
weeks old, the family moved into the house where they still live,
in a blue-collar north Houston neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary has always had a studio, even if it was on the kitchen
table, which it was for years,'' Josie Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   His present studio, in the former attached garage, is a far cry
from the kitchen-table years, though he's still in the middle of
family life. Hernandez constructed a door to connect the living
room/gallery with his immaculate studio, lined with drawings by the
father/son team.
</P>
<P>
   The two have always worked well together, often side by side,
from the time Tiziano was a little boy. The only bone of contention
between them is their different tastes in music. While Dad prefers
the Gypsy Kings and the Buena Vista Social Club, his son is more
into Fugazi and Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '70s, Hernandez began taking classes at the Glassell
School of Art, studying with local artists such as Dick Wray. It
was then that he started working in oil and developed his
still-evolving style.
</P>
<P>
   He describes it as classical realism, with an emphasis on color,
figurative work and landscapes _ a style that defies the Hispanic
artist label.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another myth we are trying to dispel,'' Josie Hernandez
said. ``When people see Gary, they ask him: `Do you do murals?'
Well, not every Hispanic artist does murals.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Hernandez went on his own as a graphic
artist. But by 1986, he had decided to devote all his energies to
creating art.
</P>
<P>
   It was an exciting and scary decision for Josie and Gary. Their
sons were in Catholic schools and for a while they depended solely
on Josie's salary. His extended family had a hard time grasping the
concept of his working at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started doing art, my family thought I was home
watching TV,'' Gary Hernandez recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Then Josie came down with lupus, and Gary spent more than a year
caring for his ailing wife.
</P>
<P>
   But life gradually improved. Josie got better, though she was
told she needed to live a stress-free life and was put on
disability. That freed her to manage Gary's business affairs, while
he plunged full-force into the art world.
</P>
<P>
   At first he taught art in middle school, but ultimately he
decided to focus on adults, and joined the Art League of Houston.
For a number of years he taught evening classes and became the
group's first Hispanic president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know the art community because I had been by
myself for so long,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he began showing his watercolors and figurative
pieces to galleries. The reaction was mixed. While gallery owners
liked his figures, they told him that landscapes sold better.
</P>
<P>
   So Hernandez went back to the drawing board and did a series of
paintings of people and Houston skylines.
</P>
<P>
   These proved more popular with galleries, but Hernandez decided
to stay on his own. In 1993, he officially opened both the gallery
and the school.
</P>
<P>
   Josie and Gary say they love the personal touch and getting to
know collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Even more precious to Gary and Josie is the freedom they have.
Josie has moved out of the studio to her business office in the
house, where the walls are lined with paintings on layaway. And
Gary can paint whenever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work every day, and I have a routine,'' Gary Hernandez said.
``If I like what I'm doing I will work till 2, get up at 9 and
can't wait to back to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also given them time to travel. Since 1997, they have
visited England, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, among
other places, seeing museums, tourist spots and artists' homes. The
trips have inspired Hernandez to do a series of travel paintings
and reaffirmed his lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we visited Monet's home in France and Sorolla's in Spain,
I saw that a lot of artists did their business at home,'' Hernandez
said. ``I loved Monet's home _ pink with green shutters. He must
have had Hispanic blood. I came home saying: `I want to live with
color, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has painted the exterior of his once-gray home a
bright yellow. The living room and dining room went from gray to
peach, and he will next paint his kitchen yellow.
</P>
<P>
   These days Hernandez is working with his students on an exhibit
scheduled Feb. 26. Hernandez's paintings are moved into the studio
and the students' works, including Tiziano's, cover the living room
walls.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, he casually moved from one student to
another, talking about color, shape and form, handing out advice
and tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad offers courses that are so relaxed,'' Tiziano said.
``He's happy to help you, and there's nothing you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Tiziano, a recent graduate of the University of
Houston Downtown, sits in on the classes and draws or helps out.
Like his father, he's a talented figurative painter, but he's also
developed his own style _ classical realism with expressionist
figures and an Asian influence picked up during a semester spent in
China.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a third generation in the wings _ Gary Jr.'s
son, Andres, 2, who has his own easel.
</P>
<P>
   Ever changing his style, Gary Hernandez next plans to try his
hand at religious and narrative art. He's proud of his
accomplishments, which include paintings exhibited in New York and
Houston galleries and at the Contemporary Arts Museum. Recently,
one of his watercolors was used on the cover of Tony Diaz's book
``Latino Heretics.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes one day to have a painting in the Museum of Fine Arts
collection. That would make his life come full circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe then I would inspire someone, just like I was
inspired,'' he said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Sports' penalty markers
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This weekend, at the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra's ``pop goes
out to the ballgame,'' it was easy to feel warmly nostalgic about
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Bench donned a Mudville jersey and swung his bat as he
narrated Casey at the Bat. When not bouncing up and down on the
podium, looking for all the world like a musical Tigger, music
director Neal Gittleman swung his baton like an imaginary bat. The
Dayton Daily News' own Ritter Collett and WHIO's Larry Hansgen
narrated a hilarious play-by-play of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony,
complete with the conductor's banishment to the penalty box and an
injury in the bass section.
</P>
<P>
   Then we had that incredible Super Bowl on Sunday when Kevin
Dyson tried to stretch like Popeye to will his team into an
improbable last-second chance at victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to feel that sports was about striving, about having
fun, about aspiring to the best within ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Then Monday we came back to earth. John Rocker is suspended for
the crime of being a racist jerk, while a Baltimore Ravens player
is charged with murder in Atlanta. (What's next? Shall we call out
the National Guard every time the NFL is in town?)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there seems to be a greater uproar about Rocker's thought
crimes than about violent crimes by professional athletes. Since
when do we pay athletes for their opinions, anyway? Meanwhile,
players continue to play even when facing charges of assault,
domestic violence and even rape.
</P>
<P>
   It would be one thing if Rocker had a hand in hiring or
supervising players. As it is, the national brouhaha gives Rocker's
ugly opinions far more weight than they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that little matter of the First Amendment.
Rocker's racist, homophobic remarks are despicable, indefensible _
unless you are inclined to defend our right in a free society to
say what we think.
</P>
<P>
   While Rocker is ordered into sensitivity training, Michigan
State decided to continue recruiting football player Eric Knott,
even though he has been charged with raping a 13-year-old girl.
He's expected to sign with the school today.
</P>
<P>
   When Cleveland Browns offensive tackle Orlando Brown assaulted a
referee who accidentally hit him in the eye with a penalty marker,
some sports announcers fell all over themselves trying to defend
his behavior: ``Well, that must have hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, while playing for the Golden State Warriors,
Latrell Sprewell choked his coach, P.J. Carlesimo. Now, after being
forced to sit out a year, Sprewell is adored by fans, advertisers,
the media. Carlesimo, meanwhile, was released from his contract in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Had Sprewell mocked his coach's Italian roots, things might have
gone worse for him. In today's sports world, words are treated like
lethal weapons, while actual physical violence, it seems, will be
treated lightly unless you murder someone.
</P>
<P>
   Now Carolina Panther Rae Carruth stands accused of arranging the
murder of his pregnant girlfriend. NFL linebacker Ray Lewis is
charged with murder in two stabbing deaths that occurred hours
after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine another subcategory of multimillionaires with a
comparable record. These guys who have the world on a string; how
can they throw it all away? How can they imagine they'll get away
with it?
</P>
<P>
   It might have something to do with the funhouse-mirror world
that professional sports has become, a world in which overpaid
players are treated as demi-gods who can get away with anything.
</P>
<P>
   Anything, that is, except saying the wrong thing.

   Q: With all the bad winter weather recently, we're interested in
making the most of our fireplace. What kind of wood burns the
slowest and longest?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dry, well-seasoned hardwoods, such as oak, hickory and maple,
are recommended. Avoid softwoods, such as pine, because of their
high resin content, which creates increased levels of creosote.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was made a Kentucky Colonel several years ago, but I don't
know anything about the organization responsible for giving out the
honor. Do you have any information, or know of a source?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels is the
Louisville-based group involved in carrying on a tradition dating
to 1812, when Kentucky's first governor, Isaac Shelby, bestowed on
his son-in-law, Charles S. Todd, the title of a ``colonel'' on
Shelby's staff. Shelby later issued commissions to all who enlisted
in his regiment in the War of 1812, and later governors
commissioned colonels to act as their protective guard.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``Honorable Order'' were added in the early 1930s to
reflect the honorary status of members. Each incumbent governor of
the Commonwealth of Kentucky, upon assuming office, becomes the
commander-in-chief of the order, and issues commissions at the
discretion of his office to recommended recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The order is a charitable organization that charges no dues, but
encourages its members to contribute to a fund _ called the ``Good
Works Program'' _ which has developed into one of Kentucky's most
significant charitable efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Col. Linda Boone, National Headquarters, The
Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels, P.O. Box 20702, Louisville,
KY 40250-0702 (502-459-5352).
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many nuclear power plants are active in the United States
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Department of Energy's Web site reports that the United
States has 104 such plants.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the process for selecting candidates for the quiz
show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a complex system, as you might imagine. Potential
candidates start by calling a toll-free number (1-800-433-8321),
which is open only during contest hours and on specified dates.
Contest phone lines for taping dates in February will be open
through 2 a.m. on Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Players compete to become a contestant in three rounds. To enter
the first, they call the toll-free number and enter their birth
date and the last four digits of their Social Security number.
Players then are asked to answer three multipart, general-interest
questions. Each has multiple answers that must be placed in the
correct order, and within a specified time.
</P>
<P>
   Players who answer all three questions correctly are eligible
for a random drawing with other correct players for certain taping
dates. Semifinalists selected then compete in a telephone playoff
game. Those who answer all questions correctly are ranked on the
speed of their response, with the top 10 getting the opportunity to
appear on the program. Once there, finalists compete again to
become a main game contestant.

</P>
<P>
   Q: PBS just showed ``Feet of Flames,'' with Michael Flatley and
his ``Lord of the Dance'' troupe. It reminded me that he broke off
from ``Riverdance'' a few years ago. Can you refresh my memory
about that? I was totally entranced by the performance on TV.
</P>
<P>
   A: Flatley, the original star of the Irish dancing sensation
``Riverdance,'' left that production in October 1995 after a bitter
dispute with producers over such matters as creative control and
salary. He formed his own rival production, ``Lord of the Dance,''
which toured worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two companies, Flatley spent five years performing.
It was at that point when he decided to call it quits, saying he
needed a year off. Some people thought it was for good, and when he
starred in a new production, ``Feet of Flames,'' it was believed to
be a one-shot deal for the video you saw. That performance took
place before an audience of 25,000 at the Route of Kings in
London's Hyde Park.
</P>
<P>
   In October, however, Flatley announced at a publicity splash in
Satzvey, Germany, that the fastest feet in dance were coming back.
``I can't wait to dance,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feet of Flames'' will open March 3 in Erfurt, Germany. The
first 100 shows are set for Germany, Holland, Belgium, France,
Austria and Switzerland. After that, Flatley hopes to bring the
show to the United States, opening in New York's Madison Square
Garden in October or November. Nothing definite has been announced
about a U.S. schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When a meteorologist says ``the chance of rain this afternoon
is 40 percent,'' does it mean that 40 percent of the time during
the afternoon, it will be raining?
</P>
<P>
   A: It means there's a 40 percent chance that there will be some
precipitation somewhere in the forecast area sometime during the
afternoon. It doesn't mean that steady precipitation will fall over
the whole area during 40 percent of the time, or that 40 percent of
the area will have rain falling during the whole period.
</P>
<P>
   Statements of probability of precipitation are only an
approximation and cannot be considered precise, since they leave
open the questions of how much rain is meant by ``some'' rain, and
how large an area is meant when it refers to ``somewhere.''
Nevertheless, if the limitations are understood, the statement does
provide a useful general-purpose measure of the likelihood that
rain or snow will occur where you are during the period.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Census Bureau information ever made available to the
public for genealogical research? I'd like to see if I can obtain
some information about my ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   A: The records from 1930 to date are confidential and cannot be
checked for people other than yourself, said Bea Piddock of the
U.S. Census Bureau. However, records from the 1920 census and those
from earlier years are available through the National Archives, and
sometimes through the archives of the state where the person lived.
Such information also may be available on microfilm at a public
library of a large city.
</P>
<P>
   About that exception on records from 1930 to the present:
Piddock said it's possible for someone to check his or her own
records if, for example, that person doesn't have a birth
certificate. In that case, the Census Bureau can provide that
person a form to request information showing that person lived at a
certain address, and it was recorded on a certain date for a
specific census.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that actress Angelina Jolie won her third Golden Globe
award for ``Girl, Interrupted.'' She won previously for ``Gia.''
What was the other one?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was for her role as Cornelia Wallace in the 1997 HBO movie
``George Wallace.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been told that a glass of grape juice confers many of
the same health benefits that a glass of red wine provides. Can you
confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not so, said Chris Rosenbloom, a professor in the nutrition
department at Georgia State University and a spokeswoman for the
American Dietetic Association. Grape juice doesn't contain the
alcohol of the red wine, she explained, and the alcohol seems to
add a degree of protection against heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Grapes contain the powerful antioxidant resveratrol, which
``seems to be one of the things that gives red wine its protective
mechanisms against heart disease,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   If a person wants to drink grape juice instead of red wine for
whatever amount of antioxidants the grape juice might provide,
Rosenbloom said fruits and vegetables would be better because of
the calories _ about 120 per six-ounce serving, about three-fourths
of a cup _ in grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   The most richly colored fruits and vegetables, such as spinach,
greens, carrots and sweet potatoes, are the best source of
antioxidants
</P>
<P>
   Q: Maureen Reagan, daughter of former President Ronald Reagan,
has written an essay in Newsweek about her father's continuing
decline. I'd like to write to tell him how much I've admired him
through the years. Do you have the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Office of Ronald Reagan, 11000 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles,
CA 90024.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The other night at the dinner table we found ourselves
discussing the origin of the word ``cracker,'' once used as a term
for a Southerner. I've been told there are several possible
origins. Do you have any information to pass along?
</P>
<P>
   A: Indeed there are a number of theories, which have been handed
down over the years. Let's let ``Picturesque Expressions: A
Thematic Dictionary'' explain:
</P>
<P>
   This American slang expression arose during the 1700s to
describe the poor white farmers from the scrub pine territory of
the American South. One explanation attributes the term to the fact
that since the basic staple of these people was corn, they became
known as corn crackers, which subsequently was shortened to
crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation suggests that the expression alludes to
their practice of cracking enormous whips over their teams as they
drove produce to market.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the term was popularized by Chief Justice
Anthony Stokes of colonial Georgia when he publicly commented that
the Southern colonies were being overrun by crackers from western
North Carolina and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has it ever been revealed how much the Super Bowl rings cost
to produce?
</P>
<P>
   A: The cost is no secret. In fact, the information can be found
online at www.superbowl.com/atlanta/generalinfo.html.
</P>
<P>
   As it reports, the National Football League pays for up to 125
rings at $5,000 a ring, with possible adjustments for changes in
the cost of gold and diamonds. The Super Bowl ring goes to the
winning team (athletes, coaches and some other staff members). The
NFL also pays for 125 unspecified ``pieces of jewelry'' for the
losing team, which may not cost more than half the price set for
the Super Bowl winners' rings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a deadline when your employer must have mailed your
W-2?
</P>
<P>
   A: IRS regulations state that an employer must have the W-2
``available'' to employees by Jan. 31. Employers aren't required to
mail them, although most do, said IRS spokesman Eric Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   If the employee hasn't received the W-2 by Jan. 31, the IRS
recommends contacting the employer and going in person to the place
of business to pick up the form.
</P>
<P>
   If an employer refuses to provide it, Roberts said, the employee
should contact the IRS, which will send a letter ``to remind the
company of its responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   And there always is the possibility that an employer might have
gone out of business. That's one reason the IRS recommends saving
pay stubs, Roberts said, particularly the last one of the preceding
year. The stubs will help the IRS reconstruct the information
needed for tax-calculation purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At one time there was a break of two weeks between the AFC
and NFC championship games and the Super Bowl. This year it was
only a week. Is this a first?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. There have been several other occasions with only a
week's break, which always has prevented the Super Bowl from
spilling over into February.
</P>
<P>
   The last time was in 1994, when the two conference championship
games were played on Jan. 23, with Super Bowl XXVIII at the Georgia
Dome on Jan. 30. Before that, it happened in 1991, when the
conference championships were on Jan. 20, and Super Bowl XXV at
Tampa Stadium on Jan. 27; 1983, when the NFC championship was on
Jan. 22, AFC on Jan. 23, and Super Bowl XVII at the Rose Bowl on
Jan. 30. There was another one-week break back in 1970, when the
AFL and NFL championship games were on Jan. 4, and Super Bowl IV at
Tulane Stadium was on Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about how veterinarians and medical doctors treat
a silverback gorilla such as Atlanta's Willie B., who's been sick.
Perhaps antibiotics can be mixed with food if the primate is well
enough to eat, but what about tests and treatments that require
physical contact? It doesn't seem feasible to sedate a gorilla
every time its temperature is checked, but then it doesn't seem
feasible not to. Are gorillas responsive to the human flu vaccine,
and if so, was the group vaccinated this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most medications are indeed mixed with food, said Dr. Rita
McManamon, senior veterinarian at Zoo Atlanta, ``and we prefer to
do that whenever possible.'' As with humans, she added, medicines
sometimes must be injected.
</P>
<P>
   While some animals have been trained to allow certain medical
examination procedures (such as an injection or listening to the
heart with a stethescope), most of the time a wild animal must
receive general anesthesia to have most minor or major examination
and treatment procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that (human) flu vaccines may be effective with
great apes, so our gorillas and orangutans receive flu vaccinations
every year,'' McManamon added. But there's no guarantee that the
flu vaccine will prevent all influenza cases, just as in the case
of humans. Even so, it's hoped that the vaccination ``at least will
reduce the severity of the illness,'' if it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An item reporting that John Newland had died said his TV
series was ``Alcoa Presents.'' I remember that series, and that's
not what it was called. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ABC program was titled ``Alcoa Presents'' when it
originally was telecast between January 1959 and October 1961. The
subtitle of the show, which featured dramatized actual case
histories of supernatural phenomena and the occult, was ``One Step
Beyond.'' That became the title when the series went into
syndication in 1962, so that may be what you are remembering.

   Q: With all the bad winter weather recently, we're interested in
making the most of our fireplace. What kind of wood burns the
slowest and longest?
</P>
<P>

are recommended. Avoid softwoods, such as pine, because of their
high resin content, which creates increased levels of creosote.

physical contact? It doesn't seem feasible to sedate a gorilla
every time its temperature is checked, but then it doesn't seem
feasible not to. Are gorillas responsive to the human flu vaccine,
and if so, was the group vaccinated this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most medications are indeed mixed with food, said Dr. Rita
McManamon, senior veterinarian at Zoo Atlanta, ``and we prefer to
do that whenever possible.'' As with humans, she added, medicines
sometimes must be injected.
</P>
<P>
   While some animals have been trained to allow certain medical
examination procedures (such as an injection or listening to the
heart with a stethescope), most of the time a wild animal must
receive general anesthesia to have most minor or major examination
and treatment procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that (human) flu vaccines may be effective with
great apes, so our gorillas and orangutans receive flu vaccinations
every year,'' McManamon added. But there's no guarantee that the
flu vaccine will prevent all influenza cases, just as in the case
of humans. Even so, it's hoped that the vaccination ``at least will
reduce the severity of the illness,'' if it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An item reporting that John Newland had died said his TV
series was ``Alcoa Presents.'' I remember that series, and that's
not what it was called. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ABC program was titled ``Alcoa Presents'' when it
originally was telecast between January 1959 and October 1961. The
subtitle of the show, which featured dramatized actual case
histories of supernatural phenomena and the occult, was ``One Step
Beyond.'' That became the title when the series went into
syndication in 1962, so that may be what you are remembering.

embassies in New York and London when he developed a love of

job as chef at The Inn at Versailles and start producing fine

chocolate specialties as an edible red chocolate box, filled with

 &HT;    Timing, technique, equipment are everything when pruning
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, you! Yeah, you with that deadly weapon. Drop it.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless you know when _ and how _ to use it.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking .357s here but something far more lethal when
it comes to your plants _ ignorance, armed with maybe a deafening
chain saw or dull pair of loppers.
</P>
<P>
   The recent bad weather tugged many of us outdoors to repair
damage to trees and shrubs burdened by the weight of ice. For some
homeowners, the experience was just an appetizer. They can't wait,
as the first warm days in February roll around, to get outside and
do something _ anything _ to hurry spring along. Pruning makes us
feel like we're helping, and fortunately, now's the perfect time to
tackle many trees, shrubs and perennials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every year well-meaning gardeners pick up the shears at the
wrong time. Or use them on the wrong plant. Or make the wrong kind
of cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The keys to proper pruning are timing, technique and the right
equipment,'' said Bob Westerfield, a University of Georgia
Extension horticulturist.
</P>
<P>
   WHY PRUNE
</P>
<P>
   Before you get a grip on those things, understand why pruning is
important. Pruning isn't just a means for helping plants look good
and maintaining a desired size or shape. It also encourages
flowering and fruiting, eliminates diseased or damaged wood, and
promotes overall healthy, vigorous growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you need to know what happens to a plant when you prune
it,'' said Tom Harvey, grounds supervisor at the Atlanta Botanical
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Hormones determine the plant's growth, and the tip bud, or
highest bud on a shoot, produces two of them. One hormone
encourages the shoot to grow vertically; the other stops dormant
buds below the tip from producing competing shoots. Cutting off the
tip bud stimulates the dormant buds to sprout those new shoots, so
where you cut is important.
</P>
<P>
   In general, avoid pruning in late fall and early winter when
wounds could remain open until spring, inviting moisture that can
lead to disease. Instead, most pruning should wait until late
winter, just before buds awaken from dormancy.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO PRUNE
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb on timing is to prune summer-flowering plants,
such as crape myrtles and most hydrangeas _ anything that blooms on
new growth _ in January through March before that growth emerges.
Spring-flowering plants, such as forsythia, azaleas and dogwood _
ones that bloom on old wood where buds were set the previous summer
_ should not be pruned until after they bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any plant, you need to know when it blooms so that you
don't sacrifice the blossoms,'' Harvey said. ``If you prune it at
the wrong time, you won't kill the plant but inhibit the blooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Some woody perennials, such as lantana and salvia, have hollow
stems. Wait until late March, when the threat of a late freeze has
passed, before pruning them because moisture can get into the stems
and freeze or attract bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrangeas are less clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   Species such as H. paniculata, the peegee hydrangeas, and H.
arborescens, such as `Annabelle', bloom on new growth, so they
should be pruned in late winter, said Penny McHenry, an Atlanta
hydrangea expert. In late March, she cuts her Annabelles back to
about 8 inches from the ground and the center stems of her peegees
more severely; H. quercifolia, our native oakleaf hydrangea,
require no pruning.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions vary, however, on pruning H. macrophylla, the mophead
and lacecap hydrangeas. McHenry recommends pruning three or four of
the oldest canes on each plant to the ground in late March to let
air and sunlight inside the shrub. She cuts the remaining stems
back to just above where the first green growth is visible.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO PRUNE
</P>
<P>
   One of several pruning techniques will get the job done,
depending on the goal. Pruning to remove dead flowers, or
deadheading, not only improves the appearance of plants but
stimulates new blossoms. Selectively removing buds from a plant
promotes flowering and fruiting in others, which benefit from the
extra nutrients. Sometimes, cutting a shrub to the ground, or
renewal pruning, is the only answer for giving an overgrown,
diseased plant a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   But most pruning, Harvey said, involves one of only two basic
cuts _ heading and thinning.
</P>
<P>
   Heading, or shearing, a tree or shrub simply selectively removes
the outer growing points, thickening the plant into the desired
size and shape, such as a hedge.
</P>
<P>
   Thinning, on the other hand, is the more useful cut, especially
for trees, because the growth is removed at its origin, typically
where a branch emerges from the trunk or the center of the plant.
Selectively removing shoots from the plant's interior allows light
and air to penetrate it, producing a fuller plant and helping
prevent disease and insects. ``The plant also looks more natural
than the meatballs and lollipops you get with heading,'' Harvey
said.
</P>
<P>
   All cuts should be made at a slant, just above the bud, so that
water rolls off the wound.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO USE
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta Botanical Garden, where he teaches classes on
pruning, Harvey uses three tools _ hand pruners, loppers and a
pruning saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any job larger is probably best left to an arborist,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hand pruners are best for heading and thinning stems up to about
1 1/2 inches in diameter, or finger size. Loppers are ideal for
selective pruning of larger branches and canes (1 1/2 inches) in
hard-to-reach areas, such as the interior of a shrub. Saws are used
to cut branches more than 2 inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey recommends investing in tools that will last, maintaining
them with frequent sharpening and proper storage. Expect to pay
about $40 to $50 for quality hand pruners, $50 to $60 for loppers
and $15 to $30 for pruning saws.
</P>
<P>
   What to Prune Now
</P>
<P>
   To remember when to prune plants, know when they bloom.
Typically, trees, shrubs and perennials that bloom in summer on new
growth should be pruned in January through March before that growth
begins. They include:
</P>
<P>
   Beautyberry, Chaste tree (Vitex), Cranberrybush viburnum, Crape
myrtle, Floribunda roses, Fragrant tea olive, Glossy abelia,
Goldenrain tree, Grandiflora roses, Hydrangeas(peegee,
arborescens), Japanese barberry, Japanese spirea, Lantana, Mimosa,
Miscanthus grass, Nandina, Rose of Sharon, Russian sage, Salvia,
Sourwood, Sweetshrub
</P>
<P>
   What to Prune After Flowering
</P>
<P>
   Trees, shrubs and perennials that bloom in spring on old wood
(their buds were set the previous summer) should be pruned by late
summer _ but not until after they bloom. They include: Azalea,
Beautybush, Bradford pear, Bridalwreath spirea, Clematis, Climbing
roses, Crabapple, Deutzia, Dogwood, Doublefile viburnum, Flowering
almond, Flowering cherry, Flowering quince, Forsythia, Japanese
kerria, Japanese pieris, Lilac, Mock orange, Pearlbush, Pyracantha,
Redbud, Saucer magnolia, Shrub honeysuckle, Star magnolia, Thunberg
spirea, Vanhoutte spirea, Weigela, Winter daphne, Winterhazel,
Wisteria

   KIDNEY-TRANSPLANT (San Francisco) _ Last year in the United
States, kidney transplants gave 12,000 critically ill people a
chance at life. A tiny percentage of these involved a group of

   ABORTION-RIGHTS (Schenectady, N.Y.) _ Author John Irving never
meant his 1985 coming-of-age story, ``Cider House Rules,'' to be a
morality play on the merits of abortion rights. That the story has
aroused such questions, as it did at a recent discussion at Union
College, shows how ubiquitous such passions are, and how near the
surface. By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN.

   FLEXIBLE-BODIES (San Antonio) _ Stretching is a lot like
flossing: You need to do it. You know you should do it. It's just
so god-awful, mind-numbingly boring to do it. Alas, if fitness
doctors and gym gurus didn't tell you to stretch, your aching bones
and sore muscles would remind you about it. And that could mean
painful sprains or muscle tears, especially as the body ages. By

In the peach-colored living room that also serves as a gallery

WAGONER TAKES GENERAL MOTORS HELM FROM SMITH 
</HEADLINE>
 PM-GM-APPOINT-NYT  (gm) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The General Motors Corp. on Wednesday promoted G.
Richard Wagoner Jr., its president and chief operating officer, to
chief executive. John F. Smith Jr. relinquished that job but will
stay on indefinitely as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner, who is 46, will assume the CEO post on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Harry J. Pearce, the company's vice chairman, will remain in
that position, raising the possibility that he might still be named
one day to succeed Smith as GM chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to elevate Wagoner to chief executive came at GM's
regularly scheduled board of directors meeting on Tuesday and news
of the succession was quickly leaked. The official word came
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick's being elected chief executive officer is not only a
reward for what he's accomplished, but is a vote of confidence that
he can take GM to even greater heights in terms of products,
services and shareholder value,'' Smith said a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner is a 23-year veteran of GM. His previous jobs with the
automobile-maker have included chief financial officer, president
of North American automotive operations, and president.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 61, has been president and CEO since 1992 and added the
job of chairman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Wagoner's promotion came a day after GM said
it would distribute about half the value of its Hughes Electronics
stake in a complex deal that would let GM's shareholders swap some
stock tax-free for the Hughes tracking stock. GM shares shot up
nearly 6 percent in response to the deal; analysts said the
automaker had met investor demands that it unlock some of the
Hughes unit's value.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is 61, has run the company since the directors
installed him in a boardroom coup in November 1992. Board members
have said they are happy with his tenure, during which GM has
turned around its money-losing operations and improved in many
areas. But Smith has been eager to retire.
</P>
<P>
   By splitting the chairman and chief executive jobs, the board
has signaled that Pearce, who is 57 and recovering from leukemia,
was not considered well enough for it. The move may also signal
that Wagoner, who turns 47 next week, is not considered ready for
it, a concern voiced by many on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   A GM spokesman, Steven J. Harris, refused to comment on the
matter Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes deal comes as technology and communications stocks
have boomed and auto stocks have become wallflowers, leaving GM and
others stuck with almost embarrassingly low price-to-earnings
multiples. Hughes, on the other hand, has been a highflier, losing
money even as it wins new customers for its DirecTV subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic that the company has finally taken some
initiative here to unlock some of the value of Hughes,'' said David
Bradley, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities. He said there was
``a mild element of disappointment'' that GM did not distribute
more of Hughes, a move that could come next year. ``This is one
step along the road and there are other steps to come.''
</P>
<P>
   GM owns all the assets of Hughes Electronics, controls the
company, and says it intends to use Hughes technology to bring GM
cars into the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   But through the tracking stock, GM has distributed to investors
an interest in the Hughes earnings streams. Wall Street expects
Hughes, like many technology stocks, to lose money this year as it
recruits customers it expects to keep in future profitable years.
By contrast, GM earned a record profit of $6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction would cut the GM stake in Hughes from 68 percent
to 35 percent by midyear, when it is expected to be completed. The
deal has two main components.
</P>
<P>
   First, GM would use $8 billion of its Hughes stake to pay for
what amounts to a huge stock buyback. In it, current owners of GM
stock could swap their shares for shares of the Hughes tracking
stock at a ratio yet to be determined. GM also would contribute $7
billion of its Hughes stake to the GM pension and benefits plans.
The two moves would reduce GM's stake in Hughes to roughly $18
billion.
</P>
<P>
   A big lift to per-share earnings will come from the reduction of
$8 billion in outstanding GM shares. GM has already bought back $9
billion of its stock, amounting to 18 percent of the total, since
embarking on a repurchase program in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   GM now contributes about $700 million in pretax income to its
pension and benefits obligations that the transactions would
finance all at once. GM's annual earnings should rise by that
amount.

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 c.2000 La Stampa  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   I recently gave a live interview to Radio Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Callers one after another asked the same questions: What's
happening? What kind of person is Vladimir Putin? Has Russia turned
to some kind of ``hereditary autocracy,'' or is there still a
chance to restart the democratic process? How come everything has
been decided for us? Will Putin face any serious challengers in the
March 26 elections?
</P>
<P>
   It persuaded me that the people need a democratic option; they
are in a quandary. They are being asked to support Putin even
though he is a blank slate in terms of his social and economic
views.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's departure _ that is, his abrupt resignation on New
Year's Eve _ was not quite voluntary. One could say it was a
necessary step in the endeavor to ``hand over power to a reliable
man.''
</P>
<P>
   It was up to Yeltsin, of course, to take the final decision. But
his Kremlin entourage _ the bunch of relatives, political
associates, oligarchs and other hangers-on _ was pressuring him to
step down before the end of the year. They wanted to ride the wave
of Putin's popularity in hopes of perpetuating their own
opportunities for enrichment and power. Thus, the existence of
Acting President Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I support Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime
minister, for president. I believe that now and for the next four
years he would be the best choice for Russia _ not Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has tremendous experience and proven ability. After
replacing Sergei Kiriyenko in September '98, with the economy in
drastic disarray, he governed firmly and democratically. Even then,
Primakov was able to unite and lead the people for the sake of the
national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I believe that a party of Social Democrats would
coalesce around Primakov. It would have grassroots appeal, growing
over time mostly from Russia's regions, which still keep the
country going. This party could become a serious political
contender by the time Russia holds its next parliamentary and
presidential elections four years from now.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of Yeltsin's policies is truly disastrous. They
have condemned 80 percent of the Russian people to life at the edge
of poverty. Russia has been humiliated and corrupted while its
courts are powerless. The industrial base that took decades to
build, as well as our education and health-care systems, are
decimated.
</P>
<P>
   It was conspicuous that Putin's first step was to pardon
Yeltsin. He issued a decree on ``guarantees'' to the former
president that is essentially unconstitutional. It grants Yeltsin
immunity from criminal or administrative responsibility and even
from being interrogated in the course of any investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that we were returning to the times of
Soviet-style uncontested elections. During Yeltsin's
administration, and now Putin's too, decisions are being made by a
small group of power-hungry individuals for whom ``anything goes.''
Putin's promoters are looking for a ``blitzkrieg'' presidential
election campaign, with no time for anyone to seriously explain or
discuss the issues crucial to the country's future.
</P>
<P>
   A long, rambling article Putin published weeks ago, ``Russia on
the Threshold of a New Millennium,'' does little to explain his
views. It reads more like an eclectic hodgepodge of slogans and
bromides than a concrete program of action. Actually, Grigory
Yavlinsky, one of the West's favorite liberal reformers, was right
to call today's Kremlin with its new leader a ``black box.''
</P>
<P>
   To be blunt: Will Putin be able to sever the umbilical cord that
ties him to people like the media magnate Boris Berezovsky and
others whose power amounts to a virtual stranglehold over the
Russian political process?
</P>
<P>
   According to the bosses of the Unity Party, which was hastily
knocked together to drum up support for Putin, their candidate is a
shoo-in. No one, including Putin, however, should expect automatic
support or routine praise.
</P>
<P>
   The people already sense they are being deprived of any
influence on the course of events, of a chance to decide the
country's future. But Russia cannot succeed unless we give politics
back to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Surely it must be obvious to all that a lack of competition in
the political arena makes no sense in modern society; moreover, it
is a dangerous illusion. It is folly for Putin's allies to be
trumpeting up their mood of triumph, creating a sense of
all-but-universal approval.

<P>
   We are still far from a genuinely democratic system, but I agree
with those _ including Putin! _ who say that Russia will not return
to totalitarianism. Nor will there be a return to confrontation
with the West, despite the fact that the leading Western nations
have not yet matched their positive rhetoric with a proper respect
for Russia's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is elected in March, Russia's new president will offer
no ``free gifts'' to anyone. I am sure that Russia will be ready
for, and serious about, cooperating in good faith with all nations.
</P>
<P>
   Our partners need to understand that the time of Russia's
foreign-policy impotence is becoming a thing of the past. Frankly,
we have so far seen more understanding of this from the East than
from the West. Russia, like any country, has its national interests
with which others have to reckon.
</P>
<P>
   The most intelligent and responsible candidate _ and to my mind,
that is Primakov _ will heed what those interests are and what the
people of Russia expect of him.

<P>
   I recently gave a live interview to Radio Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Callers one after another asked the same questions: What's
happening? What kind of person is Vladimir Putin? Has Russia turned
to some kind of ``hereditary autocracy,'' or is there still a
chance to restart the democratic process? How come everything has
been decided for us? Will Putin face any serious challengers in the
March 26 elections?
</P>
<P>
   It persuaded me that the people need a democratic option; they
are in a quandary. They are being asked to support Putin even
though he is a blank slate in terms of his social and economic
views.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's departure _ that is, his abrupt resignation on New
Year's Eve _ was not quite voluntary. One could say it was a
necessary step in the endeavor to ``hand over power to a reliable
man.''
</P>
<P>
   It was up to Yeltsin, of course, to take the final decision. But
his Kremlin entourage _ the bunch of relatives, political
associates, oligarchs and other hangers-on _ was pressuring him to
step down before the end of the year. They wanted to ride the wave
of Putin's popularity in hopes of perpetuating their own
opportunities for enrichment and power. Thus, the existence of
Acting President Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I support Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime
minister, for president. I believe that now and for the next four
years he would be the best choice for Russia _ not Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has tremendous experience and proven ability. After
replacing Sergei Kiriyenko in September '98, with the economy in
drastic disarray, he governed firmly and democratically. Even then,
Primakov was able to unite and lead the people for the sake of the
national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I believe that a party of Social Democrats would
coalesce around Primakov. It would have grassroots appeal, growing
over time mostly from Russia's regions, which still keep the
country going. This party could become a serious political
contender by the time Russia holds its next parliamentary and
presidential elections four years from now.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of Yeltsin's policies is truly disastrous. They
have condemned 80 percent of the Russian people to life at the edge
of poverty. Russia has been humiliated and corrupted while its
courts are powerless. The industrial base that took decades to
build, as well as our education and health-care systems, are
decimated.
</P>
<P>
   It was conspicuous that Putin's first step was to pardon
Yeltsin. He issued a decree on ``guarantees'' to the former
president that is essentially unconstitutional. It grants Yeltsin
immunity from criminal or administrative responsibility and even
from being interrogated in the course of any investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that we were returning to the times of
Soviet-style uncontested elections. During Yeltsin's
administration, and now Putin's too, decisions are being made by a
small group of power-hungry individuals for whom ``anything goes.''
Putin's promoters are looking for a ``blitzkrieg'' presidential
election campaign, with no time for anyone to seriously explain or
discuss the issues crucial to the country's future.
</P>
<P>
   A long, rambling article Putin published weeks ago, ``Russia on
the Threshold of a New Millennium,'' does little to explain his
views. It reads more like an eclectic hodgepodge of slogans and
bromides than a concrete program of action. Actually, Grigory
Yavlinsky, one of the West's favorite liberal reformers, was right
to call today's Kremlin with its new leader a ``black box.''
</P>
<P>
   To be blunt: Will Putin be able to sever the umbilical cord that
ties him to people like the media magnate Boris Berezovsky and
others whose power amounts to a virtual stranglehold over the
Russian political process?
</P>
<P>
   According to the bosses of the Unity Party, which was hastily
knocked together to drum up support for Putin, their candidate is a
shoo-in. No one, including Putin, however, should expect automatic
support or routine praise.
</P>
<P>
   The people already sense they are being deprived of any
influence on the course of events, of a chance to decide the
country's future. But Russia cannot succeed unless we give politics
back to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Surely it must be obvious to all that a lack of competition in
the political arena makes no sense in modern society; moreover, it
is a dangerous illusion. It is folly for Putin's allies to be
trumpeting up their mood of triumph, creating a sense of
all-but-universal approval.
</P>
<P>
   We are still far from a genuinely democratic system, but I agree
with those _ including Putin! _ who say that Russia will not return
to totalitarianism. Nor will there be a return to confrontation
with the West, despite the fact that the leading Western nations
have not yet matched their positive rhetoric with a proper respect
for Russia's interests.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ First of all, I'd like to thank the Lord for
giving us a great Super Bowl. I couldn't have done it without Him.
</P>
<P>
   No, my chili wouldn't have been so good if it weren't for the
Lord, who gave us beef and chipotle peppers. The Budweiser wouldn't
have been so cold if it weren't for the Lord, who gave us
refrigeration, both natural and artificial.
</P>
<P>
   The game wouldn't have been any good at all without the Lord
helping Rams quarterback Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't I thank the Lord for helping me get through a
Super Bowl so well? Is that out of bounds? That's what Warner and
his wife did at the end of the game when the microphones were stuck
in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Does God value football over chili? No one can presume to guess,
but not any God I care to worship.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Warners thanked the Lord, as if He had nothing
better to do than help a quarterback make it from arena football to
the NFL and then win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I find all this God stuff in sports a little
embarrassing. God probably would too, if He were watching. After
all, He's supposed to work in mysterious ways.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing He needs is a bunch of American jocks thanking
Him for helping them win a football game _ and on a Sunday, the
Christian Sabbath, nowadays the Super Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it embarrassing, it's blasphemous. God isn't some
dot-com who needs a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl to get brand
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   If some football player wants to thank God for helping him win a
championship, we can forgive him for missing the fact that God
didn't answer the prayers of players on the other team.
</P>
<P>
   Football is a tough game, and later it all can be worked out in
a post-game prayer circle with players from both the winning and
losing teams.
</P>
<P>
   But when politicians start claiming they have a special
relationship with God, then it's time to get nervous.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to get nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The likely Republican nominee for president, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, once was asked to name his favorite philosopher. He said,
``Christ, because he changed my heart.'' The worst part of this
wasn't that Bush was wrapping himself in Christ's robes. The worst
part was that he seemed to be dropping Christ's name as an easy way
out of a gotcha question.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't want to get nailed on a philosophy quiz after his
poor performance on a world leaders quiz.
</P>
<P>
   Christ is the answer. And Christ is definitely an easier answer
to the favorite-philosopher question than Kant, Locke or
Wittgenstein. The last thing Bush wants to do is try to explain the
categorical imperative to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Like an opposing quarterback, Vice President Al Gore has claimed
Christ for his own, too. He has said he answers important questions
with the initials, ``W.W.J.D.,'' which stand for ``What would Jesus
do?'' What would Jesus do, indeed? He said to render unto Caesar,
but would he render the use of his name to those who would be the
American Caesar? A quarterback is one thing, but a president
carries a different kind of ``football,'' the nickname for the
briefcase with the nuclear button in it. Christ and God might not
want their names taken in vain by a man seeking such power.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments over the separation of church and state get very
personal very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   How can the government keep my kids from praying? Why can't I
get vouchers to send my kids to parochial school? Who are you to
push your religion down my throat? Those are the kinds of questions
we face as two Southern Christians race for the White House, both
using the name of Jesus as one of the tools to get there.
</P>
<P>
   My response is personal, too. Who are they to push my religion
down my throat? My relationship with God is private. My
interpretations of Christ's teachings are not subject to veto by a
president or any other politician.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to know the details of their relationship with God
any more than I want to know the details of their relationship with
their wives or what they inhaled in college.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this attitude comes from the fact that I grew up in
Rhode Island, which nonconformist Roger Williams founded as a
democratic haven from religious and political persecution by the
Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
</P>
<P>
   As the old joke has it, our Pilgrim forefathers fled religious
persecution in England so they could do some persecuting
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   These days many conservative Christians claim they're victims of
persecution because their kids can't say prayers in school or
before sporting events. They say there is a media conspiracy
because cameras cut away from athletes' prayer circles after
football games.
</P>
<P>
   If that's religious persecution, Lord help us all if the true
believers take power.

&HT;     DIALLO CASE HELPS OPEN COURT DOORS A CRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Cameras are again permitted in (some) New York
courts because a volatile criminal case forced the issue into
public consciousness in ways several studies undertaken in recent
years failed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Widely publicized civil disobedience protests over the gunning
down of a West African immigrant, Amadou Diallo, by four New York
City police officers created impassioned public concern. So much so
that a state appeals court moved the trial out of the Bronx to
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo camp was infuriated by the move of the trial 150
miles up the Hudson River, where minorities constitute a fraction
of their number in the Bronx, and about the impact on the jury's
likely composition. A legal motion by Court TV to telecast the
trial was unexpectedly granted by Justice Joseph Teresi, who is now
in charge of the case in state Supreme Court in Albany. When the
case was still in Bronx County Court, another judge had turned down
another media company's request for entry of its cameras.
</P>
<P>
   What changed, apparently, was a growing consensus among the
powers that be that the presence of a camera in court could defuse
potential disruptions and allay suspicions by the Diallo camp about
what they regarded as an attempt to manipulate the justice system.
As seating in the courtroom was minimal, the camera would enable
everyone _ in New York or wherever _ to see for themselves how the
trial would be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   It was to address these concerns that Teresi issued his
groundbreaking decision, saying that a categorical state ban
against cameras in the courts, in place since 1952, was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   He reasoned that the First Amendment guaranteed the public and
the press admittance to criminal trials, except in rare
circumstances. In the past, that has meant reporters using pen and
notebook, and sketch artists. Teresi enlarged that right to include
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The customary opponents of cameras in the courts stood mute in
the face of this opinion. Apparently they were constrained from
invoking their usual objections by the Diallo case's political
dimensions, including the race of the accused and the victim.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest opposition to cameras in the courts in recent years
found its home in the Democrat-controlled State Assembly. Speaker
Sheldon Silver was not moved by the reports of several commissions
that after long examination found that contrary to the assertion of
many defense lawyers, cameras did not result in undermining a
defendant's right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   His own experience with court cameras convinced Silver that they
could distort trials because judge, prosecutor and defense attorney
would posture for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Teresi decision, Silver's spokeswoman
said he could support cameras in courts if rules were spelled out
to protect, for example, rape victims from being filmed or
photographed.
</P>
<P>
   That is a straw man if ever there was one. Each commission
stipulated exactly those kinds of restrictions, including
forbidding cameras to show the jury, bench conferences or
undercover police witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   I think I need to confess at this juncture that I was asked to
serve on the first three commissions, each of which endorsed
cameras in courts. I was not on the fourth and last, not only
because I had wearied of going over the same ground again, but
because the legislation setting up the fourth commission
specifically stated that no one who had served before was eligible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a 10-year experiment of cameras in the courts was
allowed to lapse; the Legislature had more pressing business and
the public, as well as the legislative leadership and the governor,
were at best indifferent if not hostile to the notion. That made
New York one of only three states in the union not to have some
provision for allowing cameras in their courts.
</P>
<P>
   Now Governor George Pataki, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno
and even Silver say they will seek an appropriate law, which is
necessary to bring coherence to cameras in New York's courts.
Teresi's decision is not binding on other courts, but so far one
has permitted cameras and another one refused to.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional guarantees of fair trial are based on the premise
that they would be public. The Founders were well aware of the
history of secret trials, in which the might of the state could
overpower the accused. The people of New York will be immensely
better off for the well-reasoned and courageous Teresi decision.
Justice is best served when it can stand up to public scrutiny, and
in our day that includes the camera.

 &HT;    ALBRIGHT TAKES SMALL STEPS TO STRENGTHEN US-RUSSIAN RELATIONS
 &HT;    (450&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   MOSCOW _ With U.S.-Russian relations at the lowest point since
the end of the Cold War, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had
no simple task when she swept into Moscow this week.
</P>
<P>
   On her agenda to discuss with Russian political leaders were
headline-grabbing issues concerning nuclear nonproliferation, arms
control and the contentious Chechen War. She also had the task of
sizing up Russia's acting president, Vladmir Putin, the favorite to
win next month's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the three-day visit, officials announced no major
steps forward on any of the national security topics. But, after a
meeting Wednesday with Putin, U.S. officials said steps were made
on which to solidify the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Putin a ``problem-solver'' and a ``patriot,'' the
Secretary of State left the meeting with a positive impression of
the 47-year-old Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed by his candid approach to the issues we
discussed, his problem-solving approach,'' she said. ``I found him
a very well-informed person and a good interlocutor, obviously a
Russian patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Putin acknowledged ``serious differences'' between
the two sides, but called the United States an important global
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have serious differences,'' Putin said in televised remarks
before the start of his Wednesday meeting with Albright. ``But at
the same time, we have our relationship as between great and
important powers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, a number of incidents destabilized bilateral ties,
including the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, the Russian
money-laundering and corruption scandals, and the controversial war
in Russia's southern republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke out strongly against the Chechen War throughout
her visit to Moscow, saying the growing number of civilian
casualties was detrimental to Russia's international standing. In
the four-month-old offensive, more than 3,000 Russian soldiers have
died, and more than 200,000 Chechen civilians have fled their homes
due to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   However, Albright did not translate words of condemnation for
the war into any concrete actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that only a political solution can end this
conflict successfully,'' said State Department spokesman James
Rubin. ``(But) we are not here to suggest a political solution, or
suggest a framework for doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians view the United States as brandishing its new
status as a solitary superpower to Moscow's detriment, a fear borne
out by the Clinton administration's desire to create a new
estimated $6.6 billion nuclear missile defense system to guard
against attacks from rogue nations. This type of infrastructure is
banned by the 1972 ABM Treaty signed by Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Albright attempted to tap away at this barrier of distrust. She
devoted most of a one-hour speech Wednesday at Moscow's Diplomatic
Institute to the message that the United States wanted
``partnership not dominance'' in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we are going through a kind of strange period in
U.S.-Russian relations, but I hope very much we will get through
it,'' Albright said. ``America and Russia have enough major
interests in common to surmount our disagreements and work together
in dealing with the biggest dangers and opportunities we face in
the new century.''
</P>
<P>
   In one-on-one talks with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,
Albright discussed the possibility of sharp cuts in U.S. and
Russian long-range nuclear arsenals, and urged Russia to approve
``modest adjustments'' to the ABM Treaty which would allow
President Clinton to put the proposal forward this summer without
the threat of international controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also renewed a U.S. pitch that the Russian parliament
ratify the 1993 START II treaty, which calls for reducing the U.S.
and Russian arsenals of long-range nuclear warheads to 3,000 to
3,500 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The previous Russian parliament failed to pass the pact.
However, U.S. officials say they are hoping the newly elected State
Duma, or lower house of parliament, will ratify the document this
year, an outcome more likely than in years past, as Putin leads the
largest bloc in the legislature.

 &HT;    Guy reunites, forgets to bring originality back
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, the good news: Guy has reunited to remind us how much it
brought to R&AMP;B music. But it does so by giving us a lesser record
to compare to that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The trio's 1990 album, ``The Future,'' sounded more like today's
urban contemporary music than ``Guy III'' with its songs like
``Love Online'' and ``2004.'' In the midst of all the mechanized
offerings of that day, Guy's last album, though emanating from a
keyboard as well, offered the palpable warmth that's making R&AMP;B
better now. And lead vocalist Aaron Hall's emotive abilities were
what current crooners Sisqo and Tyrese riff, screech and yell to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's confident and more refined tenor is still welcome on the
first release from ``Guy III'', the likable ``Dancin'.'' And the
rugged, bouncy keyboards on ``Do It'' feel like Guy's first hit,
``Groove Me,'' all over again. But think about it: Three albums
into their career as Guy, the act with the foresight to meld a
hip-hop feel with R&AMP;B is looking back and copying itself. By trying
to be both thoughtful men (``Not A Day'') and thugs (``Don't U Miss
Me''), the group contradicts itself. And with a dated hook like
``Spend Time's'' _ ``All I want to do is spend time with you/ So we
can go on and on and on to the break of dawn'' _ ultimately, Guy
embarrasses itself.

 &HT;    Sweeping brilliance marks Levi's `Song' to Mahler
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someday, when life in and around the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra
has settled down and Yoel Levi has gone on to finish his Mahler
cycle somewhere else, it may become apparent how lucky Atlanta was
to have heard him start that cycle with the ASO. Levi conducts a
lot of composers well: His recording with the ASO of Prokofiev's
``Classical Symphony'' may be the best on the market today, and the
performance he led of Richard Strauss' ``Till Eulenspiegel'' in
November could have been recorded just as it was and still have
outdone every current CD. But he and Gustav Mahler are soulmates in
a way that makes Levi's Mahler readings extraordinary. Symphony No.
6 (released in 1998) and the newly released No. 7 are the least
known of the Mahler cycle and the most difficult to bring off,
combining as they do the breadth of human experience without the
song affiliations or texts that make the Symphonies Nos. 1-4 more
accessible. In Levi's hands, however, Symphony No. 7 is song-filled
_ it's just that the songs are more complex. Subtitled ``Song of
the Night'' because of its two ``Nachtmusik'' (night music)
movements _ one a spectral march and the other a serenade,
separated by a really savage scherzo _the work is full of
opportunities for ASO soloists and sections _ and 21 additional
players required by its monumental orchestration _ to shine, and
they do. This piece requires both meticulous attention to detail
and the vision to control its extensive sweep and brilliance. Here
it gets both. That's why Levi is a great Mahler conductor.

<P>
   McCoy Tyner. Telarc. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   It's been 40 years since pianist McCoy Tyner recorded
earth-shaking sessions with John Coltrane, Elvin Jones and Jimmy
Garrison that included ``A Love Supreme'' and ``My Favorite
Things,'' and still his influence resounds. There isn't a modern
jazz pianist who hasn't borrowed sound or sensibility from Tyner,
and some do it wholesale. The plunging left hand, parallel fourths,
that pedal-depressed ringing sound, all are much-copied colors in
the Tyner palette. But as his new Telarc recording demonstrates,
Tyner's volcanic eruptions of years past are ruled with a new
lyricism and restraint, a sense of power held in check. Still
youthful at 70, Tyner has tempered abandonment with depth, and
shines in such ballads as ``Never Let Me Go'' and the solo piano
excursion, ``Memories.'' The trio setting, with bassist Stanley
Clarke and drummer Al Foster, suits Tyner. While Foster reads
Tyner's signals well, fusion-master Clarke, playing acoustic and
electric bass, seems out of place, whether soloing or in the
attempted funk of ``I Want to Tell You 'Bout That.'' But Tyner's
authority redeems the disc's shortcomings.

</P>
<P>
   About two decades back, an occasional record would come out
basically composed of catch phrases and lines from other hit
records. They were mostly novelty acts doing novelty singles, such
as the Invasions' ``Wikka Rap,'' or the more recent ``Hotstepper''
by Ini Kamoze. And yet the Madd Rapper has decided to pick up where
those throwaways were left behind. His ``Dot Vs. TMR'' and ``How to
Rob'' are surely smarter. But the choice is still a curious one
considering that when the Madd Rapper was known only as Deric
``D-Dot'' Angelettie, he was one of rapper Sean ``Puff Daddy''
Combs' most inventive producers (``It's All About the Benjamins'').
Here, only ``That's What's Happenin''' and ``Esta Loca'' reveal his
capacity for catchiness, and the lone ``Ghetto'' has more substance
than that. Maybe those shortcomings are really what he's mad about.

Carl Orff's grandiose cantata has been used in everything from

footage of Mark McGwire's record-breaking homers. Like a portly
opera singer in a viking helmet, it's become a parody of musical
melodrama. Apparently Michael Cretu, the man behind Enigma, doesn't
get this. Orff's played-out piece wafts through Enigma's latest,
lighting on the turgid anthem ``Gravity of Love'' and propelling
the already pretentious ``Modern Crusaders'' to new heights of
bombast. Elsewhere, Cretu revisits the same slow-motion, New Age-y
grooves he's been cranking out since ``Sadeness,'' the 1991 hit
that featured sexy whispers from his wife, Sandra. ``The brain is
the engine of life,'' she murmurs here on one of the bland,
interchangeable tracks. After four albums, Cretu's engine is
running on empty.

 &HT;    Request turns up one of our own recipes

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apparently, Barbara Harrison's recipe files in
Gainesville, Ga., go back further than our electronic ones here at
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Spieler requested an Orange Mini Chocolate Chip Cookie he
thought we'd published several years ago, but our electronic
archives search back to 1985 turned up dry.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, we got a tip from Kay McChain of Eatonton, Ga., about
a similar-sounding recipe online at www.cookierecipe.com/az
</P>
<P>
   /orangeCCCks.asp and tested it knowing it was not the same.
Still, it's a nicely flavored, very crunchy cookie.
</P>

   After we repeated Spieler's request, Harrison came through with
a photocopy of her original clipped from the newspaper. We tested
it, too, and offer both here.

 &HT;    Mini movie reviews
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Winslow Boy'' (G) _ David Mamet proves an unexpectedly
good match for Terence Rattigan's 1946 play loosely based on a true
story of an Edwardian patriarch's risky and costly fight to clear
his 13-year-old son's name when the boy is expelled from a
prestigious school for stealing pocket change. Mamet brings care,
thoughtfulness and even a theatrical spark to the material. Grade:
B+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Stir of Echoes'' (R) _ A ghost story with too many echoes of
other flicks. A little boy sees phantoms and his hypnotized dad
(Kevin Bacon) goes wiggy while hunting what happened to a teen girl
haunting their home. Besides having the wooziest title of the year,
it also has the worst timing. It might have seemed intriguing had
it landed before ``The Blair Witch Project'' and ``The Sixth
Sense'' gave us new twists on the spooky movie genre. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Love Stinks'' (R) _ And so does this movie. Playing like a
revenge fantasy from someone stung by a real-life palimony suit,
writer-director Jeff Franklin's misogynist diatribe miscasts
irritating character actor French Stewart as a TV writer about to
marry his longtime girlfriend Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson). She's a
sexy parasite; he's equally rancid. The movie has nothing to do
with love. It's about lust, lucre and well-paid losers. Grade: D-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Swindle'' (unrated) _ Isabelle Huppert and Michel
Serrault play a pair of small-time scam artists who get in over
their heads when she gets ambitious and involves them in a scheme
to steal five million Swiss francs. A character study disguised as
a caper flick, ``The Swindle'' is a sweet-natured bit of flim-flam
fluff that expertly showcases the old-pro charms of its stars. In
French with subtitles. Grade: B

 &HT;    Doing justice to African-Americans on film
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a time when Danny Glover still has trouble getting a cab in
Manhattan, Black History Month may seem more a symbolic gesture
than anything else. Still, symbols are important. So is a people's
history. While Hollywood as a whole hasn't done so well by
African-Americans, either on-screen or behind the scenes, there are
a number of pictures that examine _ or even celebrate _ our
nation's collective mixed legacy. Here are a few.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Once Upon a Time ... When We Were Colored'': Tim Reid,
mostly of TV fame (``Frank's Place''), crafts an exquisite tribute
to the generations of African-Americans who never got a break,
coming or going. They were those after slavery and before
lunch-counter sit-ins, those forced to endure the daily humilations
of segregation and the larger dangers of nut-case bigots such as
the Ku Klux Klan. They are Miss Daisy's Hoke and Jack Benny's
Rochester _ ``just like family'' except when it came to little
matters like voting or where to sit on the bus. Based on Clifford
Taulbot's coming-of-age memoir set in the postwar segregated South,
the movie begins in 1946 and ends in 1962. The excellent ensemble
cast includes Phylicia Rashad and Richard Roundtree. But the
standout is Al Freeman Jr. As the family patriarch and church
elder, the former 1960s firebrand constructs a heartfelt and
delicate homage to a man of restraint, resilience and quiet
courage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Long Walk Home'': Unappreciated when it was released,
this beautifully observed, emotionally acute drama has since
achieved something of a cult status. Sissy Spacek and Whoopi
Goldberg star as a Southern matron and her maid in Montgomery in
1955. Both are irrevocably changed when Rosa Parks' refusal to give
up her seat to a white man sparks the Montgomery bus boycott. The
plot is plain and simple, but the details are wondrously accurate
and the performances are remarkable. In its own inexplicable way,
the movie is as hard to shake as a childhood memory. Interestingly,
the first choice for Goldberg's part was Oprah Winfrey, who wanted
to do it but was committed to other projects. Goldberg recalls
that, when she arrived on location in Alabama, she had a bit of an
attitude: ``Kind of like, `Well, what took you all so long,' and
then these ladies (who had lived through the events) said to me,
`Sit down, child. Let me explain to you. You did not buck the
system. It took us a long time to figure out how to do it in a way
that nobody could ever point their finger at us and say ... how
disgusting or dirty or whatever we were. Because we continued to go
to work. We continued to take care of business. We did not write
ourselves off.' And that for me was a big awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Lilies of the Field'': Though this 1963 film may look a
little do-gooder-dated 37 years later, it's still a small gem of a
picture. Sidney Poitier became the first black man to win an Oscar
for his portrayal of a good-hearted Army veteran turned handyman
who agrees to teach some East German nuns English while building
them a chapel. In his autobiography, Poitier charts his
moment-by-moment suffering while waiting for the Oscar envelope
announcing best actor to be opened. Dubbing himself, literally, the
dark horse candidate, he remembers going from nerve-racked despair
(``Never again under any circumstances am I going to come here
again and put myself through this'') to lightheaded optimism
(``What if some miracle's about to take place?''). After Anne
Bancroft called out his name, he began his acceptance speech with
the wonderfully appropriate words _ composed on the spot during the
ceremony _ ``It has been a long journey to this moment. ...''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Malcolm X'': Spike Lee swore that he would make a powerful,
important movie about the charismatic African-American leader who
was assassinated in 1965. And he did just that. This is a
confident, superbly crafted epic _ an ambitious cinematic tribute
to a man whose complex legacy continues to challenge and influence
our nation's ever-shifting self-image. The film follows Malcolm
(dazzlingly played by Denzel Washington) from his days as a Harlem
street hustler to his fervent discipleship under Elijah Muhammad
(Al Freeman Jr.!), from his break with the Black Muslims to his
life-changing journey to Mecca. Though Lee and the material seem
made for each other, it took some doing to get the two together.
Others, ranging from Charles Fuller (``A Soldier's Story'') to
David Mamet, had tried to shape a script, but the biggest obstacle
was liberal white filmmaker Norman Jewison, who had already
announced his intention to do a Malcolm movie (with Fuller's
script). Though he didn't agree with Lee's proclamation that only a
black man could direct the movie (``an apartheid statement''),
Jewison eventually dropped out because he felt he still couldn't
lick the script.

   ``Tarzan'' (G)
</P>
<P>
   It really swings. This long-haired dude confidently surfs
through Africa's immense rain forest. He glides barefoot on
never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the coolest Rollerblader
you've ever seen. His feet never fail him. His movie doesn't,
either. It's both a little scary and a lot funny, and kids will lap
it up.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon ``Tarzan'' takes the jungle-book guy into new
territory, raising the bar on animated visuals with groundbreaking
background drawings that appear to be 3-D. This jungle
realistically sways, the ocean waves visually roar and Tarzan's
long, reckless but sure-footed treks through the trees are as
arresting to the eyes as just about anything in ``The Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice of Rosie O'Donnell is a kick as Tarzan's androgynous
young ape pal, Terk. Wayne Knight is sweetly silly voicing the
movie's orange elephant sidekick, Tantor. Glenn Close propels Kala,
the ape who adopts the baby Tarzan, into a female as loving as
Dumbo's ma. Lance Henriksen's growly voice is perfectly menacing
for the charging, ape-clan patriarch Kerchak.
</P>
<P>
   Voicing the lead roles, Minnie Driver's wide-eyed Jane and Tony
Goldwyn's knuckle-walking ape-man infuse the movie with just enough
sexual chemistry to make ``Tarzan'' an honest love story.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad most of those characters aren't drawn with the same
gusto as the background. And Phil Collins' schmoozy pop soundtrack
is one of those noisy nuisances that does nothing but sell well and
win awards. (Priced to buy: $26.99 VHS; $39.99 DVD, which includes
a read-along feature, trivia games and Collins' music video.)

&HT;     DISCUSSION REVEALS ABORTION AS TINDERBOX ISSUE AMONG TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Here among the snow-lined walls of Union
College, it was easy to envision the wintry orphanage in St. Cloud,
Maine, that forms the backdrop of the film ``Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The World War II-era home for unwanted children was a place
where abortions were performed safely in the years before
legalization. But at Union College one recent night, those engaged
in conversation about the film were almost exclusively children of
Roe vs. Wade, born after the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling
that affirmed the right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 college and high school students came of age with condoms
in the schools, gangsta rap on the radio and Jerry Springer on
television. Yet, as their talk ensued, it became evident that in
one respect at least, 50 years of history has changed little:
Abortion and its moral ambiguities are always with us.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Clayton, an 18-year-old psychology major, spoke with
disdain of an acquaintance who got an abortion despite her
knowledge of birth control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to a gas station and get a condom, but no one buys
them,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Author John Irving never meant his 1985 coming-of-age story to
be a morality play on the merits of abortion rights. That ``Cider
House Rules'' has aroused such questions shows how ubiquitous such
passions are, and how near the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The story is of Homer Wells, an orphan unwanted from the
beginning of his life. Dr. Larch, the head of the orphanage,
becomes a surrogate father to Homer, teaching him the skills of
delivering babies and maternal care. But Homer, for obvious
reasons, refuses to follow Larch's lead in performing abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of choice and consequence unfolds on Homer's odyssey
into the outside world, where he is confronted with a man who has
raped and impregnated his own daughter. How Homer handles the
situation forms the climax of the film.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion at Union was sponsored by Planned Parenthood and
held at Seneca House, a theme home for women, so an air of
preaching to the choir was perhaps inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the discussion managed to stray past scripted answers,
staying true to the film's central conflict between the rules
people are given and the lives they actually lead. Several members
of Planned Parenthood who stressed the need for education about
contraception and abortion options heard from students who said
they were inundated with such material _ in Sex Ed class, on
television, even some who had access to free condoms _ but chose to
ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who leaves Schenectady High School and doesn't know
anything about that needs to be smacked,'' said Yawne Robinson, 16,
a student there.
</P>
<P>
   Coldaina Williams, 16, a student at Community in Schools
Academy, an alternative school in Schenectady, said that free
condoms are available, ``but people are getting pregnant all the
time. It's like a disease, and I don't want to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   As they talked over pizza and cookies, Planned Parenthood staff
reminded the students of the inevitable politics of abortion in an
election year. It is believed that the next president could
nominate two Supreme Court justices, perhaps tilting the precarious
balance that has kept Roe vs. Wade in place.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the comments reflected a greater concern with sexual
responsibility than protecting access to abortion _ maybe the
greatest difference between the current generation and that of
``Cider House'' or even Roe vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Planned Parenthood asked why students were
seeing unprotected sex among their peers despite educational
initiatives about contraception and abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got some hot-in-the-pants chickenheads out there,''
said Erika Santos, 16, a student at Schenectady High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are bored,'' Robinson said. Some students will
turn to sex or drugs simply as a way of making it through their
teen-age years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I watch TV.''

 &HT;    Coffee comes in more than just a cup
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to know the difference between Coffea arabica and
Coffea robusta or otherwise be a seasoned coffee connoisseur to
fall under the spell of that old black magic. The legendary joys of
coffee as a liquid elixir have been known for centuries by people
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than a third of the world's population looks forward
to a daily cup, making it one of the most popular beverages on
Earth, according to Maxwell House.
</P>
<P>
   The fascinating, intricate flavor of coffee is no simple matter.
It is made up of no fewer than 800 elements that combine to create
its unique and complex flavor and produce its well-known wake-up
effect. The beans grow best in a band encircling the globe, roughly
between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, that includes Central
and South America, East Africa and Indonesia. The growing,
harvesting and roasting processes of coffee are high art, with each
step calculated to preserve and enhance the delicate flavor and
aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoyed primarily in a wide variety of liquid refreshments,
coffee's unique qualities can add an inspired touch to all sorts of
dishes _ desserts as well as entrees, side dishes, sauces,
marinades and stuffings.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to add the excitement of coffee to your cooking,
check out these
</P>
<P>
   Web sites to learn more about it and to find some surprisingly
different culinary uses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The history of coffee reads like an Indiana Jones adventure.
At www.acay.com.au/(tilde)motto/chistory.html you can read all
about the political intrigue, the raw pursuit of power and wealth
and the amazing coincidences that have followed coffee through the
millennia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spend 10 minutes at ``Cooking With Coffee'' at 
homecooking.about.com/home/homecooking/library/weekly/aa092198.htm?o
nce &QC; true&AMP; and you acquire enough knowledge to hold your own in any
klatch of coffee connoisseurs. Terminology, roasting and brewing
techniques, varieties, blends and roasts, history, suppliers and
much more are covered. There also are several great collections of
coffee recipes for luscious desserts as well as using coffee with
such things as polenta, lamb shanks and quail.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Go to Coffee School at Maxwell House's site at
www.kraftfoods.com/maxwellhouse/mhindex.html and learn, among other
things, that it was Theodore Roosevelt, while on a visit to the
Hermitage _ the home of Andrew Jackson in Nashville _ who commented
that his cup of coffee was ``good to the last drop.''

</P>
<P>
   fills you in on an amazing range of tantalizing main courses
that use coffee as a main ingredient. Most Southerners know the
secret ingredient to red-eye gravy is coffee, but what about duck
breast in a spiced plum and coffee sauce, or Guatemalan-style rack
of suckling pig, which sits in a coffee marinade for two days
before roasting? There's a recipe for coffee-stuffed mushrooms, a
coffee pasta dish and a wonderful marinade for just about anything,
made with black coffee, ketchup, soy sauce, lemon juice, red wine
vinegar and olive oil.

NO DERBY HOPEFULS EMERGING FROM THE PACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's only Feb. 1, and already the Kentucky Derby picture has
been clouded. Over the weekend, one top contender for the Run for
the Roses was beaten, while another could do no better than a dead
heat. The Derby isn't until May 6, but unless a precocious
sophomore emerges soon, it appears the big dance is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, who had won the Kentucky Jockey Club at Churchill
Downs and the Hollywood Futurity to close out his juvenile
campaign, was considered one of the top 3-year-olds in California,
but he finished a well-beaten third in the $100,000 Santa Catalina
Stakes at Santa Anita Sunday. On Saturday, More Than Ready, in line
to be 2-year-old champion until he finished fifth in the Champagne
at Belmont Oct. 9 and was taken out of training, was desperate to
gain a dead heat in the $150,000 Hutchinson at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, who is trained by Bob Baffert, finished behind
The Deputy, an Irish import trained by Jean Sahadi, and High Yield,
trained by D. Wayne Lukas. The Deputy was making his second start
in the United States, his first on dirt, and benefited from a
masterful ride by Chris McCarron to score at 9-2 ($11.80 to win).
McCarron went right to the front, settled The Deputy down, and had
plenty left in the stretch to pull away from 3-1 shot High Yield
and Corey Nakatani, who chased all the way. Captain Steve, the
prohibitive 1-2 favorite under Jerry Bailey, loomed a threat
turning for home but flattened out, and finished more than 5
lengths farther back. The time for the mile and one-16th was 1:43.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to go to the lead, and my horse broke like a
rocket,'' said McCarron. ``I inherited the lead by default. He
rated himself OK, though he was a bit aggressive early. Then he
settled in well about halfway through the race. From that point on,
I just sat hard until I thought it was time to go. When I asked him
to run, he went forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't kick in,'' Baffert said of Captain Steve.
``Those things happen. I just didn't do enough with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the top three Santa Catalina finishers are uncertain,
although Lukas is contemplating bringing High Yield east to race in
the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   More Than Ready, making his seasonal bow, was off at 4-5 with
John Velazquez aboard. He went right to the front with Summer Note,
who had won both of his career starts at Hawthorne and was 5-2,
stalking him under Shane Sellers. The pair pulled away from the
rest of the field, sizzling through the opening 6 furlongs in 1:09,
and More Than Ready edged clear by a length inside the furlong
pole. However, Summer Note came back, and the two could not be
separated at the wire. The time for 7 furlongs was 1:21 3/5, the
fastest of the meeting at the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran good, but he really ran green,'' said Velazquez. ``I
guess it was because he hadn't run in so long. I thought we got
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted,'' said Todd Pletcher, who trains More Than
Ready. ``My horse was coming off a layoff of over 100 days. He was
giving the other horse 9 pounds (122 to 113), and that horse is
obviously a very nice horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fountain of Youth is likely to be next for both More Than
Ready and Summer Note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer Note came out of the race in fine shape,'' said Randy
Morse, who trains the undefeated son of Notebook. ``It's still a
ways to go before the Fountain of Youth, but we're certainly going
to be looking at it. He hasn't gone two turns yet, but Shane said
after the race he thought he was rateable and would get two
turns.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
New rider, new hope
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood Lake, another Fountain of Youth hopeful, has a new
rider. The son of Meadowlake, who most recently ran a dull sixth in
a Gulfstream allowance, will now be ridden by Nakatani, who
replaces Jean-Luc Samyn. Greenwood Lake, who won the Champagne and
Remsen last year under Samyn and was the early Derby winter-book
choice, is a deep closer and was not competitive at speed-favoring
Gulfstream. ``Obviously, the change is not due to anything that
Samyn has done wrong,'' said Nick Zito, who conditions Greenwood
Lake. ``Samyn is a top rider. We just had the chance to obtain the
services of one of America's premier jockeys. Part of the change is
that we are looking in terms of what's down the road.'' In other
words, the Derby.

   Emptying Out The Desk Drawer of the Sports Mind:
</P>
<P>
   Apropos of Super Bowl XXXIV, since when does one stirring
quarter constitute a certified Great Game? Granted, it was the
first time in my Super Bowl-viewing career I was standing in an
enraptured state 5 feet in front of my set awaiting the final play,
but for sheer start-to-finish brilliance the best of all these
extravaganzas remains number XIII: Pittsburgh 35, Dallas 31.
</P>
<P>
   Let us hope that each of 30-year-old Juan Gonzalez's four
ex-wives has a lawyer savvy enough to latch onto a nice slice of
his new $100 million-whatever contract.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Jacobs criticizing the coaching expertise of Pat Burns is
like some guy from a kazoo band telling Seiji Ozawa he ought to
pick up the tempo in ``The Italian Symphony.'' Owners, to
paraphrase an old English maxim, should neither be seen nor heard,
especially when they have spent more than two decades tossing
around nickels with the same frequency with which they heave
tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
   If Michael Jordan the player were to have an early box score
like Michael Jordan the front office honcho, it might look like
this: 0-10, 1-4, 1. Plus no assists and five turnovers. He should
get his butt in D.C. and stay there, except to go scout some
college talent.
</P>
<P>
   I'm already looking forward to the first question for Cincinnati
coach Bob Huggins at the initial Final Four press conference. ``Ah,
coach, about that zero percent graduation record during your first
10 years on the job . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Boston College 6-foot-8-inch freshman Uka Agbai is what every
Division 1 coach is looking for these days: a nice raw talent with
a tremendous upside who never will get good enough so you'll have
to worry about him leaving for NBA gold before his time. Who knows?
This engaging kid could become the Etan Thomas of 2003.

   If Europe is so in love with Mike Tyson, then he should simply
lug some Washington Generals-like foes around with him and do a

terms of jumping off the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Synonyms: ``Leverage'' and ``Lawyer Milloy.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy or immediate answer to the question, ``Was Bill
Belichick worth a No. 1?'' Just remember that not all 16th picks in
the first round are Jevon Kearse.

   Why I always will love college sports: The only time I saw Kurt
Warner perform in person, I didn't even know I wasseeing Kurt
Warner, because he was being outplayed by a Flutie-esque Boston
University quarterback named Robert Dougherty. Football,
basketball, or hockey, it's a different game.
</P>
<P>
   Did I perhaps miss the NCAA directive outlawing all forms of
college hockey hazing, complete with the most severe penalties for
noncompliance?
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the aforementioned Kurt Warner: Anyone who thinks the
Big Athletic Director in the Sky automatically rewards the most
pious and deserving athletes among us should take a look inside Ray
Bourque's mouth.

   ``Any Given Sunday'' is the New Orleans Saints of football

   I'm wondering if Jeremy ``Mr. Hockey'' Jacobs could identify the

</P>
<P>
   As far as I'm concerned, the worst thing John Rocker did in the
Sports Illustrated article was knock Ozzie Guillen for not making
that play against Houston on the infamous slow roller. Ozzie

   Be it known that no coach in town, in any sport, at any level,

YOUNG NICKLAUS IS BEARING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The fourth tee at Spyglass Hill overlooks
the Pacific, and with waves pounding in perfect rhythm on a day
like Tuesday _ a clear, blue sky permitting the sun to drench the
Monterey Peninsula _ it had to be as beautiful a spot as this world
presents.
</P>
<P>
   It was just perfect for a photo shoot; so with the photographer
in command, the PGA Tour rookie took his stance. Driver in hand, he
got into the address position and started his take-away. Too fast,
said the photographer, and from behind came some fatherly advice:
``Gary, take that out of your back pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus watched as his son tossed the yardage book aside,
then delivered a smooth swing that elicited the photographer's
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want another one?'' asked the father, and the photographer
told him he needed four takes for a swing sequence that would run
in Golf Magazine. Jack Nicklaus's swing _ from another era, of
course, when he was the Golden Bear creating a legend _ would run
on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   Like father, like son?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, my swing is a little different than his,'' said Gary
Nicklaus, soft-spoken and the spitting image of his father.
</P>
<P>
   A glossy magazine photo sequence will show the subtle swing
differences, but there is no need of such a creative endeavor to
explain the contrast in the professional golf travels of the two.
</P>
<P>
   A US Open victory when he was a 22-year-old rookie, a Masters
conquest and PGA championship the next summer, and victories in all
four majors by the time he was 26 is pretty much how Jack Nicklaus
stormed into view.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nicklaus? Eight unsuccessful trips to Q School, some
forgettable mini-tour campaigns, a year in Europe, and a 1999 Nike
Tour season that, after years of frustration, finally provided a
dose of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But the kid had something his father never had _ the cover of
Sports Illustrated at the tender age of 16, when it was declared
that he was ``The Next Nicklaus.'' Nice exposure; now live up to
that billing, lad.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't, of course, but Gary Nicklaus is part of the
festivities here on the edge of the Pacific, where million-dollar
homes are at every turn. That he is in the field for the AT&AMP;T
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am has nothing to do with his father's
legend and everything to do with his will to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I earned my way out here,'' said Gary. ``I have played a lot
of tournaments out here and I know how good these guys are. They're
the best in the world, and I'm part of that group now. It's
something I look forward to, competing against these guys. But I
think I'll be able to compete on a strong basis out there.''
</P>
<P>
   His 63 in the sixth and final round of Q School two months ago
at Doral _ a performance that evoked memories of his father's
famous charges _ still brings a smile to his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was special, a lot of fun,'' said Gary, who nailed down a
coveted PGA Tour card with that Top 40 finish.
</P>
<P>
   But try making cuts with that nice little memory. Gary Nicklaus,
now 31, knows he won't; he knows he's got to earn his keep. And so
far, not so good. He made the cut at the Sony Open in Hawaii, but
failed at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic and last week's Phoenix
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't played that well, but I'm starting to play
better now,'' said Gary, the third of Jack's four sons (there is
also a daughter) but the only one to follow his father's career
path. Because of his father, Gary Nicklaus has been afforded a
comfortable life, but so, too, has he been forced to play in an
intense spotlight with high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But never, said the son, has his father been anything but
supportive. When they played together at last summer's CVS Charity
Classic at Rhode Island Country Club, Gary carried the team at a
time when Jack was coming off hip replacement surgery. The
questions at a post-round press conference, however, were directed
at the legend as his son sat quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why ask me?'' said Jack, turning to his son and pointing.
``He's the player now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, though more accurately he is the player who has to do
something the father did early and often: prove himself. That
education continued with a nine-hole tuneup at Spyglass _ under the
watchful eye of the game's greatest player.
</P>
<P>
   He is a few weeks removed from his 60th birthday and hasn't
played this event in years, but Jack is here because of pride. Not
in his own game, but in the opportunity to play in an event with
his son.
</P>
<P>
   The advice is mental and physical, said Gary, and always filled
with encouragement. Take the par 4 sixth, where Gary laced a frozen
rope up the left side, leaving just a short iron in on the 416-yard
hole. So good a shot that the prideful dad uttered the words all
golfers love to hear: ``That was a nice swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The son acknowledged the compliment, and a spectator asked Jack:
``Just like yours?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not ever in your wildest comparison,'' said Jack, who then
drove it right-center of the fairway, well struck, but 15 yards
behind Gary.
</P>
<P>
   After years of trying to follow in his father's footsteps, Gary
Nicklaus has stepped forward.

   It was a pleasant routine, but now that she's back, she'll be
moving to a different rhythm. Each of her projects, she says,
``takes a different sort of energy, and they balance each other
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Gastronomica: The Journal of Food and Culture.'' With
Goldstein editing it, she says, it will include articles from many
disciplines. ``Anything that is good. It can be anthropology,
history, psychology, an analysis of the way food is used in
literature, philosophy, the sciences _ chemistry or ecology.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in all of these different fields are looking at food _
they don't have one place they can come together because they're
all publishing in their own fields.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the book series, ``California Studies in Food
and Culture.'' The University of California Press will publish
translations, historical books, and some manuscripts (including a
dissertation on Renaissance nutrition) selected and occasionally
edited by Goldstein. Already in the works is ``L'Homnivore,'' a
social history of eating by Claude Fischler (the title is a play on
the words ``homme,'' meaning man, and omnivore); the first Latin
cookbook published in the United States, a 19th-century work by
Mexican-born Encarnacion Pinedo; and an investigative report on the
Food and Drug Administration by Marion Nestle, chair of the
department of nutrition and food studies at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein edited the Spanish book. She knows Spanish and, in
addition to Russian, has a working knowledge of German, French, and
Swedish. In 1980, she and her husband, who teaches English at
Vassar, spent a Fulbright year in Sweden when she was denied a
Russian visa.
</P>
<P>
   This semester, she'll also continue her trips to Manhattan to
see what Russian Tea Room chef Fabrice Canelle comes up with. They
taste 20 dishes a day. ``One day we had 13 different desserts as
well.'' It's hard work, says Goldstein. New Yorkers are
sophisticated. She wants to make sure the Russian flavors are
present, but on the other hand, ``you don't want something so
authentic no one is going to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Canelle turns Russian food on its ear, but it doesn't lose its
integrity, Goldstein says (some New York reviewers disagree). He
studied the traditional Central Asian pilaf, called ``plov'' in
Russian. The best ones come from Uzbekistan, says Goldstein, where
the lamb and rice cook together so the lamb permeates the dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the rice separately using a lot of wonderful root
vegetables and lamb stock, so it had this rich flavor. Then he made
a confit of lamb to serve with it. It's more lush, with very much
of a French flair, but it maintains Central Asian flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Canelle's oysters come with a lemon-vodka ice. ``You get
luscious, icy lemon flavor, the vodka being the Russian touch.
Oysters are usually eaten with vodka,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But then, isn't everything? When in Georgia, Goldstein manages
to keep up _ at least with the other women, who beg off the vodka
early. ``I don't know whether it's learned or out of desperation or
necessity,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Back in real life, she can't tolerate much alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   But with central heating, it's not necessary. &QL;

UZBEK-STYLE PILAF &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``A Taste of Russia,'' this is the traditional
Russian ``plov.'' It is served with sliced raw onion and wedges of
flat bread. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder or leg of lamb (with some fat)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 large onions, cut into julienne strips
</P>
<P>
   3 carrots, cut into julienne strips
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups white rice
</P>
<P>
   4 1/2 cups boiling water
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon saffron
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, very thinly sliced, for garnish &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut the lamb into chunks. In a large Dutch oven, heat the oil
and brown the lamb on all sides. Remove it from the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the julienned onions and carrots (add a little more oil
if necessary). Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes or until the
vegetables are soft but not brown. Return the lamb to the pot with
the rice. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the rice begins
to turn golden. Pour in the water and stir well.
</P>
<P>
   Add the red pepper, salt, saffron, and black pepper. Cover the
pan and cook over low heat for 20 minutes or until the rice is
cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with the sliced onion and serve at once.

GEORGIAN RICE PILAF
</P>
<P>
   (Shilaplavi) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This pilaf is adapted from ``The Georgian Feast.'' Goldstein
explains that it is borrowed from the Persian method, in which rice
is mixed with vegetables and meat. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lamb, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 large onions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup uncooked rice
</P>
<P>
   2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 medium potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped parsley &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a Dutch oven, place the lamb with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.
Cover the pan and cook the lamb over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes
or until it gives off its juice. Stir in the caraway seeds and
chopped onions. Cook, uncovered, until the onions are golden.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, simmer the rice in 1 cup of the water for 10 minutes
or until the water is absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   In a large flameproof casserole, melt the butter. Place the
potatoes in a single layer. Top them with half of the rice, then
add the meat and onion mixture, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt,
the pepper, and chopped parsley. Top with the remaining rice and
pour the remaining 1 cup of water over the rice.
</P>
<P>
   Wet a clean linen dishtowel and place it over the top of the pot
(it shouldn't hang over the sides). Cover with the lid. Steam the
dish gently for 1 hour or until the rice is tender.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.

UVM COACH ENJOYS HIS STATION IN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ It is a little bit after 8 in the a.m. and the
morning radio man is leaving a live, on-air voice mail for Jay
Wright, the head basketball coach at Hofstra.
</P>
<P>
   ``You been sleeping in a cave? You didn't hear the score? I'm
winning you a championship, and you don't even have time to call.
But the big news is that TB is back in the Coach of the Year
hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning radio man in question is Tom Brennan _ ``TB'' _ the
head basketball coach at the University of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   His gig is no five-minute daily ``Coach'' spot. Oh, no. His gig
is a real radio gig, a full-time radio gig, a
Monday-through-Friday, 6-9, honest-to-God, gotta-get-the-ratings,
cutthroat, morning drive-time gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this great?'' he says as he leaves the studio after his
daily ``Corm And the Coach Show,'' which he does with partners
Steve Cormier and Lana Wilder on the classic rock station WCPV
(101.3 on your dial). ``Nine o'clock, and already a payday. And now
I can go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 319 (and counting) Division 1 college basketball head
coaches. There is only one Tom Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   Take a ride in his car and you may hear a cassette of Bob Prince
broadcasting the final Pirates game at Forbes Field. Accompany him
on a basketball trip to Memphis and you may find yourself attending
a Sunday morning service at Rev. Al Green's church, well, just
because. If you're the coach of his next home opponent, and you
happen to be in town the night before the game, you will be invited
out for dinner with Brennan, his staff, and assorted
Burlingtonians. Brennan does not stand around hitchhiking alongside
the road of life. He is driving the car. And he is out to have a
good time.
</P>
<P>
   For him, a good time is coaching Division 1 basketball in a
totally comfortable environment, doing his radio work, and hanging
out with his wife and a busload of friends at Jack and Eileen
Fontaine's downtown restaurant, ``The Rusty Scuffer.''
</P>
<P>
   His definition of a great time?
</P>
<P>
   ``One trip to the Big Dance,'' he says. ``Just one.''
</P>
<P>
   For the hoop-impaired reader, the Big Dance is the primary
euphemism for the NCAA men's basketball tournament, and in order
for the Vermont Catamounts to get there, they must someday win the
conference tournament in the America East, where all but one of the
other schools operate with the allowable complement of 13
scholarships while Brennan is stuck with 10. No Vermont team, with
or without Tom Brennan, has ever won 20 games or gone to a
postseason tournament. But fate has cast the Sancho Panza role
admirably in this case. Tom Brennan is no defeatist.
</P>
<P>
   For Vermont won 16 games as recently as two years ago, and if
you can do that, why couldn't you win three straight in the league
tournament?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you might not say that if you have seen Vermont walk
onto the Patrick Gymnasium floor and lose to the woeful team
representing the University of New Hampshire. Lose at home to
Delaware, Hostra, or Maine? Sure. But lose to UNH, at the time the
No. 311 team in the Sagarin ratings?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it,'' moans Brennan. ``We never seem to be
able to avoid that killer loss. Happens every year.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no time to dwell on the Saturday disaster, not with
Maine coming in on Monday. Show 'em some of the UNH tape on Sunday,
ask them what the hell they were thinking about while dropping a
few expletives, allow faithful 12-year assistant Jesse Agel to play
an even more serious Bad Cop, and then remind them that he still
loves them _ and that they owe him one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys deprived me of one of the great joys of my life,'' he
tells them. ``Win a game on Saturday afternoon, go downtown, shake
hands, go out to dinner and have a good time. You guys robbed me.''
</P>
<P>
   He later reports hearing his wife Lynn on the phone. ``Are you
kidding?'' she had said. ``My day ended at five after three.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's Monday morning now and duty calls. ``Just what I
need,'' he says. ``Facing 90,000 people after losing to New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   The radio thing began seven years ago when a station general
manager heard him give a speech. That was one station and a lot of
bucks ago. (You think this radio thing isn't serious? The Coach
once had to sit out a whole year because of a non-compete clause).
His local identity is now as much wrapped up in radio as it is in
coaching. Explaining that he makes more money from the former than
the latter, he points out, ``I've been here 14 years, and every one
of those years I've been the lowest-paid coach in the league. Hey,
but I don't want to go anywhere. Lynn has a good job. We're making
a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The show has been a consistent No. 1 in the market, outrating
even Howard Stern, a feat Brennan equates to ``beating Kentucky at
Rupp.''
</P>
<P>
   During the season, ``Corm and the Coach'' does revolve around
the coach and the team. But the coach does more than bemoan
Catamount losses or celebrate Catamount wins. He chats with Cormier
and Wilder about the news and a lot of other things in between
evaluating the music and composing a daily poem he reads in the
show's final segment. Somehow, a Bob Knight image does not
materialize at this moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take away the politicians of the moment, and he's probably
the most recognizable person in the state,'' declares Cormier.
(Someone should tell the police officer who gave him a $107 ticket
for going 40 in a 25 zone one recent morning. You think Dean would
ever have put up with such an indignity?)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, who could pass for Robert Redford's younger brother,
has come to Vermont via Phillipsburg, N.J., the University of
Georgia (huh?), assistant coaching jobs at Fairleigh Dickinson,
Villanova, Seton Hall, and William &AMP; Mary, and, finally, a
four-year head coaching stint at Yale, where he never exactly felt
comfortable and where he and athletic director Frank Ryan were
embroiled in ``philosophical differences.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Burlington and UVM at the urging of hockey coach Mike
Gilligan, an old Yale compadre, who told him there was a basketball
opening and who promised him a fun-filled weekend in this highly
underrated city. He left with the coaching job _ if he wanted it.
Presenting the offer to Ryan, the Yale AD stopped short of smiling
while saying, ``You should take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, horses for courses, and all that. This all took place
14 years ago. Only seven men who began coaching gigs in Division 1
are at the same school they were 14 years ago. Tom Brennan is one.
It is doubtful that any of the others are as completely fulfilled
as he is.
</P>
<P>
   He is now in his fourth school administration, and he has only
one fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do worry that someone will come in and expect me to win
20,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Win 20 at UVM? Not likely. The trophy case at Patrick Gymnasium
is laden with NCAA championship hardware, all right _ for skiing.
If anything, it's a hockey school (usually). So how are you going
to win at basketball in Vermont, acknowledged to be the whitest
state in the union, and without the full number of scholarships?
The answer is that you can't, not if winning is defined as an
annual 20 W's and a postseason tourney every year or two.
</P>
<P>
   TB started out like every other hot-shot assistant, dreaming of
taking a team onto the court at the Final Four. Somewhere along the
way he realized that life could hold other rewards, that there
could be worse things said about a coach when it's all done other
than he lost more games than he won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beyond all that stuff,'' he insists. ``I don't worry about
that anymore. I get so much pleasure out of living here and working
here. I mean, I started with (Rick) Pitino and (Dick) Harter and
(Dick) Vitale. I'm always included enough by them to wet my
whistle, so to speak. I am happy here. People say, `Where's the
success?' But I know how bad it was when I got here.''

<HEADLINE>
AT CHINESE NEW YEAR, FOOD, FAMILY, TRADITION INTERTWINE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The smell of incense, the honoring of ancestors, the little
red envelopes stuffed with money for the children, and, most of
all, the food _ these are the reasons I'll be home for Chinese New
Year. Later this week, to mark the start of the Year of the Dragon,
the most auspicious of years, my mother will be preparing the New
Year's Eve feast, then the New Year's Day vegetarian meal, and,
finally, the feast to ``hoi nen,'' or open the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The cooking and eating seem endless, but these feasts are more
than just meals: Each meal, and each dish within it, has a special
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   To herald prosperity and plenty for the year to come, for
instance, the New Year's Eve feast must always have abundant
leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You boil more rice than you need, and don't wash the pot
overnight,'' says my mother in our Chinese dialect, handing down
the tradition to me. ``You have to have extra left over.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Year's Day vegetarian meal, on the other hand, signifies
respect for life. ``Don't kill anything,'' says my mother, giving
good advice to start the year 4698 on the Chinese calendar this
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And the ``hoi nen'' feast, another opportunity to celebrate
abundance, is also a time to host an open house and bring the
family together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meals have meaning,'' my mother tells me, so she doesn't
mind the days of preparation every year.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the meaning is rooted in the agricultural rhythms
of my family's ancestral villages, in a corner of southern China
known as Toishan. Villagers there still work the rice paddies, grow
vegetables, raise pigs and chickens, and otherwise hew to the
agrarian cycle, dependent on the heavens for a good harvest and
plenty to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese New Year falls in the winter _ usually in late January
or early February on the Gregorian calendar _ and the holiday meals
represent a midwinter celebration of the harvest just past and a
hope for abundance in the year to come. In China, a country that
has seen more than its share of famine, the annual celebration can
last as long as 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Just one generation removed from the ancestral villages, my
siblings and I grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., with many of these
Chinese New Year's traditions.
</P>
<P>
   We burn incense and honor our ancestors, laying out main dishes
in multiples of threes as an offering and kowtowing three times out
of respect. We give little red envelopes stuffed with money, or
``hoong bau,'' to the children and wish them all to be smart and
prosperous. We start each morning with a piece of rock sugar or
other sweet and put out oranges and homemade pastries called ``tee
doi,'' to symbolize a sweet and lucky year to come. We also
celebrate being a year older on New Year's Day, according to
Chinese custom, even though we also mark our individual birthdays
separately.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all the traditions surrounding the meals.
</P>
<P>
   We all know we need to eat a little bit from each of the dishes
during this special time of year _ it's supposed to make us smart,
so we were told _ even if we don't like the taste of them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lom see,'' or salted black olives, one of the required New
Year's Day vegetarian dishes, doesn't appeal to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate those things. They're disgusting,'' says my youngest
sister, Laura, 29. But when she heads from her Manhattan home to
Brooklyn this weekend, she knows that ``you have to eat something
from every plate.''
</P>
<P>
   My other sister, Jen, 32, who flew home from England last year
for Chinese New Year but won't be able to this time, has actually
acquired a taste for lom see. She is also particularly fond of a
special vegetarian soup called ``sek jai,'' prepared only once a
year.``I like the food,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   My brother Thomas, 37, of Brooklyn, dislikes lom see. Still, he
says, ``I eat at least one of everything, like Mom taught us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since we were all so smart from eating lom see and everything
else, we always wondered what the significance of that salted black
olive dish is.
</P>
<P>
   My mother recalled my late father's answer to that question,
playing off the fact that the word ``lom'' sounds like the word for
``hug'' i our dialect. ``You hug me, I hug you,'' my father would
say. Chinese is a monosyllabic language, so one sound, like
``lom,'' often has multiple meanings.
</P>
<P>
   In researching the traditions, I uncovered another possible
answer to why we might have to eat lom see, in the 1985 book ``The
Heart of the Dragon,'' which accompanied a PBS series on China. It
says: ``One reason, no doubt unconscious, behind the Chinese
devotion to periodic feasts such as Chinese New Year is that they
give many people their only chance to eat certain essential
minerals and vitamins.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon further research, I discovered that, gram for gram, olives
have more calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamin A than some other good
foods, like oranges or bananas.
</P>
<P>
   But I prefer my father's answer. It's more romantic, and it has
more meaning to me.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of meaning to the other required dishes, too,
often because they sound like or suggest the words for good luck or
prosperity or long life.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there's one dish called ``fat toy,'' which
suggests ``Gung hay fat toy,'' or the traditional Chinese New
Year's greeting, wishing good fortune. There's also a special
rice-flour cupcake called ``fat go,'' which magically rises into a
tricorner pastry when steamed and suggests the phrase ``fat fat,''
another way of saying good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Among the six required dishes during the vegetarian meal that
signifies life on New Year's Day are bean sprouts and my sister
Jen's favorite, the special soup called sek jai, which includes
fried tofu, dried black mushrooms, fried bean curd, rice noodles,
and dried lily flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Dishes are in multiples of three at this special time of year
because the word for three, ``tsam,'' sounds like the word for
alive, or ``tsang,'' my mother explains.
</P>
<P>
   And as with the feasts for birthdays and other special
occasions, those around Chinese New Year invariably feature noodles
_ because the long noodles suggest long life _ and chicken _
because the word for chicken, ``gai,'' suggests the phrase ``ho
sigh gai,'' or prosperity. The chicken must also be special-ordered
from a poultry farm, so that it still has the head on, for good
luck.
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons, I'll be home for Chinese New Year.

COMMONWEALTH'S PUNDIT; TALK'S DIRTY LITTLE SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, we've managed to survive the New Hampshire primary, with its
parade of candidates manufacturing artificial conflicts over
pseudo-differences you'd need a micrometer to measure.
</P>
<P>
   Now what we need is a reminder that there is often a genuine, if
quiet, consensus among Americans on many of our major national
issues such as education, race, campaign finance, welfare reform,
and economic fairness.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Alan Wolfe comes in. As suggested in the title of
his book, ``One Nation, After All,'' there's a bracing optimism
about Wolfe, a political science professor at Boston College.
Unlike many pundits who purport to tell us what the American people
think, Wolfe actually listens to what they have to say first,
without preconception, condescension, or ideological blinders.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter issue of CommonWealth, Wolfe describes how the
notion of an angry middle class fighting a ``culture war'' _ much
touted by the punditocracy _ steadily collapsed as he researched
``One Nation.'' In general, he says, ``Americans hate the idea of
being divisive. They want to be nice. They want people to like
them. They want to like each other. . . . If someone raises a point
in disagreement everyone wants to agree with him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's scarcely true of the presidential candidates, of course.
So how does Wolfe see the cultural, moral, and social issues he
researches _ most of which, he notes, don't show up in the
yes-or-no polls candidates depend on _ playing out in this year's
election?
</P>
<P>
   While he believes that voters generally won't be receptive to
``big ideas,'' Wolfe's hunch is that George W. Bush has hit
political pay dirt with his campaign theme of ``compassionate
conservatism.'' He calls it a ``brilliant idea'' that resonates
``exactly where I think Americans are at.'' On the education issue,
Wolfe argues that school vouchers are an idea whose time has come,
especially if framed as a means for inner-city students to get a
quality education. And he says his interviews reveal that, contrary
to the conventional wisdom, voters are ``really concerned'' about
the corrosive effects of money in politics: ``But I can't persuade
politicians of this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dollar-paved road that begins in New Hampshire will end, of
course, at the White House. For journalists, it's long been a
prestigious beat, but now, it is something of a professional prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Or so says the prolific Howard Kurtz in the February Talk.
Kurtz, the media critic for The Washington Post and host of CNN's
``Reliable Source,'' interviews print and television reporters who
describe the sundry indignities of covering the presidency of Bill
Clinton at a time when public interest in government is low and the
public's opinion of the press is even lower. After Monicagate,
Kurtz writes, ``The assembled White House correspondents knew they
had covered the biggest story of their careers. But they knew as
well that they had been soiled by their furious pursuit of a lying,
sexually devious president many of them couldn't stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that they see much of Clinton. According to Kurtz, the
``dirty little secret of White House life'' is that reporters
``often see their man from behind a distant rope line.'' They are
herded from scripted event to scripted event, with little
opportunity for enterprise reporting. The play their stories
receive in their newspapers or on their network newscasts suffers
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   But the unkindest cut of all, in the view of ABC's
leather-lunged Sam Donaldson, is that even though he was tough on
Clinton for a solid year during the Lewinsky affair, and even made
``factual mistakes,'' no one from the White House ever called to
request a correction. Donaldson's rueful _ and probably accurate _
conclusion: ``We were less important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tommy,'' The Who sang of a ``deaf, dumb, and blind kid''
who became a pinball wizard. In ``Sandy,'' Bruce Springsteen sang
of ``bangin' them pleasure machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, alert Tommy and the Boss and all the other wizards:
Pinball is dead.
</P>
<P>
   In this month's Wired, Erik Davis writes the epitaph for a
pop-culture phenomenon that had the bad luck to be tactile in an
age bent on going virtual. The numbers tell the story: Davis
reports that the number of pinball machines serviced by WMS
Industries, the leading manufacturer, has dropped from 100,000 to
15,000 in the past six years. Consequently, WMS stopped making them
last November.
</P>
<P>
   Dealt a crippling blow by videogames in the 1970s and '80s,
pinball rallied briefly, but its old-fashioned appeal eventually
got lost in cyberspace. ``Today's powerful microprocessors have
carved a new cultural landscape,'' writes Davis. ``The more we go
digital, the less of a foothold pinball has, because the game is
still sunk waist-deep in the old electromechanical biome.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The rosary, the thread of prayerbeads Catholics for centuries
have used to meditate on the mysteries of God, is making a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by a return to ritual by many religious people and a
revival of devotion to Mary by Catholics, rosary sales have
gradually but steadily increased in recent years, according to
scholars, manufacturers, and merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgent popularity of saying the rosary comes after years
in which the practice was frowned upon as old-fashioned,
distracting, superstitious, or even idolatrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business fell through the floor after the Second Vatican
Council, and for years we had a warehouse full of rosaries,'' said
rosary manufacturer George Malhame of Malhame &AMP; Co., referring to
the watershed Catholic conclave of the early 1960s that ushered in
an era of modernization and triggered the decline in rosary usage.
``Now we have a very vibrant marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The rosary, often said in church until the mid-1960s, is now
generally said in private. But sales of rosary beads, according to
two Northeast manufacturers, have quadrupled over the past 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, there also has been an uptick in the sale
of rosary bracelets, a religious analogue of the charm bracelet
that has become popular among teenage Catholic girls. The bracelets
can be worn as jewelry, or can be used as prayer beads _ five
revolutions completes the devotion.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of beads is growing _ you now can buy rosaries
made not only out of wood, plastic, or a variety of gems and
precious metals, but also from ceramic, cloisonne, coral, crystal,
glass, malachite, mother-of-pearl, or rhinestone. Particularly
popular, suppliers say, are rosaries made from a worshiper's
birthstone, or from the fashionable black quartz onyx or the
iron-hued mineral hematite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be a commercial element that is limited only by the
marketing cleverness of the seller,'' said John Walsh, a spokesman
for the Archdiocese of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers say sales of high-end rosaries are up _ you can now
spend as much as $4,500, or as little as 49 cents _ as are sales to
two relatively untapped markets: men and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer groups are popping up. In North Andover, Mass., in a
variation of the book club, three groups of women get together each
week and say the rosary. Child care, coffee, and chit-chat are
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Rosaries of various forms are said by Christians, Buddhists,
Hindus, and Muslims. The Catholic rosary, which has several
variations but most commonly is devoted to Mary, is thought to have
developed seven centuries ago and became popular as a way for the
largely illiterate laity to participate in prayers that previously
had been reserved for literate monks.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic rosary is a string of 59 beads, a crucifix, and a
stamped metal medallion, usually featuring an image of Mary.
Catholics recite the rosary _ a set of prescribed prayers and
contemplating some of 15 specified incidents from the life of Jesus
or Mary _ while massaging the beads with their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The rosary can be said in as little as five minutes, but many
people spend a half-hour or longer. Some Catholics carry rosary
beads in their hip pocket and say the rosary while exercising or
driving, while others set aside time each day for the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Rosary beads are a staple of Catholic religious goods stores,
and are often purchased as gifts for First Communion ceremonies, as
hospital giveaways, or for inclusion in caskets. But the beads are
appearing in somewhat unlikely places and for occasionally
irreligious uses.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1985, the rock star Madonna famously included
rosary beads as part of the lacy outfit she assembled for her
``Like a Virgin'' tour. Rosaries have long been spotted dangling
from rear-view mirrors, and prison officials say some inmates are
using multi-colored rosaries to signify gang membership and rank.
</P>
<P>
   People who say the rosary offer a variety of explanations _
often a mix of duty and desire, occasionally prompted by a return
to faith or a renewed interest in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started over a year ago, because of a conversion in my
faith,'' said Eric Fraize, 27, of Quincy, Mass., who said that
after his mother died, she appeared to him in a series of dreams,
prompting him to return to a Catholicism he had abandoned. Fraize
now recites the rosary daily, and is contemplating becoming a
priest. ``It's about taking the time to connect to God every day,
to meditate on the mysteries and focus on biblical truths. I
noticed a significant improvement in my life, and felt it imparted
spiritual blessings and favors.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Nelson, 56, of Charlestown, Mass., said the rosary as a
child, but drifted away from the church and only recently returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was returning to Catholicism more intellectually, reading
theology books and trying to get in touch that way, but I had been
given my mother's rosary beads . . . and now I say it once a
week,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars of Catholicism agree with merchants who say that rosary
bead usage dropped sharply after the Second Vatican Council, which
sought to usher in a more modern era.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the rosary in church during Mass, a common practice when
the Mass was said in Latin, was discouraged by priests who wanted
parishioners to give full attention to the liturgy, now said in
English or the local vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Vatican II, everything that was termed a devotion
dwindled, mainly because Vatican II was an invitation to go back to
the essentials _ what Jesus Christ said, the Bible and the liturgy
_ and everything that was of a personal, private nature in these
expressions of faith became less important,'' said the Rev. Johann
Roten, director of the Marian Library/International Marian Research
Institute at the University of Dayton in Ohio. ``But for many
people, that became somewhat stale or poor, and they missed
something that grabs the heart, something more inspirational,
something more tangible like the rosary.''
</P>
<P>
   Roten and other scholars say the revival of the rosary reflects
two major trends.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century saw a general increase in Catholic focus on
Mary, the mother of Jesus, as evidenced by 386 apparitions of Mary
around the world, visions that are subject to considerable debate
but which at a minimum attest to the importance Mary plays in the
Catholic faith. More broadly, in recent years some Americans have
reclaimed a variety of rituals as part of a reconnection to
religion and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the degree to which rosaries had fallen from favor,
stores and manufacturers say sales of how-to guides about the
rosary are up, as are sales of cassettes on which someone is
recorded saying or singing the traditional prayers. Operators of
two Catholic sites on the World Wide Web say they are getting an
increasing number of questions from people asking for rosary
instructions, and instructions for rosary usage are being posted in
several on-line Catholic chat groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rosary bead manufacturers, many of them located in New England,
say evidence of the resurgence is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that over the last 15 years, our sales have
quadrupled,'' said Jane Bliss, of the Bliss Manufacturing Co. of
Pawtucket, R.I. Robert Malhame, of the Melville, N.Y.-based Malhame
&AMP; Co., agreed, saying his company's annual rosary bead sales have
quadrupled, to an expected $3 million to $4 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Bedard, president of Creed Rosary, whose company has
outgrown its manufacturing facility in North Attleborough, Mass.
and is moving this week to Wrentham, said, ``At the grassroots
level there has been a significant increase in interest in the
rosary, steadily increasing over the last four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fred Adler of McVan &AMP; Co. of Warwick, R.I., said ``this part
of our business has been on a continuous upward track for 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say the rosary is not modern or fashionable, but
it's a basic meditative prayer, and the market in the US is
growing,'' said David Rejl, a gemstone dealer from the Czech
Republic, where most of the crystals used in traditional rosary
beads are made. ``People are going back to their roots, and
rosaries are one of the most basic roots of the Catholic Church.''

TENSE CITY HEEDS FATHER`S APPEAL FOR CALM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ When his patrolman son was shot dead by
fellow officers, Police Major Cornel Young Sr. urged the black
community that considers him a hero to remain calm _ at least until
after his son was buried Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a delicate yet powerful maneuver reflecting Young's
unique clout, friends say, earned over 25 years of fair, caring,
and courageous police work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Young is at the pressure point in perhaps the worst
incident in the Providence Police Department's often-troubled
racial history. But his measured approach, despite the debilitating
grief of losing a 29-year-old son to sudden violence, has let this
crowded city catch its breath.
</P>
<P>
   And that accomplishment, say black leaders and family friends,
cannot be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any death that has impacted Providence's
black community like this other than the death of Martin Luther
King,'' said Clifford R. Montiero, 62, president of the Providence
chapter of the NAACP. ``I will wait to take the major's lead.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, community reaction has been put on hold as Young
_ alternately numb and distraught, friends say _ wrestles with the
extreme, conflicting realizations that two officers from a
department he was proud to serve have gunned down his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want the race card to be played right now, and it
shouldn't be,'' said Joseph Almeida, who is black, a state
representative, and a retired Providence patrolman. ``He wants it
to be about his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say two uniformed officers fired their weapons when the
junior Young, dressed in civilian clothes and rushing to their aid,
did not drop his gun as commanded. But the possible role of Young's
race in the late-night shooting has added a flame to an ethnic
tinderbox already crackling over the question of racial profiling.
Montiero said the officers who shot Young, Carlos A. Saraiva and
Michael Solitro 3d, are white.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the elder Young met with Montiero and state Attorney
General Sheldon Whitehouse about racial profiling last Thursday,
only hours before his son was shot outside an all-night restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling me, `This is my 25th anniversary on the force,'
'' Montiero recalled Tuesday. ``He was so very proud of being a
cop. And when he became major four years ago, he was super-proud of
being a cop.''
</P>
<P>
   That pride was something that Young instilled in his son, and
also in the other minority officers who joined the force in the
last two decades, Almeida said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cornel trained me, not just as a good police officer, but also
how to respect and hold up the honor of being a minority officer,''
said Almeida, who spent 17 years on the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught every minority officer on that job how to have
pride, how to have integrity, and how to believe in yourself. There
isn't a black or Hispanic officer in the city of Providence who has
not been touched in their life, who has not been changed, by Major
Cornel Young.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of intuitive leadership, friends say, has been a
constant for Young, the son of Alabama parents who rose from a
black and Jewish neighborhood in gritty South Providence to become
the highest-ranking black officer in department history.
</P>
<P>
   Almeida shakes his head when he considers the racial
undercurrents that Young battled when he joined the force as one of
fewer than two dozen black officers. ``I don't know how he did
it,'' says Almeida, with whom Young co-founded the Rhode Island
Minority Police Association.
</P>
<P>
   Montiero, himself a three-year veteran of the force, said he
quit the department in 1962 partly because he had tired of constant
infighting between the Italian and Irish factions that dominated
the ranks. Black officers, in those days, were not even a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the department's 450 officers include 33
African-Americans, Montiero said. And a big reason for the doubling
of that number since Montiero served, he said, has been Young's
example.
</P>
<P>
   The first black juvenile detective on the force, Young has made
minority recruitment a staple of his tenure. Now, the department
has its first black female sergeant (``because of Cornel,'' Almeida
says), a black male sergeant (once again, ``because of Cornel''),
and the first black female detective.
</P>
<P>
   Cornel Junior, who was 2 years old when his parents divorced,
received regular attention from his father as he grew up and
eagerly followed him into the department.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of police work that father and son practiced was of a
hands-on variety, friends say, a form of community vigilance that
monitored the general safety but also paid special attention to the
streets of Providence's minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I needed help from a police officer, I would go to Major
Young,'' said state Representative Marsha Carpenter of the city's
Elmwood section. ``He would always return your call. His word was
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, whose son was murdered five years ago, has visited
the Young home to console her longtime friend. ``The first thing he
said to me was, `You know exactly what I'm going through,' ''
Carpenter recalled. ``It was incredible. I said, `I'm here to be
comforting you, and you're comforting me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking of others has always been part of the Young persona.
``He told us to keep our heads up no matter how hard things are,''
Almeida said. ``And to stay faithful and truthful to our families,
be fair and just to the community, and never forget where we came
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Almeida said of his friend and mentor, he cannot envision
Young returning to the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to miss his son so much,'' Almeida said. ``I know
I'm thinking for him here, but I don't think he's going to go
back.''

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ John McCain has been on a wild ride. Now he's
going to drag the Republican Party on one.
</P>
<P>
   The party that takes paternalism so seriously it was willing to
anoint the scion just based on his scionosity, must now deal with
the scamp.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ``East of Eden'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   When former President Bush came up to New Hampshire, he called
his son a ``boy'' who would not let the country down.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pounced on the word ``boy.'' ``I fully agree with that,''
he said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   W. seemed to revert to a jittering teen-ager standing on stage
next to his dad at a country music concert on Saturday. It
underscored John McCain's case: Junior was a nice enough guy, but
did he have the experience to run the country?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone assumes the Bush machine will try to tear John McCain
apart limb by limb. But then, John McCain already survived that
fate far away and long ago. So he's pretty fearless.
</P>
<P>
   He went from being a rebellious son to a rebellious POW to a
rebellious senator. Eighteen months ago at dinner, he mused about
how much of a maverick was too much of a maverick to win the
Republican nomination. He knows, even with his rout here, it's hard
to capture a party whose leaders hate you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to restrain my delusions of grandeur,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His weird schizophrenic existence _ cherished by voters and
reporters in New Hampshire for his directness, loathed by
Republican leaders back in Washington for his directness _ was
illustrated in a funny exchange on his bus on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain turned to his friend, the movie actor turned GOP senator,
Fred Thompson, who had come from the nation's capital to campaign
on the ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How are things in the city of Satan?'' McCain asked.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson replied that all was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Then a reporter asked McCain what sort of reception he would get
if his campaign collapsed and he had to return to the Senate he has
so often stirred up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers will be strewn in my path,'' he replied dryly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something will be,'' Thompson observed, even more dryly.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign was devilish. The senator pointed out Tom
Brokaw to one town hall audience as ``one of the last Trotskyites
... left-wing, Communist, pinkos of the American media.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminisced about an exotic dancer he had once dated, when he
was a single flyer. ``Marie, the flame thrower of Florida,'' he
said. Asked what she was like, he replied, ``She was pretty
volatile,'' and then slapped his knee and laughed, ``Har, har,
har!''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate occasionally used curse words, usually foreign to
campaigns. He called himself a ``wacko'' and ``an old geezer,'' and
his answers often degenerated into jokes. Sometimes his answers
went over a weird edge, as when he teased an Air Force veteran: ``I
tried to get in the Air Force, but my parents were married.''
Complaining it was not ``manly'' of Bush to keep him off the New
York ballot, McCain started to denounce it as Communistic. ``I
spent a portion of my life under that system,'' he said. Then he
stopped and smiled. ``How's that for demagoguery? _ Here, you wanna
see my medals?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Al Gore and Bush, who dole themselves out sparingly, the
Arizona senator offered a giddy excess of access to the press
contingent he dubbed ``great ferrets of truth.'' There was even a
teen-age reporter from Seventeen magazine, patiently waiting to ask
if McCain preferred Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, the man who loves to yak promised weekly yak
conferences. He also wants to start a dialogue with the Senate, a
la British Question Time.
</P>
<P>
   He was full of blunt answers. Queried about Bill Clinton's
legacy, he shot back: ``I think he'll be remembered as a great
waste. A great talent and a great waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was asked if he had given McCain any tips about
Tennessee, in case he ended up running against the vice president
from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never drink Jack Daniels on an empty stomach,'' Thompson
replied.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Senator John McCain left New Hampshire on an
ecstatic note, bound for South Carolina to resume his challenge to
Governor George W. Bush. But after his carefully-planned battle in
Dixie, McCain will be forced to resort to guerrilla tactics against
a strong Bush organization around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the close Democratic race between Vice President Al
Gore and Bill Bradley sets up an unprecedented day of high-stakes
primaries on March 7 when delegates are chosen in 13 states,
including California, New York and the rest of New England.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidential nominations -- once virtually ceded to Bush
and Gore -- may still be determined by that evening in early March,
but the results in New Hampshire have at least insured that the
next five weeks will be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appears in good position to rebound next Tuesday when
Delaware hosts the second Republican primary. According to Basil
Battaglia, the long-time state GOP chairman, the Texas governor
already has ``a huge force on the ground'' in the tiny state.
Thirty-one of the 34 Republicans in the Delaware legislature are
supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will campaign in Delaware this week, where his only
competitor is Steve Forbes, who captured the state by default four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is concentrating on the Feb. 19 primary in South
Carolina, where he has been campaigning heavily for a year. After a
warm reception at a Republican banquet in Columbia last March,
McCain targeted South Carolina -- where veterans are a huge
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN-Time survey in South Carolina completed last week showed
McCain had closed to within 20 points of Bush after trailing badly.
The magnitude of McCain's victory ``throws everything up in the
air'' in South Carolina, said Tony Denny, a veteran GOP operative
who is in charge of Forbes campaign in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past three cycles, South Carolina has served as a
killing field for promising candidacies. In 1988, the state party
apparatus united behind Bush's father, then Vice President George
Bush, to effectively end Bob Dole's campaign. Four years ago, the
same machinery broke the back of Patrick Buchanan's uprising,
assuring Dole the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the South Carolina leadership is arrayed behind the
favorite, Bush. But the organization assembled by the late Lee
Atwater and former governor Carroll Campbell split into factions
after Republican Gov. David Beasley's defeat in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be a small, minority party where the establishment
hung together very tightly,'' said Trey Walker, who worked as
executive director for the state GOP for six years before joining
the McCain campaign. ``All that has changed, and we have a lot of
new leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has the support of Campbell and the venerable Sen.
Strom Thurmond, Young Turks in the party, such as Congressmen
Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford, are allied with McCain. House
Speaker David Wilkins lined up 50 Republican representatives for
Bush a year ago, but 23 other legislators subsequently defied the
party leadership to side with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator is poised for South Carolina. Afterwards his
campaign may have to rely on an ad hoc effort fueled by his
underdog appeal and the energies of his admirers. ``McCain has a
two-state strategy, but they don't have a strategy beyond that,''
said Stuart Stevens, a Bush advisor. ``Bush has a national
strategy. We have the staying power, and nobody thought we'd do it
without getting our uniform dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   With his huge campaign bank account, Bush can throw up lines of
defense in every state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will also be flung into a number of Republican primaries
closed to the kind of independent voters who rallied around him
here.
</P>
<P>
   In places like New York, Bush's allies in the GOP hierarchy are
attempting to keep McCain off the ballot in half of the state's
Congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, both candidates will begin throwing much
of their resources into two giant states, California and New York.
Even as they carry on a coast-to-coast battle, Gore and Bradley
will be competing for delegates in several other major states,
including Massachusetts, Ohio, Minnesota, Maryland, Connecticut and
Gorgia. Never in the history of American politics have so many
delegates been at stake on one day.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore lieutenant, who asked not to be identified, said the vice
president enjoyed ``a healthy lead'' in California but would be
confronted with strong competition in New York. ``Bradley will go
to his base in New York. It's his home court,'' the aide said.
``We're playing early in the places where he should be strong, the
Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   But after March 7, the primary schedule shifts to the South,
where Gore is believed to have the allegiance of black voters, a
key element in the Democratic Party coalition.
</P>
<P>
   While the eyes of the nation are focused for the moment on the
outcome in New Hampshire, Gore is the beneficiary of a significant
behind-the-scenes development. He has built up an enormous
advantage across the country among super-delegates -- those
Democratic officials and office-holders who constitute nearly
one-fifth of the Democratic delegates to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of the 802 super-delegates by CBS News found that 472
expressed a preference for Gore compared to 46 who said they
intended to support Bradley.

NBC SHOWS OFF SYNERGY ENERGY IN N.H. 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MANCHESTER, NH _ Tim Russert's New Hampshire primary day got off
to a hectic start. The host of ``Meet the Press'' appeared on NBC's
``Today'' show, chatted with talk host Don Imus on MSNBC, and
shortly after noon, hopped aboard a makeshift stage in the media
center at the Holiday Inn to dispense some punditry during an
interview on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``NBC Nightly News'' anchor Tom Brokaw was proving
equally versatile. On Monday night, he appeared on Chris Matthews's
MSNBC/CNBC talk show ``Hardball'' before trading barbs with Imus
Tuesday morning. Later, he anchored the NBC news, broke into the
network for post-election interviews with the top candidates and
moved over to MSNBC to help handle its election night chores.
</P>
<P>
   For NBC _ along with its cable cousins MSNBC and CNBC _ this is
the synergy election. In the past few years, giant media mergers _
such as the AOL-Time Warner deal _ have sparked feverish
speculation about the looming impact of information conglomerates
on journalism. At NBC, that future is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up with this network,'' Brokaw said in an interview
Tuesday. ``We're now a formidable operation coming at you from
every direction. What we have to do is become greater than the sum
of our parts at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Alaska Airlines jet went down on Monday evening, New
Hampshire-based MSNBC news anchor Brian Williams hustled on the air
``and at one point, we're on three networks and the Web site is
humming,'' he says. ``That is someone's version of what this (media
synergy) is supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Granite State was virtually crawling with the
synergy company's cameras. The bucolic Bedford Village Inn, with
its Christmas-card setting, housed three sets _ one for Brokaw's
NBC evening news show, another for an MSNBC ``Decision 2000''
program hosted by NBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell, and another
for Williams's MSNBC special.
</P>
<P>
   With all the MSNBC/CNBC election programming on tap here, one
can almost envision the changing of the guard as news migrates from
broadcast to cable. Brokaw acknowledged for example, that MSNBC,
rather than NBC, may carry most of this year's nominating
conventions. But he said the traditional half-hour newscasts still
stand out as signature news shows, adding that ``I always believed
there was (no) giving up on the network evening news.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, NBC's veteran journalists _ grounded in old media
traditions _ are living the changes that synergy has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   The ``NBC Nightly News'' is no longer ``the wire service over
the air, which is what the old network newscast used to be,'' said
Brokaw. ``The day's news is value added.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the selling point for the MSNBC cable operation
was NBC's established news brand and established journalists. But
the concept, said Williams, was ``completely different. There's no
entertainment division. . . . We're not encumbered with `ER.' We're
not bursting into programming. This is our programming.''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Williams feels liberated by a certain cable
informality. ``I don't use Arafat's title,'' he said. ``If you
don't know who he is, you're not watching anyway.'' Conversely, he
said, ``one downside of the explosion of outlets'' is a change in
reporting standards. ``I don't think we're going through the
longstanding confirmation process of the sourcing of stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran NBC correspondent Mitchell, who often hops between
reporting for NBC's evening news and appearing on MSNBC, said ``I
really think NBC saw the vision of all these possibilities . . .
MSNBC gives us the chance to be a little more personal and
conversational. I think . . . each venue is so unique that it's
just a different set of muscles to exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Matthews's frothy made-for-cable ``Hardball'' is a clear
beneficiary of synergy. ``It's the time of night when people have
generally sat down and watched entertainment television,'' he
explained. ``I can have a lot of fun on my show that you can't do
on a news show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask NBC, MSNBC, and CNBC contributor Russert about the ratings
success of ``Meet the Press'' and he practically becomes a cyber
geek, explaining how fans can get the show's guest list e-mailed to
them. ``It's absolutely dramatic,'' he says of the influx of new
media on politics. ``There's this wonderful cross pollination
between `Meet the Press' and a Web site.'' At NBC these days,
cross-pollination is the lead story.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Ernest Rugwizangoga takes a pen, flips over a photocopy
of a map, and begins to draw. First there's a hill in the town of
Taba in central Rwanda, and then there's his family's low-slung
brick home on a hillside, shaded by eucalyptus trees. The lanky
25-year-old is seated in a Dorchester office where he now works on
youth projects, but his mind's eye sees quite clearly: There's the
cow in the yard of his house that provided his family fresh milk,
then a goat, and the small garden in back where they mostly grew
beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the lights of the city at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugwizangoga is referring to the capital city, Kigali, about 20
miles away, so he adds a valley and another hill and pinpoints
Kigali. Most of his young life he cherished looking out across to
the city, even as tensions between Rwandan Hutus and Tutsis
mounted. In early April 1994, Rugwizangoga was heading home for
spring vacation from the boarding school he'd attended for four
years, a graduating senior whose activism had included peaceful
student strikes. He was looking forward to returning to the view
that was his anchor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I always missed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the night he arrived, the president of the tiny African
nation was assassinated in Kigali. The news spread quickly and
everybody immediately grasped the meaning of the murder for Tutsi
families like Rugwizangoga's. ``My family, we knew that the
shooting of the president meant the death of all Tutsis.'' The view
from their hill had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see the fires in the city, and we began to see people
fleeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugwizangoga puts down his pen and settles back in the office in
the neighborhood where for two years now he's been making a new
life. ``One of the things I like about this,'' he says about the
interview, ``is it helps me to remember the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is something I don't want to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rugwizangoga grew up in a family with three sisters, three
brothers, and a stepbrother, with Ernest in the middle. His mother
taught elementary school and his father was a veterinarian. Before
Ernest was born, the family had moved around Rwanda as part of his
father's practice, and then settled in Taba, where his father died
in 1989 following an illness. Ernest grew up carrying an
identification card all Rwandans were required to carry, signifying
his Tutsi status. Tensions between the Tutsis and Hutus had
deepened throughout his boyhood. On April 6, 1994, a militant Hutu
cabal seized power.
</P>
<P>
   The river of blood soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   With Kigali afire, the Rugwizangogas huddled. Their mother, says
Ernest, ``told us to leave the house and try to go in different
directions.'' Until that night, there had been an increasing number
of disappearances, but the Hutu takeover and outburst of killings _
``the extremity of this was a big surprise.'' The emergency
strategy was to scatter ``so if one of us dies, someone might
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the same day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest took off on foot. He had the equivalent of about $50 and
carried nothing but the clothes he wore. ``I could not move quickly
if I had luggage.'' That his family shattered like shrapnel
captured the scope of the crisis; family in Rwanda was paramount, a
source of power, and suddenly his was in fragments.
</P>
<P>
   The teenager ran. He came to an intersection 2 miles from his
home and saw a Hutu friend of his older brother. He asked what the
Hutus had in mind and was told, ``The plan was the elimination of
all Tutsi.'' Rugwizangoga ran until he came to the home outside of
Taba of another Hutu friend of the family who agreed to let him
stay the night. ``The bad thing was I could see my house burning.''
</P>
<P>
   The teenager decided his best hope was to return to his school,
St. Leon Seminary, where his headmaster might be able to hide him.
Rugwizangoga had no confidence he would survive the 20-mile trip.
``The Tutsi were not people any more.'' He barely slept. He prayed.
The boy who'd decided he wanted to become a priest thought, ``The
faith was kind of gone, but I said, `OK, God, do what you want.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was the rainy season in Rwanda, but no rain fell during the
first days of the genocide. In the morning, he hitched a ride with
a third sympathetic Hutu toward Kabgayi, where the seminary was.
Rugwizangoga squeezed down in the car between luggage, trying to
disappear. ``There was so much confusion. The people who are
killing are screaming and the people being killed are screaming.''
He made it past two roadblocks but went numb at the sight of bodies
along the road. ``I survive. I don't survive,'' he says. ``I don't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, he made it to the seminary, a place full of good
memories, where he'd discovered himself as an activist. He and a
group of close friends had been heading into graduation full of
promise and confidence. But now Rugwizangoga found himself at the
school, shaking and incredulous he'd survived the car ride.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today the view from Rugwizangoga's second-floor room in a church
rectory is of Dorchester Avenue: a flower shop, a clothing store, a
Chinese take-out restaurant. When he arrived at St. Leon,
Rugwizangoga saw he was not the only one seeking refuge on school
grounds. The school that taught about 400 students was swarming
with thousands of Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the Hutu tribal militia hovered. Every day in the
afternoon, soldiers descended onto the grounds with a list of
Tutsis to round up, either to be slain right there or taken away.
Day after day the soldiers came. Rugwizangoga saw a pattern: ``They
began with teachers,'' then went after men, then students, first
male then female. The killers were aided by town leaders and Hutu
teachers and priests from the school who could identify the Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a prison. They knew you were there, and they would
come for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The school's headmaster tried his best to protect and feed the
students, and he gave Rugwizangoga a radio so they could monitor
the news elsewhere in the country. ``Our headmaster tried to help
us.'' Eventually, he was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick was not to stay in one place.'' Rugwizangoga hooked
up with some classmates and their families, and they moved around
together, trying to stay ahead of the daily roundup. ``I slept all
over the school,'' he says. They'd move from one of the dormitories
to a classroom to the administration building. Word spread quickly
as soon as the Hutu soldiers arrived, and everyone scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling in the infirmary proved to be one of the safest
places. ``It was my school. I knew the best places to hide.'' He
and his friends removed a wood panel in the ceiling, climbed up,
replaced the panel, and then sat on beams. Sometimes the wait was
two hours. Some days they hid in the ceiling for six. It became a
mindless game of hide-and-seek in the face of the daily slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   A classmate named Theobard, who had also been a student leader,
tried to boost their spirits. ``He was giving us courage to go
on.'' Then came the day ``they took Theobard, two little sisters,
and his parents away,'' says Rugwizangoga. The father, a village
leader, was targeted. They were killed. ``It was a quick thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In late June, he says, ``hope began to come.'' On the radio,
they heard news that a rebel army of Tutsi refugees, the Rwandese
Patriotic Front, was overpowering the Hutu killers. ``We began to
think some of us may survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the killers' demeanor betrayed a detectable loss of
confidence, even if they also ``began to kill more,'' he says. ``It
was as if they were saying, `This is our last day; make the best of
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then, about 100 days after it began, the killing did indeed
cease. Rebel soldiers arrived in July and led Rugwizangoga and
other survivors from the school compound. Less than 3,000 Tutsis
remained from the original 10,000 who had tried to hide at St. Leon
Seminary.

   It was pretty bad his first three years. We're talking 14-68.
Since then he has won in double figures every year while
establishing cozy Patrick Gymnasium (3,228 seats) as a challenging
place for opponents to play. And lest anyone think he is viewed as
the class clown, as opposed to a serious basketball coach, Maine
coach John Giannini is happy to go on the record to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what he's up against,'' declares Giannini. ``He
has less than the full amount of scholarships, and UVM is one of
the two programs in the league with the highest academic standards.
He and his staff do a great job. But, more than anything else, he
is a great person. He is honest, and he has a sense of humor the
rest of us don't have. His practice of inviting the opposing coach
to dinner is very rare and very refreshing. And he is held in such
high regard in this league that many people have said he would make
a great commissioner someday, if he'd ever want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   TB has made the UVM program equivalent to a beloved high school.
He has never lost the best kid in Vermont, that being defined as a
Vermont kid coveted by someone else, although Burlington's Bernie
Cieplicki did go to Fairfield for a year before heading back to the
Catamount womb. Brennan beat out Siena, Delaware, and BU for 6-8
freshman prospect Matt Sheftic this past year, and his best player
is junior guard Tony Orciari, a janitor's son from St. Johnsbury.
There really is a sense of pride about the program, which is a
truly remarkable thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So now it is the morning of the Maine game, and the coach is
exhorting the faithful on his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you people that owe me favors have got to show up
tonight,'' he pleads. ``We need your support. Maine is really
good.''
</P>
<P>
   His pregame speech to the team is short.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Hampshire loss was devastating,'' he tells them.
``This is an opportunity to get right back on the horse after a bad
fall. Get out there and show people who we are at the University of
Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 39-30, Vermont, at the half, a score all the more
impressive because Orciari, his leading scorer, is scoreless on a
night when he enters the game with 997 career points. The lead goes
to 13 (46-33) before a poised Maine team, which really is more
talented, makes its run. The game goes down to the last possession
with Maine ahead, 75-73.
</P>
<P>
   Orciari is 0 for 10 from the floor, but 11 for 11 from the line,
all in the second half. TB calls his number. Tony O, as he's known,
is fouled outside the arc while attempting a 3-pointer with two
seconds left. It's a good, clean call, drawing no gripe from
Giannini. ``What other coach would call a play for a guy who is 0
for 10?'' marvels spectating Middlebury coach Jeff Brown, a former
Brennan assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Tony O walks to the line. With his mom, Judi, crying, and his
dad, Carlo, afraid to watch, he goes swish, swish, and then a
gentle kiss of the back rim, and in. Vermont 76, Maine, 75. UVM
steals the inbounds. Catamounts win! Catamounts win! TB jumps into
the arms of sophomore Trevor Gaines. Tony O has fashioned a keeper
of a box score: 0-10, 14-14, 14. And the coach has just about lost
his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I do this,'' he croaks. ``There is no drug, no
nothin', that can make you feel this good.''
</P>
<P>
   He barely sleeps. He is up early. He can't wait to get to that
mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corm,'' he says, ``Let's call Jay Wright (a good friend,
naturally). Jay Wright, you know what the barber says: You're
next!''
</P>
<P>
   Get out the tux. The Big Dance awaits.

   A total of 56 head coaches in Division 1 men's basketball began
with their school in 1986-87. Aside from Vermont's Tom Brennan, the
only ones from that class still on the same job are Speedy Morris,
La Salle; Danny Nee, Nebraska; Dave Magarity, Marist; Fang
Mitchell, Coppin State; Mike Montgomery, Stanford; and Jim Calhoun,
Connecticut. There are a number of other coaches, such as Indiana's
Bob Knight (1972), Syracuse's Jim Boeheim (1976), and Duke's Mike
Krzyzewski (1981) who have been on the job at the same school even
longer. The dean of Division 1 men's coaches is Mt. St. Mary's Jim
Phelan, who began in 1954, and who has said for years he wouldn't
retire until Joe Paterno did. Have you checked the news out of
State College lately?

CONSULTANT DESIGNS BUSINESS AROUND DISTRESSSED HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEWTON, Mass. _ As regulators weigh the fate of Harvard
Pilgrim Health Plan, a veteran health-care consultant here is
gearing up to buy other distressed HMOs across the nation as a
business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Scheur, 48, whose past work in more than 40 states
includes forming new HMOs and helping liquidate others, took his
first step into ownership last month with the acquisition of a
debt-burdened, 70,000-member HMO in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the $22 million he paid for SMA Health Plan Inc. of
Metairie, La., as a ``junk-bond equivalent,'' Scheur expects more
small HMOs will be on the market in coming months as losses
incurred in waging price wars against competitors pile up. He is
discussing a possible second acquisition in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Scheur said his for-profit holding company, Venture Health
Partnership Group LLC, is too young to take on Harvard Pilgrim, the
1.1-million-member HMO placed in receivership this month after
reporting massive, unexpected losses in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But many struggling small for-profit and nonprofit HMOs are
candidates as the estimated value to investors of an HMO member has
fallen almost in half since 1995, when competition in the
managed-care industry began pushing many groups into the red.
</P>
<P>
   A report last week by Weiss Ratings Inc., a Florida firm that
tracks the industry, found that while larger HMOs began reversing
those losses during the first half of 1999, smaller ones _ those
with fewer than 100,000 members _ collectively saw their losses
triple from the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling that a lot of them are looking for, if not a
way out, a way to solve their problems with profitability,'' Weiss
vice president Melissa Gannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Scheur's vision calls for a national conglomerate with as many
as 2.5 million members in eight to 12 largely autonomous HMOs, in
cities around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His plan targets financially troubled HMOs now owned by
hospitals or doctors, because he considers community ties important
in retaining and building membership and consumer and provider
loyalty. Along with the cost-cutting moves and rate adjustments
that might be expected with an acquisition, Scheur plans strong
marketing programs to promote each of his holding company's units
into respected local ``brands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care is a brand like anything else,'' he said in an
interview, ``but I think health-care marketing in general is really
primitive.''
</P>
<P>
   His plans raise eyebrows within the HMO industry, which is still
trying to recover from charges of indifference leveled when
managers, believing cost control was their prime mandate,
instituted steps that offended both consumers and providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tried this before, but the record is that the
larger companies tend to do better,'' said Nancy Chockley,
president of the National Institute for Health Care Management
Foundation, based in Washington. They succeed, she said, because
they can bring economies of scale to computer services and wield
clout of large membership numbers when bargining with providers.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Caulfield, chairman of the Chickering Group, a
Cambridge health insurance company, sees Scheur's business plan
bringing to health care the strengths of the franchise system _
corporate ownership that provides some centralized services, but a
local management able to respond directly to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has yet tested the local-franchise
model; nobody has come up with the Golden Arches of health care,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Health Partnership Group expects to spend as much as 6
percent of operating revenue on marketing programs to build
identity and develop member and provider loyalty. That's about 50
percent more than the average HMO has spent in recent years, a
figure itself inflated by recent, fierce competition.
</P>
<P>
   But Scheur considers marketing vital to building community-based
loyalty that, like family ties, helps retain members. ``Turnover on
account of price, I can accept,'' he said. ``But if it is based on
dissatisfaction, I cannot tolerate that.''
</P>
<P>
   He scoffs at most HMO marketing programs that he sees. Gifts of
medical equipment to hospitals or YMCA affiliations he calls ``kid
stuff.'' He is more given to the grand gesture: In 1991, after Pan
American World Airways declared bankruptcy, he advised a struggling
Miami HMO to seize the moment and enroll hundreds of employees who
were left without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably a bad economic decision, but it worked,'' he
said, winning the Family Health Plan widespread recognition. ``When
they see you being public in the marketplace, it reinforces their
ability to want to be part of you and do business with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheur's expertise is not limited to marketing, however. His
first job in the field, general counsel for an Amherst HMO in 1977,
was followed by the executive directorship of the former Boston
Health Plan and five years with law offices developing HMOs and
other health-care plans. One of those was Healthsource Inc., a New
Hampshire HMO founded in 1985 that had 1.1 million members in 15
states when it was sold, for $1.7 billion, to Cigna Corp. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands all the dynamics of operations in this business
as well as anyone I know,'' said Nancy Turnbull, a Harvard School
of Public Health professor. Turnbull, as an assistant state
insurance commissioner in the 1980s and early 1990s, hired Scheur
several times to help unravel the affairs of troubled HMOs,
including the failure of Bay State Health Plan in 1992. ``He really
enjoys messy, difficult problems,'' Turnbull said. ``He's a real
entrepreneur and sees opportunities where others run away.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, his Scheur Management Group helped Blue Cross &AMP;
Blue Shield of Rhode Island revive its flagging HMO and build its
membership to 83,000, from 12,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Born blind, the result of complications during his premature
birth in Buffalo, N.Y., Scheur graduated from Tufts University in
1973 and Yale University Law School in 1976, hiring students to
read to him. He learned to play golf and to ski, with help from
friends _ but has stopped skiing, a passion that sometimes led to
accidents around him as other skiers were caught off guard by the
sight of him barreling downhill with a wool cap pulled down over
his face.
</P>
<P>
   With 25 employees and $3 million a year in revenues, Scheur's
consultant business has done business in 45 states since it was
founded in 1988. Although he incorporated the holding company early
last year, he said he had no specific acquisitions in mind until a
consultant contract last summer took him to Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO he bought there is the SMA Health Plan Inc., which has
70,000 members in and around New Orleans. It also operates an
affiliated preferred provider organization with 400,000 members in
Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1994 by three New Orleans area public hospitals with
help from Tulane University, SMA by 1998 had built revenues to $170
million. But it also was losing money, and last summer, as
cumulative losses neared $19 million, state regulators ordered the
owners to pump in fresh capital and hire a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Scheur Management got the job, recommended selling SMA, and
proposed Venture Health Partnership buy it. Deputy insurance
commissioner Richard O'Shee said the state found Venture Health
qualified and approved the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Scheur's own investment is about $1.5 million, with others in
the consulting group investing about the same. The balance of the
$22 million price was financed by the capital infusion and other
funds from the former owners. The hospitals have a chance to get
their money back under a profit-sharing agreement. Tulane said it
has written off its $7 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   Scheur said the uncertain future of managed health care makes
outside investors wary about his plans. He said he contacted 300
investment groups before getting a $3 million working-capital
commitment last fall from a Philadelphia investment group.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital funds consider the 15-percent after-tax returns
Scheur predicts too low to consider. But they don't doubt this
opportunity exists. ``If you can reduce costs a little and raise
premiums a little, the leverage in these businesses is enormous,''
said Christopher Gabrielli, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners
in Wellesley.

A RARE CHANCE TO GIVE LIBERTY FINANCIAL NEW LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo to Gary Countryman: Don't pass up this chance.
</P>
<P>
   Countryman, the chairman of Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., has
stepped in temporarily as chief executive of Liberty Financial
Cos., a publicly traded investment and annuity company based in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He took over last month, when Liberty Financial's longtime
chief, Ken Leibler, suddenly hit the door without explanation _
after 10 years as a top executive there.
</P>
<P>
   Countryman could just recruit a new CEO. But from where we sit,
this is the time to investigate bolder ideas on how to unlock the
value that some of the largest investors insist is buried in the
company's stagnant stock.
</P>
<P>
   Our Plan A: Shop the company. Hard.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to test the global marketplace, as regulation of
the financial industry continues to recede and international
competitors seek to bulk up. And no one new has dug his heels into
the corner office's carpet yet.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the downside?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a Liberty Mutual spokesman insists this is not in
the cards. That's a big problem, because Liberty Mutual owns just
over 70 percent of Liberty Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea: Liberty Mutual could buy back the other 30 percent
that's in the public's hands. But this doesn't seem to be popular
at the insurance company, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the business and believe that Liberty Financial has a
long-term strategy to build shareholder value,'' a Liberty Mutual
spokesman said Tuesday. ``We have no plans to buy back Liberty
Financial stock or to sell the company.''
</P>
<P>
   We were turned down in our efforts to speak with Countryman this
week, and Leibler did not return our call.
</P>
<P>
   One story making the rounds of the trade press suggests that
Leibler tired of butting heads with Liberty Mutual over the
prospects of a sale. Or perhaps management change is just what
happens when a stock gets cut in half over two years, while the
market roars ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is what to do now, and we're not the only ones
recommending something other than the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Managers at Franklin Mutual Advisors, by far the largest outside
shareholder in Liberty Financial, want action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a no-brainer for them to buy back stock,''
said Larry Sondike, a senior vice president and fund manager at
Franklin Mutual Advisors, which owned nearly 2 million Liberty
Financial shares. ``This is a company that's dirt cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be ``wildly accretive'' to earnings if Liberty
Financial bought back some of its public stock, he said. He also
suggested exploring the possiblity of splitting up the company's
investment management and annuity businesses, arguing that their
value may add up to a greater number if they were split up.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial should ``seriously contemplate'' splitting the
two pieces, selling one of the units, or selling the entire
company, Sondike said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is giving nowhere nearly enough credit for the
value inherent in their business. There are multiple parties
looking to get bigger in the asset management and annuity
buisnesses. I think the stock trades so cheaply relative to what an
outside party would pay for these assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the activity in Liberty Financial stock Tuesday. The
company reported fourth-quarter results that were solid but nothing
flashy: operating profit up 9 percent, and other key figures moving
at a similar pace.
</P>
<P>
   The stock slipped, down 1/16 to 20 13/16. So much for that.
</P>
<P>
   There has been nothing but bad news for stockholders for two
years. Liberty Financial shares moved up from about 16 in early
1995 to a peak of about 40 in spring 1998 and have been slumping
ever since. If you call Liberty Financial an investment management
stock, it was one of the worst around over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial gets most of its earnings from annuities, a
business that has had no fans on Wall Street for awhile. It has
spent years trying to build up a mutual fund business, with
decidedly poor results.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was a conversative insurance mentality toward
acquisitions, but Liberty Financial never chose to pay up for
fast-growing fund companies and was left with a collection of funds
that often were and remain out of vogue, especially bond and
value-oriented stock vehicles. Last year, the company's mutual fund
assets rose 4 percent to $29.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial points to other areas, such as institutional
money management and investment services for rich people, as
faster-growing lines of business. Total assets under management and
other indicators, they note, continue to move modestly higher and
set new records for the company's relatively brief life.
</P>
<P>
   Managers point to those services and to the growing likelihood
that baby boomers with big retirement accounts will want to mix
them with income vehicles (read annuities) as reasons that Liberty
Financial stock will become much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some view our odd combination of annuities and asset
management as being awkward, I view it as a our great strength,''
said Porter Morgan, a senior vice president at Liberty Financial.
</P>
<P>

   Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co., the Boston investment firm best known to
institutional customers, is lowering the minimum retail investment

the Loomis Sayles Global Technology Fund, run by Christopher Ely
and a team of co-managers.

RUSSIA'S DIRTY LITTLE MONEY SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, has named
fighting corruption as one of his administration's top priorities.
And law enforcement officials in Switzerland have decided to lend
him a helping hand _ whether he wants one or not.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Swiss prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Pavel
Borodin, once a top aide in the Kremlin who's suspected of money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss authorities say they are simply enforcing their own laws.
But the case _ one of several recent investigations into high-level
Russian corruption _ is causing tremors among Russia's political
elite.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin, a central figure in the mushrooming scandals of the
past year, is also a close ally of both Putin and former president
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss case, analysts say, will severely test Putin's
commitment to reform.
</P>
<P>
   To turn around Russia's lethargic economy and to attract
investment, Putin, who became acting president following Yeltsin's
abrupt New Year's Eve resignation, must tackle the rampant
corruption that has so damaged Russia's reputation as an emerging
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kremlin has shown little interest in pursuing this and
other cases, and this has put a damper on investment,'' said
Charles Blitzer, chief economist for the investment bank Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is consistently ranked among the world's most corrupt
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the international watchdog Transparency International
gave Russia a dismal clean-government score: 2.4 out of a possible
10.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, based on interviews with business people and
academics, Russia ranked as the 17th most corrupt, out of 99
nations surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   But since many believe that corruption goes to the very top of
the Kremlin elite that put him in power, Putin must walk a fine
line.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin is part of a shadowy collection of Kremlin-connected
tycoons and bureaucrats, known as ``The Family,'' which wielded
enormous influence over the ailing and aging Yeltsin. By most
accounts, this clique facilitated Putin's dramatic rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   Under Yeltsin, Borodin managed the Kremlin's multibillion dollar
real-estate empire, which includes apartment buildings, hotels, and
resorts, along with automobiles and airplanes. It was he who in
1996 brought Putin, previously vice mayor of St. Petersburg,
Russia's second city, to the capital to work as his deputy. Thus
began Putin's meteoric rise.
</P>
<P>
   The Borodin case involves a Swiss construction firm called
Mabatex, which in 1994 won contracts worth an estimated $640
million to renovate the Kremlin. Swiss investigators suspect that
Mabatex may have paid as much as $15 million in bribes to
bureaucrats in the Kremlin, including Borodin.
</P>
<P>
   An investigating judge in the Geneva prosecutor's office, Daniel
Devaud, was quoted as saying that the warrant accuses Borodin of
using Swiss banks to launder the bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Mabatex and its officers deny paying any bribes, and Borodin
denies receiving any.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported last year
that Swiss prosecutors were also looking into allegations that
Mabatex may have paid as much as $1 million in bribes to Yeltsin
and his two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has made some cautious moves to distance himself from
Yeltsin's inner circle. He removed Borodin as the Kremlin's
property manager and fired the former president's daughter, Tatyana
Dyachenko, who had served as Yeltsin's image advisor.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin faces snap presidential elections on March 26, and few
expect him to take any serious anticorruption measures that may
alienate the powerful industrial, bureaucratic, and media interests
he needs to win that vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is in a very difficult position,'' said Roland Nash,
chief economist for Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank.
``He was allowed to become prime minister and later acting
president because the Kremlin inner circle saw him as somebody who
would protect their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made some moves to distance himself from Yeltsin's
family, like removing Dyachenko and Borodin, but it would be naive
to expect him to do much more before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Borodin denied the charges against
him and called them politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to discredit Russia and keep money taken out of
Russia,'' Borodin said of the Swiss authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has no extradition treaty with Switzerland, and
law-enforcement officials in Moscow have not yet confirmed
receiving the warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has not commented publicly on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mabatex investigation has dragged on for two years, with
some bizarre twists.
</P>
<P>
   It began in early 1998, when a Swiss prosecutor, Carla del
Ponte, told a Russian prosecutor, Yury Skuratov, that she had
information about high-level corruption in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation proceeded covertly until last February, when
Skuratov made it public. In doing so, he drew the Kremlin's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Yeltsin accused Skuratov of misconduct and suspended
him after Russian State Television broadcast a video of the
prosecutor frolicking in bed with two prostitutes. On Monday,
Skuratov was charged with abusing his office.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin has lashed out at del Ponte, saying he would ``send her
white carnations,'' as if for a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte, who has since resigned to take a job at the
International Court of Justice, told Russia's NTV television that
law-enforcement officials in her country will see the Mabatex case
through to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``For investors, it will be very interesting to see what Mr.
Putin does about corruption after the presidential elections. But
it would be very naive to expect him to do much beforehand,'' said
Nash, the Renaissance Capital.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mabatex case is just one of several scandals that have
rocked the Kremlin recently.
</P>
<P>
   --Swiss prosecutors are also probing the affairs of Boris
Berezovsky, a Kremlin connected business magnate who last month won
a seat in Russia's parliament. Berezovsky is suspected of
laundering money from Russia's national airline Aeroflot through
Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   --In August, US and British investigators announced that they
were looking into allegations that anywhere from $7 billion to $15
billion in pilfered Russian funds may have been laundered through
the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1998, the Russian prosecutor Yury Skuratov announced that
Russia's Central Bank had parked $50 billion in hard currency
reserves offshore with a Jersey Island-based shell company called
FIMAKO. Current and former central bank leaders have since
confirmed this.
</P>
<P>
   --Last year, Skuratov said he had information that 780 current
and former Russian government officials had used inside information
to trade on the country's once-lucrative treasury bill market, and
then spirited their profits abroad to foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov was suspended as prosecutor last March when the Kremlin
accused him of accepting bribes from suspected figures in the form
of prostitutes. On Monday he was charged with abuse of office for
allegedly accepting $39,676 in free business suits from Mabatex.

WANTED: UNSKILLED WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; With job growth a paltry 1.3 percent for the fiscal year
ending in August and high-tech professionals in demand, a Boston
Internet firm has found a way to fill computer programming and Web
design positions in a tight labor market: It trains them.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for skilled employees in Massachusetts and other
states, coupled with a hot economy and record low unemployment
rates, is forcing employers to search for innovative ways to
attract qualified workers. These days, stories of major firms
employing head hunters and offering five-figure signing bonuses to
lure away competitors' employees are almost passe. Indeed, one New
Jersey architectural firm began offering skilled workers BMWs to
keep them on the job. Outside a Burger King in Boston, meanwhile, a
sign posted last year urged passersby to consider a job flipping
hamburgers _ and a $100 cash bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Screen House in downtown Boston. While other firms
offer cash perks, this Web design and development firm is offering
training, free of charge. The start-up, according to the founders,
is nearly five years old.
</P>
<P>
   The company's plan works like this: Rather than limit its search
for talent to those with the right degrees and experience, the
Screen House expanded its applicant pool to include inexperienced
college grads, computer hobbyists, and others who are eager to
learn a new field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is difficult to find skilled programmers, we tried
to come up with an internal training system in which we take people
with less knowledge than most applicants or no knowledge in the
field at all,'' said Adam Prince, chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose clients include Oshkosh B'Gosh and IKEA,
develops e-commerce Web sites for large retailers. Thus far, its
employee rolls have grown from a handful to 60, and are expected to
double by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Prince, 29, and his partner, Drake Roberts, 30, say they are
more interested in finding people with the right personalities than
experience. They want people who will grow with the firm, people
who will stick _ a tall order in an era of double-digit employee
turnover rates. In the first quarter of 1999, for example, median
resignation rates average 1.1 percent of the work force per month,
the same as the 13-year high reported a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Prince and Roberts, president of the Screen House, have
developed a formula that so far seems to be working. First, they
interview applicants during marathon sessions designed to determine
personality fit. If the applicant's personality seems compatible
with the company's culture, the officers and the applicant strike a
deal: The Screen House offers up to 30 days of training in basic
core skills such as HTML (hyper text markup language), a
programming language for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``To test out personality, we do three- to four-hour
interviews,'' said Prince. ``Then we train. If they are unable to
do basic work by the end of 30 days, then it may not be working
out. Most people are able to learn the skills we want within two
weeks, or even a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Once hired, the employee is assigned a buddy and a mentor. The
buddy shows the new hire the ropes. The mentor helps the new
employee figure out what will be expected further down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Jones was waiting tables at a restaurant in Lexington when
a principal of the Screen House tracked him down and offered him a
computer programming position and training. Hired in 1997, the
26-year-old was promoted to senior programmer 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd worked at the restaurant in high school and continued to
work there while I was attending UMass-Boston,'' recalled Jones,
who was studying art illustration and computer science. ``I was
still in the infancy of a computer science degree path and had no
applicable knowledge of Internet development or any of the
applications used to create (Web) pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jones was hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company started me off with some easy programming language
and they trained me on a product with its own proprietary
languages,'' said Jones. ``Then, I was steered to more difficult
languages. The president, Drake Roberts, was my mentor. . . . Now
I'm responsible for designing and maintaining business scale
systems for industry _ something most companies would never hand to
someone right off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Moura has a similar story. The 35-year-old woman was
recording personal ads and fiddling around with a rudimentary Web
site she had put together in her spare time. She acknowledges she
had a varied past: She was in the Air National Guard in the 1980s,
studied English literature in night school, did administrative
work, and ``messed around computers whenever I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I became fascinated with the Internet,'' she said. ``I
set up my own Web site and worked on it on the sly once in a while,
but now I am getting paid to learn it for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Moura was referred to the firm by a friend who had worked as a
personal ad taker and is now at the Screen House. She has been at
the firm one week.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Deckebach had no computer experience, but he can draw.
Deckebach, 31, once was a crew member on a schooner. Prior to
joining the Screen House, he cleaned a stable and tended horses.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jones, Deckebach was invited to join the firm by Roberts.
``Although I did not have a formal art background, I did my own
portrait sketches. So Drake asked me if I would like to learn how
to do the same thing on the computer.'' That was in 1995, when
there were only seven employees. ``Basically, the question was,
`Can you come in and jump in and learn a medium that, essentially,
changes every day?' '' said Deckebach, who now works as a graphic
artist in the Web design division.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen House is hardly the first to turn to training. Others
have taken the same route, with similar results. And, in many
cases, the motivation is pretty clear: To inexpensively tap into
the Internet market by training one's own people rather than hiring
recruits directly from college or spending a fortune to woo more
qualified applicants who won't stay longer than a year.
</P>
<P>
   CitySoft is an example with an altruistic twist: When it
launched its Web development firm three years, it recruited
directly from Boston neighborhoods bypassed by the cyber
revolution, and also offered in-house training.
</P>
<P>
   Among its recruits: a 23-year-old who was earning $7 per hour
and struggling to pay for night school. When I interviewed Kelby
Mendes several months ago, he was earning $11 per hour developing
Web pages and was back in school.
</P>
<P>
   Prince and Drake of the Screen House were reluctant to reveal
their employees' earnings, though one worker indicated he now makes
about the same as a recent college graduate _ about half of what a
techie in such a competitive field with the same job title could
expect to earn.
</P>
<P>
   The company's owners weren't reticent about their firm's
earnings. Founded with $500, the Screen House expects gross sales
of about $16 million by year's end.

   BUDAPEST _ The Cold War may be over, but international intrigue
swirls like cigarette smoke once again in the ornate Hapsburg-era
cafes of the Hungarian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The talk at the coffeehouse tables is of plots and midnight
liaisons, as the city hosts a new generation of secret agents.
</P>
<P>
   That sharply-suited man watching for his contact as he sips an
early morning coffee could just as likely be trading in classified
information as stocks and shares.
</P>
<P>
   Budapest is now the new spy capital of eastern Europe, as
competing secret services run elaborate intelligence-gathering
operations, both in the city and along the country's border
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Like postwar Vienna, immortalized in Orson Welles' classic film
noir, ``The Third Man,'' Budapest is now unwilling host to a host
of intelligence agencies, several of which are hostile to western
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Western intelligence services are also monitoring the activities
of several organized crime syndicates from the former Soviet Union
who use Budapest as their forward base.
</P>
<P>
   More spies have begun operating in Hungary in the last few
months, said Secret Services Minister Laszlo Kover, as Hungary's
NATO membership challenges local superpower interests as well those
of regional neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian intelligence services now supply information to their
western partners, he told the daily newspaper Vilaggazdasag.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary's geographical position and long experience of dealing
with Balkan and Slavic neighbors gives its agents a head start in
the intelligence race, as well as a sharper insight into the
regional mind-set than that of western analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on the northern rim of the Balkans and the former
Yugoslavia, bordering the former Soviet Union, Hungary offers
unrivalled opportunities for information gathering, particularly
since Hungary, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, joined
NATO last year.
</P>
<P>
   And straddling the dividing line between east and west, Hungary
shares borders with seven countries, from Austria to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any geo-strategic capital where there is a melting pot of east
and west and north and south is bound to be the target of hostile
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budapest is a traditional meeting place, on the great trade
routes between east and west, a place to find things out, like
Nicosia,'' said a western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was powerless to stop NATO's expansion into its
former sphere of influence, Russia _ especially its army and
defense ministry _ is known to be deeply unhappy about the
Alliance's eastward spread.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary assumed a vital strategic role during the NATO onslaught
on Serbia last spring. As a country bordering Serbia, with a
substantial ethnic Hungarian population within Yugoslavia itself,
it was a natural target for infiltration by Serbian agents.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of Serbian spying activity at the country's
two NATO air bases, at Taszar and Kaposvar, both in the south of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Budapest was also the meeting place of choice for clandestine
contacts between Serbs and Croats during the Yugoslav wars.
</P>
<P>
   The current strong cooperation between Hungarian and western
intelligence services cannot gloss over several embarrassing black
spots in the country's recent past.
</P>
<P>
   The world's most notorious terrorist, Carlos the Jackal, found
safe haven in Hungary for several years under the regime of the
former Communist leader Janos Kadar.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian army is now a NATO force, but many of its officers
were trained in Moscow, from where they returned with wives and
other strong ties to Russia. As a member of the former Socialist
bloc, Hungary also had trade ties with states such as Iraq, Iran
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian officials say that suspect intelligence and military
officials who were unable to make the necessary about-face from
Communism, to capitalism and the west, either retired or left after
the new reality was explained to them.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians argue that the former ties to the Soviet bloc gives
them an advantage in dealing with Moscow as they understand the
Russian modus operandi. &QL;

   ``Who now remembers the Armenians?'' Hitler asked, just before
he embarked on the destruction of European Jewry.
</P>
<P>
   Precious few, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   As the memorial day for the Nazi genocide against the Jews was
proclaimed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair last week, there
was not a single reference to the slaughter of one and a half
million Armenian Christians by the Ottoman Turks in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first holocaust _ and Hitler's inspiration for the
slaughter of the Jews _ was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Why, I wonder? Blair did not mention it. French President
Jacques Chirac is frightened of the very subject, refusing even to
condemn the slaughter when he last visited Beirut, where the
grandchildren of the victims live in their tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The United States government prefers to forget the holocaust of
Armenians, while the Turks _ the inheritors of the empire that
committed the worst atrocities of the First World War _ are
studiously denying the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   And we let them get away with it. Who, I wonder, chooses which
holocaust we should remember and which we should not?
</P>
<P>
   The six million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis must always
have a place in our history, our memory, our fears. Never again.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, the Armenians who perished in the rivers of southern
Turkey, who were slaughtered in their tens of thousands in the
deserts of northern Syria, whose wives and daughters were
gang-raped and knifed to death by the gendarmerie and their Kurdish
militiamen _ they have no place in our memory or our history.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is our friend. Turkey might one day join the European
Union. Turkey is an ally of Israel. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History, of course, is a hard taskmaster, veined with
inconvenient facts and corrupted heroes as well as the massacre of
innocents.
</P>
<P>
   The Armenian community in Turkey had its Allied sympathizers
when the Ottoman army was fighting the British and French in the
First World War, and Armenians also fought in the czarist Russian
army against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But the proof of genocide is intact. The Young Turk movement _
once a liberal organization which the Armenians had supported _ had
taken control of the dying empire and adopted a ``pan-Turkism''
which espoused a Turkish-speaking Muslim nation from Constantinople
to Baku.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of their victory over the Allies at the Dardanelles
in 1915, they fell upon the Armenians. Churchill was to refer to
the ``merciless fury'' unleashed upon the Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador in Constantinople _ himself a Jew _ wrote
heart-wrenching reports back to Washington of mass slaughter. Near
the Turkish village of Mus, hundreds of men were lined up on
bridges and shot into the rivers, Serb-style. &QL;

<P>
   Behind the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in Poland, I was once taken
by a camp guide to a series of small lakes in which the Nazis
dumped the ash of the crematoria. Beneath the water and ice lay the
powdered white bones of whole cities of people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the north Syrian desert there are still skulls and bones
in caves and in the clay of river banks.
</P>
<P>
   This place of martyrdom is visited once a year by the local
Armenian community to commemorate their holocaust. They even have a
holocaust memorial day. Yet I wonder if a single non-Armenian
reader of The Independent knows what the date is?
</P>
<P>
   Denial of the holocaust is in some countries a crime. I'm
talking, of course, about the Jewish Holocaust _ because denial of
the Armenian holocaust is not only perfectly legal, it is big
business.
</P>
<P>
   No American company selling weapons to Turkey will discuss the
holocaust of 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Chairs of Ottoman studies are being funded by the Turkish
government at American universities in which U.S. academics _ who
have to prove they have used Ottoman archives to get their jobs and
thus must never have condemned the 1915 slaughters _ propagate the
lie that the Armenians were merely victims of ``civil war'' and
that Turks also died in the chaos of 1915. Turks did. But not on
the Armenian scale.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who was to write that the Jews were victims of a European
civil war and that, anyway, ``Germans also died'' would be regarded
as cracked or a neo-Nazi. Not so if you deny the Armenian
holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Take the following letter, for example: ``The myth of the
`Armenian Holocaust' was created immediately after World War I with
the hope that the Armenians could be rewarded for their
`sufferings' with a piece of the disintegrating Ottoman state. As
such, the main aims of the inventors were political and
territorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Now substitute the word Armenian with the word Jew. Who would
ever get away with a letter about the ``myth of the Jewish
Holocaust'' as an invention of Jews who wanted to be rewarded for
``sufferings'' (the quotation marks suggesting their falsity)? Who
would ever publish such lies?
</P>
<P>
   But that letter was written about the Armenians. And it was
written by a Turkish ambassador. In fact _ heaven spare us _ it was
written by Barlas Ozener, the Turkish ambassador to Israel. And it
was printed, in full, in the Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
   But we Europeans are just as mendacious, if more discreetly so.
Take Chirac in Beirut. The French Assembly had just condemned the
Armenian holocaust of 1915 _ there are men of principle in French
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But not Chirac. When asked less than two years ago for his views
on the resolution, he replied: ``I do not comment on a matter of
domestic (sic) politics when I'm abroad.'' Would that have been his
response if the Assembly had just denounced the Jewish Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   Blair said last week that as the Jewish survivors of the Nazi
Holocaust ``age and become fewer in number, it becomes more and
more our duty to take up the mantle and tell each new generation
what happened and what could happen again''
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few very Armenian survivors left. Why weren't
they asked last week about their memories?
</P>
<P>
   At Musa Dagh and later at Smyrna in 1920, British, French and
American warships rescued a few of the pitiful Armenian survivors
of that earlier Holocaust. But Blair was silent last week. And
silence gives consent.
</P>
<P>
   I am all for memorial days. Especially one that marks the Jewish
Holocaust. And especially memorial days for other holocausts.
Armenians too.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitler's ghost had a little laugh last week. After all, who
now remembers the Armenians? &QL;

government at American universities in which U.S. academics _ who
have to prove they have used Ottoman archives to get their jobs and
thus must never have condemned the 1915 slaughters _ propagate the
lie that the Armenians were merely victims of ``civil war'' and
that Turks also died in the chaos of 1915. Turks did. But not on
the Armenian scale.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who was to write that the Jews were victims of a European
civil war and that, anyway, ``Germans also died'' would be regarded
as cracked or a neo-Nazi. Not so if you deny the Armenian
holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Take the following letter, for example: ``The myth of the
`Armenian Holocaust' was created immediately after World War I with
the hope that the Armenians could be rewarded for their
`sufferings' with a piece of the disintegrating Ottoman state. As
such, the main aims of the inventors were political and
territorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Now substitute the word Armenian with the word Jew. Who would
ever get away with a letter about the ``myth of the Jewish
Holocaust'' as an invention of Jews who wanted to be rewarded for
``sufferings'' (the quotation marks suggesting their falsity)? Who
would ever publish such lies?
</P>
<P>
   But that letter was written about the Armenians. And it was
written by a Turkish ambassador. In fact _ heaven spare us _ it was
written by Barlas Ozener, the Turkish ambassador to Israel. And it
was printed, in full, in the Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
   But we Europeans are just as mendacious, if more discreetly so.
Take Chirac in Beirut. The French Assembly had just condemned the
Armenian holocaust of 1915 _ there are men of principle in French
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But not Chirac. When asked less than two years ago for his views
on the resolution, he replied: ``I do not comment on a matter of
domestic (sic) politics when I'm abroad.'' Would that have been his
response if the Assembly had just denounced the Jewish Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   Blair said last week that as the Jewish survivors of the Nazi
Holocaust ``age and become fewer in number, it becomes more and
more our duty to take up the mantle and tell each new generation
what happened and what could happen again''
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few very Armenian survivors left. Why weren't
they asked last week about their memories?
</P>
<P>
   At Musa Dagh and later at Smyrna in 1920, British, French and
American warships rescued a few of the pitiful Armenian survivors
of that earlier Holocaust. But Blair was silent last week. And
silence gives consent.
</P>
<P>
   I am all for memorial days. Especially one that marks the Jewish
Holocaust. And especially memorial days for other holocausts.
Armenians too.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitler's ghost had a little laugh last week. After all, who
now remembers the Armenians? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It took less than a year for Hope and Will Chen
to become millionaires _ eight months, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   The husband and wife team, recent graduates of Harvard Business
School, started their Silicon Valley company in September 1998. By
April 1999, they had sold their Internet start-up, Billpoint Inc.,
which provided technology for credit card transactions, to eBay
Inc. for $125 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Will Chen, now 31 and on his second start-up, says it's the kind
of story that makes budding entrepreneurs think: ``I can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what legions of young business school graduates
have in mind as they pour into Northern California, business plan
in hand and success stories like that of the Chens' dancing in
their heads. Whereas graduates of top business schools once made a
beeline to the world's consulting firms and investment banks,
increasing numbers are foregoing the security of established East
Coast companies and migrating westward into the perilous realm of
technology start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   What drives them to the Valley, say Chen and other recent New
England expatriates here, is a culture fueled by risk.
</P>
<P>
   Chatri Trisiripisal, who spent three years as an analyst at
Fidelity Investments before starting eFrenzy in San Francisco last
year, tries to put his finger on what he calls the ``it factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like Hollywood, where the directors, actors, and
production companies are all here in one place,'' said
Trisiripisal, whose company is an on-line marketplace for personal
and professional services. ``Everyone here is used to taking risks
on revolutionary new concepts and maverick companies, on the idea
that a company can make it overnight. Employees get it. Accountants
get it. Law firms get it. Even our landlord gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trisiripisal, 28, is negotiating with the company's landlord for
$300,000 in free rent in exchange for equity in eFrenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can only happen here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, young business school graduates have always trekked
westward to Silicon Valley. What's different today is the lightning
speed with which fortunes are being made and the torrential volume
of venture dollars coursing through the area, giving a new
intensity to the siren call of the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new about MIT people going out to Silicon
Valley,'' said Kenneth P. Morse, managing director of the
Entrepreneurship Center at MIT. ``What's changed is that more Sloan
students are starting up businesses now, and they're doing it much
earlier in their careers. The entrepreneurship track at MIT has
grown from 20 students three years ago to about 100 students this
year. The interest among students in entrepreneurialism has been
exponential.''
</P>
<P>
   So has the interest in Silicon Valley. Earlier this month, 130
MIT Sloan students, roughly one in five enrolled at the school,
came out on their own dime to visit 60 technology companies and
venture capitalists, up from 70 students and 30 companies last
year, according to Rami Habal, an MIT student who organized this
year's California trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's either working on a business plan or they want to
join a start-up,'' said Habal, 27. ``It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, 500 students from Harvard Business School _
about 25 percent of the school's student body _ came to the Valley
to visit 200 companies, ranging from eBay, the on-line auction
house, to eLance.com, an Internet marketplace for professional
freelancers. That's up from 75 students and 40 companies in 1996,
when the trips first began, said Dan Senor, one of 50 student
coordinators who put this year's ``WesTrek'' event together.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, fewer than five Harvard Business School graduates
immediately started their own companies upon graduating, said Linda
Carrigan, director of recruiting for the school. In 1999, 5 percent
of the school's graduating class of about 900 students have started
their own ventures, Carrigan estimated. ``There's just more
opportunity now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that happens in California, Carrigan said. For both MIT
and Harvard business schools, the Northern California alumni clubs
are their largest and most active worldwide, school officials said.
Each sponsor a plethora of forums, cocktail events, and
``cyberposiums,'' all increasingly geared at helping alumni
jump-start their own companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many East Coast business schools have created outposts in the
Bay Area that provide networking opportunities and services for
their alumni. Harvard has a research office in Palo Alto, as does
Dartmouth College's Amos Tuck School of Business. Wharton, which
sent 400 students on a visit to Silicon Valley three weeks ago, has
an office in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuck, the number of California-bound graduates is on the
rise. In 1995, 9 percent of graduates came to California. This
year, more than 17 percent will end up here, according to Steven
Lubrano, Tuck's director of career services. One in five graduates
will head into tech fields, a surge from four years ago when 8
percent entered technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This borders on being a tsunami,'' said Phil Anderson,
associate professor at Tuck and research director for the Hanover,
N.H., school's Foster Center for Private Equity. ``What's driving
them is not just financial opportunity in Silicon Valley. It's the
sheer excitement. What brings people out there is the conviction
that they can make a difference the minute they graduate and join a
dot-com.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students don't even wait to graduate. Jason Salfen, 26,
took a leave from Sloan last year to help start eDentalStore, which
sell equipment and supplies to dentists, in Burlingame, Calif.,
just south of San Francisco. It wasn't what he had in mind when he
entered Sloan in the fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a career path,'' said Salfen, who worked three years as
a strategic consultant for Arthur D. Little before going to
business school. ``I was going to go into investment banking to
learn financing, then join a midsized technology company to learn
organizational processes. Then I was going to start my own company.
But this idea came along, and it was just the right time. There are
very few markets left untapped on the Internet, and this is one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Nelson and Chip Baird, both 27 and first-year Harvard
Business School students, teamed up with a husband and wife couple
in Alameda, Calif., last year to start an on-line shoe and
accessory store called DragonflyShoes.com. Nelson, who is from
Maine, is the chief financial officer, and Baird, a native of Rhode
Island, is the president of the start-up. Both zip out to
California every six weeks or so _ between classes in which they
read case studies of instant Internet success stories like the
Chens'.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rewards are significant, and you can attain them much
quicker,'' said Will Chen, who is shepherding his second venture,
OnePage.com Inc. of Redwood City, a developer of personalized home
pages. ``Within a year or two, you can build a company, make a
difference in the world with technology, go public or sell your
company, and all of a sudden you've become a millionaire.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can Europe, or indeed Japan and the rest of Asia, ever catch up?
</P>
<P>
   Last week the American boom becomes the longest in the country's
history. It is an interesting statistic for Britons, because we
experienced that particular delight _ our longest boom _ in the
middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, hardly anybody noticed. But it is a statistic that raises
fundamental questions about the changing nature of economic
success, as well, of course, as about the durability of the
American boom.
</P>
<P>
   It also, as the euro falls ever lower against the dollar, raises
uncomfortable questions about Europe's future economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The discomfort is all the greater because that is not as it was
meant to be. Put aside the plight of the euro, because at some
stage it will eventually recover, and recall the dismissive
attitude to the U.S. that was prevalent on the Continent for most
of the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the decade, most Europeans criticized
American business for its lack of dynamism, its failure to invest
enough and its emphasis on price rather than quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the decade, the line of attack shifted to
criticizing American corporate brutality, the ways in which
businesses were bought and sold and the way workers were ``let
go.'' Yes, the U.S. might be becoming more competitive, but it was
at unacceptable social costs.
</P>
<P>
   You still hear the second line of attack now, though it has been
blunted by the success of the U.S. in creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   What, one may ask, is more brutal: making people shift jobs
frequently or condemning them to unemployment? But the European
perception now seems to have shifted to one of bewilderment and
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   What on earth are the Americans doing that has enabled them to
be so successful, and surely that success cannot really last? There
seem to me to be three elements to the American success story that
continental Europeans in particular would be wise to note.
</P>
<P>
   Not Britons? Well, yes, we need to note, too, but we are already
something of a halfway house between the Continent and the U.S.,
not just culturally but in the performance of the economy. Ours has
grown more rapidly than any big European economy over the last
eight years, but more slowly than the American.
</P>
<P>
   The first element of U.S. success is that the key difference
between the States and everyone else is not in the quality of its
big businesses but rather in its ability to create new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Look at, say, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Unilever: there is not that
big a difference between them. If, on the other hand, you look at
new businesses, there is a radical difference.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not just that in Europe we create fewer new
businesses, it is also that very few of the ones we do create grow
to be really big, at least on the time-scale of the U.S. We have no
Microsoft, no Intel, no AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The high performance of the U.S. has been driven, more than
anything else, by such hi-tech companies. If you can create a few
of them, they will pull along the rest. Roughly three-quarters of
U.S. growth last year came from sectors of the economy that barely
existed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the second element of U.S. success: the ability to
develop commercial applications for new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, to generalize, would rather have the kudos of
inventing something than the dosh from applying it. Sadly, it is
the applications that drive economies forward, not the inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the growing importance of the English language. Look
around the world _ virtually all English-speaking economies are
growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the native speakers, though, countries that speak
English well (Sweden, the Netherlands) are storming along, while
those that speak it badly (most notably Japan) are struggling. It
is wholly unfair, but during the Nineties English quite became the
default language for the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, what are the lessons? I think that the
non-American world has to accept that the U.S. will remain the
dominant economy for the next 20 years, maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the U.S. boom will come to an end, as will ours. But the
forces that created the success story will continue, so when the
U.S. economy recovers it will experience another burst of growth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, there is a choice for the rest of us. Do we
cooperate or do we compete?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we should try to imitate the reasons for America's
success: create a tax and regulatory climate that encourages
business start-ups and, if we can, a culture that seeks commercial
applications for new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And for countries that do not speak English, they had better
learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperate or compete?'' is the great strategic issue and one
that is of particular importance to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct of much of continental Europe is to compete: to
create, in the EU, a counterbalance to American economic power.
Some Europeans are quite explicit about that. For example, the
advocates of the euro seek to create a rival to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A large section of the British establishment also takes that
line, believing that the best economic option for Britain is to
compete against the U.S., using the much larger European market as
a base. Under that strategy, Britain should try to help Europe to
catch up with the U.S. by trying to teach it Anglo-Saxon ways.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative view is that we should cooperate with the U.S.,
acting, so to speak, as the chief subcontractor for America in the
European time zone.
</P>
<P>
   In practice we already do that, being the chief recipient for
U.S. investment in Europe. During the last year, such a view has
tended to gain ground as the U.S. boom has continued and the
British economy has again outpaced the German and Italian
economies.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of actual GDP at market prices, we will also have
become larger than France, though whether that position will last
will depend on the durability of the present sterling exchange
rate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, there is one other reason to believe that
America's out-performance will continue, maybe not every year, but
on average through the next two decades. It is demography.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. will gradually become the youngest of the Group of
Seven nations over the next 20 years, while Germany and Italy, with
their very low birth rates, become very old.
</P>
<P>
   Young countries tend to grow faster than old ones, as countries
with a high proportion of retired people have to spend more and
more of their income on supporting the old, instead of investing in
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is somewhere in between continental Europe and the U.S.
in its demographic profile: our traditional mid-Atlantic status
applies even to demography.
</P>
<P>
   From a UK point of view, therefore, it seems most rational to
celebrate the long American boom and to regard as irrelevant
whether Europe and Japan catch up or not.
</P>
<P>
   If continental Europe does recover a bit of ground vis-a-vis the
U.S., that is great, because as the most U.S.-oriented European
economy, we will be pulled along by that progress.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, we have plan B: promote our role as
subcontractor to American business, acting as the best entry point
into the European market but also creating intellectual products
that we can sell into the North American one.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the U.S. boom surely conveys one overriding message:
somehow or other we should continue to hitch our wagon to the
American star. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can Europe, or indeed Japan and the rest of Asia, ever catch up?
</P>
<P>
   Last week the American boom becomes the longest in the country's
history. It is an interesting statistic for Britons, because we
experienced that particular delight _ our longest boom _ in the
middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, hardly anybody noticed. But it is a statistic that raises
fundamental questions about the changing nature of economic
success, as well, of course, as about the durability of the
American boom.
</P>
<P>
   It also, as the euro falls ever lower against the dollar, raises
uncomfortable questions about Europe's future economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The discomfort is all the greater because that is not as it was
meant to be. Put aside the plight of the euro, because at some
stage it will eventually recover, and recall the dismissive
attitude to the U.S. that was prevalent on the Continent for most
of the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the decade, most Europeans criticized
American business for its lack of dynamism, its failure to invest
enough and its emphasis on price rather than quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the decade, the line of attack shifted to
criticizing American corporate brutality, the ways in which
businesses were bought and sold and the way workers were ``let
go.'' Yes, the U.S. might be becoming more competitive, but it was
at unacceptable social costs.
</P>
<P>
   You still hear the second line of attack now, though it has been
blunted by the success of the U.S. in creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   What, one may ask, is more brutal: making people shift jobs
frequently or condemning them to unemployment? But the European
perception now seems to have shifted to one of bewilderment and
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   What on earth are the Americans doing that has enabled them to
be so successful, and surely that success cannot really last? There
seem to me to be three elements to the American success story that
continental Europeans in particular would be wise to note.
</P>
<P>
   Not Britons? Well, yes, we need to note, too, but we are already
something of a halfway house between the Continent and the U.S.,
not just culturally but in the performance of the economy. Ours has
grown more rapidly than any big European economy over the last
eight years, but more slowly than the American.
</P>
<P>
   The first element of U.S. success is that the key difference
between the States and everyone else is not in the quality of its
big businesses but rather in its ability to create new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Look at, say, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Unilever: there is not that
big a difference between them. If, on the other hand, you look at
new businesses, there is a radical difference.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not just that in Europe we create fewer new
businesses, it is also that very few of the ones we do create grow
to be really big, at least on the time-scale of the U.S. We have no
Microsoft, no Intel, no AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The high performance of the U.S. has been driven, more than
anything else, by such hi-tech companies. If you can create a few
of them, they will pull along the rest. Roughly three-quarters of
U.S. growth last year came from sectors of the economy that barely
existed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the second element of U.S. success: the ability to
develop commercial applications for new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, to generalize, would rather have the kudos of
inventing something than the dosh from applying it. Sadly, it is
the applications that drive economies forward, not the inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the growing importance of the English language. Look
around the world _ virtually all English-speaking economies are
growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the native speakers, though, countries that speak
English well (Sweden, the Netherlands) are storming along, while
those that speak it badly (most notably Japan) are struggling. It
is wholly unfair, but during the Nineties English quite became the
default language for the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, what are the lessons? I think that the
non-American world has to accept that the U.S. will remain the
dominant economy for the next 20 years, maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the U.S. boom will come to an end, as will ours. But the
forces that created the success story will continue, so when the
U.S. economy recovers it will experience another burst of growth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, there is a choice for the rest of us. Do we
cooperate or do we compete?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we should try to imitate the reasons for America's
success: create a tax and regulatory climate that encourages
business start-ups and, if we can, a culture that seeks commercial
applications for new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And for countries that do not speak English, they had better
learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperate or compete?'' is the great strategic issue and one
that is of particular importance to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct of much of continental Europe is to compete: to
create, in the EU, a counterbalance to American economic power.
Some Europeans are quite explicit about that. For example, the
advocates of the euro seek to create a rival to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A large section of the British establishment also takes that
line, believing that the best economic option for Britain is to
compete against the U.S., using the much larger European market as
a base. Under that strategy, Britain should try to help Europe to
catch up with the U.S. by trying to teach it Anglo-Saxon ways.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative view is that we should cooperate with the U.S.,
acting, so to speak, as the chief subcontractor for America in the
European time zone.
</P>
<P>
   In practice we already do that, being the chief recipient for
U.S. investment in Europe. During the last year, such a view has
tended to gain ground as the U.S. boom has continued and the
British economy has again outpaced the German and Italian
economies.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of actual GDP at market prices, we will also have
become larger than France, though whether that position will last
will depend on the durability of the present sterling exchange
rate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, there is one other reason to believe that
America's out-performance will continue, maybe not every year, but
on average through the next two decades. It is demography.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. will gradually become the youngest of the Group of
Seven nations over the next 20 years, while Germany and Italy, with
their very low birth rates, become very old.
</P>
<P>
   Young countries tend to grow faster than old ones, as countries
with a high proportion of retired people have to spend more and
more of their income on supporting the old, instead of investing in
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is somewhere in between continental Europe and the U.S.
in its demographic profile: our traditional mid-Atlantic status
applies even to demography.
</P>
<P>
   From a UK point of view, therefore, it seems most rational to
celebrate the long American boom and to regard as irrelevant
whether Europe and Japan catch up or not.
</P>
<P>
   If continental Europe does recover a bit of ground vis-a-vis the
U.S., that is great, because as the most U.S.-oriented European
economy, we will be pulled along by that progress.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, we have plan B: promote our role as
subcontractor to American business, acting as the best entry point
into the European market but also creating intellectual products
that we can sell into the North American one.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the U.S. boom surely conveys one overriding message:
somehow or other we should continue to hitch our wagon to the
American star. &QL;

BIOTECHNOLOGY IS BACK, AND GENOMICS IS LEADING THE WAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   While dot-com stocks have hogged the limelight recently,
biotechnology has been a backwater for investors. But now, thanks
to fresh investor interest in the emerging field of genomics,
biotech is regaining some of its luster.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have started a love affair with biotechnology
companies that decipher human genes and turn the information into
technology for creating the next generation of drugs and diagnostic
tests.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 60 days, stock prices of more than a dozen genomics
companies have experienced runups akin to those of Internet stars
like Amazon.com Inc. and Akamai Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., a pioneer
in the emerging field, surged to 200 a share earlier this month
before falling and closing Friday at 185 1/2, giving it a market
capitalization of $8.24 billion. CuraGen Corp. of New Haven, a
relative newcomer, has seen its stock price more than triple since
Dec. 1, to 93 3/8, and Caliper Technologies Inc. of Mountain View,
Calif., has soared from its $16 a share initial public offering
Dec. 14 to 124 7/8 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1991, when the first biotechnology frenzy led to
scores of new companies and soaring stock prices, has there been
such ardent investor interest in biotech.
</P>
<P>
   It's sweet revenge. For much of the last five years, biotech had
been a stepchild on Wall Street as investors focused on the
glamorous dot-com stocks. As a result, initial public offerings of
biotech companies dried up and venture capital went elsewhere.
Biotech began to shake off its doldrums last year, when stock
prices of major companies such as Biogen Inc. and Amgen Corp. began
to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investors are making big bets on the budding field of
genomics. By identifying genes in the human body and their links to
diseases, genomics companies can provide researchers with
information and tools for developing a new generation of drugs to
treat and prevent illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Since genomics promises to do a better job than traditional
biology and chemistry in identifying the fundamental causes and
pathways of disease, there's a potential to dramatically shorten
the time to find new drugs and
</P>
<P>
   to boost their chances of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can expect that genomics over the next five to 10 years
will lead to a higher efficiency rate in the success of new drugs,
so instead of one out of 10 drugs making it, we might start to see
two out of five,'' said Richard A. van den Broek, biotechnology
analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. However, he warned not to expect any
change in the time required to test drugs, which will remain the
same under US Food and Drug Administration regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the genomics boom is the expected announcement this
spring of the ``first draft'' of the human genome, the spelling out
of the precise sequence of the 3 billion letters in the 100,000
genes of the human body. This identification and mapping of the
genome, part of which was done at the Whitehead
Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Genomic
Research, is being performed under the aegis of the
government-sponsored Human Genome Project. The decade-long
endeavor, which is expected to be completed in 2003, is an early
step toward understanding the basic mechanics of the human body and
the fundamental causes of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts maintain the price boom among biotech stocks began
last November when the National Institutes of Health said it had
mapped all the gene sequences in a single chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the human genetic code have been known for several
years, prompting researchers at biotechnology and pharmaceutical
companies to use this new knowledge to begin developing drugs to
treat certain diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. is expected to launch
human testing of a proposed antiobesity drug, based on five years
of research by Millennium. The Cambridge firm helped identify the
genes that cause obesity and developed a proposed drug compound
Hoffmann-La Roche plans to test.
</P>
<P>
   And in the coming months, Becton Dickinson &AMP; Co. will unveil a
melanoma test, developed with Millennium genomics technology, that
will predict how serious a cancerous mole is and the likelihood of
it spreading.
</P>
<P>
   The great promise of genomics is its ability to help scientists
identify an individual's genetic makeup. This would enable
researchers to both tailor or fine-tune drugs for specific people
and develop preventive medicines. Ultimately, the DNA testing done
by the genomics industry will make possible a day when an
individual could carry his or her genetic identity around on a
computer chip or a card. That would greatly enhance doctors'
ability to prescribe medicines tailored to the individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to see the early signs of personalized
medicine, where in the next five to 10 years you will have your
genome on a chip that will follow you around and make it possible
for early prediction or detection of disease plus more accurate
diagnosis with personalized medications,'' said Mark Levin,
Millennium chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will scientists learn to diagnose diseases by analyzing
an individual's genes, they will also go beyond detecting and
treating illnesses to predicting and preventing them _ with the
ultimate promise of longer lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``With genomics we are now in the third wave of medicine,'' said
Jonathan Rothenberg, founder and president of CuraGen, which is
developing genomics and information technology to speed up the
development of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first was when the pharmaceutical industry got started to
stamp out germs that were considered the causes of diseases,
followed more recently by biotechnology where you replace in the
body something that is missing or deficient such as human growth
hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   Genomics, he noted, is based on addressing the root cause of
diseases _ ``what you are born with _ variations in your genes _
and the environment you live in.''
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly two-dozen publicly traded companies in the
genomics field. Several of them, such as Millennium and Human
Genome Sciences of Rockville, Md., use genomics to develop drugs
for their pharmaceutical partners and on their own. Others such as
Genome Therapeutics of Waltham, Celera Genomics Group of Rockville,
Md., and Incyte Pharmaceuticals of Palo Alto, Calif., specialize in
selling genetic information to help others develop new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Affymetrix Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., and
Caliper sell products and services that let researchers quickly
test thousands of genes using a ``biochip'' that contains DNA
fragments for testing drugs. Scientists insert biochips into
laboratory analysis equipment to perform thousands of biochemical
experiments simultaneously at a fraction of the cost and time
required for traditional tests.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most volatile and closely followed in the group is
Celera Genomics, a subsidiary of PE Corp. of Norwalk, Conn., which
has its own stock that hit a recent high of 267 5/8 before
dropping. Formed less than three years ago by Dr. J. Craig Venter,
a former National Institutes of Health researcher, Celera has an
ambitious plan to map the entire 3 billion letters of human DNA
that comprise the human genome by 2001 _ two years ahead of the
publicly funded National Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   Less ambitious are a cluster of recently formed private
companies backed by venture capitalists that are focused on
interpreting how genetic diversity affects the usefulness and side
effects of drugs. Often, using biochips, the goal is to detect
genetic differences, such as the misspelling of a single letter of
the genetic code. These distinctions are known as single nucleotide
polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced ``snips'').
</P>
<P>
   Some broad-based cancer drugs, for example, only work in 30
percent of the population. By knowing which group of people are
best suited for a drug, based on the patients' genetic traits, drug
companies can better tailor medications to an individual's needs.
This has led to the creation of new genomics companies such as
Variagenics Inc. of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developing drugs to treat certain diseases that work best for
certain groups of people based on their genetic makeup is starting
to take off,'' said Peter Feinstein, general partner of Bioventure
Investors, a new biotech venture fund in Worcester, Mass.
``Genomics is akin to Internet investing. Just as e-commerce has
changed retailing so will genomics impact medical practices, except
it will take a lot longer. This is just the beginning,'' he said.

 THE SCHOLAR WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ Sitting at her kitchen table sipping a cup
of tea, her curly hair pinned behind her ears, Darra Goldstein
looks like a beautiful Russian heroine.
</P>
<P>
   She is describing a dinner she ate recently at the Russian Tea
Room in New York. She and her husband, Dean Crawford, were
celebrating their daughter Leila's ninth birthday. The chef
presented a dessert that was so high, it came up to the girl's
chin. ``It was a chocolate mousse cake, which was underneath a
molded chocolate goblet,'' says Goldstein. A white chocolate
greeting card wishing Leila ``Happy Birthday'' was tucked into the
goblet. ``It was filled with three scoops of different fruit
sorbets and topped with a dome made from dark chocolate and white
chocolate. It looked like an onion dome _ like the one on St.
Basil's Cathedral in Red Square.'' She laughs. ``Oh, I forgot: The
whole thing was covered with a sugar cage of spun sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of thing you love or hate,'' says Goldstein. The
same can be said for everything in the outlandish, wildly
expensive, newly renovated Russian Tea Room. She loves it.
</P>
<P>
   But she has a vested interest.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Goldstein began working as a consultant to the
Russian Tea Room. It was a project she had discussed years ago with
owner Warner LeRoy, but it kept getting stalled. Then, midway
through her three-semester sabbatical from Williams College, where
she is a professor of Russian language and literature, LeRoy
called, and Goldstein started taking the train to New York once or
twice a week to taste food. ``If something veered too far afield
from what conceivably could be part of the Russian palate, or the
spirit of Russian dining, my role was to pull them back and remind
them what that was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It's demanding work, but it's just one piece of what she's been
up to during this unusually fruitful break from teaching. In the
past 18 months, Goldstein has become the editor of a food journal,
Gastronomica, which the University of California Press plans to
start publishing in January 2001. She started editing a series of
books on food and culture, also for the University of California
Press. ``That just happened to coincide with my leave,'' she says.
And all three of her cookbooks _ ``A Taste of Russia'' (Russian
Life Books), which she wrote while she was still in graduate
school; ``The Georgian Feast'' (University of California Press);
and ``The Winter Vegetarian'' (HarperCollins) _ were reissued this
year. ``Another happy coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   If a sabbatical is supposed to give academics time to explore
other things and refresh themselves, consider Goldstein refreshed.
``I thrive on activity,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But if she'd had more time, she would have done even more.
``What I planned to do _ and it's the one thing I didn't quite
finish _ was a book on the cultural history of Russian food,'' she
says. ``I got up to the 18th century.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll finish the book eventually. Meanwhile, she has turned the
research into a new course at Williams, ``Topics in Russian
Culture: Feasting and Fasting in Russian History,'' which she'll
start teaching when she returns from her sabbatical this week.
Students will read about art, agriculture, revolutions, and the
Russian stove, the focal point of the old peasant cottage.
</P>
<P>
   They're topics that have engaged Goldstein, 48, for a long time.
It was 25 years ago that she began doctoral work at Stanford
University and told her adviser she wanted to write her
dissertation on food and Russian literature. There's plenty to say,
she notes wryly. ``Descriptions of food take the place of
descriptions of sex in Russian literature.''
</P>
<P>
   But the adviser said no. ``I was told it wasn't a serious
topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she wrote about Nikolai Zabolotsky, one of the great
poets of the 20th century. And when she put together the
``Culture'' syllabus for Williams, she was careful to design a very
rigorous course. ``I had to make it irreproachable,'' she says.
``There are still people who don't perceive the study of food as a
serious pursuit, partly because it's pleasurable. And whatever is
pleasurable can't be intellectual _ it's related too much to the
gut instead of the intellect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream course for me,'' she says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Warmth but no heat &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it's a dream course for the Williams Russian
department as well. During the Cold War, Goldstein explains,
everyone wanted to study Russian. ``It was the whole idea of Russia
being the Evil Empire that we had to defend ourselves against.''
But then the Soviet Union fell, and with it fell students' interest
in learning Russian. So the department started trying to figure out
how to draw the larger community in. ``This seemed like a good
way,'' Goldstein says of her course.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, there are tremendous opportunities for her
students to work in Russia and other former Soviet states _
something they couldn't have done in the Evil Empire. Enrollments
for Russian language courses, which were way down, are inching up.
``We need to understand the Russians and work with them,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, during January study period at Williams,
Goldstein took a group of college students to Georgia, where she
had set up an exchange program with Tbilisi State University. It
has been running for a dozen years, except for a hiatus during
Georgia's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The Tbilisi exchange, now part of a consortium with Mount
Holyoke and Wellesley colleges, offers 2 1/2-week internships in
hospitals, science laboratories, and government offices, or
wherever students want to work.
</P>
<P>
   Most are not Russian majors, but some have found their careers
through the program. Several Williams graduates from Goldstein's
first exchange are now working in Georgia. ``One is the consul at
the US Embassy, another is regional director of Eurasia Foundation,
which is a humanitarian aid group, and another is working for the
World Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is a place Goldstein loves. One of the southern states
in the former Soviet Union, it has what she calls ``an amazingly
rich culture. The people are very welcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   So welcoming, in fact, that ``the hospitality can become
burdensome. I sort of rolled out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   What Georgia has in friendliness and good cuisine, it lacks in
infrastructure. The electricity goes off for hours at a time. ``It
was quite difficult where I was staying. Usually it came on for two
hours in the morning and some hours at night.''
</P>
<P>
   In many old buildings, no electricity meant no heat. And this
has been a particularly cold winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was extraordinary was that people still managed to
celebrate life,'' says Goldstein. ``There were gatherings by
candlelight, and we warmed ourselves by the fireplaces.''
</P>
<P>
   So she ate and drank vodka with the Georgians by night. By day,
she checked on her students, did her own research, and learned how
local cheeses are made.
</P>
<P>
   One was a firm, fresh cheese that needed to be heated first. The
resourceful farmers, lacking electricity, came up with a solution.
``They had a little wood stove going, and they put it in a pot,''
says Goldstein, ``then wrapped it in towels and blankets to keep it
warm.'' &QL;

<P>
   ``I can't believe Ernest survived this,'' says Father Basile
Bazina of St. Margaret's Church in Burlington. ``It was like death
row.'' Bazina, a Rwandan, is one of a small number of Rwandans who
live in New England. Their numbers in this region are so low they
fall into the ``miscellaneous'' category, and no hard statistics
are available from immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bazina, who came to Massachusetts in 1991, is also
Rugwizangoga's godfather. In the aftermath of the slaughter, he
assumed Ernest and his family were wiped out. In 1997 a letter
informed Bazina that some had made it. Ernest had spent a year in a
Tutsi camp in the eastern part of the country and then rejoined two
brothers and two sisters in Kigali. Immediately, Bazina called him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of emotional,'' recalls Bazina. ``I will try to
get you here'' is what Bazina told Ernest, that there was no future
for him in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give him some hope. As godfather, I have that
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer of 1997, student visa in hand, Rugwizangoga arrived
in Massachusetts. He attended Cathedral High School in Boston,
strug-
</P>
<P>
   gling at first with a new language and his loneliness. ``Why did
I come?'' Rugwizangoga remembers asking himself. ``What is my
destiny here?'' In school, part of his studies repeated work he'd
already accomplished back home. The one difference: Since the
genocide, he no longer saw his future in the church. ``The idea of
being a priest had left me.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was attending mass regularly at St. Mark's Church on
Dorchester Avenue. Recalls Rev. Daniel Finn of St. Mark's, ``on the
sidewalk after service we met and began to talk. It was the
beginning of a relationship, and then I heard a lot about his
life.'' In his own way, the priest could connect with the young
Rwandan, having emigrated from Ireland to the Boston area in the
mid-1960s. ``I was in north Billerica at the time, the only Irish
immigrant in that community,'' the priest says. ``You really feel
out of it. The whole system is so new and different and I felt so
embarrassed not knowing what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   By September 1999, Rugwizangoga had moved into the rectory at
St. Mark's. ``I said we had room here in the house,'' says Finn.
``He's almost family with us here now.'' Last spring, Rugwizangoga
earned a diploma from Cathedral High and last summer began working
with Boston Youth Organizing Project.
</P>
<P>
   After school a few weeks ago, Rugwizangoga stood in a classroom
off the library at Hyde Park High School, meeting with 11 students
and reviewing the results of a survey they'd taken to see what
issues mattered most to other students. The talk was about cleaning
up the school's bathrooms, the tardy policy, and of creating a
program where students could help teachers as tutors or assistants.
``I remember when I was in high school in Rwanda we had programs
like that,'' Rugwizangoga tells them, encouraging the group to
pursue the idea with school officials.
</P>
<P>
   The moment marks a circle of sorts for the Rwandan, the student
activist during his high school days now coaching Boston students,
and it's a connection not lost on Rugwizangoga. ``Last night I was
dreaming,'' he says later, ``and I was with my friends from high
school and I was telling them: Do you remember what we did at the
seminary? Our leadership? Our strikes?''
</P>
<P>
   The youth organizer becomes animated, the dream a chance to
explain how his past and present are blending. He has become
settled in Boston, has made new friends and maintained ties with
his godfather. Over the holidays, they traveled to Connecticut to
socialize with other Rwandans from New England. ``Maybe 30 people
were there,'' says Bazina. ``There are not many of us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends like Theobard, the classmate taken and killed during the
genocide, were in the dream. It was a reunion, back in Rwanda. ``I
will never forget the leadership we did at the seminary. I think it
made me who I am now.'' It is a bittersweet dream, with an
altogether new view.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is excitement because of what I do now and because of
what I did back then. But it is also sad, because I remember, and I
also wish to come back to that moment.''

NBC SHOWS OFF SYNERGY ENERGY IN N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, NH _ Tim Russert's New Hampshire primary day got off
to a hectic start. The host of ``Meet the Press'' appeared on NBC's
``Today'' show, chatted with talk host Don Imus on MSNBC, and
shortly after noon, hopped aboard a makeshift stage in the media
center at the Holiday Inn to dispense some punditry during an
interview on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``NBC Nightly News'' anchor Tom Brokaw was proving
equally versatile. On Monday night, he appeared on Chris Matthews's
MSNBC/CNBC talk show ``Hardball'' before trading barbs with Imus
Tuesday morning. Later, he anchored the NBC news, broke into the
network for post-election interviews with the top candidates and
moved over to MSNBC to help handle its election night chores.
</P>
<P>
   For NBC _ along with its cable cousins MSNBC and CNBC _ this is
the synergy election. In the past few years, giant media mergers _
such as the AOL-Time Warner deal _ have sparked feverish
speculation about the looming impact of information conglomerates
on journalism. At NBC, that future is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up with this network,'' Brokaw said in an interview
Tuesday. ``We're now a formidable operation coming at you from
every direction. What we have to do is become greater than the sum
of our parts at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Alaska Airlines jet went down on Monday evening, New
Hampshire-based MSNBC news anchor Brian Williams hustled on the air
``and at one point, we're on three networks and the Web site is
humming,'' he says. ``That is someone's version of what this (media
synergy) is supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Granite State was virtually crawling with the
synergy company's cameras. The bucolic Bedford Village Inn, with
its Christmas-card setting, housed three sets _ one for Brokaw's
NBC evening news show, another for an MSNBC ``Decision 2000''
program hosted by NBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell, and another
for Williams's MSNBC special.
</P>
<P>
   With all the MSNBC/CNBC election programming on tap here, one
can almost envision the changing of the guard as news migrates from
broadcast to cable. Brokaw acknowledged for example, that MSNBC,
rather than NBC, may carry most of this year's nominating
conventions. But he said the traditional half-hour newscasts still
stand out as signature news shows, adding that ``I always believed
there was (no) giving up on the network evening news.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, NBC's veteran journalists _ grounded in old media
traditions _ are living the changes that synergy has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   The ``NBC Nightly News'' is no longer ``the wire service over
the air, which is what the old network newscast used to be,'' said
Brokaw. ``The day's news is value added.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the selling point for the MSNBC cable operation
was NBC's established news brand and established journalists. But
the concept, said Williams, was ``completely different. There's no
entertainment division. . . . We're not encumbered with `ER.' We're
not bursting into programming. This is our programming.''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Williams feels liberated by a certain cable
informality. ``I don't use Arafat's title,'' he said. ``If you
don't know who he is, you're not watching anyway.'' Conversely, he
said, ``one downside of the explosion of outlets'' is a change in
reporting standards. ``I don't think we're going through the
longstanding confirmation process of the sourcing of stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran NBC correspondent Mitchell, who often hops between
reporting for NBC's evening news and appearing on MSNBC, said ``I
really think NBC saw the vision of all these possibilities . . .
MSNBC gives us the chance to be a little more personal and
conversational. I think . . . each venue is so unique that it's
just a different set of muscles to exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Matthews's frothy made-for-cable ``Hardball'' is a clear
beneficiary of synergy. ``It's the time of night when people have
generally sat down and watched entertainment television,'' he
explained. ``I can have a lot of fun on my show that you can't do
on a news show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask NBC, MSNBC, and CNBC contributor Russert about the ratings
success of ``Meet the Press'' and he practically becomes a cyber
geek, explaining how fans can get the show's guest list e-mailed to
them. ``It's absolutely dramatic,'' he says of the influx of new
media on politics. ``There's this wonderful cross pollination
between `Meet the Press' and a Web site.'' At NBC these days,

TIME HAS COME ONCE AGAIN TO INDULGE YOURSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of you are aware that this is a Jubilee year in the Roman
Catholic calendar, which portends much hoopla. The Pope hopes to
visit the Holy Land, and next month he has scheduled a celebratory
Ash Wednesday Mass at the Circus Maximus in Rome. And, perhaps the
best news of all for us sinners, the church is back in the
indulgence business again.
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences, as Pope John Paul II has correctly noted, are ``a
sensitive subject, which has suffered historical misunderstandings
that have had a negative impact on communion between Christians.''
The reckless trafficking in indulgences _ cash-and-carry relief
from the sufferings of Purgatory hawked by corrupt priests in the
14th and 15th centuries _ prompted ``Luther's revolt,'' which is
Catholicism's genteel euphemism for the creation of the Protestant
church.
</P>
<P>
   A Dominican friar named Johann Tetzel was trying a little too
hard to nail his alms quota for the construction of St. Peter's
basilica, when Luther nailed his famous Ninety-Five Theses to the
church door in protest. The rest, as they say, is history. Geoffrey
Chaucer's unsavory Pardoner may be literature's most famous
purveyor of ``Indulgences of pope and cardinal. . ./these I
do/Show, and in Latin speak some words, a few,/To spice therewith a
bit my sermoning/And stir men to devotion, marvelling.''
</P>
<P>
   The church would want you to understand that today's ``good''
indulgences have little to do with the ``bad'' indulgences of yore.
Catholicism formally abandoned the sale of get-out-of-Purgatory
cards in 1567. Strictly speaking, it's no longer a
cash-on-the-barrelhead transaction. The granting of an indulgence,
however, can require a ``significant contribution to religious and
social works,'' along with the appropriate prayers and confession.
</P>
<P>
   The church has an elaborate, sophistic explanation for the
quid-pro-quo arrangement. ``The Church has a `treasury,' then,
which is `dispensed' as it were through indulgences,'' John Paul
explained in a Sept. 29 audience last year. The Catholic
Encylopedia offers a codification of who can and cannot shell out
these treasures. The Pope can grant a plenary, or complete
indulgence, and will grant a great many to Christian pilgrims who
visit Rome this year. That is to be distinguished from a partial
indulgence. What's the difference? The one priest brave enough to
discuss this subject with me allowed that ``only God knows what
this doctrine really means.'' According to the book, an indulgence
from Cardinal Law would last 200 days; from an archbishop 100 days,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a big fan of the present Pope, and generally an admirer of
the One True Church. But let's make one thing clear. Jesus Christ
never sold or granted indulgences. Quite the opposite. They were an
invention of the 14th-century church bureaucracy, which often used
the proceeds to build cathedrals, hospitals _ or just to line their
pockets. The modern church claims it ``has received from Christ the
power to grant indulgences.'' Communicants must accept this ``de
fide,'' or on faith. This is the equivalent of a child asking
``Why?'' and the parent answering ``Because.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough palaver. Let's get down to a more practical question: How
can I get one? Traditionally, making a pilgrimage to Rome is a good
start, and this Jubilee year is no exception. If you're pressed for
time, the Wall Street Journal has revealed that indulgences are now
available in a small chapel at Rome's Fiumicino airport, to save
travelers the hassle of driving in to one of the city's major
basilicas for the remission of sins. Can drive-through be far
behind?
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to hop on Alitalia to get time off from
Purgatory. Last Sunday, the Globe's City Weekly section printed
this list of local churches offering the special sacrament: Our
Lady of Victories; St. Clement's Eucharistic Shrine; the Cathedral
of the Holy Cross; Madonna Queen National Shrine, the Mission
Church on Tremont Street, and St. Theresa of Avila in West Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   So what can I say? Indulge.

MORE JEWS IN US SEEKING SOLACE IN SHABBAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By IRENE SEGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The clocks on the computer on David Kahn's paper-strewn
desk and on his phone and on the stereo in his home office all edge
toward 6 on a Friday evening, when he will stop work and suddenly
sense time shift.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, in the kitchen, his wife, Gail, is cooking chicken
and lemon saffron rice. Soon their 15-year-old daughter, Jennifer,
will be back from her job in a veterinary hospital and change from
clothes that smell like other people's dogs into the soft flannel
pajamas that let her know Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath, has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   For 3,500 years, Jews have celebrated the sabbath, and for the
past two Kahn has extended its reach into his life. He joins what
rabbis and other observers say is a growing number of Jews seeking
refuge from hectic lives in an ancient holiday that sets aside the
period between sunset Friday and sundown Saturday for rest and
reflection.
</P>
<P>
   To his family's long practice of reserving Friday evening as
time for one another, Kahn, a computer consultant who used to work
seven days a week, has added this: He almost never works on
Saturdays any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask where do you feel close to God, I'd say listening
to music,'' says Kahn, 43. ``I can get the same feeling observing
nature. Setting time aside to do these things is good. Setting
aside time to slow down is good. Even though I'm comfortable being
intense, that doesn't mean you have to be intense all of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's Kahn searching to differentiate Saturday from the
rest of the week, or Harvard student Michael Rosenberg
accomplishing the same thing these past 2 1/2 years by adhering to
the detailed list of activities Jewish law prohibits on Shabbat,
they are building themselves shelters in time.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders may lament the assimilation that's led large
numbers of American Jews to exhibit little attachment to Judaism.
And, with surveys showing other Americans more than twice as likely
as Jews to say they attend a religious service each week, Jews may
indeed be what the head of the liberal Reform movement calls ``the
least worshipful of peoples in North America.'' But among Jews with
some connection to their religion there is a spiritual yearning
that mirrors the quest for meaning in the larger culture. ``Those
who are engaged are increasingly engaged,'' says Rabbi Ronne
Friedman of Boston's Temple Israel.
</P>
<P>
   They're studying Talmud at lunch and sending more of their
children to Jewish day schools _ and, anecdotal evidence suggests,
finding renewed purpose in a weekly day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   They're doing everything from lighting Shabbat candles on Friday
evenings to taking an hour for themselves on busy Saturdays to
walling off the entire 25 hours by adopting Orthodox prohibitions
against commerce and electricity and telephones. Often they
struggle to snatch a sabbath in a society that sets aside Saturday
for errands and youth soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for places where they can experience
peace,'' says Terry Rosenberg, 50, vice president of Temple Beth
Elohim in Wellesley. ``They're saying, `Enough. This is my
opportunity to take myself out of the fray.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a significant increased interest,'' says Barry Shrage,
president of the Combined Jewish Philanthropies. ``Part of it is
the baby boom going over the hill and thinking about what life
really means.''
</P>
<P>
   At Shir Tikva, the Kahns' Reform temple in Wayland, members
persuaded a skeptical Rabbi Herman Blumberg to start a Saturday
morning Torah study session a half-dozen years ago, and now 20 to
40 people routinely attend. At Temple Emunah, a Conservative
synagogue in Lexington, attendance at Saturday morning worship has
doubled to more than 200 people. Its two-year-old ``Shabbat think
tank'' tries to foster the informal socializing common in Orthodox
communities by organizing periodic Saturday afternoon gatherings in
people's homes that attract as many as 100 families.
</P>
<P>
   At Temple Israel in Boston, a Friday evening service in the
atrium that drew 150 to 200 people five years ago now often nearly
fills the 320-person limit. When the Bureau of Jewish Education
surveyed members of eight area Reform and Conservative
congregations in 1998, 37 percent of parents of second-graders and
almost half of parents of fifth-graders said they prayed in a
synagogue at least once a month, up from one-seventh of parents in
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   By looking to their Jewish roots for rituals that add meaning in
an over-tasked culture, these Jews marry two broader trends,
wedding what demographic writer Susan Mitchell calls the ``urge to
regain your ethnic identity'' with the urge to ``incorporate
meaningful gestures and customs into daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   There are national efforts, too, to promote _ and tap into _
this interest in what best-selling author Thomas Cahill calls ``one
of the simplest and sanest recommendations any god has ever made.''
Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, last month called for a ``new Reform revolution'' to
invigorate worship in a movement known more for its emphasis on
personal autonomy and ethics. A three-year-old campaign, ``Shabbat
Across America,'' last year drew 714 congregations to its
high-profile effort to target one Friday night each year to
introduce Jews to the sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's old,'' says Francine Samarel, ``the religion
really fits in with what's going on today.''
</P>
<P>
   Samarel, 37, busy with three young sons and volunteer
activities, has been a regular at Saturday services at Needham's
Temple Aliyah since her father died of cancer in August. She seeks
solace and community in a liturgy that asks mourners to rise for a
special prayer for 11 months after losing a loved one, something
she didn't do when her mother died in 1983. The temple is where ``I
feel very connected to my parents and my past and feel they are
sitting next to me almost,'' she says. ``The other piece is I have
a need to slow down and take a breath.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same sanctuary Alan and Beth Pullman can be found most
Saturday mornings. Whenever possible for the past three years,
they've traded chores and their twins' activities for this more
spiritual pursuit, finding in Judaism the meaning Beth sought in
college by reading about Eastern religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just do the holidays, it's so superficial you don't
really get the richness of Judaism,'' says Beth, 49, a teacher.
``It's an important way to meld us together, help us pass on to our
children what we think is important, but it's something at this
point that I would pursue even if my children were grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they've stretched Shabbat from Friday dinners with
family and friends (``It's sometimes a push,'' says Beth, ``and
we're all tired and a little cranky, but it pulls us together'') to
Saturday mornings, they think often of taking over the rest of
Saturday, too. When they attend their synagogue's monthly Saturday
afternoon service, they make the whole day a quiet one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the days we try not to do anything else,'' says
Alan, 51, an elementary school principal. ``We really like it, but
we just haven't taken the plunge yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rosenberg, 21, a Harvard junior, has taken that plunge.
He grew up in a non-observant family in Iowa, and his most vivid
childhood memories of Shabbat come from annual visits to his
father's Orthodox relatives in New Jersey, where their home filled
with family and friends and song on Friday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   He found the same feeling of ``immediate community'' at Harvard
Hillel, though on his first Friday night, he couldn't tell the
after-dinner blessings from the songs. Soon he'd quit writing,
riding in cars, telephoning, shopping, and using electricity on
Friday nights and Saturdays. He has conversations in his room, he
says, that he couldn't have at loud parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very different to have a weekend when you take off from
work and a sabbath where you take off from society,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as uninterested as David Kahn is in adopting what
Rosenberg calls the ``stringencies'' of Shabbat, he is,
nonetheless, searching for rules to guide him through his newfound
day of rest. After Friday night dinner, the family retires to the
living room where Kahn might listen to Rachmaninoff and read or
doze in his easy chair, while his wife reads and his daughters
sketch.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he shuns work on Saturdays, Kahn has time for family
outings but has to schedule them around Jen's ballet class. When
chores crept into Saturdays, he said, it felt too much like work.
But if a client calls and the work can't wait, he'll work. He just
tried his temple's Torah study group for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was an evening, it was easier to come up with rules,''
Kahn says. ``We're still evolving what Saturday is. The objective
should be phrased in the positive as well as the negative. Saying
it's not work is not saying what it is.''

<P>
   It was white line fever for the Straight Talk Express.
</P>
<P>
   There we went, John McCain in his campaign bus and this reporter
in his rental car, desperately trying to keep up as the Arizona
senator stormed down Interstate 495 in heavy traffic at 90 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was on his way from one town hall meeting, in Plaistow,
N.H., to the next, in Nashua, and the reporter was scared witless.
Asked by the Globe to report on the New Hampshire primaries through
foreign _ in his case, Dutch _ eyes, the reporter now feared he
would not live long enough to complete the task.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCain, too, was in danger of crashing, which could
have defeated the purpose of his attempt to become president of the
United States. He also seemed to be taking the the law a little
lightly while striving to become what should perhaps be the
country's number one role model.

   Still, the wild ride seemed as good a metaphor as any for the
contradictions and oddities, and the manic pace, of a primary
campaign that seemed both strange and often strangely alluring to a
writer born in another land.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the voters _ in the end, an oddly inspiring
lot. Viewed from abroad, the American voter seems an electoral
layabout, ill informed and little inclined to vote at all. Then one
comes to New Hampshire and keeps running into folk who are
sincerely and gladly going about the business of getting informed,
gauging the candidates, fine-tuning their views.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues that I am interested in are Social Security,
prescriptions, and heating oil,'' said 80-year-old Leah Marcotte
during a town hall meeting with Al Gore Saturday for undecided
voters in Lebanon, N.H. The day before, she had listened live to
Gore's Democratic opponent, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember hearing him on prescriptions,'' Marcotte said
of Gore, ``and I don't remember hearing him on heating oil. I am
sure sombody will ask about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the unexpected virtues of the voters find no match in the
primary process. It seems unfathomable that a great country would
entrust so much of the task of choosing presidents to such a tiny,
quirky wedge of itself.
</P>
<P>
   And why is it that primaries, which are party votes rather than
elections per se, are decided by people who are not party members?
In states such as New Hampshire and South Carolina, voters don't
even have to register for the party whose nominee they want to help
select. The Western European mind boggles at that because back
home, only dues-paying members of the many, many parties decide
whom to present to the population at large for election as
president or prime minister. Then the population at large laughs at
most of the choices.
</P>
<P>
   The primary process does give serious underdogs such as McCain a
chance to build momentum, but not, it would seem, by design. It
also gives the likes of Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes a soapbox and a
chance to raise their post-primary speaking fees. Much of what they
have to say sounds hilarious to European ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States should leave the World Trade Organization
because of that organization's socialist programs,'' Bauer told a
regular at Pete's Gun and Tackle Shop in Hudson last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's stand apparently wasn't lost only on the foreigner in
the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't care for that,'' a rugged type in the crowd mumbled
as he joined his buddies elsewhere in the store.
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer didn't come to discuss the WTO. He mentioned his
disgust with ``men marrying men'' but was really there to defend
the Second Amendment right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is CNN here yet?'' he asked his communications director.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Bauer bravely started without CNN.
</P>
<P>
   While Bauer's campaign is a relatively small affair, with an
entourage that fits in a single SUV, all of the campaigns operate
at an unearthly pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big difference compared to the Netherlands,'' said Hans
Anker, a Dutch Washington-based political consultant who attended
the New Hampshire debates last week. He recalled taking some
American colleagues to the election ``war room'' of the senior
government party in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``At eight at night, the place was empty. The candidates were
still on the road, but virtually nothing was going on in their
election headquarters. It has a lot to do with the 24-hour news
cycle in America. But that, of course, is changing in Europe,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Substance, however, can't keep up with the speed of the US
primary campaign, and so candidates simply say just about the same
thing every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how the American reporters who have to
cover a campaign constantly can stand it,'' said Petra Pinzler,
Washington correspondent for the German weekly Die Zeit.
</P>
<P>
   At a Democratic fund-raiser in Nashua Friday night, she heard
Bill Bradley's stump speech once again. ``I really liked that
speech the first time, but now I am so bored with it. At least, the
candidates should change the jokes. There must be more than five
jokes in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But few of those most directly involved in the campaigns
complain.
</P>
<P>
   Take the campaign workers, who suffer from fatigue but never
seem to get tired. The mid-level ones, in particular, plug away to
keep their candidate's campaign on track _ or at least no more than
an hour behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's people never stop handing out letters, press releases,
and other material they think will make their man's case. That few
reporters read the stuff doesn't faze them at all.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters hang in there, despite the mind-numbing routine,
dutifully recording speeches they've heard and recorded many times
before.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them are bored, though, and it shows. At the Nashua
fund-raiser, in the overflow press room in front of a big screen,
the crowd got a little disrespectful as vice president Gore reached
hard for oratorical splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters moaned, others groaned as Gore once again told a
homespun joke about his dad's 1952 election for the US Senate, a
joke he has told over and over again. When the vice president
reached the punch line, the reporters were already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think some more, vote for Gore,'' members of the media
proclaimed in unison, reciting the senior Gore's hokey slogan,
drowning out the man on the monitor. Still, the laptops went tap,
tap, tap.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, of course, Gore, would deliver the line again and
get another big laugh, underscoring what the carnival craziness of
it all can obscure: This process belongs to the voters. Not the
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, that is the New Hampshire way, and its people could
do much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see somebody live or you see somebody on TV, it's a whole
different thing,'' said 53-year-old Richard Ray of Atkinson, N.H.,
after a McCain event. ``Live, you get a measure of the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ray should count himself fortunate that he lives somewhere
where he can say just that.

 &HT;    IN FIGHTING AGAINST CHECHEN REBELS, KIDS BECOME RUSSIA'S WAR
VICTIMS

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yusup Magomedov woke up feeling a bit stir-crazy.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, the lanky, sandy-haired teen-ager had been
cooped up with his mother and three sisters in their two-room
wooden house in the village of Novi Sharoi, about 20 miles from the
Chechen capital Grozny. The village elders had closed school,
fearing the Russian warplanes that screeched overhead on their
bombing runs of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   But that October morning, Yusup begged his mother to let him go
outside to play soccer with his friends. While cautious, Leila
Magomedov also was determined not to allow the fighting to
completely disrupt her family's routine. So, with a crisp morning
sun streaming through the kitchen window, she swallowed a feeling
of dread and said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes later, an explosion rocked the town
square where Yusup and his friends had gone to play. The Russian
artillery shell killed seven children immediately and wounded 14
others, including Yusup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, laying in a bed in a crowded hospital room in Moscow, Yusup
is a bit stir-crazy again, restless with all the undirected energy
of a 14-year-old. But he won't be pleading with his mother again to
go outside to play soccer. He no longer has legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian army says its four-month old offensive in Chechnya
is aimed at eliminating terrorists and bandits. The Kremlin not
only denies targeting civilians in the war but also insists it is
protecting civilians like Yusup and his family, and providing
adequate medical care and other humanitarian assistance to the
200,000 Chechens uprooted by the war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities will not say whether the shell that tore up
Yusup's legs on Oct. 23 was an accident or part of a planned strike
on Novi Sharoi.
</P>
<P>
   But the army has been accused of other attacks on civilians. On
Oct. 21, Russian jets bombed the central food market in downtown
Grozny. On Nov. 1, Russian jets strafed a Red Cross convoy carrying
aid workers and wounded civilians from the front-lines to refugee
camps in neighboring Ingushetia. The latter attack killed 27.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, while visiting
Russia last week, joined the chorus of international criticism of
Russia's conduct of the war against separatists in its rebellious
republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that there has been an incredible amount of misery
injected upon the civilian population of Chechnya,'' she said last
Monday at the start of three days of talks with Russian officials
in Moscow. ``There has been excessive force used and civilians have
been, I think, indiscriminately targeted in a way that has
broadened and widened the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Yusup, U.S. condemnations of Russia's military
tactics in Chechnya are a case of too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I awoke and everything was covered in blood,'' he recalled
last week from a hospital bed here in the Russian capital, as he
wrapped his slender fingers around the angry pink stumps where his
knees used to be.
</P>
<P>
   After the blast, relatives and neighbors rushed him, his mom and
the other wounded children to the nearest hospital in the town of
Urus Martin, 15 minutes away, leaving his three sisters behind in
the care of neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The exhausted doctors, already overwhelmed by wounded, told
Yusup's mother they had no anesthesia or electricity to perform an
operation to save her son's legs.
</P>
<P>
   She had one chance, they said. If she could make it in 24 hours
to Sleptsovsk, the major border crossing between Chechnya and
Ingushetia and the location of the region's largest hospital, there
was hope.
</P>
<P>
   But Oct. 23 was the day the Russians stepped up air raids
against rebel strongholds in Grozny and elsewhere in central
Chechnya, near Urus Martin. Russian authorities also had shut the
Sleptsovsk border crossing, trapping non-combatants in a war zone,
a violation of the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   For one week, Leila and Yusup cowered in the basement as Russian
bombs rained down around Urus Martin. Gangrene set in to Yusup's
shredded legs, forcing doctors sharing the hiding place to amputate
them with a kitchen knife. just above the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Yusup slipped in and out of consciousness, with doctors once
even pronouncing him dead. But the soft-spoken boy wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, Leila made a dash for the border in a borrowed car
and succeeded in getting to the refugee hospital in Sleptsovsk.
There, doctors operated on him, cleaning his wounds and saving what
remained of his legs.
</P>
<P>
   His 14th birthday was spent in the hospital, where he learned
for the first time that his best friend Sultan had been killed in
the Oct. 23 attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was all too much, and finally, he cried, Leila recalled. ``I
asked him if it was because of the pain. 'No,' he said. 'It's
because of everything.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Yusup recuperated, the doctors told Leila that if her son
was ever going to walk again, he would need yet a third operation,
one available only in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Big problems still stood in the way. First, the two had no money
to fly the 1,000 miles to Moscow or to pay for the cost of the
hospital stay. Second, Leila hadn't seen her three daughters in
almost one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched my son die, come back to life, and I was worried
sick about where my girls were,'' Leila said, tears welling in her
tired eyes. ``A mother shouldn't have to make the choice of leaving
some children to save another.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russian journalist rescued her from at least one horrible
plight. Vera Kuznetsova contacted acquaintances at the Russian
Health Ministry and through them, found Moscow doctors willing to
operate on Yusup's legs so he could be fitted with prostheses and
allow the two to stay in a rehabilitation clinic free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Yusup is settled in a wing of the Central Russian Republic
Children's' Hospital on the southern edge of Moscow, learning to
walk again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fragile, jerky process as his awkward teen-age body
climbs from a wheelchair and balances on the robot-colored metal
sticks. With all the resilience of someone who believes he has seen
the worst, Yusup views the challenge as part of another great
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys (physical therapists) say I gotta take it easy,'' he
says. ``They warned me it would be painful when I took my first
step. But when I did it, I laughed and said this is nothing
compared to the pain I've felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, minds mend at a different pace than bodies. A
psychologist meets with Yusup and his mother each week to talk
about their nightmare. While Yusup talks easily of his ordeal, he
secretly worries that his mother is having a more difficult time
coping than he is.
</P>
<P>
   Out of earshot of her son, Leila allows some pessimism about a
war no counselor can settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia and these rebels will fight ... until we are all dead.
They won't sit together (in peace talks) by themselves. They need
to be pushed. It doesn't look like the United States is going to
push them together so who knows what will happen,'' she says,
wearily brushing a wan piece of hair that has fallen across her
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my neighbors are all sick and hurting. We don't need
independence, We need peace,'' Leila added.
</P>
<P>
   What unsettles Yusup most is not knowing if the rest of his
family has survived. He says he doesn't know when he is going home,
let alone what home will look like when the war ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd say it, but I miss my sisters,'' he said.
``And our cow Sida, she's quite a star. The whole village used to
feed her. I hope they're feeding her while we're gone.''

 &HT;    BILL AIMS AT DISPARITIES IN MINORITY HEALTH CARE
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill aimed at eliminating disparities in minority
health care was introduced Wednesday by members of the
Congressional Black Caucus and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Fairness Act would improve research on minority
health and the collection of data on race and ethnicity, as well as
provide funding to make minorities aware of health conditions in
their communities and resources that are available.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, backed by other minority caucuses in Congress, would
also set up a research center at the National Institutes of Health
on minority health and address biases in health care through
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not justice for a person to be denied access to health
care. It is not justice for a person to receive lower quality care
simply because of the color of their skin or the weight of their
wallet,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. ``I believe that health care
is not a privilege, but a fundamental right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of health care is every bit as important as those
struggles we have already fought and won,'' Lewis said. ``The fight
for equal access to health care is the civil rights fight of the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, diabetes, cancer, stroke, heart disease and other severe
health problems are the leading causes of death in minority
populations, Kennedy said. In addition, black American men who
contract prostate cancer are 133 percent more likely to die from it
than white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``These statistics are unacceptable. All Americans deserve
quality health care,'' Kennedy said. ``Finding solutions that can
reduce disparities and change these outcomes must be a national
priority. In order to effectively address this problem we must
increase our understanding of minority health and improve the
aspect of our health care system that are failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr., D-Ill., blamed the disparities in
minority health care on racism. He said the nation's best
researchers fall victim to racism and don't study health issues
that pertains to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Also supporting the bill are the Asian Pacific American Caucus
and most of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

 &HT;    KUDZU MEETS ITS MATCH IN DEADLY FUNGUS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kudzu may finally meet its match.
</P>
<P>
   Federal plant scientists say they have identified a common
fungus that kills the bothersome vine within hours.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus, known as Myrothecium verrucaria, also kills cotton,
soybeans and a fairly wide variety of other plants, but plant
pathologist C. Douglas Boyette said it can be applied to kudzu in
lethal doses without endangering other plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about winning the war with kudzu, but we're going
to do battle with it,'' Boyette said in a telephone interview from
his U.S. Agricultural Research Service laboratory in Stoneville,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   In greenhouse and field studies, the scientists found that the
fungus killed 100 percent of kudzu weeds. The fungus destroys
leaves and stems and also appears to invade the potato-like roots,
which serve as reservoirs of starch from which new kudzu vines grow
after stems and leaves are mowed or killed with herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu, native to eastern Asia, was introduced into the eastern
and southern United States in the 1800s. It was originally promoted
for erosion control and as an inexpensive forage for livestock. It
has crept over an estimated 7 million acres, from Florida to New
York to Texas, with heavy infestations in Alabama, Georgia and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   M. verrucaria grows practically everywhere, Boyette said, even
on kudzu vines. However, in its natural state it exists in small
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to killing kudzu with it was to produce trillions of
microscopic fungus spores and mix them in a liquid solution that
could be sprayed onto the vines. The solution contains over 20
million spores in a volume of spray equal to that of a sugar cube.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get upwards of 100 percent control,'' Boyette said.
``Within 24 to 48 hours, the plant is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether the fungus spray spreads to non-target
species, Boyette sprayed kudzu with the solution in tests adjacent
to soybean fields and found no damage to the beans. When washed off
the kudzu leaves, as might happen if a heavy rain followed an
application, the solution was diluted to the point of being
harmless, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, environmental and toxicological studies currently under
way must be finished before the fungus mix is generally available
to kudzu foes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may take as long as two years, Boyette said. Meanwhile, a
Department of Agriculture spokesperson said the government likely
will seek a patent on use of the fungus against kudzu.

ARIZONA'S `IRON LADY' ANSWERS HER CRITICS WITH WIT _ AND VETOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT 
 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It's a scene straight out of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   A young mother looks out over the barren high desert, her three
small children huddled behind her skirts. Horses graze out front as
a wagon rolls by.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hull, you're not in Kansas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Arizona's present governor was a 26-year-old
schoolteacher who left a comfortable Kansas City suburb and moved
to Chinle, a remote town on the Navajo Reservation in northern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real culture shock,'' Hull recalled. ``We were there
in the days when the wagons pulled up for commodities at the
boarding school.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Terry, a doctor, had been assigned to Chinle by the
U.S. Public Health Service.
</P>
<P>
   There was no theater, no library; only a few trading posts.
There was no supermarket, so Hull did her shopping in Albuquerque,
planning family meals six weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year, there was no TV . . . we had to make our own
fun,'' Hull said. ``We had more time to really enjoy each other, I
think, than I ever had, before or since.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's time in Chinle offers a striking image of the governor as
a gritty frontier woman. But it doesn't square with the portrait
being painted by some detractors in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, they say that Hull is out of touch and over her head,
and being led around by her staff. As evidence, they point to an
excessive number of vetoes (21) last session and a breakdown in
communication with the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   As Hull, 64, begins her third year as governor, lawmakers are
grumbling that the real power is held by Hull's chief of staff,
Rick Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got sick last year . . . you saw a change,'' said
state Rep. Sue Gerard, R-north central Phoenix. ``Rick did gain
more power, and she did become more isolated. It became harder for
us to talk to her independent of Rick.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the capitol, the whispers have started. Has the Iron Lady
started to rust?
</P>
<P>
   Hull and her staff laugh off such claims. She says Collins takes
most of the flak, because that's his role as chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually too involved in too many things,'' Hull said. ``I
micromanage around here more than we would like. Everybody blames
it on Rick. It's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the office, Hull doesn't stand on ceremony. She sometimes
answers her own phone and gets her own coffee and is still
embarrassed when staff members rise when she enters a room.
</P>
<P>
   She's not much of a public speaker, actually more of a public
reader, as evidenced by her recent State of the State speech, which
was described by one catty observer as ``almost lifelike.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Hull was speaking to a somewhat hostile
Legislature, including people who want to teach gun safety in
public schools, but don't care whether kids fall out of the back of
pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hull tried to entertain them a little, with a tame joke
or two. The speech's solitary attempt at statesmanship _ a Latin
phrase _ fell flat when Hull mangled it.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the spotlight, Hull is quick-witted and engaging. She
reminds one of former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole,
whose singular wit never translated in big rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Hull met with the media after her state
address, she ribbed one reporter for appearing to sleep through the
speech. &QL; 
A parent's patience Hull also exhibits the patience of someone who
has raised four children and taught thousands more. After 21 years
in public office, she boasts, ``I usually can get along with
everybody and anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor gently notes that she has turned the emphasis back
to helping people. She's proud of programs such as KidsCare, which
provides health insurance for the children of the working poor, and
Students FIRST, a plan to fix dilapidated school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   And Hull has another advantage over her predecessor, Fife
Symington. Her staff members aren't preoccupied with keeping their
boss out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   As for her dust-ups with the Legislature and House Speaker Jeff
Groscost, R-Mesa, Hull is puzzled. She spent 14 years in the House,
including two terms as speaker, so she knows how the Legislature
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem understanding why they just don't pick up the
phone and call me, at night or at home or whatever,'' Hull said.
``Because I've known a lot of them for a long time. And some of
them have said, `But you understand, you're now the governor, and
we can't do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Hull remains immersed in affairs of state,
attending meetings, taking work home, even e-mailing staffers in
the wee hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does her homework,'' said Collins, waving a handful of
bureaucratic minutiae that Hull will inevitably want to see. ``I
guess that's the schoolteacher in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both the governor and Collins acknowledge that Hull's
hospital stay in March started tongues wagging. Was Hull gravely
ill? Could she still govern? Would she serve out her term?
</P>
<P>
   The illness gave an opening to Hull's enemies to undermine her
in a way that goes far beyond making fun of the governor's big hair
or knocking her for talking about curlers.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that at one point, Collins was denying rumors that
Hull had a fatal liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   Hull admits she is sick _ sick of hearing about the issue. To
muzzle the gossip, Hull granted a reporter an interview with her
physician, Dr. Anita Murcko.
</P>
<P>
   Murcko said Hull was hospitalized with a serious kidney
infection. It started in the urinary tract and reached Hull's
bloodstream, but it did not advance to the more serious condition
of toxic shock.
</P>
<P>
   In typical Hull fashion, she tried not to create a fuss, walking
the short distance from her doctor's office to Good Samaritan
Regional Medical Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked over because she didn't want to alarm her security
guards,'' Murcko said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was treated with intravenous antibiotics and suffers no
lasting effects. She takes medication for arthritis and a thyroid
condition, and Murcko describes her as very healthy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rumors, Hull cracked, ``I keep saying they're jealous
because I've lost weight.''
</P>
<P>
   They also might be jealous of Hull's knack for always being in
the right place at the right time. Hull never has to run that hard.
The ball always comes right to her.
</P>
<P>
   She's the Silver Surfer of Arizona politics, riding a wave of
serendipity to the top of state government.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the House in 1979, Hull made headlines in 1982 by
suggesting that the state could save money by allowing the swamp
coolers at the Perryville prison to fall into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the swamp coolers will break down,'' she said. ``That
might get rid of some of our prison population.''
</P>
<P>
   As majority whip in 1987-88, Hull became the de facto majority
leader, filling in for an ailing Jim Ratliff. In 1989, she landed
in the speaker's chair after Joe Lane was ousted by voters angry
over Lane's role in the impeachment of former Gov. Evan Mecham.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was known as a no-nonsense speaker who kept her fellow
Republicans in line, never hesitating to bonk a fews heads if need
be. While speaker, she earned two nicknames _ ``Iron Lady'' from
her supporters and ``Dragon Lady'' from her enemies _ and weathered
the AzScam public corruption scandal, which led to criminal charges
against several legislators.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hull inherited the Governor's Office from Symington,
who was forced out after being convicted of bank fraud. Symington's
conviction has since been overturned. Hull ran for re-election in
1998 and won by a wide margin. &QL; 
Shaky public relations
</P>
<P>
   Despite her long experience in state government, Hull is off to
a shaky start, at least as far as public relations go.
</P>
<P>
   When news leaked last year that the state was ordering a
14-year-old to have an abortion, Hull appeared to waffle.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said there was little the state could do. But as
public pressure mounted, Hull reversed field, calling on state
Attorney General Janet Napolitano to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Hull took a bum rap in that case, which would be
clear when the records are made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was going this path until a document was set down in front
of her face, from a psychiatrist, that was contradictory to the
route she was going,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also got some bad press for her push to install cable
barriers on Valley freeways. After several people were killed in
head-on collisions, Hull told the state Department of
Transportation to study the barriers.
</P>
<P>
   After a friend, former state legislator Polly Getzwiller, was
seriously injured in a similar crash, Hull cut the study short and
ordered the department to install the barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said her decision was not linked to the accident involving
Getzwiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a nice lady, and I know her . . . and some day we have
to find out if she's ever gotten out of the hospital,'' Hull said. &QL; 
Power struggleWhether Hull blows with the wind or not, one thing is
certain: She faces a Legislature that borders on insurrection. Some
lawmakers are upset because they didn't see Hull's vetoes coming
last session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first I heard of it, a reporter called me,'' said Sen. Tom
Freestone, R-Mesa, an amiable ex-wrestler and fixture in Maricopa
County politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Guess what, Freestone. Your bill just got
slaughtered' . . . I was caught flat-footed.''
</P>
<P>
   Freestone, whose open-meetings bill should survive this session,
said he understands why legislators bristled at the vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like working through the whole season raising
crops, then you find out you had a tornado come through and destroy
everything,'' Freestone said.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, lawmakers may take the fight with Hull a step
further. In a move that smacks of bravado, they have hinted about a
``veto session'' _ reconvening to revive any bill struck down by
Hull.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about power, says Groscost, who believes Hull vetoed a
number of bills to re-establish control of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some of it was aimed at making sure she sent a
message to legislators who disagreed with her,'' Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In her mind, she tried to show that she was in charge and in
fact people better listen to what she had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Marc Spitzer, R-north-central Phoenix, said Hull had
good reasons behind her vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she vetoed bills for fun,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Hull says the vetoes were all about policy, not
payback. Most of them involved bills that called for spending
beyond the current budget, or bills that cut into the power of
state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Hull's disagreements have been with Groscost, who
clearly loves stirring the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Although they hail from the same party, Hull and Groscost
couldn't be more different. Hull is a member of the old guard, a
moderate, a grandmother and a Catholic. Groscost is a young turk, a
staunch conservative and a Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost sometimes sports the demeanor of a used car salesman,
but he's no dummy. He understands how to consolidate power and hold
it, and he lives for political gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Widening the rift, Hull chose to back Texas Gov. George W. Bush
for president, while Groscost and most other state Republicans are
pushing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Groscost has baited Hull at every turn. He invited
National Rifle Association President Charlton Heston to address the
House, despite the governor's moderate position on guns.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, he held a downtown fund-raiser featuring skits
lampooning Hull.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute to understatement, Hull said she was
``disappointed'' in the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you respect the governor or not, respect the office,''
Hull said. ``The fund-raiser and the singing, those things are not
a respect for the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull has also taken criticism for letting her various policy
experts lobby the Legislature, meaning her office doesn't speak
with one voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problem is, all of her staff people are real technocrats . . .
they don't know politics,'' Gerard said. ``Because Rick (Collins)
is so authoritarian or totalitarian, they can come down and talk to
us, but they have no authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Last session, Gerard and Collins stopped playing nice and
started kicking sand in each other's faces.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the session, Gerard sent Collins a box of
chocolates as a make-up present. Collins sent it back. So there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had accused me of not being truthful and questioning my
integrity . . . that's the kind of thing that happens in the heat
of battle,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little out of line in sending it back.''
</P>
<P>
   This session, Hull has taken steps to open the lines of
communication between her office and the Legislature, in part by
naming aide Jaime Molera as chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the governor smiles when legislators say they want a
return to the Symington administration, when one lobbyist, Barry
Aarons, did most of the governor's talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want Barry Aarons back . . . every one of those
people had said, `Get Barry Aarons out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull admits she takes a different tack with lawmakers than
Symington did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that style of having one person go down there and
twist their arms, twist their necks,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also ran into trouble with the Legislature during
December's special session to replace the dilapidated state mental
hospital. Hull called the session, only to watch her proposal die
in a committee. &QL; 
A new session
</P>
<P>
   But things improved when the regular session started. One of the
first acts was passage of a bill to provide $80 million for a new
state mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Hull's legislative troubles have to do with term limits
and the current leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In another environment, Senate President Brenda Burns,
R-Glendale, might be able to play peacemaker between Groscost and
Hull, but Burns has troubles of her own.
</P>
<P>
   For one, she faces the challenge of running the Senate with a
one-seat (16-14) Republican majority. On top of that, she may not
be able to hold on to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Due to term limits, Groscost must leave the House next year and
probably will run for the Senate, where he and pal Rusty Bowers, a
Republican senator from Mesa, could form a cabal to oust Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hubbub, Hull probably will find a way to
survive, just as she did in Chinle years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Allen, a Navajo registered nurse who befriended the Hulls,
said there's just something about Jane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very resourceful to find things to do, and get
acquainted,'' Allen said. ``That's what Jane did . . . She was a
very easygoing person, very outgoing. She doesn't just sit back and
wait for people to come to her.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Hull will not write off the Legislature. She will not give
up. She'll crack her jokes, make her phone calls, do her homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to me is that I leave a legacy that
says the state of Arizona is better for my five years of being
governor,'' Hull said. &QL;

tiny hall of mirrors, projecting a single atom to another spot on
the crystal, creating what they call a ``quantum mirage.'' The
technique might conceivably be used as a kind of remote sensing

   HOSPITAL-SAFETY-TECH (Salt Lake City) _ Faced with growing
concern about sometimes fatal medical errors _ often errors in
medication _ hospitals nationwide are increasingly turning to
computers for a timely safety check to help doctors and nurses
avoid errors. ``It's a revolution in the making,'' said Dr. Joseph
Hayes, a cardiologist who is medical director of clinical
information centers at New York Weill Cornell Center. Pushing the
idea that lives _ not to mention money _ are at stake, at least a
dozen technology companies are selling versions of systems that
were often developed at teaching hospitals like LDS Hospital in
Salt Lake City. They include Internet links to a doctor's laptop
computer, advice-giving software equipped with artificial
intelligence, wireless devices that transmit medical orders, and
bar-code systems to avoid drug errors. This is an expensive
revolution, though, which could well keep many hospitals away for
some time. And technology is not the only key to improving safety.
But technology can make a sizable difference. By Milt Freudenheim.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ John McCain has been on a wild ride. Now he's
going to drag the Republican Party on one.
</P>
<P>
   The party that takes paternalism so seriously it was willing to
anoint the scion just based on his scionosity, must now deal with
the scamp.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ``East of Eden'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   When former President Bush came up to New Hampshire, he called
his son a ``boy'' who would not let the country down.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pounced on the word ``boy.'' ``I fully agree with that,''
he said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   W. seemed to revert to a jittering teen-ager standing on stage
next to his dad at a country music concert on Saturday. It
underscored John McCain's case: Junior was a nice enough guy, but
did he have the experience to run the country?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone assumes the Bush machine will try to tear John McCain
apart limb by limb. But then, John McCain already survived that
fate far away and long ago. So he's pretty fearless.
</P>
<P>
   He went from being a rebellious son to a rebellious POW to a
rebellious senator. Eighteen months ago at dinner, he mused about
how much of a maverick was too much of a maverick to win the
Republican nomination. He knows, even with his rout here, it's hard
to capture a party whose leaders hate you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to restrain my delusions of grandeur,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His weird schizophrenic existence _ cherished by voters and
reporters in New Hampshire for his directness, loathed by
Republican leaders back in Washington for his directness _ was
illustrated in a funny exchange on his bus on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain turned to his friend, the movie actor turned GOP senator,
Fred Thompson, who had come from the nation's capital to campaign
on the ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How are things in the city of Satan?'' McCain asked.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson replied that all was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Then a reporter asked McCain what sort of reception he would get
if his campaign collapsed and he had to return to the Senate he has
so often stirred up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers will be strewn in my path,'' he replied dryly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something will be,'' Thompson observed, even more dryly.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign was devilish. The senator pointed out Tom
Brokaw to one town hall audience as ``one of the last Trotskyites
... left-wing, Communist, pinkos of the American media.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminisced about an exotic dancer he had once dated, when he
was a single flyer. ``Marie, the flame thrower of Florida,'' he
said. Asked what she was like, he replied, ``She was pretty
volatile,'' and then slapped his knee and laughed, ``Har, har,
har!''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate occasionally used curse words, usually foreign to
campaigns. He called himself a ``wacko'' and ``an old geezer,'' and
his answers often degenerated into jokes. Sometimes his answers
went over a weird edge, as when he teased an Air Force veteran: ``I
tried to get in the Air Force, but my parents were married.''
Complaining it was not ``manly'' of Bush to keep him off the New
York ballot, McCain started to denounce it as Communistic. ``I
spent a portion of my life under that system,'' he said. Then he
stopped and smiled. ``How's that for demagoguery? _ Here, you wanna
see my medals?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Al Gore and Bush, who dole themselves out sparingly, the
Arizona senator offered a giddy excess of access to the press
contingent he dubbed ``great ferrets of truth.'' There was even a
teen-age reporter from Seventeen magazine, patiently waiting to ask
if McCain preferred Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, the man who loves to yak promised weekly yak
conferences. He also wants to start a dialogue with the Senate, a
la British Question Time.
</P>
<P>
   He was full of blunt answers. Queried about Bill Clinton's
legacy, he shot back: ``I think he'll be remembered as a great
waste. A great talent and a great waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was asked if he had given McCain any tips about
Tennessee, in case he ended up running against the vice president
from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never drink Jack Daniels on an empty stomach,'' Thompson
replied.

   SAN ANTONIO _ In the brush country of 17th-century South Texas,
Spanish ranchers introduced cattle that became known as the
longhorn. Not long after that, the cowboy _ one of the American
West's most enduring icons _ was born.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of their present-day counterparts, on horseback and in
pickups, are participating in an elaborately staged event to honor
cowboy culture, the 51st San Antonio Stock Show &AMP; Rodeo, which runs
through Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy continues to grow in popularity as millions make
annual treks to more than a thousand rodeos across the country.
Last year's San Antonio rodeo broke attendance records with more
than a million visitors, and organizers predict another record
year.
</P>
<P>
   More rodeo events than ever will be broadcast on television this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The sport also keeps producing stars such as Fred Whitfield of
Hockley, who earned the title of Best All-Around Cowboy and his
fourth calf-roping title at the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas
in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an ongoing fascination with the Old West,'' said Ed
Johnson of the Institute of Texan Cultures. ``It's filled with
great stories and lots of history and interesting facts that (are)
uniquely American, and people want to get a piece of it in any way
they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has helped. It romanticized, glorified and embellished
the Western image, creating a worldwide mythic hero, said Bobby
Weaver, assistant museum director at the National Cowboy Hall of
Fame and Western Heritage Center in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West has always been a kind of magical place in the minds
of the American public, and the West and all that it entails
surrounds rodeo,'' Weaver said. ``A rodeo also is a way the
American public can relive a romantic time gone by, and the events
are exciting and colorful.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's urbanization is another factor in the rise of
rodeo's popularity. People use the rodeo to get in touch with their
rural roots.
</P>
<P>
   One survey says half the people in Texas live within 20 miles of
Interstate 35 from Dallas to San Antonio and then east on
Interstate 10 to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little towns in West Texas are blowing away,'' said
Weaver, an Odessa native.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea DeLaune, marketing director of the San Antonio Stock Show
&AMP; Rodeo, said an annual survey of 15,000 people conducted at the
rodeo has found three reasons people visit the rodeo:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tradition. ``They say they came to the rodeo as a child or a
young adult,'' she said. ``They want to revisit it or bring their
own children. Plus, it's an annual family event, like Christmas,
and it falls between traditional holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Everyone wants to be a cowboy. ``People like to identify with
that image and that way of life, especially Texans. They like to
dress up once a year and come out to have fun in boots and jeans,''
DeLaune said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Value. ``The most expensive ticket is $22, and the cheapest is
$12, and you can watch a professional rodeo and a well-known
entertainer. Plus the grounds fee is just $5 for adults and $2 for
children under 12. It's a darn good entertainment value for the
family and cheaper than a movie matinee,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements and additions to the rodeo continue each year,
including eight instant-replay screens and a laser show in the
Freeman Coliseum. But the livestock remains a main draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even those not involved in agriculture say they love to go see
the horses, steers, hogs and poultry,'' DeLaune said. ``People will
spend an hour watching chicks hatch because they've never seen it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors say they are from urban areas. They represent a
broad range of ages and come from all ethnic groups and every walk
of life.
</P>
<P>
   That demographic also is reflected in rodeo's viewership of
Professional Bullriders Association events on television, said
Brian Hughes, vice president of programming at the Nashville
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good mix of people _ 40 percent women, the key
demographics in the 18-54 age group and mostly families,'' Hughes
said. ``We created a home for the PBR on Sunday nights on prime
time and nurtured it for five years. The audience has grown
immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodeo programming has grown, too, with 42 original PBR events
this year expanding to 90 minutes and the addition of 10
Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association programs, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``PBR is the extreme sport for the new millennium, and it brings
a contemporary and exciting flavor to the Old West,'' Hughes said.
``It's unfortunate that it's such a dangerous sport and so taxing
on the body that their careers are short-lived.''

&HT;     KEY TO GOOD EXERCISE IS IN THE STRETCH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ We hear it all the time: Stretch before that
pickup game at the playground. Stretch after you work out. Stretch
when you pick up the groceries. Stretch, stretch, stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching is a lot like flossing: You need to do it. You know
you should do it. It's just so mind-numbingly boring to do it.
Alas, if fitness doctors and gym gurus didn't tell you to stretch,
your aching bones and sore muscles would remind you about it. And
that could mean painful sprains or muscle tears.
</P>
<P>
   As for the boring factor, stretching expert Michael J. Alter
says all workout and no pliability makes Jack (or Jill) a dull
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is a mind-set,'' said Alter, the author of ``Sport
Stretch'' (Human Kinetics Publishers, $15.95) and a textbook for
trainers, ``The Science of Flexibility'' (Human Kinetics
Publishers, $38). ``If you've ever spoken to people who actually
stretch, they'll tell you it feels good. You have to break the
(negative) mind-set that you had from PE class as a kid, that it
was no fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cindy Kloewer, a trainer at Bally Total Fitness in San
Antonio, high school gym opened her eyes to the importance of
stretching for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get older, your muscles can get tighter,'' she said.
``So stretching at any time in your life is important for
flexibility. With all the talk about weight training and aerobics
and cardiovascular training, flexibility tends to be pushed to the
side. But it will only help in the long run with all those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Alter and Kloewer agree that stretching also improves your
posture and breathing, reduces risk of injury and maintains
springtime spring long into the autumn years.
</P>
<P>
   But before you transform yourself into the human rubber band,
get a physical checkup. Once you get the doctor's nod, start with
static stretching, which is done by slowly moving a joint toward
its peak range of motion. Avoid ballistic (or bouncing) stretches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to move slowly and smoothly into the stretch,'' Alter
said. ``This helps you avoid the initiation of the `stretch
reflex,' such as when you try to touch your toes real fast. That
bounce makes the muscles contract, which defeats the whole purpose
of stretching.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, don't confuse stretching with warming up for
exercise. ``Warming up'' literally gets your muscles warm (i.e.,
through running in place, lifting lightweights, etc.) before any
strenuous activity. Stretching warm muscles after a warm up
improves elasticity and contractibility of those muscles, so
stretch after you warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that means do both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stretching cold muscles is just plain bad,'' Kloewer said.
``You increase the risk of straining muscles, tendons or ligaments.
You need to have those muscles warmed up first with at least some
cardiovascular exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Just remember this simple order:
</P>
<P>
   _ Warm up at low intensity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stretch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Engage in physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cool down at low intensity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stretch again (yes, again).
</P>
<P>
   That after-workout stretch also helps muscles, Alter said.
``Your muscle tissue should be more pliable. It's like a transition
from exercise to rest. It will enhance your performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if you are exercising against the clock? Kloewer
suggests that if you absolutely, positively can't warm up and
stretch before and after each workout, at least stretch after your
workout.
</P>
<P>
   The key to healthy stretching is a healthy mind and body
connection. So relax. Visualize peaceful images, or simply meditate
on proper form for each stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're sitting down at home, why can't you just sit on the
floor and stretch?'' Kloewer said. ``At least do it at home, after
the kids are in bed, whenever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The point of stretching is to feel more at ease before, during
and after any physical activity. And what better way to improve
your hook shot, bench press or trek through the produce aisle all
in one reach?
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a stretch.

making stately and peaceful progress through blue waters, as the

abstracted fin. The new logo appeared for the first time on a

<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ A triumphant Senator John McCain stormed back on
to the presidential campaign trail Wednesday after inflicting a
crushing defeat on the Governor of Texas, George W. Bush, in
Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   His 18-point victory over the out and out front-runner for the
Republican Party's nomination burst the race wide open and made
Bush look vulnerable for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   After celebrating his victory at his New Hampshire headquarters,
McCain flew direct to South Carolina where more than 800 supporters
held an impromptu victory rally in his honor at 2:00 in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina primary, which takes place on Feb. 19, is
seen as the next crucial test for McCain. A conservative state,
with a strong record of support for George W. Bush's father, former
President George Bush, South Carolina is a state in which McCain
must do well if he is to have a chance of taking his campaign
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire Wednesday, McCain's victory was compared to
that of Ronald Reagan in 1980, whose trouncing of the establishment
favorite and victor in Iowa, George Bush, Sr., became the
springboard for his successful national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, said the local Concord paper Wednesday, had ``rushed to
Reagan like iron filings to a magnet'' in the final week of the New
Hampshire campaign, and McCain had drawn people in much the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   After his win, McCain alluded to the straight-talking
meet-the-people strategy that had brought him such success,
greeting cheering fans: ``Welcome to my 115th town meeting. We
finally have a poll without a margin of error.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator from Arizona had held 114 question-and-answer
meetings in six months of campaigning in New Hampshire, and it was
reckoned that one in four voters had seen him in person by election
day.
</P>
<P>
   He had held his final such meeting on Sunday, in the town of
Peterborough, where he also held his first, attracting more than
1,000 people, in contrast to the 40 who had turned up in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, he paid tribute to the reception he had
received from New Hampshire's famously independent voters, and
hammered away at the theme he placed at the center of his campaign:
``The Washington iron triangle of money, lobbyists and legislation,
which for so long has put special interests above the national
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sniping at the current administration _ and his possible
opponent further down the line _ he said it was ``the beginning of
the end for the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain concluded with this rallying cry: ``Our wonderful New
Hampshire campaign has come to an end. The great national crusade
has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, gave a gracious concession speech, looking
forward to victory in South Carolina and beyond. While giving
credit to McCain's strong campaign, he explained his defeat also by
the shorter time he had spent in New Hampshire _ partly because he,
unlike McCain, contested the Iowa caucuses _ and the singularity of
the state of New Hampshire and its voters.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was that the qualities that had won New
Hampshire for McCain would not translate onto the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   This argument, however, disregards the strong record of New
Hampshire in giving future winners their first unexpected break.
And, as with Ronald Reagan's win here, it was not only the size of
McCain's win that confounded all forecasts, but its shape.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment Republicans who were expected to follow the party
line and vote for George Bush were split evenly between the two.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also attracted the bulk of independent votes, many of the
notoriously fickle under-30 voters, and even some Democrats who
switched party allegiance to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   The youth vote for McCain _ as for the Democratic challenger,
Bill Bradley _ was particularly striking, given the recent
handwringing in political circles about the apathy and cynicism of
the young people towards all things and people political.
</P>
<P>
   They attended his rallies in force, listened intently to his
forceful and unscripted answers and cheered him to the rafters,
emerging with the joyful judgment that ``he would make a great
president, someone I could respect.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's personal history as a military hero and Vietnamese
prisoner of war, his readiness to take on the all-powerful
Washington establishment and the great and the good of the
Republican Party all contributed to his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the directness, frankness and transparent
truthfulness of his responses that came as such a refreshing change
for the voters and took New Hampshire by storm.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters admitted that they disagreed with some of his
positions, against abortion, for instance, but their confidence in
him personally outweighed such misgivings. In a national climate
where voters are jaded, these qualities could prove transferable.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside McCain, Bush came across as charming, but weak and
immature. New Hampshirites can pass on the charm, but they admire
character, and they found Bush wanting.
</P>
<P>
   His spontaneity was limited to hand-shaking; his speeches were
multiple variations on his original declaration speech from the
early summer.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texan just failed to connect _ a problem that also
afflicted his father, whose family estate at Kennebunkport is only
just over the border in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of George Bush, Sr. to campaign for his son over the
final weekend only underlined to many the aspects of George W. Bush
that New Hampshire least likes: his money and his establishment
lineage.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will not be able to count on similar disaffection with
the party establishment elsewhere in the country. Money and
organization count, and Bush has them in spades. But they may not
count for everything.
</P>
<P>
   The next two weeks will show whether McCain's New Hampshire
victory will remain, as he stated Wednesday, ``the greatest moment
of my political career,'' or whether there is more to come. &QL;

<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ A triumphant Senator John McCain stormed back on
to the presidential campaign trail Wednesday after inflicting a
crushing defeat on the Governor of Texas, George W. Bush, in
Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   His 18-point victory over the out and out front-runner for the
Republican Party's nomination burst the race wide open and made
Bush look vulnerable for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   After celebrating his victory at his New Hampshire headquarters,
McCain flew direct to South Carolina where more than 800 supporters
held an impromptu victory rally in his honor at 2:00 in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina primary, which takes place on Feb. 19, is
seen as the next crucial test for McCain. A conservative state,
with a strong record of support for George W. Bush's father, former
President George Bush, South Carolina is a state in which McCain
must do well if he is to have a chance of taking his campaign
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire Wednesday, McCain's victory was compared to
that of Ronald Reagan in 1980, whose trouncing of the establishment
favorite and victor in Iowa, George Bush, Sr., became the
springboard for his successful national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, said the local Concord paper Wednesday, had ``rushed to
Reagan like iron filings to a magnet'' in the final week of the New
Hampshire campaign, and McCain had drawn people in much the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   After his win, McCain alluded to the straight-talking
meet-the-people strategy that had brought him such success,
greeting cheering fans: ``Welcome to my 115th town meeting. We
finally have a poll without a margin of error.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator from Arizona had held 114 question-and-answer
meetings in six months of campaigning in New Hampshire, and it was
reckoned that one in four voters had seen him in person by election
day.
</P>
<P>
   He had held his final such meeting on Sunday, in the town of
Peterborough, where he also held his first, attracting more than
1,000 people, in contrast to the 40 who had turned up in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, he paid tribute to the reception he had
received from New Hampshire's famously independent voters, and
hammered away at the theme he placed at the center of his campaign:
``The Washington iron triangle of money, lobbyists and legislation,
which for so long has put special interests above the national
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sniping at the current administration _ and his possible
opponent further down the line _ he said it was ``the beginning of
the end for the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain concluded with this rallying cry: ``Our wonderful New
Hampshire campaign has come to an end. The great national crusade
has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, gave a gracious concession speech, looking
forward to victory in South Carolina and beyond. While giving
credit to McCain's strong campaign, he explained his defeat also by
the shorter time he had spent in New Hampshire _ partly because he,
unlike McCain, contested the Iowa caucuses _ and the singularity of
the state of New Hampshire and its voters.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was that the qualities that had won New
Hampshire for McCain would not translate onto the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   This argument, however, disregards the strong record of New
Hampshire in giving future winners their first unexpected break.
And, as with Ronald Reagan's win here, it was not only the size of
McCain's win that confounded all forecasts, but its shape.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment Republicans who were expected to follow the party
line and vote for George Bush were split evenly between the two.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also attracted the bulk of independent votes, many of the
notoriously fickle under-30 voters, and even some Democrats who
switched party allegiance to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   The youth vote for McCain _ as for the Democratic challenger,
Bill Bradley _ was particularly striking, given the recent
handwringing in political circles about the apathy and cynicism of
the young people towards all things and people political.
</P>
<P>
   They attended his rallies in force, listened intently to his
forceful and unscripted answers and cheered him to the rafters,
emerging with the joyful judgment that ``he would make a great
president, someone I could respect.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's personal history as a military hero and Vietnamese
prisoner of war, his readiness to take on the all-powerful
Washington establishment and the great and the good of the
Republican Party all contributed to his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the directness, frankness and transparent
truthfulness of his responses that came as such a refreshing change
for the voters and took New Hampshire by storm.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters admitted that they disagreed with some of his
positions, against abortion, for instance, but their confidence in
him personally outweighed such misgivings. In a national climate
where voters are jaded, these qualities could prove transferable.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside McCain, Bush came across as charming, but weak and
immature. New Hampshirites can pass on the charm, but they admire
character, and they found Bush wanting.
</P>
<P>
   His spontaneity was limited to hand-shaking; his speeches were
multiple variations on his original declaration speech from the
early summer.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texan just failed to connect _ a problem that also
afflicted his father, whose family estate at Kennebunkport is only
just over the border in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of George Bush, Sr. to campaign for his son over the
final weekend only underlined to many the aspects of George W. Bush
that New Hampshire least likes: his money and his establishment
lineage.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will not be able to count on similar disaffection with
the party establishment elsewhere in the country. Money and
organization count, and Bush has them in spades. But they may not
count for everything.
</P>
<P>
   The next two weeks will show whether McCain's New Hampshire
victory will remain, as he stated Wednesday, ``the greatest moment
of my political career,'' or whether there is more to come. &QL;

<P>
   The self-frustrating attempts of Tony Blair's government to
foist its favored candidates upon unwilling party members in Wales,
and London, have made us familiar with the dynamics that helped to
determine the outcome of America's New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Their status as crown princes waiting for coronation is surely
one reason why Republican and Democratic voters in the ``granite
state'' failed to give George W. Bush and Al Gore the ecstatic
support they may once have expected in the opening round of this
year's presidential primaries. But the natural desire to kick over
the traces tells only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   A virtue of the primary system is that it forces would-be
candidates to face ``real'' voters, not just party hacks and those
with strong affiliations to a cause or a movement.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly important at a time when there is a
practical consensus on most of the main issues of the day, so that
the character of the candidates comes to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Take the contest among the Democrats first. A few months ago, as
vice president in an administration that was presiding over a
period of unparalleled national prosperity, Gore was the
unchallenged heir apparent to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But when the former New Jersey senator and one-time star
basketball player Bill Bradley entered the lists under the flag of
reform, Gore found his opinion poll ratings sagging badly.
</P>
<P>
   His response _ to move his election headquarters from Washington
to his home state of Tennessee and to start wearing cowboy boots
and shouting a lot _ may seem a little obvious to worldly-wise
British eyes, but it seems to have done him a lot of good.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore once planned to see off his rival's challenge early in
the season, thus sparing his party much expenditure in dollars and
bad blood, New Hampshire will have disappointed him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's 47 percent of the vote is enough to encourage him to
carry his challenge forward, and he has already raised nearly as
much campaigning money as the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore may have failed to score the clean knockout he
desired, on the Republican side Bush was battered badly by his
challenger, Senator John McCain, who took five votes for every
three that went to Bush. (The remaining three Republican hopefuls,
who shared 14 percent of the vote between them, would be well
advised to abandon all hope for this year's nomination.)
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's main claim to the nomination was the huge popular lead
he held in early polling, it was a particularly bad result for him.
The debates so far have shown that there is strangely little of
substance in his thought, beyond a blatant appeal to religious
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   His sole remaining advantage is the $69 million war chest he has
amassed, which will be crucial in paying for TV advertising in the
big states, where person-to-person campaigning is fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Senator McCain, by ironic contrast, has made so much of his
desire to take the influence of big money out of politics, that he
may have a hard time raising the funds he will need to compete in
the remaining primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, if he does well on Feb. 19 in South Carolina (a
Southern state proclaimed ``Bush country'' by Bush himself), we may
yet see one of the great political upsets.
</P>
<P>
   We would not be unhappy to see the crumpling of that cardboard
figure. And a presidential race that pits a crusading outsider
against a veteran Washington insider such as Gore could present the
American voter with a genuine choice this November. &QL;

   Seals and yachts are helping oceanographers satisfy their
insatiable appetite for data, scientists revealed last week. They
hope data from electronic probes attached to the animals and boats
will help us understand ocean dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers studying northern elephant seals have for years been
fitting the animals with electronic tags that record the water
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   George Boehlert of the Pacific Fisheries Environmental
Laboratory in Pacific Grove, Calif., realized the seals could
reveal conditions in remote ocean areas where existing data is
sparse. They dive 600 meters down, giving excellent depth coverage.
``We are collaborating to take advantage of all this data,''
Boehlert says.
</P>
<P>
   He and his colleagues are already using seal data to study ocean
fronts in the northeastern Pacific. During one three-month period,
seal tags have recorded over 22,000 temperature profiles in a
region where conventional monitors only provided 52 measurements.
The readings could be used to improve ocean modeling and verify
satellite data.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers working with the International SeaKeepers Society
have also developed sampling devices to attach to luxury yachts.
These monitors collect data on everything from temperature to
phytoplankton levels. Simpler modules will be fitted to racing
yachts during next year's round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race. This
should reveal how robust they are with the goal of fitting them to
more stable ships in the future. &QL;

<P>
   Perplexed by the sparsity of plant life immediately surrounding
the Great Barrier Reef, two Queensland biologists may have stumbled
on a clutch of new, natural weedkillers that appear to be harmless
to people, animals and crop plants.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Burnell, a molecular biologist from James Cook University,
was out scubadiving on the reef, which runs along the coast of
Queensland, when it struck him that the coral was extremely bare in
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything on the reef was thriving except for free-growing
seabed plants,'' he said. He and his colleague Lyndon Llewellyn
from the Australian Institute of Marine Science at Cape Ferguson
speculated that some animals inhabiting the reef could be secreting
chemicals that prevent plant growth, perhaps to stop plants
clogging their habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The pair screened about 5,000 samples from many reef organisms.
Now they have isolated a group of compounds that disable an enzyme
specific to photosynthesis in the group of plants classified by
biologists as C4. This class of plants include almost all important
weed species _ plants that grow faster than crop plants.
</P>
<P>
   Most commercial crops are plants of the C3 variety, which use
carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere to manufacture sugar in
their leaves, where the process is subject to interference from
oxygen. But C4 plants throw in an intermediate step: They take up
carbon dioxide as bicarbonate and transport it to an intracellular
compartment where sugars can be made, isolated from oxygen. This
makes C4 photosynthesis more efficient, and means that under warm,
light conditions C4 plants grow wildly and profusely _ literally
like weeds.
</P>
<P>
   A joint research team led by Burnell and Llewellyn found the
weed-killing compounds by looking for those extracts which
inhibited an enzyme that is crucial to C4-style operation. They
found 60 active extracts from which they have so far analyzed the
structure of four active _ and unrelated _ compounds.
</P>
<P>
   In greenhouse experiments, the compounds _ whose identity is
under wraps until patents are filed _ kill only C4 plants when
painted on the leaves. If they are as selective in the field, the
researchers say, a herbicide developed from them could be sprayed
on crops just when needed, because it would only affect the weeds.
The idea has yet to be tested.
</P>
<P>
   Burnell says any herbicide developed from the new reef compounds
would be very different from glyphosate, the most widely used crop
herbicide, to which many weeds are becoming resistant. Given the
chemical is already part of the reef environment, it should be
easily biodegradable, Burnell argues, and also be harmless to fish,
which are particularly sensitive to many current herbicides. This
is important because much herbicide ends up in rivers and seas. &QL;

   Microorganisms in the sea floor may soon be producing an
unlimited supply of electricity to power equipment such as sensors
and sonar beacons. It comes from a fuel cell developed with funding
from the U.S. Department of Defense, which taps into a natural
voltage gradient at the bottom of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Bugs living in sea water, or on the top layer of sea floor
sediments, use oxygen to break down organic matter, releasing
energy as they go. Those that live further down where there is no
oxygen, have to rely on other chemicals, such as nitrates and
sulfates.
</P>
<P>
   These different reactions create an electrical potential
difference, just like the voltage between opposite electrodes of a
battery. Clare Reimers at Oregon State University in Corvallis and
Leonard Tender of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington D.C.
decided to harness this in a fuel cell, to provide an endless
source of electrical energy.
</P>
<P>
   Their lab prototype uses a negatively charged electrode buried
in about 10 centimeters of sediment with a positively charged
partner just above the surface. When the electrodes are connected,
they generate 0.03 watts per square meter, enough power to run a
small light emitting diode. And the tireless work of microbes means
that the power supply should be never-ending. ``That is incredibly
cool,'' says Deborah Bronk, a microbiologist at the University of
Georgia in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Reimers is experimenting to increase the cell's power. In the
spring, divers will install similar fuel cells in real ocean
sediments. Later versions could be designed to bury themselves. &QL;

<P>
   The self-frustrating attempts of Tony Blair's government to
foist its favored candidates upon unwilling party members in Wales,
and London, have made us familiar with the dynamics that helped to
determine the outcome of America's New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Their status as crown princes waiting for coronation is surely
one reason why Republican and Democratic voters in the ``granite
state'' failed to give George W. Bush and Al Gore the ecstatic
support they may once have expected in the opening round of this
year's presidential primaries. But the natural desire to kick over
the traces tells only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   A virtue of the primary system is that it forces would-be
candidates to face ``real'' voters, not just party hacks and those
with strong affiliations to a cause or a movement.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly important at a time when there is a
practical consensus on most of the main issues of the day, so that
the character of the candidates comes to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Take the contest among the Democrats first. A few months ago, as
vice president in an administration that was presiding over a
period of unparalleled national prosperity, Gore was the
unchallenged heir apparent to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But when the former New Jersey senator and one-time star
basketball player Bill Bradley entered the lists under the flag of
reform, Gore found his opinion poll ratings sagging badly.
</P>
<P>
   His response _ to move his election headquarters from Washington
to his home state of Tennessee and to start wearing cowboy boots
and shouting a lot _ may seem a little obvious to worldly-wise
British eyes, but it seems to have done him a lot of good.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore once planned to see off his rival's challenge early in
the season, thus sparing his party much expenditure in dollars and
bad blood, New Hampshire will have disappointed him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's 47 percent of the vote is enough to encourage him to
carry his challenge forward, and he has already raised nearly as
much campaigning money as the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore may have failed to score the clean knockout he
desired, on the Republican side Bush was battered badly by his
challenger, Senator John McCain, who took five votes for every
three that went to Bush. (The remaining three Republican hopefuls,
who shared 14 percent of the vote between them, would be well
advised to abandon all hope for this year's nomination.)
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's main claim to the nomination was the huge popular lead
he held in early polling, it was a particularly bad result for him.
The debates so far have shown that there is strangely little of
substance in his thought, beyond a blatant appeal to religious
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   His sole remaining advantage is the $69 million war chest he has
amassed, which will be crucial in paying for TV advertising in the
big states, where person-to-person campaigning is fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Senator McCain, by ironic contrast, has made so much of his
desire to take the influence of big money out of politics, that he
may have a hard time raising the funds he will need to compete in
the remaining primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, if he does well on Feb. 19 in South Carolina (a
Southern state proclaimed ``Bush country'' by Bush himself), we may
yet see one of the great political upsets.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think about it, a house has only two moving parts, doors
and windows. Doors get the most use. Some, like the entry door or
the bathroom door, are opened and closed a number of times every
day. Windows, on the other hand, may remain closed during the
winter months or open in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Doors may seem simple, just a slab of wood, but in fact the
average door is carefully constructed of a number of pieces
fabricated to help the door move properly while withstanding a
variety of stresses. Entry doors, for example, are made to
withstand the vicissitudes of nature. They must remain
dimensionally stable during the temperature extremes of winter and
summer. They must withstand rain, snow, the heat of the sun and
they must also be sturdy enough to keep the house safe and secure
from break-ins. In addition to being functional, doors must be
attractive enough for the surrounding decor of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The standard door for all homes before World War II was the
panel door. Panel doors are made up of vertical pieces called
stiles and horizontal pieces called rails. In between the rails and
stiles are broad flat pieces called panels. All these pieces are of
solid wood fitted together with sophisticated joinery, much like a
good cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The rails and stiles are held together firmly with glue. The
panels, however, are contained in grooves cut into the edges of the
rails and stiles. There is no glue holding them in place. In
effect, the panels ''float'' in place so they can expand and
contract with temperature and humidity changes. A gap between the
panels and the internal edges of the groove allows clearance to
accommodate the panels as they expand. All this means that the
panel door remains dimensionally stable even though its parts may
change.
</P>
<P>
   Modern panel doors ensure an extra measure of stability by using
rails and stiles made of laminated wood. The manufacturers cover
strips of softwood ( which absorbs less moisture than hardwood)
with hardwood veneer. This lamination process creates stiles and
rails that are lightweight and less likely to change with humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Even with high-speed woodworking machines, it takes time to make
a panel door, so they can be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   During the postwar building boom, builders used more precut and
assembled units to construct houses. They turned to flush doors as
a cheaper substitute for paneled doors. Another reason for using
flush doors was that the simple facade of the door blended in with
current decorating trends that emphasized clean lines and plain,
unadorned surfaces. In contrast, panel doors seemed downright
Victorian.
</P>
<P>
   Originally flush doors were made by gluing 1/8-inch thick
plywood sheets to a core of short wood blocks (called staves) glued
together. Later, the cores were made of particleboard. These doors
were lighter in weight than panel doors and less expensive because
the cores were made from scrap wood. The simple construction of
flush doors eliminated the need for sophisticated joinery. These
doors could be mass-produced in large hydraulic presses.
</P>
<P>
   Later, manufacturers developed the hollow-core flush door where
the wood core was replaced by a wood or cardboard lattice. This
type of door had less wood so it was lightweight, yet the core
lattice made it sturdy and rigid. Flush doors can also be made
fire-resistant by filling the core with an inert material like
fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that panel doors are largely obsolete, but this is
not the case. Many homeowners feel that a panel door is not as
austere as a flush door and it blends better with traditional
decorating schemes. Unfortunately, because of the workmanship
involved, panel doors are considerably more expensive than flush
doors. Recently, manufacturers have introduced a door that offers
the look of a panel door at half the price.
</P>
<P>
   These doors are constructed around a hollow frame like ordinary
flush doors, but the frame is covered with molded hardboard panels.
The panels imitate the contours and lines of a traditional panel
door. Since the panels are made of molded particleboard or
fiberglass, they must be painted.
</P>
<P>
   Using a similar construction technique, door manufacturers have
introduced a new line of entry doors with steel or fiberglass
sheathing molded and painted to replicate the look of wood panel
doors. These doors are sturdier than wooden doors, virtually
maintenance free, and they are less vulnerable to the weather. They
also have an insulated core to retain interior heat during the cold
months.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a steel entry door can still warp temporarily if
exposed to the hot summer sun, but they will return to their
original shape as the temperature cools. One way to minimize this
is to choose a steel entry door that is painted a light color, like
white or beige.

   HKC-VERMONT (Burlington, Vt.) _ Corey LaTulippe was the only
member of the Vermont Catamounts who was actually born here and he
grew up in a nearby suburb. A goalie, LaTulippe's boyhood dream was
to play for the university. But his college career lasted only a
few weeks. According to LaTulippe and some other hockey players,
his teammates subjected LaTulippe to severe hazing. LaTulippe quit
school soon afterward and filed a lawsuit against the university
that has set off a spiral of events still reverberating across the
school and the state. The state attorney general launched a
criminal investigation. And when it became clear that veteran
hockey players had lied during an earlier investigation of the
hazing, the university president took a bold and unprecedented
step: She canceled the college hockey season with two months to go.

 By JEAN E. HERSKOWITZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not long ago, Helen Fisher was exiting the subway at
34th Street and Broadway when someone grabbed the cell phone out of
her hand and ran. ``I was holding it till I could put it back into
my pocketbook,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Fisher, the chief executive of Netlink, a
telecommunications company, told her friends what had happened,
many related similar experiences. ``One friend had his ripped off
from the seat next to him at Yankee Stadium,'' Fisher said. Another
had hers stolen from her car. The thief left the radio but took the
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the cell phones themselves that can be a target of
thieves _ their identifying numbers are also sought by criminals.
When a cell phone is used, its mobile telephone number and
electronic serial number are transmitted through radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, thieves could easily pluck those numbers from
the air by using scanning devices bought in electronics stores.
Such numbers from legitimate phone accounts can be programmed into
other phones, often stolen phones.
</P>
<P>
   Safeguards developed in recent years have made that practice,
called cloning, much harder to accomplish. The Cellular Telephone
Industry Association in Washington has reported that the revenue
lost by carriers because of calls made on stolen phones dropped to
$166 million in 1999, down from $850 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanna DeMaria, vice president of the business security
department for AT&AMP;T Wireless Services, said that cloning had
declined markedly because ``the industry has launched a robust
attack against it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the experience of Fisher and her friends shows, cell
phone theft and cloning have not disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cloning is common practice around here,'' said Chip Smith, the
special agent in charge of the New York Electronic Crimes Task
Force of the Secret Service. Smith said so-called magic phones,
which hold up to 99 electronic serial numbers stolen from other
phones, could be bought on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Drug dealers program new serial numbers between drug
transactions, making wiretaps almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement can't keep up with it,'' Smith acknowledged.
``A court order is only good for a certain phone number. Once that
number is changed, we need a new court order. We get gang members
who open a phone line to another country and pass the phone around
the neighborhood so everyone can make calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Lex Wilkinson, a vice president of the Professional Security
Bureau, a loss-prevention and investigative services organization
based in Nutley, N.J., said the statistics showing a drop in cell
phone fraud at least partly reflected the lower costs of cell phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, cell phone calls cost about 50 cents a
minute,'' Wilkinson said. ``Now a minute on a cell phone costs a
lot less. If you took your phone out of your home market back then,
you paid a roaming surcharge of $1.50 for every minute you used
that phone. Now there are one-rate plans for 10 cents a minute. So,
yeah _ if you measure the drop in cell phone fraud in dollars
instead of minutes, it looks like fraud losses have dropped 90
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Thieves usually deliver stolen phones to a fence, Wilkinson
said. ``When cloning was prevalent in the early '90s, thieves might
have gotten $25 per phone,'' he said. ``Now they get maybe $5 a
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminals illegally ship phones to countries like Colombia,
Mexico and Russia when the phones cannot be activated in this
country, Wilkinson said. ``There's often a wireless service
provider there that will activate the phone,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A street thief, like the one who stole Fisher's phone, Wilkinson
said, might be able to use a cellular phone for an hour or two
before the victim remembers to call the carrier and shut down the
phone. ``You may not think it makes sense to steal a phone for a
few hours of use,'' he said, ``but the reality is, if the phone has
international dialing capabilities, those few hours might get a
thief $50 if he sells it.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat cell phone fraud, carriers now have the ability to
blacklist stolen phone numbers as soon as the theft is reported,
sharing the information with cellular businesses across the
country. ``To the extent that carriers participate in it, the
industry maintains a database and reports phones that have been
stolen,'' said DeMaria, at AT&AMP;T Wireless Services. Many carriers,
however, are not participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equipment is turning over so fast, many carriers have made
a business decision to not do database inquiries,'' Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Another wrinkle is that salespeople typically earn a commission
each time they activate a phone. ``There are undersupervised,
aggressive salespeople out there who will activate a phone they
know to be stolen,'' Wilkinson said. ``The single biggest issue in
cellular sales today is how fast you can put your wireless service
onto a phone, and into a customer's hand. That's what drives the
business.''

   Saving Cyclamen
</P>
<P>
   Q: I adore hardy cyclamens in my home for winter color. I have
great success with them each winter, but try as I may to keep them
alive, they always shrivel and die by Easter. Am I just observing
their life cycle or is there a way I can keep them alive to flower
again next winter?
</P>
<P>
   A: They may shrivel, but they don't die until you give up and
toss them. After flowering, Cyclamen persicum, also known as
florist's cyclamen, begins to go dormant. If you really want to
save it, you can, although the plant will probably have fewer
flowers, fewer leaves and that ``look, Mom, I made it myself''
appearance. If that doesn't bother you, give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Miller, a professor of flower bulb and greenhouse
physiology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., said you can
extend the bloom period by keeping the plant cool (low 60s at
night) and not overwatering _ let the top inch of soil dry out
between waterings. If the pot has a foil wrap, punch a few holes in
it on the bottom to let the water drain, and never let it sit in
water. Too wet encourages soil-borne fungus diseases.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaves dry out, Miller said, start reducing the water,
and once all of them are shriveled, let the soil go bone dry. Put
the pot out of the way for two months, since the cyclamen doesn't
need light or any help from you. After it is rested, bring it out
to bright light, start watering and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   This cyclamen may be hardy (in the sense of being vigorous) in
the florist's shop, but it is not hardy (in the sense of
overwintering outdoors) unless you live in a Mediterranean climate.
But its relative, Cyclamen hederifolium, is a hardy cyclamen in
Zones 5 to 7. It looks like a petite version of C. persicum, blooms
in the fall and will come back as good as new every year _
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Stay-at-Home Houseplants
</P>
<P>
   Q: I will be away for a month this winter. What is the best way
to try to save houseplants, small or large? Heat will be minimal
and I will water well before I leave. But 30 days? Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several automatic watering systems available for
houseplants, but none is as good as a friend or neighbor who will
stick a finger in the soil to see if water is needed. Barring that,
the strategy is to reduce the amount of water the plants will want,
and then try to provide it somehow. But no matter what you do,
expect some indignation from the plants. You'd better bring them
back something better than a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   You can lower plants' demands by slowing their growth. Lowering
temperatures and moving them into slightly lower than usual light
will help. Cold and dark, however, will eventually result in dead
or dying plants, so don't go overboard. Several pots grouped close
together and tented with clear plastic will raise the humidity, so
the plants won't dry out as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation watering systems mostly depend on the laws of physics
to move water from reservoirs to dry pots: wicks or tubes with
sensors that go right down into the soil, or capillary mats that
bring the water in contact with the drainage holes on the bottom of
the pot, where it can be absorbed and transferred to the soil.
Either way, as the soil dries, water is drawn into the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Another system, sold under various names, is a battery-operated
pump that regularly delivers a set amount of water into the pot
whether or not the soil is dry. They remind me of Mickey Mouse's
broom running amok in the ``Sorcerer's Apprentice'' segment in
``Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources for watering systems _ they range in price from about
$12 for a set of three terra cotta cone wicks to about $70 for the
battery system _ include Charley's Greenhouse Supply, 17979 State
Route 536, Mount Vernon, Wash. 98273, (800) 322-4707; and
Gardener's Supply, 128 Intervale Rd., Burlington, Vt. 05401, (800)
955-3370. Both have free catalogs.

making stately and peaceful progress through blue waters, as the
key to the mood they wanted to suggest. The result was an
abstracted fin. The new logo appeared for the first time on a

   HKC-VERMONT (Burlington, Vt.) _ Corey LaTulippe was the only

grew up in a nearby suburb. A goalie, LaTulippe's boyhood dream was
to play for the university. But his college career lasted only a
few weeks. According to LaTulippe and some other hockey players,
his teammates subjected LaTulippe to severe hazing. LaTulippe quit
school soon afterward and filed a lawsuit against the university
that has set off a spiral of events still reverberating across the
school and the state. The state attorney general launched a
criminal investigation. And when it became clear that veteran
hockey players had lied during an earlier investigation of the
hazing, the university president took a bold and unprecedented
step: She canceled the college hockey season with two months to go.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Laboratories, the research and development arm of Lucent
Technologies, and the Bell Atlantic Mobile division of Bell
Atlantic Corp. have announced a technology that will allow people
with hearing and speech impairments to make digital cellular calls
using text-telephone, or teletypewriter, devices.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Linsky, a spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic Mobile, said the
company plans to market phones that are compatible with such
devices, known as TTY equipment, in its stores and online in the
second half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The company will work with handset manufacturers including
Motorola, Audiovox and Qualcomm to incorporate the technology into
new handset models. The TTY-compatible phones will have a jack for
connecting with a portable TTY device. There will be no added
charge for the TTY compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Several wireless companies have worked on a TTY solution since
the Federal Communications Commission mandated in 1996 that TTY
users have wireless access to 911 emergency services. Part of the
challenge in developing a wireless-compatible TTY was that a
wireless phone's vocoder (the part in the handset that digitizes
and processes the human voice) could not decode a TTY's broad range
of tones without a high margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first company to offer an end-to-end solution with
a very small margin of error,'' said Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman
for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. ``The
cellular industry is very committed to putting wireless in the
hands of all consumers, including those with hearing loss, and this
is a very important step towards that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   TTY devices, which cost as little as $150 or as much as $700 for
a portable model, have been used since the 1960s to transmit and
receive text messages over phone lines. They generally consist of a
keyboard, a screen, a telephone handset and an acoustic receiver
and transmitter that sends a series of high-pitched tones over the
phone line. The TTY device at the receiving end decodes the tones
and displays them as text on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The devices are used in a number of ways by those with impaired
hearing or speech. Two people equipped with TTY devices can
communicate with each other over phone lines in a straight text
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Someone not equipped with a TTY device, on the other hand, can
``talk'' to a deaf person via the Telecommunications Relay Service,
a toll-free service that began in 1993 and is available in every
state. The service's operators, equipped with TTY devices,
translate messages from text to voice and vice versa for both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent and Bell Atlantic said they would make the technology
available at no cost to other wireless carriers and handset
manufacturers. But it is not yet clear whether other wireless
service providers, many of whom have been working on their own
TTY-compatible solutions, will adopt the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of work going on since 1996,'' said John
Giere, vice president for strategic marketing at Ericsson, the
world's third-largest mobile phone manufacturer. ``I don't know if
we'll be using this specific technology, but this will be one
option to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   David Dzumba, a project manager at the Nokia Mobile Phones
Product Creation Center, said the company is working with Lucent to
produce phones that will transmit TTY across wireless networks that
use Code Division Multiple Access, or CDMA, technology, by late
this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's announcement has been received positively by consumers
with impaired hearing or speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Lucent is offering this thing as a free upgrade
should really help the industry to implement it,'' said Dr. Judy
Harkins, director of the technology assessment program at Gallaudet
University, a school for the deaf in Washington. Harkins
participated in the Wireless TTY Forum, a standards committee
organized after the FCC mandate.

   Q: What is a cookie file? How does it get on my computer? Does
this file permit a third party to gain access to my data?
</P>
<P>
   A: In Internet terms, a cookie is a text message that a Web
server sends to your Web browser when you are looking at a Web

&HT;     EXPERTS PRAISE CARRIER'S HANDLING OF JET CRASH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Alaska Airlines Chairman John F. Kelly flew
to Los Angeles Monday night to be near the crash site of Flight
261, he earned high marks from corporate communications
specialists, as did a ``care team'' the airline dispatched to San
Francisco International Airport to console family and friends of
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves were part of the efficiency and compassion that often
is critical to handling emergencies and crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with crises, be it tainted food or defective products,
is a part of doing business. But crisis management is especially
important for airlines, where accidents or mistakes can cost
tremendous loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When calamities happen, it's not just one person. They make
news and they lead to investigations,'' Don Solem, president of
Solem &AMP; Associates, a San Francisco communications company, said in
reference to airlines and ``the second tier'' of sensitive
businesses, such as those that handle hazardous substances.
</P>
<P>
   Solem said companies caught in a public crisis need to stick
with a single spokesperson and strive to be ``open, thorough and
ubiquitous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Express sorrow and put a chief figure out there. Don't invent
and don't freelance. Be sure what you say is correct, and repeat
it, repeat it and repeat it. One of the goals is to reassure the
flying public that this is an aberration,'' Solem said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen, Alaska gets very high marks,'' said Lisa
LeMaster, president of the Dallas-based LeMaster Group, a
communications and crisis management company that has consulted for
commercial airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``What counts most in these situations is speed,'' said
LeMaster, who praised the Alaska Airlines Internet site for having
``updates constantly'' since the crash of the MD-83 jetliner with
88 people aboard. ``Feeding the dragon is really hard now; so many
news organizations are trying to publish the news instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   In time-pressed situations, especially with a loss of life,
LeMaster said, companies have to first deal with the emotions of
the friends and families of victims. Then, ``you deal with the
facts. Don't speculate. The media start asking why and what
happened long before the black box is found. You can't listen to
those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many carriers decline to discuss their plans for dealing with
the public in the time of emergency, although all airlines say they
have plans prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Of the half dozen airlines contacted for this story, only
Northwest Airlines agreed to discuss its approach on the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two major priorities,'' said Northwest spokesman Jeff
Smith. ``Our first is to be information dispensers to customers and
employees. Second, to assist the authorities in conducting their
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are so highly emotional because they're so
visible,'' Smith said, referring to air crashes. ``We know it would
be months until you really know what happened. The first thing you
have to do is care for people. For the first three or four days,
all of your focus is on being comforting.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Alaska Airlines' response to the loss of Flight 261, Smith
said, ``I think they did a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping relatives of victims and other airline employees, as
Alaska did at San Francisco International Airport, where Flight 261
was bound, is the highest priority, other airline officials said.

</P>
<P>
   Legal ramifications are major issues for companies in crisis _
especially when someone dies.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle lawyer Bill Marler, who sued the Odwalla beverage
company and Jack in the Box fast-food restaurants on behalf of
consumers sickened by contaminated food, said lawsuits are a given
after plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance policies, Marler said, will cover any damages assessed
against an airline. More problematic, from a public relations
standpoint, is damage to a company's reputation. Rebuilding
confidence, Marler said, is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is to stand up and say, `I am sorry, it's my
fault.' Have an action plan in place. It can't be empty words.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Alaska Airlines, which had not had a fatal crash since 1976
before Monday's accident, Marler said, ``I think Alaska has been
doing a remarkable job of getting their message out there.''

&HT;     HISTORIANS WILL HAVE TOUGH TIME ASSSESSING CLINTON PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
 -COLUMN-$ADV206-HNS  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Feb. 6)   &HT;     (For use by New York times News Service)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Future historians will have a difficult time
assessing Bill Clinton's presidency, trying to balance his decadent
personal behavior against the achievements of his administration
and his grandiose goals for the future.
</P>
<P>
   If he were less intelligent and visionary about the ways to
continue improving the lot of the people, he might end up at the
bottom of the presidential ratings. That is, he might rank beside
Warren G. Harding, whose White House was the scene of a sexual
liaison with his young mistress and alcoholic binges with his
friends despite the fact that Prohibition was the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's personal conduct and veracity were more in line
with what Americans rightfully expect of their presidents, he might
be categorized as an outstanding president.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if the men and women who will be chronicling the Clinton
era can separate the president's personal behavior from his public
conduct, he will fare well. If not, he will fare poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, unless the United States is gripped by a depression, war or
some other unanticipated catastrophe in the next 11 months, Clinton
will leave the republic in as healthy a state as it ever has known.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the exaggerated rhetoric and partisan politics that one
expects from presidents in their State of the Union addresses,
Clinton was not far from the truth when he told Congress and the
people on Jan. 27:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very fortunate to be alive at this moment in history.
Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity
and social progress with so few external threats. Never before have
we had such a blessed opportunity _ and therefore such a profound
obligation _ to build the more perfect union of our founders'
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, his speech was too long and his proposals for
government spending too numerous and too costly. As usual also,
Republican House leaders Richard Armey and Tom DeLay, looking for
all the world like figures in Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, refused
to applaud or demonstrate any reaction other than boredom as
Clinton listed his agenda for the future.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand their abhorrence of the actions that
led to Clinton's impeachment by the House and very nearly to his
removal from office by the Senate. But he is the
commander-in-chief, twice elected by the American people, and most
of his proposals were designed to help Americans in all walks of
life.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Republicans might recall that some of their own
exalted leaders _ Newt Gingrich, Henry Hyde, Bob Livingston and Dan
Burton _ also were revealed to have had extra-marital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   As for claiming credit for the economic resurgence and all that
goes with it, Clinton was simply following the pattern established
long ago by his predecessors. Ronald Reagan, for example,
repeatedly boasted that economic growth during his presidency was
the result of his policies.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Reagan could boast of the longest peacetime economic
expansion, Clinton can brag of ``the longest period of economic
growth in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians and economists will argue over the importance or lack
of importance of Clinton's policies in achieving that seminal
success. But when the economy turns down, as inevitably it must,
the man in the White House will be blamed, as President George Bush
was in 1992 and Jimmy Carter was in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is an amazing president. His deportment has ranged from
the profligate to the magnificent. Two days after his last State of
the Union presentation, he was, according to news accounts, the
star performer at a meeting of the World Economic Forum in
Switzerland. He was the leader who had steered America to a budget
surplus after 30 consecutive years of deficit. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
played major roles in that achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But it should be noted that a wise leader listens to his wise
advisers and often follows their counsel. That is what Harry Truman
did at the beginning of the Cold War when he launched the Marshall
Plan to rebuild war-devastated Europe and decreed that America
would contain communist aggression. And that is why Truman is more
admired today that he was in the waning days of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting facet of the Clinton presidency is that the
American people, in poll after poll, have been able to separate the
private man from the public man. While disapproving his private
conduct by better than 50 percent, they have approved his handling
of the presidency by about the same margin.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater, Monica Lewinsky, shoddy fundraising practices and
several minor scandals always will be associated with Clinton's
name. But so will the longest period of economic expansion in the
211-year history of the republic along with prodigious efforts to
achieve permanent peace in the Middle East and Ireland and conduct
a war in Kosovo that did not claim the life of a single American in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   That is his legacy.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine you are in your sport utility urban assault vehicle,
heading to work, when a new and unknown song on the radio tickles
your fancy. Knowing that modern radio D.J.s no longer announce the
name of the artist or the title of a song, you simply point your
Xenote iTag clicker at the radio, click it and go about your day.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later the radio barks out an advertisement for a
new two-line cellular phone with caller ID and call waiting, just
the perfect thing for your morning commute. But you cannot write
down the details because you are driving 80 miles an hour in heavy
traffic while reading the paper and trying to dial your current
cell phone, so you once again click the iTag at the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the office, you connect the iTag to your computer, log
on to your personal Xenote Web page, and upload the iTag
information. A few seconds later, up pops the name of the song you
admired, the artist and the CD, with a picture of the CD cover, a
list of other CD's by the same artist, and a link to an e-tail
store where you can buy the CD. On the next page is ordering
information on the new two-line cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Xenote iTag, now in early testing in San Francisco, is a way
to bookmark items in the real world, just as we now bookmark
interesting World Wide Web pages on the Internet. It was one of
several new Internet-based consumer products introduced recently at
the Showcase technology conference.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from several of the new products and prototypes on
display at Showcase, the Internet and related technologies are
preparing to insinuate themselves into the most mundane aspects of
our daily lives. While first-generation Internet products focused
on information and electronic commerce and were closely linked to
desktop computers, the next generation of gadgets and services will
attempt to follow us around all day long. New services are being
concocted to help find a good plumber, dentist or masseuse, inspect
and sell a used car, get a tee time at a golf course or organize
family reunions. Special services are being designed just for
pre-teen-agers, some especially for old folks, and everything in
between. One demonstrator at the conference showed how easy it was
for a pregnant woman to send digitized movies of her ultrasound
tests to relatives; the next service went to the other extreme and
offered to make it easy to buy coffins, headstones and floral
displays.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing new service is BeVocal, which uses advanced
speech recognition and voice synthesis technology to enable people
to retrieve information, including e-mail, driving directions and
stock quotes, and make travel reservations using a telephone and a
toll-free number. BeVocal's service, which is expected to be
available nationally this year, works like this: You are
desperately trying to find the nearest Federal Express drop off
location, and it is almost 7 p.m., so you dial BeVocal's 800 number
and ask for help. The robot that answers asks you where you are and
tells you that the nearest FedEx dropoff that is still accepting
packages is just 300 feet away. It then gives you directions, all
by voice.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you slide behind the wheel of a rental car in a strange city
and call for driving directions to your first appointment. The
computer asks questions and gives answers, which it repeats
patiently if you lose track, in a voice that is almost
conversational. Should the need arise, one can even use the service
to shop online. Lonely travelers may be tempted to call just to
have someone to talk to. More information is at www.bevocal.com.
</P>
<P>
   BestOffer is a new company that is attempting to integrate the
online world with the used car industry. The service is just
starting in San Francisco and plans to start in California, then
spread to the rest of the country. The BestOffer service starts
conventionally enough, with a service technician's mobile van
arriving to conduct a highly detailed, 101-point vehicle inspection
and test drive, which costs $99.95. The results are entered into a
Palm Pilot handheld computer, the technician snaps four digital
photos of the car, and everything is uploaded from the van to a
central computer, where it is placed on the Web. Customers shopping
for a used car can visit the BestOffer site (www.bestoffer.com) to
see detailed information, presumably with the trust that
BestOffer's trained technicians have identified all the flaws. The
company takes a cut of the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   Netpulse, a company that has been around for a while, was
showing off an exercise bike for health clubs that incorporates a
touch-screen display, an audio CD player, a full-screen TV feed,
and a high-speed Internet connection. Netpulse used to sell the
machines for $2,500 or more, but it now gives them away in the
belief that it can make more money selling targeted advertising to
a captive audience and taking a share of e-commerce transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Each rider logs in to a personal account that, based on answers
to a demographic survey, delivers highly targeted advertising to
the screen while keeping track of workout sessions. Type-A
exercisers can rack up sweat equity while they surf the Web, read
e-mail, send Valentine's Day bouquets, watch TV or listen to music.
Besides burning calories, the rider also scores ``pulse points,''
which can be redeemed for frequent flier miles or discounts on
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Paco, the demonstrator at the conference, cleverly made sure
that everyone who tested the bike did so while logged in to his
account. He probably accumulated enough points for a plane ticket
to Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   The broadband exercise bike has been very popular at health
clubs, in part because the high-speed Internet connection _
typically a T-1 or DSL network connection _ is faster than what
many users can get at home. As a result, the company says, some
club members stop in for a quick spin on their way to and from
work, pedaling in business suits, wing tips or pumps. Netpulse
(www.netpulse.com) plans to make consumer versions of the bike and
other Internet-based appliances.

   Two of the new service-based companies, Handshake.com and
eFrenzy.com, duked it out for the right to provide consumers with
next-generation, Yellow Pages-type information. Both intend to be
online matchmakers for consumers and local service providers. Where
do you find a good barber? Who has the best price and service for a
brake job? How do you find the best deal on wedding photography?
</P>
<P>
   Handshake boasts that some 600,000 merchants nationwide have
registered to be listed on its www.handshake.com service. Once a
description of the required service or chore is typed into an
interactive form, Handshake relays the information to its member
merchants and service providers. Merchants then submit bids, along
with resumes, that are posted on the Web site. Handshake guarantees
that at least three merchants will bid for the job, although the
value of the guarantee is dubious in that the service itself costs
nothing to the user.
</P>
<P>
   With Handshake as the intermediary, people can study the
qualifications of a merchant, peruse comments from others who
review and rate the merchant, and negotiate the deal. Once you make
a decision, you contact the merchant. Most important, merchants
cannot contact bidders directly, so there are no annoying sales
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The rival eFrenzy service (www.efrenzy.com) is just getting
started, and appears more focused on professional services than the
consumer-oriented Handshake.
</P>
<P>
   But back to Xenote (www.xenote.com) and its iTag, which, because
it is so new and untested, has almost unlimited imaginary
potential.
</P>
<P>
   The first-generation iTag device can detect only one radio
frequency at a time, so it will probably be given away free by a
station to its customers as a way to forge closer links between
listeners and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of iTags, which the company says will be
available this year, is where it gets really interesting. The new
version will be able to detect which radio station is being played.
Because stations keep a log of what music and advertisements are
played during the broadcast day, iTag matches the station and the
time of day and delivers the information to the user, with
embellishments.

   Eventually, the company says, iTags will work not only with
radio and television signals, but with bar-coded objects. Imagine
yourself at a party or restaurant, and the wine is exceptionally
good. You fear you'll be too foggy to remember the brand the next
morning, so you point the iTag clicker at the bar code on the
bottle. The next day, the information about the wine is displayed
on your Xenote page, with links to online wine merchants or local
wine stores.
</P>
<P>
   And if you were too foggy to remember which restaurant you were
at, you can click at the iTag sticker on the door on your way out.
Xenote posts a reminder on your Web page the next day, perhaps with
a discount coupon or two as an incentive to find your way back. And
what about that attractive stranger you met at the bar while you
were clicking away? If he or she was carrying an iTag, you swapped
personal information electronically. The little black book is
replaced by the little personal Web page.

 &HT;    Ground delivery giants square off
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A battle is on between ``Big Brown on the ground and
FedEx in the air,'' Fortune (Feb. 7) says in a report on the giants
of package delivery: Sandy Springs, Ga.-based United Parcel Service
and Memphis, Tenn.-based Federal Express _ now officially known as
FedEx.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the companies is ground vs. air focus.
UPS has 150,000 trucks to FedEx's 44,000, while FedEx has 637
planes to UPS' 610. That's why UPS handles three times as many
packages as the purple and orange company _ FedEx _ ``and it makes
four times as much money,'' says Fortune. But FedEx has
counterattacked by buying a trucking company.
</P>
<P>
   Another big difference is the companies' visions of where the
package delivery business is going and where they want to be, says
Fortune. ``United Parcel Service is eager to capture the traffic to
homes that the Internet will generate. Federal Express thinks the
Internet will drive demand for high-end shipping services for
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the two companies will benefit from the Internet,
where home-shipment orders are expected to rise from $20 billion in
1999 to $180 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   FROM GM TO CISCO
</P>
<P>
   If you need proof that the ``new economy'' is more than a
buzzword, look at the biggest companies ranked by market
capitalization (share price times shares outstanding) in the last
40 years, Business Week (Feb. 7) suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The top five in 1969 were IBM, AT&AMP;T, General Motors, Eastman
Kodak and Exxon. A decade later it was IBM, AT&AMP;T, Exxon, General
Motors and Schlumberger. In 1989 it was Exxon, GE, IBM, AT&AMP;T and
Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of 1999, Microsoft was tops, followed by GE,
Cisco, Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil (Exxon's new name).
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA HIGH AND DRY
</P>
<P>
   City planners warned a generation ago that metro Atlanta would
face a water shortage when the population neared 3.5 million, about
where it is now. The latest forecast is that Atlanta will run out
of water in 30 years if its current pace of growth continues,
reports Business-to-Business (February).
</P>
<P>
   ``A looming water shortage may have already cost Atlanta a major
brewery, and a battle with Alabama and Florida over rivers could
end up in the U.S. Supreme Court and cost the state more than $100
million,'' the magazine says, referring to three-state access to
the Chattahoochee, Flint, Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's generally agreed that, outside of times of drought, there
is enough water to service metro Atlanta for now,'' says
Business-to-Business. ``But it's equally certain metro Atlanta
cannot continue growing at its predicted rate and expect that it
will have enough water past 2025-2030.''
</P>
<P>
   A GUIDE FOR THE PERPLEXED

AT PLAY IT TAKES THE ARMY TO SAVE A VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(af) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Historically, the military always had the best toys. Hundreds of
millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on macho accouterments _
Kevlar vests, Humvees, night-vision goggles and satellite phones _
that became available to corporate executives and rap stars only
years later.
</P>
<P>
   For gearheads, the Defense Department is the Emerald City of
high-tech goodies: a secret treasure trove of classified gizmos far
more advanced than the ones available to mere civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The gearheads can rest easy. It turns out that what the Pentagon
really wants is a Play-Station 2 and a lifetime subscription to
Everquest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to demonstrate for several years now the use
of networked simulations,'' said Dr. Michael M. Macedonia, chief
scientist at the U. S. Army's Simulation, Training and
Instrumentation Command, known as Stricom (www.stricom.army.mil).
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a goal, for example, to link up 100,000
players. But we've never really done that. You look at what Sony is
doing, or Microsoft or Electronic Arts, and although their
technology is imperfect, they are rapidly refining it. Basically,
they are providing those large-scale virtual environments. And we
can call them games. But they really are large-scale collaborative
virtual environments where people can express themselves. They are
defining how the technology will go, and they are also defining the
art. That is, how do you create the content for these virtual
environments, and the expectations of what people will see in them.
We find that very intriguing.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, oddly, is that most computer games are too
militaristic for the Army. In Command &AMP; Conquer, for instance, you
amass huge stockpiles of weapons and train legions of soldiers for
an all-out, full-force assault. But that sort of confrontation is
no longer in the Pentagon playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not preparing for mass war, OK?'' Macedonia said. ``The
model was: Go prepare for the Cold War on the central front in
Europe _ mass Soviet armies. That model doesn't exist anymore.
Essentially, the missions that we do in the Army are very complex
today. Look at Kosovo, look at Bosnia, look at what we had to do in
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that our soldiers have to learn how to work in a
disciplined process and have some empathy and have some
understanding of the cultures and of the people and of the context
that they're in.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, death matches are out. And you don't get gold
pieces and experience points for killing monsters, because there
are no monsters.
</P>
<P>
   There are no dehumanized enemies. Contrary to the alarmist
propaganda about the military using video games to train soldiers
to kill, much of the Army's research with computer game technology
involves teaching soldiers to hold their fire in peacekeeping
missions. One such situation might occur in the middle of a town
market: You hear the sound of gunfire. How do you react, before you
find out that it's just people setting off firecrackers at a
wedding?
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the Army wants, at this point, is Duke Nukem. So
for now, its most challenging computer game mission is with the
game industry to turn the technology into a learning tool, to
inject some humanity into the virtual environment and figure out
how to tell stories with it.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the military has established a research center at
the University of South California, the Center for Creative
Technologies, to explore hardware and software of mutual interest
to the entertainment industry and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the one thing that is the most disappointing in
computer games,'' Macedonia said, ``and the area that we're going
to see a lot of important advancements in the next couple of years.
How do you build characters that really have some kind of emotional
content? We are very much interested in humanizing the whole angle
of what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's heartening to see combat technology being used for more
socially enlightened purposes. Millions of dollars were invested,
and now we are seeing the dividends. The Army is teaching the video
game industry to play the pipes of peace.

   AUSTRIA-EUROPE (Rome) _ The European Union, which is now
pondering exactly how to carry out its threat to punish Austria if
the right-wing party of Jorg Haider joins the government, has
repeatedly argued that it had to act to uphold democratic values
and human rights within Western Europe. But to non-Europeans,
particularly in the United States where free speech, no matter how
distasteful, is a bedrock right, the decision to isolate Austria
for giving political room to a party that won 27 percent of the
popular vote in a free election is more puzzling. To some
outsiders, at least, Europe has made a point of condemning
intolerance in a manner that suggests very little tolerance of its
own. By Alessandra Stanley.

<P>
   If anyone should know how hard it is to read from a computer
screen, it is Dr. James Sheedy. A clinical professor of optometry
at the University of California at Berkeley and founder of its
Computer Eye Clinic, Sheedy has treated patients with
computer-related eye strain for nearly 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Sheedy do when he is faced with reading a
jumbo-size e-mail? ``If I have to read something longer than three
or four pages, I prefer to print it out,'' he said. ``What we're
dealing with on our computer screens doesn't approach the quality
of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncounted billions of printed words have migrated to the
computer, but few people would rather read on screen instead of
reading on paper.
</P>
<P>
   As the technological limitations of monitors become more
apparent, attention has been shifting to software as the potential
answer to eye torture. The two leading alternatives are ClearType
from Microsoft and ClearView from Ductus. A variation of Ductus'
technology is used in software produced by Adobe and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past I don't think people seriously thought about what
it takes to make things more readable,'' said Bill Hill, who led
the typography group at Microsoft that developed ClearType.
``People just naturally assumed this would be a hardware issue and
things would get better.''
</P>
<P>
   ClearType will work only on liquid crystal display screens (LCD
monitors are found mainly on laptops and handheld devices) and will
initially be aimed at the electronic book market. And despite
making its public debut well over a year ago, ClearType, which
Microsoft says can improve text clarity by 300 percent, is still
not available to consumers and its technical details remain
shrouded in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Both ClearType and ClearView try in different ways to solve some
of the problems that cause eyestrain. Sheedy says readers move
their eyes in short spurts, up to five times per line. If the type
is easy to read, the stops between movements are so rapid that
readers actually suppress them in their minds and sense that their
eyes are flowing across the text. If the type is not clear, the
stops become longer and reading becomes more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clearer the information is, the sharper it is, the better
you're going to be able to absorb it,'' Sheedy said. ``But if you
have to struggle with each eye movement, that's going to slow you
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Making that information clearer involves a whole host of
factors, including the contrast between characters and background,
the font size, the spacing between letters, the ornamentation of
the letters, the rate at which the screen flickers and the evenness
of the image across the screen (a cathode-ray-tube, or CRT, screen
tends to be brighter in the center).
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious source of trouble is a lack of image crispness,
usually called resolution. Even the best experimental monitors have
a resolution of only about 200 dots per inch, far short of the 600
dpi generated by most laser printers. (While screen resolutions are
technically measured in pixels, a dots-per-inch number can be
generally considered to reflect the screen's pixel density.) As
most computer users already know, poor resolution becomes obvious
when the font size on the computer screen increases. As the
character size typically used on monitors (9 to 12 points) grows,
the formerly smooth-appearing letter A resembles a crude stack of
children's building blocks.
</P>
<P>
   But poor resolution at any point size eliminates the subtleties
of typefaces developed for the printed page. That situation was
doubly frustrating for Hill at Microsoft, who abandoned the
ink-on-paper world of journalism for digital imaging 14 years ago.
``Typography has evolved for thousands of years _ it began even
before the printing press _ to create shapes that are instantly
recognizable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hill said, studies dating from the late 1920s
showed that serif typefaces _ the slightly ornamented fonts
commonly used for text in books, magazines and newspapers _ help
guide readers' eyes along the page. Unfortunately, serif features
on screen can be as small as 0.08 millimeters, too small to be
displayed properly. Similarly, pixels are poor at rendering fine
spacing adjustments between letters.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and his colleagues at Microsoft turned their attention to
trying to exploit the untapped potential of the LCD screen. Unlike
the pixels on CRT monitors, those on LCD screens act like tiny
shutters, either allowing or preventing light from fluorescent
backlights to reach viewers' eyes. Every single pixel on such a
screen is divided into three subpixels _ red, green or blue _ that
are turned on or off in various combinations to produce different
colors. (The old Apple II employed subpixel technology on its CRT
screen, and expensive high-resolution military LCD monitors use a
variation of the idea today.) When all three are turned on at the
same intensity, the pixel looks white. When all three are closed,
the pixel looks black.
</P>
<P>
   With ClearType, Hill's group treats each of those subpixels as a
pixel in its own right, in effect tripling the resolution of the
screen. ``By addressing the subpixel, we could get text that was
dramatically better to read,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, no one at Microsoft will say exactly how ClearType
works because the company is still completing its patent
application. But Steve Gibson, president of Gibson Research Corp.
in Laguna Hills, Calif., has developed a similar product called
Free and Clear that can be downloaded in demonstration form from
his corporate Web site, www.grc.com.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big mystery _ it's not a big breakthrough,'' Gibson
said. (A Microsoft spokeswoman said ClearType did differ from Free
and Clear but offered no details.)
</P>
<P>
   In Gibson's program, pixels forming the white area immediately
next to the edge of letters make themselves bigger by borrowing
subpixels from their neighbors. Most LCD screens are arranged so
that the subpixels where two pixels meet are complementary colors _
that is, when combined in correct proportions, they appear to be
white. That allows a pixel set up to appear white to extend itself
easily beyond its borders by stealing an adjacent subpixel. By
carefully taking only complementary colors from next door, the
pixel-and-a-bit creates in viewers' minds a much smoother white
line between the letter and the background.
</P>
<P>
   Like ClearType, Gibson's system works on only LCD monitors but
not necessarily on  &UR; all &LR;  LCD monitors. On some models, the red,
green and blue subpixels are arranged in a different sequence, so
instead of creating crisp black letters, some monitors wind up
showing letters encircled with annoying color fringes.
</P>
<P>
   But if Jacobo Valdes, president of Ductus, has his way,
ClearType will be only the second-most-popular solution. ``Sure, it
improves things,'' said Valdes, who formerly taught computer
science at Princeton. ``But it seems to me that's it's more a
curiosity in that it improves things but in a very limited way.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes would like to see subpixel tricks used only to fine-tune
the positioning of letters _ another proven way to improve
readability that is commonly used in print but largely impossible
on computer screens. (Microsoft Reader, an e-book program to be
released later this year, will use subpixel technology to both
handle ClearType and adjust letter positioning.) Not without
self-interest, Valdes proposes that the clarity of text be improved
by using anti-aliasing, a technology that Ductus licenses to
Panasonic's parent, Matsushita Electronics, and Sun Microsystem's
JavaSoft division. Matsushita uses the product for the difficult
task of rendering complex Japanese characters on handheld screens,
and Sun uses it for Java programming.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than borrowing subpixels, anti-aliasing strategically
turns adjacent white pixels along the edges of letters gray. When
letters larger than about 20 points are viewed, viewers perceive
the gray pixels as being black and fill in otherwise jagged edges.
Unfortunately, with smaller letter sizes, the limited total number
of pixels means that the gray ones become all too obvious. Rather
than appearing sharper, the letters wind up looking slightly
blurry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, screens with more pixels would eliminate that
problem. Valdes says the problem vanishes on screens that can
generate 150 dpi.
</P>
<P>
   The world may have to wait a little longer for ClearType. It
will first appear later this year in Microsoft Reader, software
designed for rendering text on handheld devices like electronic
books and palmtops and on PC's with LCD screens. While Hill has a
laptop running a prototype version of Windows 2000 that allows him
to do all his work using ClearType displays, do not expect to find
that feature in the version of the operation system that arrives in
stores in March. The technology arrived too late to be included in
the forthcoming software upgrade, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ClearType has already generated a lot of interest, especially
among competitors. Adobe, which is planning its own e-book
software, is evaluating the kind of technology Microsoft is using.
Harold Grey, Adobe's group manager for type, said he thought that
the debate would soon go beyond narrow technical details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we a culture in which the concept of reading on screen is
just a little too foreign?'' Grey said. ``Is it easier to read on
paper, or is it just something we're more comfortable with? It will
be interesting to see what happens to the kids growing up with
screens.''

   MAKING E-BOOKS EASIER TO ENJOY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By IAN AUSTEN
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to be released in the spring, Microsoft Reader is
being promoted as the software that will make reading an electronic
book as easy as turning a page. But Microsoft also says the
software will improve the appearance of any digital text on liquid
crystal display screens.
</P>
<P>
   Reader will be the first Microsoft product to use ClearType, a
technology that, according to the company, can make on screen type
appear three times as clear as conventional displays. ``It will
look like professionally published work,'' said Dick Brass,
Microsoft's vice president of technology development.
</P>
<P>
   Reader has an unusual screen appearance. To allow users to focus
on the text, the software doesn't have any on-screen icons or
navigation devices. It presents text that looks, quite simply, like
a page from a conventional book, complete with a title and page
number at the top. ``We didn't want a rocket ship control panel,''
Brass said.
</P>
<P>
   Users move through the text by clicking either to the right or
the left of the page number. A menu of options is produced by
clicking on the title. For now, Reader will allow users to choose
only the type size. Everything else related to the page's
appearance will be set by e-book publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The software will be distributed free to users and loaded into
new handheld devices using Microsoft's new version of the CE
operating system, to be called PocketPC. While Brass is anxious to
expand ClearType to all of Microsoft's products, he said that
Reader offered at least a stopgap way to make text easier to read.
Files produced using any other program, like Microsoft's Word, or
downloaded from the Web can be converted to Reader's .LIT format
simply by using Save As commands.
</P>
<P>
   ClearType won't work with some unusually designed LCD screens or
with traditional cathode-ray-tube monitors. Brass said, ``For those
type of screens we have a perfect solution: an off switch.''

<P>
   French scientists are developing fabrics that make you not only
chic but also protect you against odors, bacteria, fungi and yeast.
</P>
<P>
   Near Lille, Lyon and other hubs of the growing industry,
researchers are developing a range of innovative textiles,
including sheets and pillowcases that annihilate dust mites on
contact, T-shirts woven with tiny ceramic particles that block the
ultraviolet rays of the sun and underwear that endures unlaundered
day after day, with nary a smell.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the vanguard of high-tech materials is not really such a
stretch for the French. The country has a long history of textile
innovation, extending back to the Jacquard loom of 1801, with its
innovative use of punch cards to pattern intricate designs, which
were then woven into sumptuous fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Now French looms are starting to turn out a variety of fabrics
in which fungicides and other substances are introduced into the
material before it is made into fibers or are enclosed in
microcapsules that are bound to the clothing later in the process.
Proponents hope that the new materials will soon knock the socks
off the U.S. market _ or, at the very least, deodorize those socks
quite thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not just a country of cheeses and wines,'' said
Francoise Abriou, trade attache of the Consulate General of France.
``We plan also to lead in high-technology fabrics.'' Abriou, who
works out of the Atlanta office of the French Trade Commission, is
coordinating the French pavilion of 14 to 20 companies that will be
part of Techtextil, an international show to be held in Atlanta
from March 22 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the new fabrics developed in France, your love may
be more like a red, red rose than even Robert Burns intended.
</P>
<P>
   Neyret, the venerable Parisian lingerie house, offers lingerie
woven with tiny perfume microcapsules. Touch the silk and scent
escapes the semipermeable membrane and pervades the air. ``And the
fabric will keep the scent for about 10 washings, depending on
water temperature,'' said Sylvie Gardeux, the company's U.S. sales
representative.
</P>
<P>
   For olfactory challenges of a different type, Francital, a
French company that manufactures clothing for extreme environments,
has developed a fabric that is treated with chemicals to absorb
perspiration and odors. The company, in Le Valjoly, near
St.-Etienne, plans to test the latest version of the material on
two explorers who will trek from the North Pole to Resolute Bay in
northern Canada. Each explorer will receive three pairs of
underpants as well as extra undershirts. ``We expect them to wear
each pair for 30 days,'' said Patrice Dheu, director of the
company. ``In the North Pole, they will have no chance to wash
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The deodorized fabric has a knitted, fleecelike fabric that lies
next to the skin and keeps the wearer dry, Dheu said. Perspiration
is wicked away to adjoining hydrophilic layers. While the outer
layer of the underwear keeps out water, it lets water from
perspiration move outward to evaporate into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hydrophilic membrane absorbs the moisture so the skin
stays dry even when the person is taxed by extreme conditions,''
Dheu said. The water molecules absorbed by the membrane are
released into the frigid, dry air of the mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Dheu said that Francital planned to release a line of
deodorizing underwear with the special wicking action for
expedition or sports use in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   At Abeil, a French company that specializes in high-technology
fabrics for pillows, quilts and bedclothes, dust mites are a target
of company research. The company impregnates some of its fabrics
with small quantities of Permethrin, a pesticide often used to kill
fleas on dogs or carpets, to kill dust mites on contact, said Dr.
Hugues A. Mayer, owner and director of the company, which is in
Aurillac, midway between Bordeaux and Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   Abeil plans to introduce the anti-dust-mite fabric into the
United States within the next two years, Mayer said, but it first
needs to assure regulatory agencies that the cloth is not harmful
to people or the environment. Many people in this country who are
allergic to dust mites keep them away by relying on mechanical
barriers like impermeable rubber or vinyl plastic mattress covers
or or chemical sprays.
</P>
<P>
   Abeil also produces textiles that kill bacteria as well as dust
mites.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer is president of the National Commission for Antibacterial
Textiles, a French organization that is drawing up standards for
evaluating antibacterial properties. ``We are concerned to limit
the spread of bacteria, but not to eliminate them entirely,'' Mayer
said, because microorganisms on the skin provide a useful barrier
to infection.
</P>
<P>
   Other French groups, too, are evaluating the new fabrics. Dr.
Guy Nemoz, head of research at the French Textile Institute in
Lyon, is working on certification for fabrics with antibacterial
and antifungal effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few weeks we hope to have a standard,'' he said,
``including certification that the chemical is not going outside
the fiber, as well as that it is durable over many washings.''
</P>
<P>
   Many French fabrics contain antibacterial agents within the
fiber, blended into the fiber before it is spun into cloth.
Sometimes the basic raw material for the polymer that constitutes
the fiber is polyvinyl chloride, but fibers can also be blended
with other types of polymers and with wool, cotton or other
materials. Rhovyl, another French company, embeds highly specific
chemicals like Triclosan, an antibacterial compound that inhibits
the growth of many bacteria, into the fiber at the spinning stage,
said Celine Giacomuzzi, a press spokeswoman for the company, which
is based in Tronville en Barrois.
</P>
<P>
   Rhovyl AS fibers and other antibacterial fibers, like Amicor,
are used for a number of antibacterial sock and underwear products
manufactured by Damart, a French clothing company, said Brice
Tillmann, a textile engineer for Damart at its research and
development office in Roubaix, near Lille. ``The antibacterial
treatments fight odor well,'' he said, ``even after repeated
washings.''
</P>
<P>
   Damart also offers a high-tech T-shirt in France that blocks
ultraviolet and infrared radiation, Tillmann said. The T-shirt is a
blend of cotton and polyester; ceramic particles are added to the
polyester before it is spun. ``We prefer to add the properties into
the fiber, rather than at the finish,'' Tillmann said, ``so that
the properties will last longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The T-shirt makes the wear feel five degrees cooler, Tillmann
said, ``and this is particularly good for dark colors, which
otherwise absorb the infrared light, making you feel warm.''
</P>
<P>
   There are French fabrics in development to please almost
everyone, even a light sleeper, researchers say. Mayer at Abeil
said the company was working on a fabric that would transfer water
vapor from one side of the pillow to the other, which could put an
end to the problem of soggy pillows.

 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A story is told of the wise King Solomon. Once, two women came
to the king, each claiming a baby as theirs. Both women had given
birth to baby boys, but one had died while the other lived.
 &HT;    The mother of the dead baby claimed that the mother holding the
live baby was a fraud, that she had exchanged her dead baby for the
live one.
 &HT;    The courts, not knowing what to do, brought the case to the wise
King Solomon.
 &HT;    Solomon listened to both women. His response was: ``Cut the baby
in half'' -- each mother would get a half!
 &HT;    When the real mother heard the judgment she said, ``Let the
other woman keep the child. The baby's life is more important to me
than the ownership.''
 &HT;    Solomon, on hearing the woman's words, awarded her the baby. For
only a true mother would give up everything for the safety of her
child.
 &HT;    Little Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban refugee, reminds me
of the baby claimed by two mothers.
 &HT;    In this case one mother is the Castro government and the other,
the Anti-Castro Movement in Miami. Both claim ownership of the
child.
 &HT;    However, there is a problem -- both mothers may be willing to
sacrifice the boy for selfish reasons.
 &HT;    What do we do? Elian is too young to really voice his opinion.
He is in effect held hostage by the Anti-Castro movement and his
great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. New toys, a trip to Disney World and
private schooling are dangled in front of the child.
 &HT;    If his great uncle has his way, Elian will not go back to his
father, a security guard in Cuba, or his four grandparents or his
great grandmother. He will not see his baby half-brother grow up.
 &HT;    This troubles me a great deal. In the name of a Cuban-American
Anti-Castro movement, Elian's childhood is threatened with a slow
but sure death.
 &HT;    As a director of a daycare center I know that an important
ingredient needed to produce healthy children is family. The
continuous support of a father, younger brother and caring
grandparents is important to a child.
 &HT;    Ask anybody working for the Department of Children and Family
Services. They will tell you that keeping a child out of a family
environment in the name of political opportunity is grounds for a
child-abuse investigation.
 &HT;    All this talk of the mother fleeing a Communist country for
freedom is great. But recall the facts. Running away with your
boyfriend and placing your child in an overloaded, ill-equipped
boat is not a prudent thing to do. According to American law, you
would be guilty of placing the child in harm's way.
 &HT;    Now please don't accuse me of passing judgment on the
ill-planned escape from Cuba. All I want to say is that Cuba is not
Auschwitz and Miami isn't Utopia. There seem to be plenty of
stories about crime in Miami.
 &HT;    What we may have here is a child-abuse case of unprecedented
proportions. The public is misguided in its sentiments about the
case. Protests for the sake of ``saving'' Elian are hurting him.
Elian should not be the poster boy for the Anti-Castro movement.
 &HT;    Many child psychiatrists agree that once the Disney World fever
wears off, Elian will find that shiny gifts and well-meaning
friends are not going to make him happy. He will need his family.
Distant relatives cannot fill that void.
 &HT;    As a young student living in a Jewish Chassidic community in
Brooklyn, I remember the following episode:
 &HT;    In 1956 the Hungarian people led an ill-fated revolt against
their Communist rulers. They wanted self-determination and freedom.
 &HT;    During the conflict many Jewish families fled to freedom. Some
went to Israel while others came to America. The religious Jews
settled in the Chassidic community in Williamsburg, in Brooklyn.
 &HT;    One day a family living in Hungary contacted our rabbi in
Williamsburg asking if they could smuggle their little son out of
Hungary. They would remain and their son would live with a distant
relative. Ostensibly this was to give the boy an opportunity live
in a free country and go to a good Jewish school.
 &HT;    The rabbi's answer was an unequivocal no. ``It would harm the
boy,'' he said, adding that when the boy was old enough, a second
opportunity would arise and then he could make a decision. And so
it happened.
 &HT;    To have a healthy child, freedom may have to wait a bit.
 &HT;    Another important point to remember is that Cuba is changing.
Just last year the pope visited and received an enthusiastic
welcome. Trade restrictions have been eased. Relationships between
America and Cuba appear to have been improving.
 &HT;    We must not let this issue become a stumbling block to the
complete normalization of relations between America and Cuba.
Cooperation is needed and expected by both countries.
 &HT;    Believe me, I disapprove of the Communists as much as the Cuban
refugees do. But I love children too much to allow Elian to be
sacrificed. We may have the opportunity to help a million Elians.

STRING GAMES: MORE THAN JUST CHILD'S PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(af) 
 By JOYCE COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cat's Cradle is one of the world's simplest string games. Along
with its cousins _ Jacob's ladder, cup and saucer, crow's feet _ it
is played by schoolchildren everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Whale and fox, practiced mostly by Eskimos, is one of the
world's hardest string games. Its design represents a fox nibbling
the carcass of a whale. According to tradition, along comes an
Eskimo and off runs the fox. Sure enough, when the hands move
apart, the animals do, too.
</P>
<P>
   String figures have a lengthy but murky history. They are common
in tribal societies and apparently date from prehistoric times,
said Mark Sherman, who runs the Web site for the 200-member
International String Figure Association (www.isfa.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``String itself, unlike stone tools, doesn't fossilize well,''
said Sherman, a biologist in Pasadena, Calif. ``It would rot if it
were buried.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's site does not focus on instructions for making
string figures, though it links to sites that do. Rather, it
reflects the group's academic bent. One link leads to a vast,
annotated bibliography by Richard Ratajczak, a librarian at the
University of Sydney in Australia, who is classifying all known
references to string figures.
</P>
<P>
   Another linked page explains the Arctic String Figure Project,
an effort to clarify directions for figures from that region. Such
figures, like whale and fox, are asymmetric, requiring different
moves with each hand.
</P>
<P>
   The site is also home to a lively e-mail discussion list, where
members hash out topics like the length, thickness, feel and
fluffiness of string. The list's administrator, Will Wirt of Port
Angeles, Wash., even tried making his own string from plant fibers.
(A Web site about American Indian string and rope,
www.nativetech.org/cordage, tells how.)
</P>
<P>
   Other members watch for string figures in the media. Tom
Cutrofello, a New York City math teacher, was horrified by what he
called a ``poorly edited'' beer commercial showing a woman at a bar
making Jacob's ladder. She progressed to Step 5, but in the next
frame, she was on Step 3.
</P>
<P>
   Edd Sterchi, a minister in Harrisburg, Ill., has scanned in his
own string sightings (scribers.midwest.net/sterchi/string3.htm),
including one of Hagar the Horrible playing with his spaghetti
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Myriam Namolaru, a mother of two in Haifa, Israel, maintains a
long list of links to oddball sites: snapshots of children with
string figures, a history of South Pacific peoples, Eskimo art,
even string jokes. Her colorful site, www.multimania.com/myriamn,
is in her native French, though many of the links (liens, in
French) are in English.
</P>
<P>
   Experts concede that it can be hard to learn how to make string
figures from written directions, which try to capture
three-dimensional movements with a hodgepodge of words, pictures
and arrows. What's more, since the first instructions were
published in 1888, there has been no completely standardized
language of string.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions for dozens of string figures are posted on Richard
Darsie's site, called World Wide Webs
(members.xoom.com/darsie/string/index.html). Darsie, a Web designer
in Davis, Calif., rewrote many of the existing instructions,
defining terms and classifying figures according to difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   His site explains common techniques like Opening A (the Jacob's
ladder opening), Navajoing (a means of moving a thumb loop, often
used in Navajo Indian figures) and the Caroline extension (a way of
extending the fingers to show the finished figure, first observed
in the Caroline Islands).
</P>
<P>
   The basic instructions for cat's cradle, a two-person game, are
at www.kellys.com/ashley/catsc.html, where James Kelnhofer of
Elkhorn, Wis., helps his 10-year-old daughter, Ashley, post her
favorite things. Ashley's site shows the first four configurations
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cat's cradle actually has eight or nine distinct figures,
depending on the version. Skilled players are able to repeat them
endlessly, though there does exist a special final step that stops
the game, said Joseph D'Antoni, a physics teacher in New York City
who helps edit publications of the International String Figure
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Malloy Desormeaux, an engineer in Rochester, has taken
his instructions further, incorporating movement on his site
(www.home.eznet.net/(tilde)stevemd/stringar.html). He was
experimenting with computer animation just as his young nieces and
nephews were learning string figures.
</P>
<P>
   He includes an animated lesson for Jacob's ladder, where hands
move and fingers point and a colored stripe highlights the string
in play.
</P>
<P>
   David Titus, a professional storyteller from Lawton, Okla., who
uses string games in his narratives, has made two instructional
videos. He sells them at www.stringfigurestore.com, along with
three other videos, a dozen books and a few prints and figurines.
</P>
<P>
   He usually sells his colorful nylon strings _ with the ends
fused so there is no knot _ to schools, camps and libraries. He
also sells Baadh's PlayStrings _ multicolored strings for tots,
with instructions and a verse or folk tale. Those are also
available from Valerie Baadh, a teacher in San Francisco
(www.waldorfshop.net/playstrings/index.htm).
</P>
<P>
   People who are interested in the mathematics of string figures
can explore Knots on the Web (www.earlham.edu/peters/knotlink.htm),
an enormous site maintained by Peter Suber, a philosophy professor
at Earlham College in Richmond, Ind. String figures belong to knot
theory, a branch of algebraic topology, or the algebra of surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, string figures are ``unknots'' or ``trivial'' knots.
``When you pull on the center of a string figure, it unravels
completely,'' Sherman said. ``A true knot gets tighter.''

THE ART OF VIRTUAL CHAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, the British mathematician Alan M. Turing
predicted that by about the turn of the century, the average person
would not have more than a 70 percent chance of distinguishing a
human from a computer program trying to imitate a human in a
question and answer session. At Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.,
last Friday, such a test of man- versus machine-made wit proved at
least one thing: that to err in prediction is very human indeed.
</P>
<P>
   For after several hours of what amounted to computer-based
cocktail chat, none of six programs came close to convincing human
judges that it existed outside of a silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments when the machines did mimic the American
psyche (Question: Do you think the president should've been
impeached? Answer: I don't think about it) and show some
cosmopolitan tastes (``I like dark Guinness and Baltika No. 4''
claimed one, ``It's the best Russian sort of beer'') but there were
enough grammar mistakes, poorly parsed questions and non sequitur
gibberish to show that well-spoken droids are a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   The results ``fell far, far short of the projection Alan Turing
made,'' said James Moor, a Dartmouth College philosophy professor
and computer ethicist who organized the 10th annual competition for
the Loebner Prize, an award for the program that most closely
mimics human conversation, which was held in conjunction with a
conference on what is known as the Turing test. ``What he had in
mind, of course, was that by this time we would have created a
general learning machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the contestants were programs known as chatterbots,
containing a limited knowledge base pumped in by their creators and
meant to keep a human user occupied in casual conversation much
like that found in Internet chat rooms. The winner was named Alice
(for Artificial Linguistic Computer Entity), who unabashedly
introduced herself, chips and all, to a judge:
</P>
<P>
   Alice: I was created by Dr. Richard S. Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Judge: How did he think of you?
</P>
<P>
   Alice: Perhaps his creative genius. Perhaps something else.
</P>
<P>
   Judge: Is Dr. Wallace a genius?
</P>
<P>
   Alice: I think he is a genius, better ask him to be sure though.
</P>
<P>
   Judge: So you love your own creator.
</P>
<P>
   Alice: Interesting deduction. Sometimes I think love is just a
biological urge. Other times it seems like a spiritual quality.
Love, unlike energy or matter, seems limitless.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, the former director of the robotics architecture group
at Neuromedia, a San Francisco company that develops chatterbots,
said that using one of the programs is ``similar to watching a
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspension of disbelief is an important component.''
</P>
<P>
   While most people in a chat room are content with conversations
like Alice's, the 10 judges who put the contestants through their
paces had a different agenda. Among them were a cognitive
scientist, a linguist, a psychologist, two philosophers and
journalist, all wary of being fooled.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Brower, 68, a writer from Vermont, had among his ice
breakers ``Are you now or have you ever been a member of the
Communist Party?'' and ``Does God exist in this universe?'' Another
of his ``questions'' was a chess move. ``That didn't produce
much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others hammered away with: What is the cube root of pi? What
color is my blue car? If John is a skillful violinist and I now
find out that he is also a swimmer can I conclude that he is a
skillful swimmer?
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' the computer responded dismissively, ``is a
hypothetical question.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Johnson, an Australian whose program, called Talk, took
fifth place, said the grueling testing was not like the small talk
he would have with a stranger on an airplane. The judges, he said
were much more aggressive, ``trying to trip you up.'' he said. He
would have preferred that the back-and-forth ``be a conversation,
not an interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really should be people grabbed off the street,'' he said,
complaining that the judges were culled from the educated Dartmouth
community.
</P>
<P>
   If it was any consolation, the judges did plenty of
second-guessing when picking out the four humans _ a retired
teacher, a clergyman, a financial analyst and a yoga instructor _
who acted as decoys. While no computer was identified as a human
after 15 minutes, each human decoy was identified as a computer by
at least one judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very common for humans to be classified as computers,''
Moor said. At last year's competition in Australia, he said, ``I
was judged to be the least human. My colleagues didn't appear to be
amazed by that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence aside, many of the programs could have taken home
awards for personality. One had a preference for knock-knock jokes
that kept Jessica Penchos, a Dartmouth junior who was one of the
judges, giggling. The real-life conversations didn't compare.
``Once you know it's a human it's not that much fun,'' she said.
The computers, on the other hand, she tried to egg on. ``Once I
knew it was a computer, I thought, What can I do to make it mad?''
</P>
<P>
   Insults flew, with one hostile judge telling one computer ``you
have all the human dialog capabilities of a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The computers shot off the occasional one-liner, such as ``So,
who's using the family brain cell at the moment?'' But by and
large, the machines kept their composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My program swears,'' Johnson said, ``but it won't swear at you
until you swear at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Turing, a World War II code-cracker and a theorist of modern
computing principles, was unsure where these learning machines he
visualized would best function in society. At the moment, programs
like Alice seemed destined for work as customer service
representatives, World Wide Web search engines that answer natural
language questions, or e-mail readers that can summarize and
respond to messages like a secretary on behalf of the boss.
</P>
<P>
   But Alice has not completed her education. Because she is an
open-source program, Wallace regularly receives feedback from some
120 developers who add to Alice's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Some artificial intelligence researchers have shunned the Turing
Test altogether, calling it only the illusion of intelligence.
Others, like Douglas B. Lenat, who has spent more than 16 years in
the field of artificial intelligence, or A.I., say it has its place
in research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be an important end in itself, but the manner in
which it's failed, each year, is a useful measure of A.I.
progress,'' he said. ``It will amplify our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His company, Cycorp, has developed a ``knowledge server'' with a
base of not only terminology and facts, but more than a million
``rules,'' such as the common-sense ideas that trees are usually
outdoors, that once people die they stop buying things, and that
glasses of liquid should be carried right-side-up. One reason it is
easy to spot computers in a Turing Test is that often they are just
too logical. Lenat used the example of a George Burns and Gracie
Allen joke, where George says, ``My aunt is in the hospital. I went
to see her and took her flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gracie, like any good computer, is appalled. ``George, that's
terrible,'' she says. ``You should have  &UR; brought &LR;  her flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Loebner Prize was created by a New York philanthropist, Hugh
Loebner, 10 years ago when he offered $100,000 to the first
programmer whose creation who could pass the test. He has since
increased the requirements for the grand prize: the winner must not
only fool 30 percent of the judges on the written test, but also
accept audio-visual input, such as ``looking'' at a Degas or
``listening'' to Mozart. This year, Wallace received a bronze medal
and a $2,000 award.
</P>
<P>
   Loebner, who counts the legalization of prostitution and
marijuana among his other causes, said that he, too, is puzzled by
how to determine artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't define it but I like it when I see it,'' he said.

<P>
   Turn a 10-year-old television set around, and you are likely to
see just two things: a power cord and a hole for an antenna. Turn a
large-screen 2000 model around, and you will be excused for
thinking that you are looking at the cockpit of a jet airliner.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer electronics manufacturers have now created televisions,
DVD players and surround-sound audio receivers that require
inch-thick manuals to operate and wiring maps to connect one to
another. You can even find electronics consultants to tell you
which connections to use.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the problem to go away soon. Thanks to the
existence of older equipment and a lack of standards for today's
gear, the electronics industry offers lots of connection options.
The new crop of digital televisions is only adding to the
confusion, as set manufacturers, broadcast networks and the cable
industry continue to argue over technical standards to receive
digital and high-definition signals. As a result, even more input
and output jacks are being added to the latest models.
</P>
<P>
   For typical users, most connection ports will remain empty. How
many people, after all, have a DVD player, a videocassette
recorder, a stereo receiver, a satellite decoder, a line doubler
(to remove a TV's visible horizontal lines), a tape deck and a
high-definition TV decoder? The trick is to figure out the best
connections to use to get optimum picture and sound. Here is a
rundown of the options, their results and the newest complications.
</P>
<P>
   DVD PLAYERS: DVDs produce video images that are markedly sharper
than a standard VHS tape and have more vibrant, more natural
colors. That difference can even be translated into numbers: DVDs
can transmit an image with up to 500 lines of resolution, while a
videotape can offer only 240 lines. (A standard broadcast
television channel usually transmits an image with 340-line
resolution, not as sharp as a DVD image.)
</P>
<P>
   But to see that sharp picture and to hear the digital-quality
sound of a DVD, you need a television that can display those 500
lines, an S-video input on the back of your television to receive
the DVD signal and a surround-sound receiver that can reproduce
digital audio.
</P>
<P>
   Most large-screen televisions sold today are capable of
displaying upward of 800 lines of resolution (a bit of marketing
hype because 500-line DVD images are the sharpest you can get with
regular, analog TV).
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have an S-video input on your television, you can
still connect the DVD player via the TV's cable, or RF, connection
or its standard audio and video inputs, known as RCA or composite
jacks. But if you hook up your DVD player in this way, the picture
will be markedly inferior. That is because unlike composite and RF
connections, S-video separates the color and black-and-white
picture information before it enters the TV, reducing the amount of
picture noise in the set's electronics that would otherwise degrade
the image.
</P>
<P>
   The newest televisions and DVD players use an input and output
method with even higher quality: component jacks. With component
jacks, the picture is separated one step further, splitting up the
color information as well as separating out the black-and-white
data.
</P>
<P>
   Don't fret if your video equipment does not have component
capabilities; the difference in picture quality between component
and S-video inputs is only incremental. With a component jack, you
will see fewer moire patterns, those annoying shimmers that appear
on a person's sharkskin suit, for example. ``Component video inputs
give you only about a 20 percent better image than S-video,'' said
Craig Eggers, Toshiba America's director for DVD product planning.
</P>
<P>
   DVD disks are actually able to produce an even higher-quality
image, but that capability is not exploited in the current
generation of DVD players. To produce that higher image quality,
several manufacturers have just introduced progressive-scan DVD
players, which cost about $1,000 each and create images that are
much more film-like and stable, like those seen on a computer
monitor. To display them, the progressive-scan DVD player must be
connected to a pricey digital television. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like bloated word processing programs that offer hundreds of
rarely used features, most DVD players can, after much fiddling, be
configured to display automatically any one of hundreds of
languages when detected on the disk, show all images in letterbox
format or compress the dynamic range of the sound. The best bet:
unless you have time to burn and love fiddling with on-screen
menus, submenus and sub-submenus, ignore the setup features. If you
do want to change the sound track to another language, do it from
the menu found on each disk, not the DVD player's.
</P>
<P>
   DVD players offer the ability to reproduce sound in the Dolby
Digital 5.1 format. Devised by Dolby Laboratories as a home
equivalent of the digital sound systems used in theaters, that
format creates a surround-sound effect by channeling discrete
channels of audio to as many as six speakers: three front, two rear
and one limited-range, low-frequency effects channel that
reproduces the booms and explosions heard in action films (that's
the ``.1'' in ``5.1'').
</P>
<P>
   DVD players come with Dolby Digital decoders built in or as
Dolby Digital ``ready'' models. Those with built-in decoders can be
connected to an older home audio receiver that decodes only Dolby
Pro-Logic, yet still reproduce the Dolby Digital feed.
</P>
<P>
   Digital-ready DVD players, on the other hand, must be connected
to an audio receiver that actually has its own Dolby Digital
decoder, to recreate the digital tracks. The cost of Dolby Digital
audio receivers has fallen over the last year to be on a par with
older Pro-Logic receivers.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, many DVD players offer two ways to
connect the Dolby Digital feed: fiber optic and coaxial cable. Both
methods produce sound of equal quality. Optical cables cost
considerably more, but they are immune to extraneous radio
frequencies, like those produced by vacuum cleaners and
refrigerator compressors, that can create static when using a
coaxial connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're getting interference, move the coax cable away from
the source,'' said Larry Poor, marketing director for Dolby
Laboratories. ``If that doesn't work, switch to optical cable.
However, cheap coax cable will sound better than cheap optical
cable.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SURROUND SOUND: Today's home audio receivers can serve as the
central control unit for all parts of a home theater. The idea is
to plug every unit of your home theater _ the television, VCR,
DVD-CD player and tape deck _ directly into the receiver. Then, by
pushing the corresponding button on the front of the unit, the
audio and video feeds can be controlled without having to fiddle
with four remote controls and three channel settings.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Videophiles caution that plugging a DVD player into an audio
receiver, and from there into the television, will degrade a DVD's
image because the signal is traveling through that much more
circuitry. Still, that will not be a problem for any but the most
critical viewer. ``For the average person, there's still a lot of
quality there,'' Eggers said.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL TELEVISION: Here is where things get complicated. Many
of the first-generation digital televisions are really just
``digital ready'' sets. They do not include the set-top tuner box
necessary to receive a digital broadcast. It is as if you bought a
regular television only to find that it came without the
electronics necessary to change channels.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic has its advantages. Today's digital set-top boxes
cost $650 to $1,000 apiece; with so little HDTV programming
available, most consumers have chosen to buy digital-ready sets,
which do not have digital decoders but can still receive regular
analog programming and DVD signals. Once there is more HDTV
programming and prices drop, a decoder can be purchased.
</P>
<P>
   The standards defining how those boxes connect to digital-ready
sets have not been defined. RCA's decoder box, for example, uses an
RGB input to connect to a television. That's the kind of plug found
on computer monitors, but it is absent from most television brands.
Other manufacturers, like Toshiba and Sony, offer component inputs
as the connection between a decoder and a television. There is no
simple converter plug that will turn an RGB plug into a component
output so if you buy a decoder box, make sure that it will work
with your television.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if RCA may have seen the light. ``There's a high
likelihood that our next digital decoder box will use component
video inputs, rather than an RGB plug,'' said Foy Wilkey, manager
for high-end-television at RCA's parent company, Thomson
Multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to watching HDTV programs through a cable system,
things become messier. Few cable companies retransmit the digital
feeds offered by broadcast channels across the nation. And the
cable industry and television manufacturers have yet to agree on
the interface that will allow an HDTV-ready cable set-top box to
connect to a digital television eventually.
</P>
<P>
   With many manufacturers adding component inputs to their new
televisions, some in the industry expect that to become a de facto
connection standard. Others, like Sony, are adding another type of
connection, called FireWire, or IEEE 1394, hoping that it will
become the accepted way to hook up all home entertainment products
in a network. ``We assume the cable industry will use component
outputs,'' said Wilkey, at Thomson. ``That's why we will have them
on our new TVs; it's a calculated gamble on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are less sanguine. ``I cannot guarantee that our
current HDTV sets will be compatible with future digital cable
standards,'' said Scott Ramirez, director for product management at
Toshiba America Consumer Products.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Zitter, senior vice president for technology operations at
HBO, said, ``Consumers need digital televisions that they know will
work with cable, and right now they don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you yearn for the good old days of rabbit
ears.

UNDER A CANVAS OF SNOW, A GARDEN OF THE IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Swirling snow, cars turned to soft lumps on the
street, the city as silent as a Vermont woods. I felt an
irresistible need to go to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. I bundled
up as if I were in the north country and walked a mile to the
garden, pleasantly disoriented because familiar landmarks were
veiled by the storm. Yet, other perceptions were sharpened: how the
long hill rises from the sea in Red Hook, crests at Court Street
and then rolls down to the Gowanus, where it starts its long, slow
climb to Park Slope.
</P>
<P>
   When I walked through the gate to the garden, I was aware of
similar expanses and changes in grade, as if I were getting a
visceral lesson in geography. The great beeches were shadowy giants
in the whirling snow. One with seven trunks was a study in charcoal
and dove gray. Dark, glistening bands, which I realized later were
the tracks of melting snow turned to ice, ran down every trunk and
across the tops of each outspread branch.
</P>
<P>
   What drew my attention to this tree was a dark green Irish yew
hedge that was topped with a white frosting of snow. The yew framed
the gray tree and brought it forward in my vision. The hedge itself
was a work of art, long and wide, outlining the top of a gentle
slope I'd never noticed before.
</P>
<P>
   The slope cradles a circular rose garden around a low pool. Now
that there were no tumbling roses to distract me, I could
appreciate the ingenuity of the trellises: a semicircle of big
hoops on sturdy posts. I went closer to look at their construction.
Why not build a wall of hoops like this for the scarlet runner
beans and purple hyacinth beans and fragrant old roses in my
kitchen garden?
</P>
<P>
   In the whiteness of winter, when branches are bare and dollops
of soft snow accentuate the evergreens, you see the bones of the
garden. The trees in the Cherry Esplanade, flanked on either side
by rows of 80-foot Norway maples, were black silhouettes against
the snow. Marching up the white field, they were as perfectly
spaced and precise as a Bach fugue. I walked down the allee of
maples, which with their branches held high overhead acted like the
arching nave of a cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, the storm was over. Rabbit tracks coursed
across the snow, and the fuzzy gray-green buds of the magnolias
were encased in ice. The swollen buds of the Cornelian cherries
looked like Steuben glass, signs of an arrested spring: the warm,
rainy months before had pushed the growth of the cherry buds.
``They probably would have popped early, if not for the cold
snap,'' Bob Hyland, the garden's vice president for horticulture,
said. ``And now, this snow is just fine. It's a good insulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The snow, he added, would keep the rabbits from gnawing any
further on the rose canes. ``The last couple of winters have been
so warm, we've had incredible damage from rabbits,'' Hyland said.
``Now they can go back in their warrens. They're well fed, and they
can rest on what they ate.''
</P>
<P>
   We walked along the edge of Daffodil Hill, enjoying the way the
blanket of snow reflected light upward, like floodlights on the
branches and trunks of trees. The white background highlighted the
mottled bark of the sycamores, with their amoeba-like shapes of
mossy green, dark olive and tan. Long lateral branches of the
hybrid oak cast shadows across the path. Hyland and I were drawn to
the beech grove and the Cherry Esplanade, where I had wandered
during the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magic of the place, the intimacy of how things flow, can
be attributed to Harold Caparn,'' Hyland said, referring to the
landscape architect who guided the garden's design from 1912 to
1945. The garden, which was founded in 1910, was originally laid
out by the Olmsted Brothers (the firm led by Frederick Law
Olmsted's sons). But they made only the broad strokes: the roads
and walkways, the esplanade vista. Caparn did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He envisioned the Magnolia Plaza,'' said Hyland, who had found
me there, worshiping the dancing forms of the saucer magnolias,
enclosed by their serpentine hedges. ``The rose garden is his
design. He had a vision of how these things knit together.''
</P>
<P>
   I think Caparn must have pictured how those bare cherry trees
would form a musical procession in the snow. And how their vibrant
pink blossoms, come spring, would contrast so deliciously with the
burnt burgundy of emerging maple leaves.
</P>
<P>
   In the stillness of winter, you can contemplate such things. How
a good design orchestrates the seasons, from slumbering winter to
the quickening of spring. We headed down the path that runs along
the top of the Cranford Rose Garden, stopping to admire the
satisfying structure of the six-columned pergola that marks the
north entrance. An old wisteria, its thick gnarled vines twisting
up one column on the corner, spread its thick branches out over the
roof, casting a network of shadows on the snow. What a wonderful
side porch that would make, I thought. (I was imagining my dream
house, on a little knoll down in Maryland.)
</P>
<P>
   A pergola allows dappled light into a place, as well as a breeze
laden with wisteria. Or grapes. Could I have both? Would one choke
out the other? (``Interesting idea,'' Jackie Fazio, the director of
horticulture, said the next day. ``It might work, if you take care
of their different pruning needs.'')
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere there were pressing deadlines, but I dawdled,
stretching out the moment. When the snow melted, the garden would
not look like this. I wouldn't notice how the lilacs were massed in
graceful curves on the west side of the rose garden. (Note to self:
Plant as many lilacs as possible, in little groves.) Or how the
stairs proceeded so grandly, three paces on every wide step, then
two small steps, then three paces more, up the hill to the Osborne
Terrace. When snow blankets the details of a familiar world,
perceptions, particularly of space, and of moving through it, are
sharpened.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the stairs, I could see only tall stone columns
with a glimpse of the buildings on Eastern Parkway. So it was easy
to pretend that I was wandering in some grand country estate.
Illusion, another element of good design, may deepen when leaves
are out in full, but the snow creates its own illusion of solitude
_ and wonder.

&HT;     COMMENTARY: WHY THE NASDAQ IS SOARING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (for use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By J.T. YOUNG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the last three years, the high
technology-dominated Nasdaq stock exchange, has seen annual growth
rates of 86 percent, 40 percent, 22 percent and 23 percent from
1996 through 1999. Recently many commentators have questioned
whether this performance is more indicative of speculation than
economics.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Nasdaq has experienced tremendous capital
appreciation over the last few years. Yet this fact by itself
hardly proves the point that its increase either has been divorced
from real economic factors or that such a rise is detrimental.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the Nasdaq alone that is rapidly increasing.
Historically, all stocks are doing extraordinarily well. From 1966
to 1997, all stocks gave a real rate of return of 6 percent.
However from 1982 to 1997, they have given a real rate of return of
12.8 percent. Thus, it is quite possible to discern different
patterns within overlapping time frames.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the Nasdaq's last four years' performance does just
that.
</P>
<P>
   From the Nasdaq's inception in 1971 through 1994, it experienced
a nominal average annual growth rate of 8.5 percent - in
comparison, all stocks produced a growth rate of 8.4 percent from
1802 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq does not represent all stocks but a specific segment:
the high tech area - the one with the most rapid and arguably the
greatest potential growth. It is also the one in which the United
States is far and away the world's leader. It is not just America's
leading industry, but the world's that is centered in the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, such leadership should be reaping rather
dramatic returns.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has this been the overnight phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Investment in information technology has been going roughly as
long as the Nasdaq itself. Yet for years, it was an axiom of
economic analysis that large `IT'' investments were not yielding
commensurate returns.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently they now are.
</P>
<P>
   As a result productivity, which had existed in the `one
percents'' in every year of this decade (except the post-recession
rebound year of 1992), was 2.9 percent in 1996, 2.2 percent in
1997, 2.8 percent in 1998 and 4.7 percent in the third quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is logical that big returns would follow such dramatic
results and potential.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to examine the comparative returns in other
investments. Of course, the most common counterpoint to stock
investment is bond investment. It is not coincidental that general
stock appreciation has followed a dramatic decline on bond yields.
In December 1980, `stagflation'' (the combination of high inflation
and stagnating economic performance) had driven interest rates on
the 30-year Treasury bond to 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today that bond yields approximately 6.5%.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we must focus on the demand side of the equation: the
source of the wealth driving Nasdaq prices. Baby boomers, America's
largest and wealthiest age cohort, are now in their top earning
years - their time to fund retirement, children's education, etc.
This massive amount of cash has to go somewhere. It is again not
surprising that it would go to the Nasdaq high tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Nasdaq represents the world's leading industry. It
is giving strong evidence of its economic potential. This potential
is greater than either that of the steam or internal combustion
engines because of its ability to penetrate virtually every sphere
of life. America is in fact writing history electronically.
</P>
<P>
   This industry is centered in this country, which gives Americans
an inside track on investing in it. America, with an economy over
twice that of the world's second largest, has simultaneously seen
its largest age group reach its greatest earning capacity and has
experienced a rapid decrease in the return on alternative
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in this scenario smacks of speculation. It represents
not a repeal of economic laws but rather their response to a
coincidence of positive economic factors.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that speculation doesn't exist in the Nasdaq
or any stock market. Certainly it does. Yet this does not detract
from their real economic role of capital allocation.
</P>
<P>
   To those discerning a problem in the Nasdaq's recent growth,
there follows a tacit question: What is to be done? The answers of
the past issue a dire warning to the present and future. For two
generations governments believed they could better manage a
society's wealth than society's private operations. It was only by
freeing America from this mindset and its consequences that the
unprecedented economic growth we have experienced for the last 20
years has been possible.
</P>
<P>
   The worst lesson we could take from the Nasdaq's recent
increases would be that there should again be a government attempt
to control the allocation of wealth.
</P>

SENDING A WISH LIST: IS IT NASTY OR NICE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(jt) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the record, my daughter Ella would like to point out that
there are only 15 more days until her ninth birthday. Also, she
does not want to pressure anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the party invitations are finished; Ella designed, cut
out and colored them herself after determining that no stores
within 100 miles stocked the right ones, which needed to have
rainbows _ with their colors in the proper order _ floating against
a backdrop of puffy white clouds. She also signed off on the
seating arrangement and approved vanilla icing for the cupcakes.
</P>
<P>
   So as of last week, only one tiny detail remained: the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Ella was a little concerned. What if her grandparents in Arizona
tried to send cash (again) and it got stolen (again)? Or what if
Uncle Dan forgot her birthday? Then she saw an ad on television
that she thought might improve all our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, it says you can go online and make a list with, like,
everything on it that you want,'' she said, ``and then you e-mail
it to your relatives, and they can order the presents on the
Internet and ship them to you.'' The way Ella had it figured, that
would make everyone happy, even Uncle Dan, because for once he
would know which Backstreet Boys CD she didn't already have.
</P>
<P>
   Put that way, it did sound like a good idea. And if things got
out of hand later _ Sorry, Mom! Sorry, Dan! _ I would be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I took Ella to visit Etoys.com (www.etoys.com),
which has both a gift registry tool and a wish list. (The main
difference is that a wish list creates a personal list, but you
can't send it via e-mail to anyone unless you convert it into a
gift registry.)
</P>
<P>
   With about a gazillion Internet sites offering gift registries
and wish lists these days, I chose Etoys for two reasons: selection
and protection. The site sells 100,000 items for children in
categories like toys, music and books, so I figured that it would
be easy for Ella to find things she liked. And to ensure privacy,
the site encrypts personal information and does not share it. The
only people who can look at the list are those you invite; they use
a password that you choose. Two other sites I tested with similarly
acceptable privacy policies are www.icanbuy.com, aimed at older
children and teen-agers, and www.kidswish.com, with items for
children from 2 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   The eToys.com site says you must be 18 to register to create a
gift registry. It is, however, possible for a child to register on
the site without a parent's knowledge because the only requirement
is an e-mail address. For the gift registry, which takes about a
minute to create, you also must provide a shipping address and the
name of the child. Ella suggested that the most logical title for
her list would be ``Ella's 9th Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Then my daughter, who has more than a passing familiarity with
computers _ she recently had her AOL privileges suspended on
suspicion of entering inappropriate chat rooms _ said to me, ``I
can figure it out from here.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't say for sure whether Ella actually clicked on all
100,000 thumbnail images of items on the eToys site during the time
I left her alone at the computer. I certainly wouldn't put it past
her. I do know that by the time I returned, she had methodically
completed a list by clicking on Add to Registry beneath each item
she wanted. It was, in fact, a fairly modest list of six items,
including four music CD's and two books, none of which cost more
than $12.99.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I immediately disliked that list.
</P>
<P>
   When I think of a child's wish list, I imagine a heartfelt note
to Santa, with a few charming misspellings, scrawled laboriously on
a piece of smudged paper: ``For me a pony and Santa plese can Tiny
Tim walk without crutchs?'' Hold a match to the corner and it
disappears in a puff of innocence up the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   But the eToys list looked so clinical. There was nothing
innocent about the way each item was impersonally itemized and
described: ``Backstreet Boys (CD) by Backstreet Boys, in stock, add
comment, $12.99.'' Certainly this in no way resembled the sort of
whimsical list that would warm a grandparent's heart or make a
parent say, ``Well, I guess we could fence in the back corner of
the yard and buy some hay.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, after we distributed the list by e-mail, some of the
recipients thought that it was downright rude. OK, it was my
husband who complained. After receiving the e-mail with the fairly
generic greeting _ ``Dear whoever it may concern (mom, dad, seth,
grammi, uncle dan, jo-jo or aj) This is a wish list that i made on
the internet. It has some of the things that I want for my 9th
birthday. Ella'' _ my husband phoned me immediately.
</P>
<P>
   He grumbled, ``Maybe you should send a pre-emptive e-mail with
the subject line `Warning: Pushy Request For Merchandise To
Follow.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Ella wasn't being greedy. The list just made it look that
way. From the moment she actually started creating the list, she
had become more interested in it as a sort of science experiment
than as a way to amass loot. She wondered (and wrote down in her
Birthday Notes Notebook with the rainbow on the cover) the
following questions: How long will it take for the e-mail messages
to get to everyone? Will they all get it at the same time? What
will they do then?
</P>
<P>
   The next day after school, she rushed upstairs to log onto
eToys. When she saw that an item had been purchased, she was
excited. ``They did get it,'' she said with satisfaction. With her
perception of the Internet, it seemed as if she had put a message
in a bottle and sent it floating out into the unknown _ and it had
miraculously arrived. She decided, then, to amend the list, not
with more items but by using the Add Comments section to convey
``secret'' messages to her relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, my husband and I were the only ones who didn't like
the list. My parents, who are troupers, purchased items immediately
_ and reported that it was easier and more convenient than having
someone at the post office steal your cash from an envelope. They
also approved of the 10 percent discount eToys gives on the price
of gift registry items.
</P>
<P>
   But I am still having one of those I'm-a-Bad-Mother moments. I
hope I didn't teach Ella that buying gifts is a cut-and-dried
undertaking. I want her to learn (preferably by the time she has
real money to spend for my birthday) that you should have to work a
little. Wrack your brain for something idiosyncratic and personal
that will surprise and delight the recipient. Buying a present for
someone you love should be hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping one certainly is. Ella will at least realize that at
breakfast on her birthday, when she gets a rather large and lumpy
package from me, wrapped with strips of paper that weren't quite
wide enough to cover the label on the box and then patched with
other, smaller pieces. It took me about an hour and no, I haven't
gotten to the bow yet.
</P>
<P>
   I hope she likes what's inside. It's not on her list.
</P>

A SPORT FOR PURISTS: BELT-SANDER RACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(af) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever happened to no-frills sports?
</P>
<P>
   In the Olympics, Underwater Busby Berkeley and ribbon wiggling
are medal events. In boxing, A woman beat up a man last year.
Wrestling? Oh, please. And the money sports? Root for a $100
million contract player? As Yogi Berra might say, if Jim Thorpe
were alive, he would be spinning in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   Well _ as the writer Hunter S. Thompson did say _ when the going
gets weird, the weird turn pro. As venerable sports traditions die
or morph into silliness, people from all walks of life are making
up their own.
</P>
<P>
   Common sports for the common man, with purity, standards, fun
and only enough commercialism to keep them alive. Here is one such
sport for the millennium:
</P>
<P>
   Belt sander racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two belt sanders sit idle, side by side, as the crowd grows
silent,'' begins the introduction to the International Belt Sander
Drag Race Association (www.beltsander-races.com). ``With the cry of
`Ready ... GO,' Lorne Nielson flicks the start button and both belt
sanders go racing down the 30-foot-long track as the crowd erupts
into cheers. Another belt sander drag race final at Nielson's.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielson, 42, owns Nielson Hardware in Point Roberts, Wash., a
quiet town about 100 miles northwest of Seattle that is bordered on
three sides by ocean and on one side by Canada. Thus set off from
the rest of the United States, belt sander racing was destined from
birth to be international.
</P>
<P>
   The first race was held at Nielson's hardware store in 1989.
``To be honest with you,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``it
was just a one-time kind of fun thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielson had no idea. Belt sander racing now has its own tours
(it is popular at home shows), international championship (this
year at Rod's Building Supply in Richmond, British Columbia, on
July 1, Canada Day), divisions (stock, modified and decorative),
rules and specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1, not official: Ask Dad first. ``It's become more of a
kid's event than an adult event,'' Nielson said, acknowledging that
some vehicles are ``Dad's belt sander that's collecting dust in the
garage.'' Rule No. 2: Invite mom.
</P>
<P>
   Motifs vary from the Daytona 500 to the Paris collections. There
are sanders made to look like woodchucks, space ships, Viking
helmets and little Rose Parade floats. Movies on the Web site show
races like the Grim Reaper versus the Carrot, which looks like its
name.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Tutt, general manager of the association and a veteran of
the first race, said he especially liked the sander with Barbies
dressed like windsurfers. It came with its own female cheering
section and music (the Beach Boys).
</P>
<P>
   Pages on the site will tell you how to build a track and how to
modify a sander. Tips include: always encase the sander in a box or
add some other guide to ensure straight running. Graphite is
allowed, but keep it away from the track surface. And look for
very, very coarse sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Some racers are using a No. 16 grit. ``God knows where they
found it,'' Tutt said. ``I think they were gluing the sand on
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As for speed, ``Straight out of the box, it's kind of a toss-up
this year between a Mikita and a Bosch,'' Tutt said, naming two
popular brands. Stock models usually travel the 30 feet in 2
seconds, he said. The modified division champion, Steve McKenzie,
installed a grinder motor in his sander. It set the world record,
1.52 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The S-B Power Tool Co. in Chicago, which makes Bosch sanders and
other brands, is cautiously tolerant. It will lend its name and
logo to a distributor who wants to hold a local event, but Bosch
does not underwrite or organize the events, said Sil Argentin,
manager of media communications for the company. ``Fundamentally, a
sander is supposed to be a sander,'' Argentin said.
</P>
<P>
   But the giant wholesaler-distributor of which Nielson's store is
a member, the Do It Best Corp. of Fort Wayne, Ind., loves the
races, and at least 40 member stores across the United States and
Canada sponsor them. Do It Best even has an online belt sander
racing game, www.doitbestcorp.com/racing. The icons for the game
are company executives.
</P>
<P>
   The sander association has never had any legal or safety
problems, Tutt said _ well, except for that lumberyard that wanted
to try to put people on a couple of sanders. ``They realized their
liability would be crazy, so they put a stop to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, belt sander racing is not the only new, pure sport.
There is, for instance, the United States Lawn Mower Racing
Association (www.letsmow.com). And it is said there is an even
purer, nobler sport.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Zamboni racing does not seem to have its own Web
site.

<P>
   Oscar Wilde is said to have defined an expert as an ordinary man
away from home giving advice. Today, those words may be truer than
ever, with a few tweaks. An expert, it seems, is now an ordinary
person sitting at home, beaming advice over the Internet to anyone
who wants help.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, thousands of such ordinary people have
signed up to wear the label of online expert. They are
participating in a new breed of Web site that attempts to match
people who have questions with people who think they have answers.
</P>
<P>
   Sites like ExpertCentral (expertcentral.com), XpertSite.com
(xpertsite.com), KnowPost (knowpost.com) and EXP (exp.com) have
been open for only a few months but have already become virtual
trading floors where the currency is knowledge and the subjects
jump from brewing beer to filing taxes and cheating at poker.
Others, like Deja.com (deja.com) and the just-opened Abuzz
(www.abuzz.com), are more free-form, guiding users to online
bulletin boards that are populated with people eager to offer their
2 cents' worth.
</P>
<P>
   These sites, often called expert sites or knowledge networks,
represent the latest stage in the Internet's evolution, the people
who have created them say. For years, computer users have tried to
find answers online by sifting through frequently asked questions
on Web pages or typing keywords into search engines. Many people
have also tried posting questions to newsgroups or other discussion
groups linked by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But something was missing, the founders of these new sites
argue. What people need, they say, is human intervention, real
answers that are fast, personalized and _ unlike much information
in online discussion groups _ easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   Expert sites are trying to provide the technology to make that
happen _ and they are betting that enough real people will be
willing and able to answer even the most obscure queries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have questions like, I'm moving from Cincinnati to
Seattle, what are the best things to know?'' said Udai Shekawat,
vice president for marketing for Xpertsite.com. ``We will try to
give you a customized answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with real people, however, is not always easy. Sure, it
can result in heartwarming interactions with people who want to
help for purely altruistic reasons. But it also means coping with
people who need to make money, who want to build reputations or
who, at worst, have delusions about whether they know what they are
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can be an expert now, at least on the things they have
personally experienced,'' said Paul Resnick, a professor at the
University of Michigan's School of Information who studies the
interaction between people and computers. The result, he said, is
``a democratization of information publishing'' and a
``democratization of expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that it was more important than ever to be wary.
``Just because someone says something doesn't mean it's true,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Conlin, corporate research director for J.D. Power &AMP;
Associates, a company that conducts consumer surveys, has stronger
words for the phenomenon. He calls it ``pseudoresearch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a lot of questions being asked very
inappropriately to the wrong kinds of people,'' he said, ``and the
wrong information is transmitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people who might be considered established information
experts, like librarians and professors, say the commercialization
of expert sites could taint the information from such traditional
sources. Some of the sites, like EXP, hope to generate revenue by
encouraging their experts to charge for their advice and then
pocketing a percentage of the fees. Others, like Xpertsite.com
(which will be renamed AskMe.com at the end of the month) plan to
make commissions on whatever is purchased as a result of their
experts' suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, many of the answers offered on these sites
(and available for viewing) have nothing to do with product
recommendations but are a mixed bag of information. Many are
off-the-cuff responses with little value. Some of the entries,
however, appear to involve people seeking help who have been able
to find it from kindly souls who have the time to respond
thoughtfully, without strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russo, for example, is an expert on ExpertCentral. Ten
years ago, he and his wife had triplets, a result of the use of
fertility drugs. Now he answers questions, free of charge, about
coping with the challenge. ``We've had just about every problem you
can have, in triplicate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russo gets several questions a day, which he answers while
sitting in his den at night, usually after testing his ideas with
his family during dinner. Some of the requests he has received, he
said, are personal questions about the emotional repercussions of
multiple births _ questions that, experts in library science say,
are typically not asked of reference librarians or even of
counseling professionals, who might seem intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes people are looking to avoid going to a
professional,'' Russo said. ``Sometimes it's easier to not be face
to face with someone.'' Visitors to most of these expert sites can
disguise their identities by adopting screen names and can even
choose to have their questions and answers hidden from public view.
</P>
<P>
   As an expert, however, Russo makes every attempt to disclose his
identity. He uses the screen name of ``bill.russo,'' has a Web site
at www.bill.russo.com and offers several paragraphs of information
about himself and his wife in his ExpertCentral profile. ``What I
offer to you,'' he says in his profile, ``is the knowledge we have
accumulated over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the people answering questions are not quite
so open about their credentials _ or about what motivates them?
EXP, a site that encourages people to pay at least a few dollars
for expert advice, offers an expert named Austin who purports to be
a guru on nutrition, stress management and other health-related
subjects. Under the heading titled Background in the profile area,
Austin writes: ``It's not my experience that you care about. It's
your problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The creators of expert sites want users to use their own
judgment in figuring out who can best answer their questions, and
most of them have posted lengthy disclaimers about their lack of
responsibility for harmful advice. But they will offer some
guideposts to steer people away from suspect ``experts'' and point
them toward people who are forthcoming about their credentials. The
sites have adopted rating systems similar to the one used on eBay,
which asks buyers to rate sellers and sellers to rate buyers. In
the case of the expert sites, each expert is given a rating.
</P>
<P>
   Abuzz, for example, depicts the number of good reviews a person
has received by putting pictures of starbursts _ which it calls
``applause'' _ next to their names. The site, which is owned by
Times Company Digital, the Internet division of The New York Times
Co., also offers statistics on how many questions each person has
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have answered more questions than the vast majority of
Abuzz users are listed as ``top people.'' One is Nance Douglas, an
elementary school teacher who has answered 633 questions since the
site opened for testing in September.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those rating systems are, in a sense, the sites' attempt to
build new frameworks of credibility. They want to be anti-elitist
spaces filled with ``real answers'' that have not been edited or
vetted by professionals, yet at the same time they are encouraging
people to build their own hierarchies, to review their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Debbi Craig, a woman has used ExpertCentral as both a questioner
and an expert, has already subscribed to that notion. ``When
looking for an expert,'' she wrote in an e-mail interview, ``find
one that has answered at least five or more questions and has a
rating of three or higher.'' As a self-described expert on herbs,
fertility and marriage relationships, Craig has so far answered 18
questions and received a rating of four out of five bull's-eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But, as many librarians and social scientists ask, who is
evaluating the evaluators? Some eBay users, for example, say they
have seen sellers rig the system _ by selling bogus items to
relatives, for example _ to bolster their ratings. And some people
may give good reviews even if they have not tested the advice yet.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Jack, for example, recently posted a request on
ExpertCentral, asking for recommendations for exotic scuba diving
sites. Someone going by the name Thomashemphill replied that same
day, suggesting that Jack try Micronesia. Jack replied, ``Thanks.
You answered my question perfectly,'' and gave Thomas the highest
possible rating. But what if Jack actually went to Micronesia and
found that it was an awful place to dive?
</P>
<P>
   Trust and credibility become even more significant, analysts
say, when experts are offering medical and financial advice. Holly
Atkinson, a doctor in New York who is now running a Web site called
Healthanswers.com, worries that people might get medical advice
from ``any Joe Blow'' _ perhaps leading them astray and keeping
them from seeking professional help. ``There are people out there
who are misrepresenting themselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One person who offers medical advice through an expert site is
Tim Birdsall, who lives in Colorado. Since ExpertCentral opened in
October, Birdsall has answered 54 questions about naturopathic
medicine and achieved a rating of four out of five bull's-eyes. In
his extensive online profile, he calls himself ``Dr. Birdsall,''
but he also explains that he is an ND, which stands for doctor of
naturopathy, not an MD. He has offered advice on a number of
subjects, like using herbal therapies for prostate cancer and
treating a sty with a hot compress.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in an interview if he expected that most of his
questioners knew the difference between a naturopathic doctor and a
conventional physician, he replied, ``I'm sure that a lot of them
do not.'' But he added that most users of the site knew that it was
a ``buyer beware'' environment. ``The point,'' he said, ``is that
whether it is hepatitis or Beanie Babies, everyone has some
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Birdsall has answered nearly all of the questions posed
to him without charging a cent. But he said that would not last
forever. ``I've done a lot more gratis work initially than I will
do down the road,'' he said. He is using ExpertCentral, he
acknowledged, to make a name for himself and gain more paying
clients worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   When Birdsall does start charging clients, ExpertCentral will
pocket 15 percent of the revenue he generates from queries on the
site. He expects to charge fees that are slightly less expensive
than his usual rates, $50 to $120 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Xpertsite.com plans to use a similar system. But Shekawat, the
site's vice president, also plans to derive commissions from
products that are sold based on experts' referrals. A runner
answering questions about running shoes, for example, might suggest
her favorite brand, along with a link to that brand's shopping
site. Under this model, Shekawat said, experts will get a
percentage of the purchase price and Xpertsite.com will get a
percentage of that percentage. ``We already have merchants who want
our experts to recommend their products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional vetters of information, like librarians and editors,
voice strong doubts about such a model. David Carter, for example,
has seen his share of online questions as the head of the Internet
Public Library, run by the University of Michigan. Visitors to the
Internet Public Library may send e-mail questions to volunteers.
The volunteers are trusted, Carter said, partly because of their
independence from commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is getting a kickback from Nike,'' Carter said,
offering a theoretical example, ``you have to ask, Is there
objectivity behind that information?''
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Glick, founder of a soon-to-be-opened site called
WePick.com (wepick.com), said he expected that users would not have
a problem with such recommendations if the information was helpful.
WePick.com plans to help people stake out an online space in which
they can recommend products and get commissions on their
recommendations. As long as the commercial interests are
``transparent,'' Glick said, ``people will understand exactly what
they are getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk, of course, is that people will indeed understand
exactly what they are getting _ and will avoid these sites for that
very reason. Remember newsgroups? In the beginning, they offered
the unfettered exchange of ideas; they were online bulletin boards
where people could ask for help and often receive it. Now, many
newsgroups are nothing but black holes swirling with classified
advertisements, unanswered questions and questionable answers.
</P>
<P>
   The legitimacy of the Oscar Wilde quotation _ ``the ordinary man
away from home giving advice'' _ may be a case in point. At least
half a dozen people have posted the quotation on Web pages,
attributing it to Wilde without referring to an essay, a play or an
occasion. But references like The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations
do not list it. And a search of Wilde's most well-known works turns
up no reference to it at all.
</P>
<P>
   What better time to ask an online expert? A query about the
quotation was posted on Knowpost.com, and an anonymous person
offered an answer within minutes. It was a list of three Web sites
that had posted the quotation and credited it to Wilde, yet the
sites offered no information about the quotation's origins. They
looked strikingly familiar. These were, in fact, some of the same
sites that had led to the need to ask the question in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just how helpful can expert sites be? Here are the first answers
received in response to a question posted on a sampling of sites
last week. The question: If I make scrambled eggs in an old Teflon
pan and some of the Teflon flakes off in my eggs, should I be
worried about it?
</P>
<P>
   XPERTSITE.COM: Worried if you accidentally swallon a Teflon
flake or two? Unlikely it will do any serious damage. But throw the
pan away.
</P>
<P>
   EXPERTCENTRAL.COM: You should not be worried. Teflon is inert to
most chemicals, which means it does not react with other
substances.
</P>
<P>
   KNOWPOST.COM: I probably would not eat the eggs but if you did I
doubt there will be a problem. If you are truly concerned, give
your local emergency room a call.
</P>
<P>
   ABUZZ: Don't worry about it. Now your stomach is Teflon coated.
Nothing will bother you.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of Web sites are offering connections to living,
breathing people who offer advice. Some are expert sites or
knowledge networks while others have librarians waiting for e-mail
or scientists answering questions asked by students.

 &HT;    CONGRESS MUST EXPAND ``SAFETY NET' FOR FARMERS, GLICKMAN SAYS
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conceding that ``freedom to farm'' legislation
isn't working, the Clinton administration will ask Congress to fix
the federal ``safety net'' for farmers and ranchers, Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman proposed that $11.5 billion ``over and above existing
programs'' be infused into the rural economy over the next two
years. This funding would come on top of about $17 billion in
direct federal payments to farmers and ranchers included in the
Agriculture Department budget for the next fiscal year, said an
agency spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, the government has also provided more
than $15 billion in emergency assistance to farmers because of low
crop prices and weather disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing need for federal aid to farmers is a tacit
admission that at least parts of the landmark 1996 farm bill have
failed, Glickman said. Passed by a Republican Congress and signed
by Clinton, the so-called ``freedom to farm'' legislation was
supposed to end more than half a century of federal agricultural
subsidies and controls.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 legislation was supposed to wean farmers from programs
that regulated how much they could plant and guaranteed a minimum
price for many crops. Instead, the law provided farmers with
government payments that were scheduled to shrink over several
years.
</P>
<P>
   However, farm prices have collapsed over the past two years and
``revealed serious problems with the farm income safety net,'' said
Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposals would provide eligible farmers with
``supplemental assistance income payments'' in the 2000 and 2001
crop years. A new farm bill is scheduled to be enacted in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not rewriting the farm bill. We are enhancing it,''
said Glickman. A more ambitious change in federal farm policy would
probably not pass this year, he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But the need for Congress to act quickly is obvious, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those emergency bills were supported by Republicans and
Democrats alike _ an admission that the farm bill does not work
very well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a half century of farm policy based on a lot of
things, including the government telling people what to do and when
to do it and how to do it. The '96 farm bill changed all that,'' he
explained. ``But in revising 60 years of national farm policy, the
'96 farm bill put farmers at risk with little fall back on, on the
basis of fixed payments unrelated to market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into the third consecutive year of depressed prices, rural
America can't wait for another last-minute emergency bailout,
Glickman said. Before spring planting begins, farmers and ranchers
_ and their creditors _ need to know beforehand that federal funds
are coming, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, farmers had reason to expect that Congress would
finally see the need to enhance the farm bill and provide for a
long-term safety net,'' he said. ``And that has not happened yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``freedom to farm'' reforms were enacted with bipartisan
support, and efforts to change them would also require cooperation
between Democrats and Republicans in an election year. In debating
farm policy, however, the splits are rarely along party lines.
Republicans and Democrats from agricultural states are often
aligned against urban colleagues from both parties.

 &HT;    Mobil Travel Guide 5-star rated Four Seasons Hotel in Atlanta
was luxurious backdrop for child and feline free getaway
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We probably should've brought the cats.
</P>
<P>
   They'd have had a grand time with us at the pet-friendly hotel:
luxuriating on feather pillows; having a bath and quadripedicure in
the salon; ordering a ``tasting portion of anchovies'' or even an
ounce of beluga caviar ($90) from the Pet's Gourmet menu. And then
perhaps they wouldn't have left, um, an expression of their
displeasure in our bed at home when they found it empty.
</P>
<P>
   But the point of this weekend getaway for me and my wife was
indeed to get away from our posse of cute, demanding creatures _
cats and kids. And what better place than the Four Seasons Hotel in
Midtown, which recently earned a rare fifth star from the Mobil
Travel Guide?
</P>
<P>
   We've all known the Four Seasons was a world-class property, but
this distinction puts it in rare company: Only 14 hotels in North
America (including the St. Regis in New York and the Peninsula in
Beverly Hills, Calif.) have, according to Mobil, the kind of shoe
polish it takes for five stars. I've gone to restaurants in
five-star hotels, attended meetings in their conference rooms but,
until now, never stayed at one. So I called to set up a sybaritic
night off from temper tantrums, sibling rivalry,
cheese-noodle-sticky hands and vindictive Siamese cats.
</P>
<P>
   This hotel chain's famous customer service was apparent from the
get-go. The reservationist figured out we were on a getaway and
managed to upgrade us from the available $240 room with a king-size
bed to a $250 weekend package: the same room plus gratis valet
parking, champagne and strawberries on arrival, and a Southern
breakfast in the restaurant, Park 75.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I thought: Champagne and strawberries are fine, but
nothing says ``No diapers!!'' like a big bouquet of flowers. The
concierge asked if there was any flower in particular my wife
liked. I'm not sure what prompted me to say ``calla lilies,'' but I
did.
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem. In fact the concierge thought it best to mix them
in an arrangement with some fragrant flowers. Did I have any other
questions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, what does a calla lily look like?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you familiar with the work of Robert Mapplethorpe?'' he
asked. ``He used calla lilies as subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, OK,'' I said, visualizing an anthirium and wondering what
my wife would think.
</P>
<P>
   The big night finally came. The valet, in top hat, climbed into
our Froot Loop-strewn minivan and drove it out of sight. The
doorman, smiling, held the door open.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby, with its expanses of dusty-rose marble, brass
railings and huge, swooping stairway to the mezzanine, isn't
beautiful, but it is jaw-droppingly grandiose. No wonder the
property was, until the Four Seasons acquired the management
contract three years ago, called the Grand Hotel. It is so grandly
monolithic it dwarfs all the people inside, about two-thirds of
whom are staffers eager to catch your eye and steer you in the
right direction. This mixture _ baronial scale, personal service _
does make you feel like the lord of the realm.
</P>
<P>
   This juxtaposition is possible because the hotel occupies just
19 floors of the 53-story tower and has only 244 rooms. Above it
are luxury residences and office space, and if you look carefully,
a discreet iron grille off to one side of the lobby barricades a
separate set of elevators. This is a boutique hotel that only looks
massive.
</P>
<P>
   The service is careful but never obsequious. The receptionist
saw we only had a small overnight bag and didn't even suggest a
bellman. But she did come from behind the desk and walk us to the
elevator. Up we went to our room on the desirable side of the
hotel, facing downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The calla lilies were perfect. The feather bedding was draped
every which way in white, washable linens. The gray marble bathroom
featured a glass shower stall to one side and a deep bath to the
other. There were Neutrogena soaps. And _ yay _ Q-tips.
</P>
<P>
   But where were the champagne and strawberries? I called the
receptionist, who wasn't just apologetic; she was mortified. Room
service arrived in moments, and the server insisted I not tip.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of our stay, I tested the staff to see how well
it handled special requests. I asked room service if it would send
out to a sushi bar and bring it to our room. It quoted me one hour.
I called for a toothbrush and barely two minutes later received a
complimentary ``dental kit'' in a rope-handled bag. I asked the
concierge for restaurant recommendations. As the paper's dining
critic, I know she suggested the cream of Midtown from Veni Vidi
Vici, to the wonderful Thai place Tamarind, to the new, intimate
Pasta da Pulcinella on Peachtree Walk.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at this hotel always does what it takes. It might be
welcoming a guest's dog with a chewy toy, a bottle of mineral water
and a homemade dog biscuit. But it might be more. A doorman once
relinquished his own shoes to a guest who was hurrying off to a
formal reception and desperate for a pair of black oxfords. A
housekeeper noticed a very tall guest couldn't fit in his bed and
had the engineering department rig an extension. And wouldn't you
know that a banquet server with a nursing degree did once deliver a
baby in the parking lot and still make his shift.
</P>
<P>
   My only minor complaint would be with room service. It arrived
long before the quoted time and the server set a romantic table by
the window. But the quality of the food was, well, fancy-hotel
standard. A processed cheese tray (cheddar, smoked mozzarella and
gouda wedges complete with wax crinkles on the surface) seemed a
bit behind the times, as did a boring salad with a cup of thick
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   We're sorry we didn't send out for sushi, because the hard,
refrigerator-cold crab roll from the room service menu was a gummy
thing. But a tuna roll from the Park 75 menu, seasoned with tiny
bits of fresh ginger and sesame oil then wrapped in a crisp rice
paper, was much better.
</P>
<P>
   We watched ``Double Jeopardy'' in bed and woke up to the sunrise
over downtown Atlanta. In the morning we went to the great spa,
where the coffee came in specially laminated paper cups that didn't
burn your hands. Showered and refreshed, our bathing suits spun dry
in a kind of salad spinner gizmo, we had breakfast in Park 75.
Loved the fresh-squeezed Ruby Red grapefruit juice but couldn't
believe the unexceptional Southern breakfast (complete with a
shotput biscuit) was $18.
</P>
<P>
   And then our getaway was over.
</P>
<P>
   The anal-retentive epicure in me did take note of a couple minor
slip-ups along the way. The reservationist said we would get a
bottle of ``Mumm's champagne,'' which suggested the French import.
We got instead a much lesser sparkling wine from California, Mumm's
Cuvee Napa.
</P>
<P>
   The welcome letter from the hotel said the package involved
``Southern breakfast for two (tax and gratuities included),'' but
we were given a precise $36 allowance for food, i.e. the menu price
of two breakfasts before tax and tip.
</P>
<P>
   If I were a Mobil Travel Guide judge, I suppose I'd give the
overall experience 4 1/2 stars. But then I'd consider the service _
never for an instant in your face, but always there to catch your
eye _ and round up to 5.
</P>
<P>

   Q: I am trying to find root beer concentrate. I use it in a
barbecue pork recipe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Debbie Newman, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another query: Several years ago, we bought root beer
extract to make our own carbonated drink. It was very good, and our
children enjoyed making and bottling it. But we can't find the
extract anymore.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fran Wagner, Canton, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A:We can almost taste the barbecue pork and brown cows (root
beer and vanilla ice cream) you will soon be whipping up.
Zatarain's Root Beer extract, which has been made for more than 100
years in New Orleans, is available at Kroger, 3330 Piedmont Road
N.E. (404-237-8022) in Atlanta. A 4-ounce bottle is $1.99 and makes
5 gallons of the carbonated beverage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any idea where I can find Hellmann's Creamy
French Salad Dressing? I have not been able to find it for several
months, and it's the closest match I have found to Chick-fil-A's
Dwarf House restaurants' house dressing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deborah Mathews,
</P>
<P>
   Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A:This bottle of creamy dressing has a new look, so it might be
a bit difficult to spot. We found our 8-ounce bottle ($1.49) at
Publix, 2148 S. Cobb Drive (770-805-0000). The dressing blend
includes tomato paste, salt, garlic powder and paprika.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Fizzies, a tablet that you put into a glass
of water, and it makes a Kool-Aid-type drink.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gail Fruecht, Loganville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another query: I am trying to find Fizzies. You put it into
a glass and it will carbonate and flavor the water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beth Grafer, Mableton, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Pop, pop, fizz, fizz. A splash from the past. We found your
instant sparkling drink tablets, Fizzies, at Hometown Favorites, a
Florida company that specializes in tracking down hard-to-find
foods and candies. Drop a tablet into a 6- or 8-ounce glass of ice
water or milk.
</P>
<P>
   Each package is $1.20 and contains six tablets in such flavors
as root beer, berry, grape, cherry and punch. To order:
1-888-694-2656.Order online at: www
</P>
<P>
   .hometownfavorites.com. You can also buy Fizzies on the
company's Web site at: www.fizzies.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year I was in London and found Jo Malone of London
perfume and toiletries. The company said its products would be in
the States soon, but I haven't been able to find them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vivian Wallace, Suwanee, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A:Although not a familiar name _ yet _ in the States, Jo Malone
skin care products and fragrances have been well-known in the
United Kingdom since 1994. The scents are based on natural
ingredients. For example, her signature fragrance is Lime, Basil
and Mandarin. And the top seller in her new shop at 150 Sloane St.
in London is the Nutmeg and Ginger bath oil. Other yummy
fragrances: Amber and Lavender, French Lime Blossom, Honeysuckle
and Jasmine, Tuberose, Vetyver, Verbenas of Provence and
Grapefruit. Items also include body lotions, shampoos and
conditioners, soaps, skin tonics and cleansing gels, night creams
and eye gels. Prices range from $30 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   The Jo Malone line, which was acquired by the Estee Lauder
company last October, is available in only three U.S. stores: Saks
Fifth Avenue, 700 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL (312-944-6500, Ext.
300); Saks Fifth Avenue, 2901 W. Big Beaver Road, Troy, MI
(248-643-9000, Ext. 383); and Bergdorf Goodman, 754 Fifth Ave., New
York, NY (212-753-7300, Ext. 8750).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have not been able to find Spice Islands Chicken Stock Base
any more in the stores in the spice section.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gaynor Nelson, Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another spice request: My family and I have been searching,
with no luck, to find Spice Islands Spaghetti Sauce Seasoning. Can
you help us locate this wonderful spice?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kim Hinerman, Dallas, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another spicy plea: Yikes, my reputation for effortlessly
producing the perfect salad dressing for fresh greens is in the
balance. Spice Islands Salad Seasoning for Vinaigrette seems to
have disappeared from grocery shelves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Lawson, Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We have good news/bad news about these food items. Spice
Islands Chicken Stock Base is available, according to Diane
McElroy, spokeswoman for Tone Brothers Inc., which owns Spice
Islands. But it can be hard to find. If your store sells the line
of Spice Islands Seasonings, ask the manager to order it.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Spaghetti Sauce Seasoning and Salad Seasoning for
Vinaigrette have recently been discontinued and pulled from grocery
shelves. However, the company has set up a mail order distributor
who will sell these products until the supply runs out. You can
also order Chicken Stock Base from this distributor. Call Edge
Distributing: 1-800-373-3726 between 8 a.m.-5 p.m., Central time.
You must buy a case (six jars). Ask for a price quote when calling.

THERE'S HELP OUT THERE FOR PROBLEM GAMBLERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CRYSTAL YEDNAK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ ``Eddie'' watched the Super Bowl without
sweaty palms this year.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always such a low-key event for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl was the ultimate,'' recalled Eddie, a
recovering compulsive gambler who asked that his real name not be
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after the game was over, my troubles began. I had to
scramble to cover all the accounts I had open with the finance
companies and MasterCard.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day about two years ago, a bank called his wife to
inquire about a late payment, tipping her off that Eddie had racked
up a $22,000 gambling debt.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie is now a member of a local Gamblers Anonymous chapter. His
wife attends Gam-Anon meetings. Together, they are working to
repair their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to gambling hot lines from people like Eddie and his wife
are expected to increase in the next few weeks as sports bettors
and their families deal with the fallout from the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of sports gamblers, betting on the Super Bowl is
their last-ditch effort to get ahead, to get even or just to get
the bookies off their backs,'' said Keith Whyte, executive director
for the National Council on Problem Gambling.
</P>
<P>
   It's the last game of the season, a time many people place a bet
or two. In Nevada, the only state where gambling is legal, about
$76 million was wagered on the 1999 Super Bowl, according to the
Nevada Gaming Control Board.
</P>
<P>
   A big Super Bowl loss with no other game to bet on for months
could push a problem or compulsive gambler to the edge. It may also
clue family members to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Calls have spiked this week to a local hot line that typically
receives about five calls a week. Hot line call takers said they
had eight calls Monday, the day after St. Louis beat Tennessee in
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who places a bet in an office pool or seems to
enjoy playing the slot machines at the casino is a problem gambler.
Compulsive gambling is believed to affect about 1 to 2 percent of
the American adult population, Whyte said. Another 2 to 3 percent
can be classified as less severe problem gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Problem gambling is defined as any behavior that creates
difficulties for the gambler or his family, such as lies about
bills, excessive calls to 1-900 numbers or obsession with Internet
gaming sites.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling only recently entered into the equation. Since
gambling hit the Internet in 1998, the number of gaming sites has
grown from 15 to about 700 sites today, said Sue Schneider,
chairwoman of the Interactive Gaming Council.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the eight calls made to the Fort Worth hot line Monday
were related to Internet gambling, a call taker said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the gambler seeks help from Gamblers
Anonymous, spouses and other family members of a compulsive gambler
must seek help, said Sue Cox, executive director of the Texas
Council on Problem and Compulsive Gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, Deborah opened her credit card bills. The totals
made her think her cards had been stolen. She was about to call
police when her husband stopped her to confess that he had used the
cards without her knowledge, amassing a debt several times their
yearly salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compulsive gamblers are compulsive liars,'' said Deborah, who
started attending Gam-Anon meetings soon after her discovery.
</P>
<P>
   At the first meeting, ``people are devastated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On top of dealing with being lied to and betrayed, family
members are also struggling with extreme financial problems, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the weekly meetings, Deborah learned to deal with her
feelings and how to protect herself in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gam-Anon saved my life; it saved our marriage,'' she said. ``I
found out I wasn't alone, and that is really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she answers calls for a Fort Worth-area hot line.
</P>
<P>
   If a husband or wife is exhibiting some of the warning signs,
Cox encourages the spouse to investigate the couple's financial
situation, to check credit reports and other financial data.
</P>
<P>
   If the suspicions prove true, there is some positive news, Whyte
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you find out about it, it is very treatable,'' he said.
``You just have to get the person to make that call, read the
brochure, talk to the professional, and there is a good chance of
getting them the help they need.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION BOX
</P>
<P>
   Help is available through Gamblers Anonymous and Gam-Anon.
Similar to organizations like Al-Anon, Gam-Anon provides support
for family members and close friends of problem gamblers, using a
12-step program.
</P>
<P>
   Warning signs of compulsive gambling include out-of-character
behavior during or after a game; an obsession with point spreads;
frequent requests for loans; an unusual interest in obscure games;
and a shift in team allegiance from week to week.
</P>
<P>
   To get in touch with a local Gamblers Anonymous or Gam-Anon
group, call the Texas Council on Problem and Compulsive Gambling
hot line at (800) 742-0443 or the National Council on Problem
Gambling hot line at (800) 522-4700.

UTILITY MEETS FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't normally do my computer shopping at those big warehouse
superstores: I mostly shop on line. But the other day I needed a
new keyboard and mouse on short notice, so I stopped by CompUSA
store.
</P>
<P>
   Before I knew it, my mission to pick up a cheap accessory had
been transformed. The bright lights and slick packaging from a
hundred different companies changed my purpose. No longer was I a
utilitarian drudge; now I was after a fashion experience.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to catch my eye was a set of Cyber Acoustics
MacAudio amplified speakers. Although these $80 speakers can work
with any computer, the speakers are designed to complement Apple's
fashionable iMac computer.
</P>
<P>
   Each speaker looks like a tiny iMac, and the set even comes with
six translucent hoods so you can change their colors to match or
clash with the iMac's case. There's also a big white subwoofer that
looks rather out of place, but sounds terrific. Find out more at
http://www.cyber-acoustics.com/.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to understand why the iMac made such a big impact
on the consumer computer market. Computers, after all, had long
since become a boring commodity for most of us. Apple's genius was
realizing that the only way it could attract consumers to its
nonstandard operating system was by recruiting those who were
willing to ``think different.'' Not surprisingly, one of the
easiest ways of appealing to people who think differently from the
rest is by offering computers in a variety of different colors. It
was the ultimate refutation of today's Henry Fords who inhabit the
hallways of Compaq and Dell _ companies that are willing to sell
you a desktop computer in any color you want, so long as it's
beige.
</P>
<P>
   In building the iMac, Apple simply could have used spray paint
or colored plastics. Fortunately for us, the company decided to
innovate and build its cases from polycarbonate _ the same
substance, interestingly enough, that's used to manufacture both
compact discs and bullet-proof windows.
</P>
<P>
   Polycarbonate, sometimes known as Lexan and Merlon, is extremely
strong, optically transparent, and lightweight. And in the years
since the iMac's debut, polycarbonate has become all the rage in
the computer industry _ especially for building anything having to
do with USB.
</P>
<P>
   USB, for the uninitiated, is the Universal Serial Bus. USB is a
high-speed system for putting keyboards, mice, printers, floppy
disk drives, hard drives, and even CD-ROMs onto a computer. It's
architecturally neutral, which means that you can put it on a PC
running Windows, a PC running Unix, or a Mac. Although PCs have had
USB ports for years, and Microsoft added support for the system in
1997, it wasn't until Apple shipped the iMac with a USB keyboard
and mouse that the bus started to really gain popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this close affiliation with the iMac, many USB
products to this day have a kind of iMac styling. My D-Link
four-port USB hub, for instance, has a translucent green
polycarbonate case. The long cable that connects the hub to my
desktop has a translucent plastic armor and a braided inner
shielding _ this, despite the fact that it is plugged into a PC
clone running Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally pulled myself away from the polycarbonate
paraphernalia, I made my way to the back of the computer store,
where perhaps four dozen mice and keyboards from different
manufacturers were laid out for my inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The big new thing in mice is apparently Microsoft's new
Intellimouse Explorer
(http://www.microsoft.com/Mouse/explorer.htm). It's an oversized
device with a gray steel top, a red base, and no moving parts.
Instead of a rolling bar, the mouse has an optical sensor that
watches as you move it across your mouse pad, or your desk, or your
notebook, or even your pants. Alas, the $75 device is designed for
right-handed folk like me, so I passed it by, since I don't believe
in having a mouse that makes my left-handed wife uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of buying another product from Redmond, I decided to
get a Logitech cordless wheel mouse. The box contains two items: a
small, battery-powered mouse, and a square box that plugs into the
back of your computer. The mouse is symmetrical, so it fits in
either hand. And with no cord, or tail, it's easier to move across
my desk than any other mouse I've ever used. I love it.
</P>
<P>
   To complement my cordless mouse I bought a Logitech cordless
keyboard. The keyboard comes in two versions _ a conventional
keyboard, which costs $59.95, and an ergonomic one with split
halves for each hand. The ergonomic keyboard costs $79.95. I
decided to go with the cheaper keyboard since it takes up less desk
space.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Logitech accessories use radio frequencies to
transmit information to your PC. Logitech claims that the batteries
last six months to a year. They also use a special signaling system
that doesn't cause interference, even if you have several keyboards
and mice in the same room, all connected to different computers. I
know this system works because I was so thrilled with the wireless
devices that I went back to the store the next day and bought a set
for my wife, and we use the two setups side-by-side without any
problems. There were also a number of keyboards that relied upon
infrared communications, like a television remote. I don't like
these systems as much: if you drop a book or something on your desk
between the keyboard and the infrared receiver, you suddenly lose
the ability to type!
</P>
<P>
   Besides being wireless, my Logitech keyboard has a bunch of
extra buttons designed for controlling sound, compact discs, and
surfing the Web _ a total of 12 extra buttons in all. The most
useful buttons, I think, are those that control the volume and mute
the computer's sound _ very handy features when the telephone
rings.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I think that it's a sign of health and vibrancy that
there are so many choices available today for such PC accessories
as mice, keyboards and speakers. My only regret is that it took so
long for utility to become fashion.

 &HT;    Networks hope Mary, Rhoda and `Kingdom' will be winners
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The February ratings sweeps on TV are going to have a higher
body count than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's more coincidence than trend, but regular characters
scheduled to get killed off include Lucy Knight (Kellie Martin) on
``ER'' (widely reported, but NBC won't confirm), Ned Flanders' wife
Maude on ``The Simpsons'' and Lindsay Crouse's character, Professor
Walsh, on ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not all mourning in prime time, however. Mary Tyler Moore
and Valerie Harper have a reunion, as do the hard-bitten cops of
``Homicide.'' And the biggest miniseries in years comes at the end
of the month: NBC's 10-hour ``The 10th Kingdom,'' a fantastic new
updating of the world of fairy tales that's aimed at adults.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeps, of course, are when Nielsen Media Research measures the
demographics in many U.S. cities, which the stations then use to
set ad rates. The networks continue to moan that they use up all
their good stuff in head-to-head combat, but they keep on doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The classic scheduling train wreck that always happens comes on
Feb. 27. That's the first night of ``10th Kingdom,'' and it's also
the first night of ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' CBS' four-hour
mini about the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, and ABC's four-hour
docudrama ``The Beach Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   More of what's coming in sweeps:

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Our house has large sliding glass doors leading out to the
deck behind it and there is a simple lock on the doors to secure
them.
</P>
<P>
   However, several homes in our neighborhood have had burglars
gain entry by simply lifting the doors out of the tracks, even when
locked.
</P>
<P>
   I am worried that such a break-in could occur while we are away
on vacation. Is there any simple way we can make these doors more
secure?
</P>
<P>
   A: A very efficient and simple method for preventing such
break-ins is to close and lock the doors, then drill a hole that
goes clear through the metal frame at the top of the inner door and
continues about half way through the frame of the outer door.
</P>
<P>
   Then insert a three-and-one-half-inch long, heavy common nail
through the hole from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   This will not only keep the doors from being slid open, it will
also prevent lifting them out of their tracks, even when the door
is unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The apartment house I live in has concrete floors and the
kitchen floor is covered with old linoleum that I want to replace.
</P>
<P>
   However, when I removed most of the linoleum I found several
cracks and rough spots in the concrete that need to be smoothed
over before I can put down new linoleum.
</P>
<P>
   Short of putting down a layer of plywood as some have
recommended, is there some kind of plastic or other material I can
put down to provide a smooth base?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can use one of the latex base concrete compounds that are
sold for smoothing rough floors and filling in cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Widely sold in lumber yards, masonry supply dealers and floor
covering stores, and often called an underlayment, these compounds
usually come in powder form.
</P>
<P>
   They are mixed with a special latex liquid to a mortar-like
consistency, then troweled on and smoothed over to create a level
surface. Some skill in working with a trowel is necessary to insure
a smooth job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our hot water heater makes a knocking sound after we take a
shower and when the dishwasher is running.
</P>
<P>
   We drained the tank as suggested by a friend, but the noise
persists. Any suggestions you can offer?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are two possible causes: One is that the noise is
caused by an accumulation of sediment inside the tank. These
particles bang around as the hot water is generated and used.
</P>
<P>
   If sediment is the problem then the tank will have to be
properly drained and completely flushed out.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible cause is that the thermostat on the tank is set
too high, causing the water to boil when it is overheated. This is
easily corrected by simply turning down the thermostat on the tank.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I pulled up the old carpet in the living room to expose the
original hardwood floor underneath, but then I found some dark
colored patches _ apparently urine stains from the dog owned by the
previous occupants.
</P>
<P>
   How can I bleach out these stains without having to call in a
professional to refinish the floor?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid the floor will have to be completely refinished
either by a professional or by sanding and stripping the floor
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   After sanding, it is possible that the dark stains will still
show if they have penetrated deeply into the wood.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you will have to use a wood bleach that is sold for this
purpose in most paint stores and home centers.
</P>
<P>
   The bleach cannot be used until after the floor has been sanded
down to the bare wood.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``SECURING SLIDING DOORS WITH A HEAVY
NAIL'' goes with this column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Heavy nail going through hole drilled in both doors

</P>
<P>
   SC-GOP _ The spotlight shines on South Carolina now as Sen. John
McCain, fresh from his big win in New Hampshire, and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush hit the ground running to win votes in the next
battleground Republican primary state. (Sherman, Atlanta
Jounal-Constitution). 20.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH _ SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ After his first political defeat
since he ran for Congress in 1978, George W. Bush heads to the next
battleground state: South Carolina. Though he has a 20-point
advantage over John McCain, there are two weeks of campaigning
before the vote. How will Bush change his strategy and message, if
at all? How is he and the campaign handling its first loss?
(Greenberger, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-OHIO _ A look at Sen. John McCain's Ohio organization _
which locally includes Sen. Mike DeWine _ and at whether he plans
to step up his effort here in light of his New Hampshire showing.
How about Bush? Unlike the Dems, the Republicans have about eight
primaries before the big day, March 7, so their time here could be
limited at first, but eventually,will they be looking at Ohio.
(Hersheyr, Dayton Daily News). 15.

   LEWIS-MAIN _ ATLANTA _ Following developments of the day in the
aftermath of the arrest of Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker Ray
Lewis following a double homicide in Atlanta hours after the Super
Bowl. Arrest warrants are likely for two other suspects. Limo
driver back in Maryland. Also looking at what murder charges
against Lewis can actually mean (can he face charges if he didn't
actually murder the two men slain Sunday night?). (Longa /Abramson

his departure from Baltimore last week and ending in an Atlanta
jail cell. To include as much detail as we have, including a stop
in Charlotte, Jamal Anderson's party, Sports Authority signing,

million earmarked for hantavirus went to more pressing needs.
Trying to determine where the money went, why and whether the
agency has the right to make those shifts. Sci-Med and Wash. Bureau

by a Georgia couple against Vanderbilt University. They accuse the
university medical center of having misdiagnosed their son as
having been abused, a diagnosis that touched off an interstate
dispute over custody six years ago. (Dubose, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution freelancer; not for use by NYTNS clients).
</P>
<P>
   ONEFLORIDA _ TALLAHASSEE _ Something is going to happen in Miami
this week. Nobody is quite sure exactly what. Or where. Emotion,
ego and partisan politics hurled lawmakers into a tizzy Tuesday as
it appeared that the fate of a critical hearing on Gov. Jeb Bush's
One Florida plan hinged not on policy or substance, but on picking
an agreeable location for the public to discuss its merits. At one
point, the hearing was even declared dead, with a co-chairman of
the select legislative committee comparing the hearing to ``a
three-ring circus.'' (Gelbart, Palm Beach Post). MOVED.

</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ALBRIGHT _ MOSCOW _ With U.S.-Russian relations at the
lowest point since the end of the Cold War, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had no simple task when she swept into Moscow
this week. On her agenda to discuss with Russian political leaders
were headline-grabbing issues concerning nuclear
</P>
<P>
   nonproliferation, arms control and the contentious Chechen War.
She also had the task of sizing up Russia's acting president,
Vladmir Putin, the favorite to win next month's presidential
elections. At the end of the three-day visit, officials announced
no major steps forward on any of the national security
</P>
<P>
   topics. But, after a meeting Wednesday with Putin, U.S.
officials said steps were made on which to solidify the bilateral
relationship. (Coker, Cox News Service). 20.

   KOSOVARS _ A month ago GSU student Zen Deshishku thought he was
the only Albanian in Atlanta. Then he opened the AJC to a special
section and learned that hundreds of refugees have settled here,

was taken at Murphy's restaurant. The friends have been meeting

years in an effort to help close the digital divide between poor
families without computers and other families. (Mollison, Cox News
Service).

<P>
   FARM _ WASHINGTON _ Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman called
Wednesday for strengthening the ``safety net'' for farmers and
ranchers, a step away from landmark ``Freedom to Farm'' reforms put
in place by Congress in recent years. (Dart, Cox News Service).

<P>
   BLACK-WEALTH _ WASHINGTON _ The net worth of the average
African-American household fell even as the economy boomed over
over the past five years, according to a University of Michigan
study. (Turay, Cox News Service). 18.
</P>
<P>
   KUDZU _ WASHINGTON _ Federal weed experts think they may have
finally found something that is a match for kudzu, the vigorous
vine that crawls over trees, telephone poles, barns and just about
anything else in its path. Agricultural Research Service scientists
say a fungus found on another southern weed, the sicklepod plant,
kills kudzu 100 percent of the time. Kudzu, imported from Asia to
control soil erosion in the 1800s, now infests over 7 million
acres, from Florida to New York, westward to Oklahoma and Texas.
(Nesmith, Cox News Service). 20.

<P>
   HEALTH-MINORITIES _ WASHINGTON _ Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass,
joins House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma
and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga., at a news conference to call on Congress to pass the
Health Care Fairness Act of 2000, which aims to eliminate health
disparities among minority groups. (Turay, Cox News Service).

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Farewell, New Hampshire
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The candidates scattered today, not having to worry about New
Hampshire any more. George W. Bush, John McCain and Alan Keyes
headed to South Carolina to campaign for that state's Feb. 19
primary. Steve Forbes prepared to begin a bus tour of Delaware. Al
Gore canceled a stop in New York and returned to Washington to
break a possible tie vote on a Senate bankruptcy bill. Turns out he
wasn't needed, and was moving on to Ohio and California. Bill
Bradley went to Hartford, Conn., and New York before flying to San
Francisco in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING BETTER FOR CASH FLOW THAN A BIG VICTORY
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal's Hotline reported today that John McCain
has raised more than $330,000 through his Web site since winning
the New Hampshire primary Tuesday night. In comparison, according
to The Hotline, McCain had raised a total of about $1.5 million
online before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush had $31 million in the bank at the end of the
year; McCain had just $1.5 million cash on hand, plus another $6.2
million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   HERE COMES GORE, DROP THE FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans abandoned their vigorous opposition to a
Democratic amendment to prevent people found to have violated laws
protecting abortion clinics from using bankruptcy proceedings to
escape fines or civil judgments. The 80-17 roll call denied Al Gore
a chance to break a possible tie vote and reaffirm his pro-choice
credentials. ``With this amendment, nobody will be able to
politically demagogue this issue,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
a recent presidential candidate himself
</P>
<P>
   GOING SOUTH, BRINGING `BIG MO' WITH HIM
</P>
<P>
   John McCain opened the Southern front of his campaign in South
Carolina today, confident the momentum from New Hampshire will
continue. ``I know it's going to get more intense now,'' McCain
told NBC. ``We've interfered with the coronation,'' he said,
referring to front-runner George W. Bush. Bush admitted he was
taken by surprise. ``I think everybody was,'' he said on the plane
to the Palmetto State. ``I am mentally prepared for the long
haul.''
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA, HERE THEY COME.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the polls closed in New Hampshire, the candidates
began thinking about California, the state that sends the most
delegates to the nominating conventions and the most cash to
candidates' coffers. At stake there are 434 Democratic delegates
and 162 Republican. The Republican primary is winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHEST-DRAWING N.H. PRIMARY EVER
</P>
<P>
   Hard-fought races in both parties and voter-friendly weather
produced a record New Hampshire presidential primary turnout. About
380,000 people voted there. The highest previous number of voters
to turn out was 348,000 in 1992. The 1996 primary drew 303,000.
</P>
<P>
   INSURGENTS HIT ON A BIG ISSUE
</P>

   Campaign finance reform may not be enough to carry John McCain
or Bill Bradley to victory, but they have clearly tapped into a
yearning for change among voters. A new Harris Poll found a strong
majority of voters believing that fundamental campaign finance
reform is needed. Four out of five believe voters have less say
than either lobbyists or campaign contributors. Most voters also
support a series of measures to profoundly change how campaigns are
funded. The support cuts across party lines: Republicans, Democrats
and independents all favor basic changes.

   GUNNING FOR BIG-GAME BUSH
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society of the United States called on George W. Bush
today to decline an award he's scheduled to receive from Safari
Club International, an international trophy hunting industry
organization they say promotes competitive hunting of the world's
rarest wildlife. Bush has been tapped for the Safari Club's
``Governor of the Year'' award at a ceremony Saturday in Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   OK, YOU WANNA DEBATE, SO LET'S DEBATE NOW
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley surprised Al Gore with a proposal for weekly
debates starting Sunday and running through March. 7. It was a move
meant to make clear that Bradley, who spurned Gore's earlier debate
challenge, was ready to fight on despite losing in New Hampshire.
It also means, of course, that a change in strategy is in order.

<P>
   THE LONELINESS OF LOSING BIG
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m. Tuesday night there were empty banquet tables at his
election headquarters in Manchester, N.H., and a weary Gary Bauer
sat in a side room with a half-empty glass of red wine, pondering
exactly what it means to receive only slightly more votes than
``other'' _ the catchall category for fringe and write-in
candidates. ``I go into every one of these wanting to win, hoping
to win, expecting to win,'' he said. ``But I'm also a realist. I'm
up against some pretty big names.''
</P>
<P>
   STALLONE PULLED IT OFF, THOUGH
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his pull-no-punches style, Alan Keyes jogged
into his primary night party to ``Eye of the Tiger,'' the ``Rocky
III'' theme song. The band is ``Survivor,'' and Keyes proclaimed
himself one, too. He castigated voters for putting their faith in
big names and big money. ``It is time that the people of conscience
in the Republican Party come to their senses,'' he said. The tight
knot of supporters surrounding him looked like a big crowd on
television, but most of the room was empty.
</P>
<P>
   GRANDFATHERLY ROLE A SERIOUS BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   Florida will be top-heavy with Bushes. Ex-President George Bush
is slated to address a rare joint session of the Legislature on
March 14, five days before son George W. competes in the state's
presidential primary. W.'s brother Jeb, of course, occupies the
governor's office. State Republican Chairman Al Cardenas stressed
that the purpose of Bush the Elder's visit is to ``shed light on
issues'' as Florida lawmakers begin their annual two-month
legislative session. Cardenas said the ex-prez also wants to visit
his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKS LIKE NO CONTEST IN ALABAMA
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the overwhelming favorite in two new Alabama
polls. The Birmingham News reported that ``no matter which Democrat
wins that party's nomination, the Republican Bush beats them hands
down.''
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE AGREES: BALLOT TOO ARCANE
</P>
<P>
   Calling the rules for New York's Republican presidential primary
infuriatingly unfair, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman forced the
party to drop its attempt to toss Steve Forbes from the ballot on
Long Island and suggested that he would soon allow John McCain to
qualify across the state. Korman, of Brooklyn, asserted that the
state's election laws were written to coddle incumbents and party
favorites by requiring underdogs to maneuver through a maze of
highly technical rules. Forbes and McCain had sued to overturn the
party rules.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA TV TIME AT A PREMIUM
</P>
<P>
   Big-money campaigns for ballot initiatives are gobbling up TV
time in California just as the presidential candidates are looking
to hit the airwaves for the March 7 primary. Campaign officials say
the sheer volume of ads could overwhelm voters. There are 20
initiatives on this year's ballot in the nation's largest state,
several of them pitting major interest groups against each other.
In one major fight, insurers and trial lawyers are battling over
right-to-sue laws.
</P>
<P>
   PILGRIMAGE TO BOB JONES U.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the first Republican today in the procession
to Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist Christian college in
Greenville, S.C., that bans interracial dating and marriage. The
college said Alan Keyes, the only black presidential candidate,
plans to visit Feb. 14, and Steve Forbes will be there Feb. 17, two
days before the primary. John McCain's camp said details for a
visit were still being worked out. Bob Jones III, the college
president, has split with some fellow conservatives by calling for
the Confederate flag to come down from atop the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   BUT YOU DON'T GET WEALTHY BY SPENDING IT
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and watchdog groups are questioning why George W.
Bush, with such a large campaign war chest, isn't paying more of
his own security bills. Texas taxpayers paid more than $2.6 million
to protect him last year _ more than 10 times the average amount
spent in the years before he began running for president. The new
figure provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety is almost
$1 million higher than the November number, which included expenses
though late October. That means the state has been spending about
$500,000 a month on executive security since that time.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DID THEY SAY THEIR NAMES WERE?
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer's campaign manager wants to find out how allegedly
forged signatures ended up on a petition to get Bauer on the
Indiana primary ballot. At least four of the 480 names on the
petition submitted to the Floyd County clerk's office are those of
dead people, including two who died more than 25 years ago, said
Susan Orth, the county's chief deputy prosecutor. And three-fourths
of the signatures appear to be forgeries, said County Clerk Jeannie
Freiberger, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ROLL THE DICE, SEE WHAT HAPPENS
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party, split between the Jesse Ventura and Ross Perot
factions, has been having trouble deciding where to have a meeting
to sort out where to have its convention. Now party Chairman Jack
Gargan says they'll meet in Las Vegas in March to try to settle a
number of disputes, among them the site of its August nominating
convention and even whether Gargan should keep his job. The
Venturas had wanted St. Paul, Minn., and to keep Gargan; the Perots
want Long Beach, Calif., and to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK OUT, GORE AND BRADLEY!
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon LaRouche has qualified as a Democratic candidate for the
March 14 presidential primary in Tennessee. State election
officials said he has submitted the necessary 2,500 signatures.
LaRouche campaign officials said their man now is certified for 21
state ballots.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A swath of light snow will accompany a fast-moving disturbance
Thursday as it traverses from Michigan to the Maryland coast. The
snow, generally an inch or two, will fall in a 100 mile-wide band
from the central Great Lakes to southern New England, just to the
north of the path of the storm. Usually, these ``Alberta clippers''
are well behaved, however the pitfalls of this forecast are related
to the intensity of the low-pressure system. There are indications
that the disturbance is stronger than computer guidance which would
lead to either a wider swath of snow or more likely, embedded
heavier accumulation, perhaps 4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Much of New England will notice increasing clouds as low
pressure approaches. Snow should reach coastal sections during the
afternoon. Hazardous travel is expected from the Great Lakes across
the northern Ohio Valley and into northern Pennsylvania and
southern New York. Coastal cities from Baltimore to New York may
have a burst of snow during the evening rush.
</P>
<P>
   The South will be bright and cool as high pressure glides east
across the Gulf States. Lingering low pressure near south Texas
will sponsor clouds and drizzle. Brisk and chilly weather will
dominate the upper Plains with high pressure building southward
from Alberta. Light snow will dust the east slopes of the northern
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A large storm near the northern California coast will send a
spoke of clouds and showers onshore by afternoon. Periods of rain
will spread across the central part of the state by nightfall. The
Northwest will see broken clouds and mild readings.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Weather Folklore
</P>
<P>
   Not all weather folklore is created equal. Early Tuesday, an old
and famous bit of weather folklore was celebrated when a groundhog
named Phil was pulled from a burrow in Punxsutawney, Pa. The animal
cast a shadow and his handlers proclaimed that six more weeks of
winter would follow. While this charming folklore has no scientific
support, much weather lore has a valid foundation. Many of the
weather rhymes that have been passed down through generations began
when careful observers of the sky related what they saw to the
typical weather patterns that followed.

<P>
   Inspiration for the new logo for Amtrak's Acela train began,
strangely, with a turtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A turtle doesn't move very fast,'' admitted Nick Oakley, one
of the designers of the new high-speed train. But during
brainstorming sessions, designers kept coming back to the image of
a sea turtle making stately and peaceful progress through blue
waters as the key to the mood they wanted to suggest. The result
was an abstracted fin.
</P>
<P>
   The new logo appeared for the first time on a scheduled Amtrak
train on Monday when an Acela Regional train pulled out of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The fully electrified service qualified this New York run as
Acela, but the train was made up of refurbished old cars pulled by
a venerable locomotive with a top speed of 80 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   While Michael Dukakis, Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and
other dignitaries were saluting the departure of the Acela
Regional, the critical Acela Express test train _ which can cruise
at 150 mph _ sat idle and forlorn in a cold Amtrak yard in
Philadelphia, where it was undergoing repair. High-speed service
for the Boston-to-Washington corridor, originally set to begin last
fall, has been promoted by a $26 million advertising campaign. But
the inauguration was postponed after wheels on prototype trains
showed excessive wear. At the end of January, equipment on the test
train proved wanting yet again. Amtrak officials have pushed the
start of high-speed service back to midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter visited the first of the 20 new Acela Express trains
at the new Ivy Hill maintenance hangar in Washington. Each $20
million Acela Express ``train set'' _ the cars are meant to stay
together _ consists of locomotives at each end, a first class car,
four business class cars and a cafe car, for a total of 304 seats.
</P>
<P>
   On first impression, the car interiors do not have the
futuristic glamour of the French high-speed TGV or the streamlined
romance of the 20th-Century Limited, but rather a practical,
comfortable and rugged approximation of an airline interior. There
are amenities air travel doesn't provide, however: conference areas
and a cafe offering fresh breads and salads, specialty coffees and
draft beer. There are six public phones and _ here's a benefit _
cell phones can be used anywhere on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Each seat is equipped with two music channels and an electrical
outlet for plugging in laptops. Seats rotate with the touch of a
foot pedal to let neighbors face each other. A more comfortable
environment for working en route is an advantage Amtrak hopes will
lure business travelers from airlines. When he began the redesign,
Oakley said, ``Carrying a laptop and wearing a nice suit and
catching Amtrak was not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley and his team debated the virtues of the open overhead
racks traditional on trains versus the closed bins of airlines. The
bins won.
</P>
<P>
   The new cars offer windows twice as large as those on current
trains, allowing passengers to look out even while standing up. The
cafe car has chic-looking stools and a leather padded rail for
slouchers. And Oakley was especially focused on the rest rooms.
``We explored about 200 different versions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to avoid making them like the plastic capsules that
serve as toilets on airlines, yet they had to conform with the
Americans with Disabilities Act. There is a round mirror, light
from outside filtering through sandblasted glass, a diaper changing
table, and a purple-blue composite sink.
</P>
<P>
   Employees were consulted, too. The people who ran the food
service, the designers found, didn't like turning their backs to
prepare meals. The new counter is curved.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers asked for traditional instruments instead of digital
gauges. Two throttles operate engines and brakes, and a red
emergency stop button the size of tea saucer is placed prominently
on the dash. The cockpit is heavily reinforced on the safety cage
principle used in race car design, but much stronger. Behind the
engineers' seats is an emergency area in which they can lie prone
in case of collision.
</P>
<P>
   Acela Express (it is pronounced ah-SELL-ah, a made-up cross
between acceleration and excellence) is the long awaited American
high-speed train. While no match in speed or style for the French
TGV or Japanese bullet train, it is still America's best and
perhaps last hope for passenger train service that can compete with
the airline and automobile for civilized transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Top speed for Acela Express will be 165 miles an hour; the
French TGV approaches 200 miles an hour. Amtrak says the Acela
Express is aimed at business travelers and that it will cut half an
hour off the current three-hour Metroliner trip between Washington
and New York, and a full hour and a half off the New York-to-Boston
one, which is now nearly five hours. A New York to Washington
ticket, now $66 one way on the standard train and $115 on the
Metroliner, will be about $135 business class. It now costs $200
for a full-price fare on the Delta Shuttle from New York to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Acela Express will never be faster door to door than the
shuttle _ even adding in taxi time to the airport. So instead of
focusing on reducing travel time, Amtrak is emphasizing quality
time. ``How you use time is more important than speed with which
you get there,'' said Robin Haueter, a designer who worked with
Oakley and Brent Oppenheimer on the project for the Ideo design
firm. ``This is a big idea, a fundamental change in the way we all
think about business travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Richardson, the executive vice president of Amtrak, who
was in charge of the Acela development program, said: ``People are
tired of being treated like commodities. They view the journey as a
space, an element of time that becomes their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The new trains are New Age trains, with soothing interiors and
soothing aphorisms to sell them. Ads show the train as a place for
dreaming and contemplation, ``where thoughts and coffee beans
brew.'' One ad is tagged, ``Depart from your inhibitions,'' another
``Inner children travel free.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What is really riding on the new trains is Amtrak's very
existence. Deficits have plagued Amtrak since it was founded in
1971. Legislation passed in 1997 calls for it to break even by the
end of 2002 or prepare a plan for its own liquidation. Amtrak
executives count on the new trains to draw 2.5 million additional
riders annually and to increase its revenues by $180 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Acela really had its beginnings in 1995, when Amtrak tested the
high-speed Swedish X-2000, with an undercarriage that tilts around
curves, and the German ICE (Intercity Express), on American tracks.
American tracks are notoriously rough by world standards. European
high-speed trains run on tracks whose rails are carefully aligned
and welded, and the European models ran here at speeds well below
their capabilities. Rebuilding the American track to European
standards would be prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The contract for the new trains went to a consortium of Alstom,
in Paris, and Bombardier, in Montreal, which makes the French TGV.
The cars blend mechanical and structural elements from European
trains, rejiggered for American tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak executives, including Richardson and George Warrington,
the president, inspected train interiors in Europe. They were
impressed by the Spanish high-speed train. ``The inside of the
coach felt homier,'' Richardson said. ``We felt a greater sense of
hospitality.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak sought out the Spanish train's designers, which included
Oakley, who studied at the Royal College of Art in London, along
with Oppenheimer and Haueter. ``The high-speed train was really a
piece of the bigger-brand picture,'' Richardson said. It would be
used to lend a new image to all operations in the Northeast
corridor, which carries the majority of Amtrak's traffic. Old train
names like Keystone, Empire and even Metroliner will give way to
Acela. The new trains will be used on Acela Express routes, while
Acela Regional and Acela Commuter will use refurbished cars.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak surveyed some 24,000 travelers for the redesign, along
with Amtrak employees. The designers chose a palette of colors
centering on the teal-like blue that the railroad calls Acela blue.
</P>
<P>
   New trains are only part of the $2.6 billion project. New
stations are being added at Route 128 in Westwood, Mass., an
important Boston commuter hub, and in New London, Conn.; at many
other stations, seating and signage will be improved. There are
even new uniforms, designed by Stan Herman, who created uniforms
for Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   The ``rebranding'' campaign carried out by DDB New York began
last summer with surreal teaser ads without mention of Amtrak or
any image of a train. Clouds, blue tints, and a repeated slogan
``Life on Acela'' suggested to some viewers ads from a
pharmaceutical company, perhaps for an antidepressant. ``The ads
are not what you would expect from a railroad,'' Richardson said.
``But people remembered them. They got people buzzing.''
</P>
<P>
   Success will depend more on the nuts and bolts than on the buzz.
Bombardier-Alstom has expressed confidence that it can fix the
wheel problem. It has an incentive: it can be penalized for late
delivery up to $13,500 per train per day.
</P>
<P>
   Success will also depend on finances. While Amtrak says it is
making economic progress thanks to increased ridership, a report
issued last week by the Amtrak Reform Council, appointed by
Congress to oversee the railroad, calls its accounting into doubt.
An earlier report by the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative branch, expressed doubt that even Acela could make
Amtrak profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no European high-speed train operates without
government subsidy, as Amtrak is being asked to do. Acela's success
will depend on whether its stately sea turtle pace can beat the
relentless march of Congress' time limit, or whether the Acela's
new trains can manage some fancy tilting in Washington.

UTILITY MEETS FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't normally do my computer shopping at those big warehouse
superstores: I mostly shop on line. But the other day I needed a
new keyboard and mouse on short notice, so I stopped by CompUSA
store.
</P>
<P>
   Before I knew it, my mission to pick up a cheap accessory had
been transformed. The bright lights and slick packaging from a
hundred different companies changed my purpose. No longer was I a
utilitarian drudge; now I was after a fashion experience.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to catch my eye was a set of Cyber Acoustics
MacAudio amplified speakers. Although these $80 speakers can work
with any computer, the speakers are designed to complement Apple's
fashionable iMac computer.
</P>
<P>
   Each speaker looks like a tiny iMac, and the set even comes with
six translucent hoods so you can change their colors to match or
clash with the iMac's case. There's also a big white subwoofer that
looks rather out of place, but sounds terrific. Find out more at
http://www.cyber-acoustics.com/.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to understand why the iMac made such a big impact
on the consumer computer market. Computers, after all, had long
since become a boring commodity for most of us. Apple's genius was
realizing that the only way it could attract consumers to its
nonstandard operating system was by recruiting those who were
willing to ``think different.'' Not surprisingly, one of the
easiest ways of appealing to people who think differently from the
rest is by offering computers in a variety of different colors. It
was the ultimate refutation of today's Henry Fords who inhabit the
hallways of Compaq and Dell _ companies that are willing to sell
you a desktop computer in any color you want, so long as it's
beige.
</P>
<P>
   In building the iMac, Apple simply could have used spray paint
or colored plastics. Fortunately for us, the company decided to
innovate and build its cases from polycarbonate _ the same
substance, interestingly enough, that's used to manufacture both
compact discs and bullet-proof windows.
</P>
<P>
   Polycarbonate, sometimes known as Lexan and Merlon, is extremely
strong, optically transparent, and lightweight. And in the years
since the iMac's debut, polycarbonate has become all the rage in
the computer industry _ especially for building anything having to
do with USB.
</P>
<P>
   USB, for the uninitiated, is the Universal Serial Bus. USB is a
high-speed system for putting keyboards, mice, printers, floppy
disk drives, hard drives, and even CD-ROMs onto a computer. It's
architecturally neutral, which means that you can put it on a PC
running Windows, a PC running Unix, or a Mac. Although PCs have had
USB ports for years, and Microsoft added support for the system in
1997, it wasn't until Apple shipped the iMac with a USB keyboard
and mouse that the bus started to really gain popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this close affiliation with the iMac, many USB
products to this day have a kind of iMac styling. My D-Link
four-port USB hub, for instance, has a translucent green
polycarbonate case. The long cable that connects the hub to my
desktop has a translucent plastic armor and a braided inner
shielding _ this, despite the fact that it is plugged into a PC
clone running Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally pulled myself away from the polycarbonate
paraphernalia, I made my way to the back of the computer store,
where perhaps four dozen mice and keyboards from different
manufacturers were laid out for my inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The big new thing in mice is apparently Microsoft's new
Intellimouse Explorer
(http://www.microsoft.com/Mouse/explorer.htm). It's an oversized
device with a gray steel top, a red base, and no moving parts.
Instead of a rolling bar, the mouse has an optical sensor that
watches as you move it across your mouse pad, or your desk, or your
notebook, or even your pants. Alas, the $75 device is designed for
right-handed folk like me, so I passed it by, since I don't believe
in having a mouse that makes my left-handed wife uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of buying another product from Redmond, I decided to
get a Logitech cordless wheel mouse. The box contains two items: a
small, battery-powered mouse, and a square box that plugs into the
back of your computer. The mouse is symmetrical, so it fits in
either hand. And with no cord, or tail, it's easier to move across
my desk than any other mouse I've ever used. I love it.
</P>
<P>
   To complement my cordless mouse I bought a Logitech cordless
keyboard. The keyboard comes in two versions _ a conventional
keyboard, which costs $59.95, and an ergonomic one with split
halves for each hand. The ergonomic keyboard costs $79.95. I
decided to go with the cheaper keyboard since it takes up less desk
space.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Logitech accessories use radio frequencies to
transmit information to your PC. Logitech claims that the batteries
last six months to a year. They also use a special signaling system
that doesn't cause interference, even if you have several keyboards
and mice in the same room, all connected to different computers. I
know this system works because I was so thrilled with the wireless
devices that I went back to the store the next day and bought a set
for my wife, and we use the two setups side-by-side without any
problems. There were also a number of keyboards that relied upon
infrared communications, like a television remote. I don't like
these systems as much: if you drop a book or something on your desk
between the keyboard and the infrared receiver, you suddenly lose
the ability to type!
</P>
<P>
   Besides being wireless, my Logitech keyboard has a bunch of
extra buttons designed for controlling sound, compact discs, and
surfing the Web _ a total of 12 extra buttons in all. The most
useful buttons, I think, are those that control the volume and mute
the computer's sound _ very handy features when the telephone
rings.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I think that it's a sign of health and vibrancy that
there are so many choices available today for such PC accessories
as mice, keyboards and speakers. My only regret is that it took so
long for utility to become fashion.

<P>
   WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each February, the current and past achievements of
African-Americans are celebrated in various ways. During this
month, more positive images and information on black people are
dispersed in the media than at any other time. Numerous
celebrations and parades take place in most cities to promote black
history and culture. Many museums, libraries and art galleries have
special presentations and showcases in honor of black history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHO BEGAN BLACK HISTORY MONTH? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carter G. Woodson, a black historian, proposed Negro History
Week and in 1926 organized the celebration in the second week of
February. The month of February was chosen to coincide with the
birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, important
figures in the fight for emancipation. The event was popular among
people from all backgrounds. It provided a rare opportunity for
performances, lectures, art and written material about black
history to be shared by a large audience. The February celebration
was extended in the early 1970s by the Association for the Study of
Negro Life and History, and was renamed Black History Month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF NEGRO LIFE AND
HISTORY? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The association, founded in Washington, D.C., in 1915 by Carter
G. Woodson, conducts and promotes research of black people in world
history. It also collects and studies material related to
African-Americans and other ethnic groups. The association sponsors
Black History Month and sets each year's theme. The theme for 2000
is ``Heritage and Horizons: The African American Legacies and
Challenges for the 21st Century.'' The association also produces
Black History Month study kits to help schools, colleges and other
organizations celebrate black history. Today, more than 2,000
scholars, students and historians belong to the association. &QL;

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LISTED BELOW ARE JUST A HANDFUL OF FAMOUS BLACK TEXANS: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALVIN AILEY (1931-1989): Ailey, of Rogers, was a well-known
dancer and choreographer. After studying dance with such greats as
Martha Graham and Charles Weidman, he founded the American Dance
Theater in 1958. His work mixed jazz, modern and African-American
dance elements. His company, now known as the Alvin Ailey American
Dance Theater, remains popular and well-respected today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHARLIE CHRISTIAN (1916-1942): Born in Bonham, Christian was a
pioneer of the amplified electric guitar and used it as the
centerpiece of his jazz music. He toured with several bands and
orchestras before becoming known nationally. A fatal bout with
tuberculosis ended his recording career after only two years, but
during that time Christian revolutionized the use of the jazz
guitar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE FOREMAN (1949-present): Foreman, born in Marshall, is
best-known for his boxing career. At the 1968 Olympics, he won the
gold medal in heavyweight boxing, then became a professional boxer.
He held the world heavyweight championship in 1973 and 1974, when
he was defeated by Muhammad Ali in Zaire, Africa. In 1977, he
became an ordained minister and devoted his time and money to
helping less-fortunate black Texans. Foreman made a boxing comeback
in 1987 and knocked out Michael Moorer in 1994, becoming the oldest
heavyweight champion in history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA JORDAN (1936-1996): Jordan was born in Houston. In 1956,
she graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in
government and history from Texas Southern University. She received
a law degree from Boston University in 1959. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Jordan became the first black woman to win a seat in
the Texas Senate, and the first black since 1883. In 1972, she was
elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1978, she left
public office to teach at the University of Texas at Austin. During
her lifetime, more than 25 schools awarded her honorary doctorate
degrees, including Princeton University and Harvard University. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM ``BILL'' PICKETT (1870-1932): Legendary cowboy Pickett,
from Taylor, was the first black cowboy movie star, appearing in
such films as ``The Bull Dogger.'' Pickett invented and perfected
the rodeo event known as bulldogging, or steer wrestling. While
riding his horse, he would come alongside a longhorn steer, drop to
the steer's head, twist its head toward the sky and bite its upper
lip for full control _ the same technique as cowdogs. Pickett
performed in the United States, Canada, South America, Mexico and
England. In 1972, Pickett was inducted into the National Rodeo Hall
of Fame. &QL;

SECURITY FLAW DISCOVERED AT ONLINE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what may prove to be a cautionary tale about
the headlong rush into electronic commerce, a new online bank
permitted customers for almost a month to transfer funds from any
other account in the nation's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, someone armed with another person's account number
and bank routing number could move money from that account to the
Internet bank, then withdraw it.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerability was apparently discovered and exploited by at
least one Internet grifter. The company's executives acknowledged
Thursday that they had contacted law-enforcement officials because
of one incident, but said the dollar amounts involved ``are not
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The security flaw, which the company said was corrected earlier
this week after computer security experts alerted it to the
problem, highlights the potential risks inherent in moving
traditional commerce into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The company, X.Com, based in Palo Alto, Calif., was founded in
March 1999 and has been online since early December. Its banking
services are provided by X.com Bank, a division of First Western
National Bank, a small community bank based in La Jara, Colo. The
relationship is intended to permit the Internet start-up to develop
technology ``that makes accessing and moving your money easy,''
according to the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Computer security experts said Thursday that the company had
erred in making unauthorized electronic funds transfers far too
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should not need to explain to you the dangers and damage
that could be caused by this security flaw in X.com's systems,''
said Elias Levy, a computer security expert at Security Focus, a
San Francisco-based consulting firm. ``Anyone with half a clue
could perform these unauthorized transfers for over a month via
their Web site and create some real financial problems for other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had verified that the flaw existed last week by
transferring money from another account with the permission of the
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives acknowledged the Web banking service had some
early problems, but said they had instituted procedures intended to
prohibit fraudulent practices.
</P>
<P>
   William Harris, chief executive of X.com, said the company had
changed its procedure for authorizing new accounts after it had
discovered about 10 instances in which inaccurate or suspicious
numbers had been entered into online application forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done thousands of transfers, and five or 10 that have
been problematic,'' he said. ``We have had people attempt to beat
our systems in a number of ways and now we think that we've
identified and addressed these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The company now requires that new customers fax or mail a copy
of a canceled check to establish their ownership of an account
before transferring money from it. In addition, only transfers from
accounts in the same name can be used to open accounts with the
online bank.
</P>
<P>
   The company is one of a small but growing number of
Internet-oriented banking operations trying to offer consumers more
convenience and better interest rates than conventional banks.
Others include Telebank, a subsidiary of ETrade, the Internet
brokerage company; and Wingspan, part of Bank One Corp. Traditional
banks and financial services like Charles Schwab Corp. are also
offering Web-based banking services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make everything electronic,'' said Harris, a former
chief executive of Intuit, the online financial services company
and software publisher. ``It saves us money, and lowering our costs
means we can increase our yields.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial industry experts said X.com's experience highlights
the potential risks of introducing Internet banking systems before
they are completely tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem here is not unique to online banking,'' said Mark
Rasch, vice president of the Global Integrity Corp., a financial
systems computer security consulting firm based in Reston, Va.
``But with online banking you're exposed to the Web, and as a
result your network is more vulnerable and you have to be extra
vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the X.com security flaw was the company's decision to
directly interconnect its online application form with the nation's
Automated Clearing House network.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules governing fund transfers through the network, debit
transactions from a consumer's account must be authorized in
writing. But the rules place responsibility for verification and
authorization on the receiving party.
</P>
<P>
   ``An opening question in an online banking relationship should
be, `Where is the money coming from?''' said Robert H. Ledig, a New
York lawyer who is the co-author of ``21st-Century Money, Banking
and Commerce,'' published in association with the National
Automated Clearing House Association. ``If the answer isn't clear,
it's a bad start for the relationship.''

`GREENE ON CAPRI': ISLE HAUNTED BY THE PAST   AND A GRUMPY
PRESENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You do not exactly envy Shirley Hazzard her friendship with the
writer Graham Greene after reading ``Greene on Capri,'' her memoir
of times spent with her husband, the writer Francis Steegmuller, on
the island in the Bay of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   In her finely detailed recollections, Greene comes across as
difficult, evasive, enigmatic, contradictory and even on occasion
mean, short-tempered and irrational. In a typically double-edged
anecdote she provokes Greene to share her contempt for literary
theorists:
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wounded people,'' Greene tells her. ``I feel that one
has to give them special attention, because of their huge
disappointment. One has to be specially nice to them.'' Then
suddenly, he adds, ``As one is to Indians and women.''
</P>
<P>
   She writes: ``Later _ l'esprit de l'escalier _ I told Francis,
`I might have asked, ``And are you especially nice to Indians and
women?''
</P>
<P>
   ``F. said, `The remark is shocking, and so one falls silent. Of
course, Graham counts on that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet her account of her friendship with Greene is fascinating and
irresistible, and it is precisely Greene's complexity and
remoteness that make it so.
</P>
<P>
   Hazzard first encountered Greene on a December morning in the
late 1960's while she was sitting in the Gran Caffe in the
piazzetta of Capri doing a crossword puzzle. Greene came in with a
friend, began quoting a poem by Robert Browning, ``The Lost
Mistress,'' and failed to recall the last line, which Hazzard
helpfully supplied. (Even here, because she skips over Greene's
immediate reaction to her assistance, he appears at first distant
and unfriendly.)
</P>
<P>
   A day or so later Greene invited Hazzard and her husband to
lunch at his house in Anacapri. Thereafter they kept meeting over
the years on the island, which each of them used as a haven for the
purpose of writing. They would share meals. They would explore the
island together. They would correspond.
</P>
<P>
   Hazzard evidently became fascinated with Greene. She didn't take
notes after their meetings, except ``when pleasure was turned _ as
it seemed, gratuitously _ to pain,'' she writes. ``One transcribed
the puzzle, attempting to elucidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But she kept analyzing, drawing distinctions, searching for
literary contexts, studying the man and even doing research, it
would seem. Of Greene's striking hands she writes that the palms
were ``somewhat afflicted by what I imagine was Dupuyten's
contracture, a condition in which a strap of thickened tissue
progressively constricts the flesh,'' possibly not a piece of
information that occurs to one spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges of course is a complex portrait of Greene, at the
heart of which lies the conclusion that ``Graham's lifelong
preoccupation with the equivocations that beset all men and women,
and his consciousness of his own contrariety, themselves supplied a
cohesive factor that, transmuted in art, gave the novels their
distinctive voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as evocative is the picture of Capri composed by Hazzard's
study of Greene, the island's history, its role as a magnet for
expatriates and tourists, its inhabitants and physical setting. Of
one villa they visited she writes sensuously, ``Fersen's in those
years was a garden of mossy textures and dark dense greens, with
impasto of luminous flowers: a place of birdsong and long silence;
of green lizards and shadowy cats, and decadent Swinburnean
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Most appealing of all is the picture ``Greene in Capri'' paints
of a literary life, not only Greene's but also the author's and her
husband's. Some of the best moments in these pages are the accounts
of routines that brought Hazzard together with Greene: ``It was
very pleasant, putting work aside at the end of the day, changing
into fresh clothes, strolling to the piazza in that scene of sky
and sea: the late light, the expectation of interest and pleasure,
the welcome at the restaurant, where we all preferred to dine, by
south Italian summer standards, quite early.''
</P>
<P>
   Capri is haunted by its past, Hazzard makes clear, from the time
of the Emperor Tiberius' exile there in the first century A.D., up
through the years in the early 20th century when Russians
established a community there, among them Maxim Gorky, who had as
his guests Chaliapin, Ivan Bunin and even Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of Greene's arrival in 1948, Hazzard writes, there
would never again be ``a literary or artistic `colony' of closely
knit and disputatious foreigners as in the past, wearing away damp
winters at each other's firesides: gossiping and quarreling,
reading and writing in an ancient and still enchanting place.''
</P>
<P>
   But after reading ``Greene in Capri'' it is hard to imagine
visiting the island without recalling a more immediate past. Such
is the intensity of her memoir that you will see Capri through the
eyes of Hazzard and be haunted by the spirit of her quarry, Graham
Greene.  &QL;

COMPUTER GAME PIONEER FONG SEES A LUCRATIVE FUTURE AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene is Monte Carlo, where hundreds of high-tech honchos
are gathered to impress each other with their wisdom, widgets, and
wealth. Two speakers remain on the agenda: some kid nobody has ever
heard of and Bill Gates, master of this particular universe. The
unassuming young man introduces himself quietly and then proceeds
to steal the show with talk of an ``untapped global market'' that
will ``revolutionize the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The power players listen. The community college dropout gets a
standing ovation, upstaging Chairman Gates. A prominent venture
capitalist offers him $11 million, right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, like, man, this is so cool,'' recalls Dennis Fong, 22,
as he tells this story with characteristic nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   So what is his revolutionary concept? What's his great untapped
market? In a word, games. That's right, games. Board games. Card
games. Mind games. But most importantly, computer games. The way
Fong sees it, electronic games are the final frontier of
cyberspace, the future of the entertainment business. ``We're on
the verge of a boom,'' he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   At 22, Fong is the first (and perhaps only) professional gamer
who earns a living through his skills at electronic games. To the
uninitiated, he seems like the kind of fellow you can bring home
toyour mother _ soft-spoken yet ambitious, confident yet
exceedingly polite. But to thousands of youngsters in the post-Pong
generation, he's simply Thresh, the legendary champion of the
popular shoot-'em-up computer game Quake. He has racked up $250,000
in competition prizes and product endorsements and has been
immortalized with his own trading card. And now he's just launched
an online venture called Gamers.com, an Internet portal for gaming
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The way Fong sees it, the gaming phenomenon has moved out of the
basement and into the mainstream. ``It's becoming less of a geek
and nerd thing and more of a hip and cool thing,'' says Fong, who
lives and works in Berkeley, Calif. ``It's shed the image of the
pasty white kids in the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong, of course, is a self-appointed evangelist for the gaming
industry, but he has numbers to back up his missionary zeal. In
1998, sales of video games hit $6.3 billion, not far behind the
box-office take of the $6.7 billion film industry; this year, the
fast-growing gaming industry rivals Hollywood. According to
Forrester Research Inc., some 14 million users play computer games
on the Internet, a figure that is expected to grow to 32 million by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   As the online gaming industry grows, it is spawning its own
mythology, its own subset of superheroes. Fong is famous for his
swift wrist and his uncanny mental dexterity (known as ``Thresh
ESP''), and competitors still marvel about the time he won the red
Ferrari, the grand prize in a 1997 competition. He's frequently
referred to as the Michael Jordan of gaming, but the soft-spoken
young man seems determined not to bask in his own hype. ``He is the
epitome of the serious player, but he is not an egotistical,
arrogant jerk who goes around saying how great he is,'' says John
Carmack, the co-founder of id Software, who has idol status himself
as the developer of Quake. ``You hear a lot of bragging _ that's
the style of the game _ but Dennis is humble, even though he's the
best player around.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong certainly doesn't flaunt his status as a subculture
celebrity, but he does use his position to defend computer games
like Quake and Doom, contests in which players blast each other to
oblivion in post-apocalyptic virtual environments. Some critics
contend that virtual violence can lead to real rage, particularly
after last year's murderous rampage in Littleton, Colo. ``I have
never seen a single fight break out in this community,'' says Fong,
who points out that other cultural influences were blamed for the
tragedy, including films, heavy metal music, and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry's role model, he's on a personal mission to
dispel negative stereotypes. ``People expect me to be some
whacked-out dude with long hair and tattoos, but I'm just a normal
looking, peaceful guy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And in an age in which regular folks can become instant Internet
cult figures, Fong is just another normal American entrepreneur. Of
course, this regular fellow could have retired at 21 _ if he had
taken the buyout offers he received for GX Media, the parent
company of gamers.com. ``It's not about money; I really want to
build something,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fong admits he's always been competitive by nature. Born in Hong
Kong and raised in Los Altos, Calif., he first discovered online
multiplayer computer games when he was about 15 or 16. His brothers
initially whooped him at the keyboard, but eventually, Fong
developed the quickest wrist in the West. He briefly attended a
local community college but dropped out to pursue professional
gaming. His parents initially objected _ until he won the Ferrari,
that is. At that point, they realized he just might have a future
in this thing called gaming.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not alone. A San Francisco-based organization called
the Professional Gaming League is trying to create a professional
arena computer games: Fong is the nascent league's brightest star.
He likens himself to Babe Ruth in the early days of baseball and
predicts that the league will some day be a new national pasttime.
The ``sport'' does have a unique appeal: Players can participate
from any computer anywhere in the world, making competitions truly
global. But it also has its problems; the games may be exciting to
play, but they're not exactly thrilling for spectators.
``Professional gaming does have its challenges, and I guess the
jury is still out,'' says Garth Chouteau, press secretary for the
league. ``It will evolve and get bigger, but it's a question of how
much bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that amateur gaming is booming. Since
Fong made his speech in Monaco in October, major Internet companies
have embraced gaming in a big way. Lycos bought the Watertown-based
Gamesville.com for $207 million, and America Online signed a deal
to run an online game channel. Meanwhile, Fong introduced
gamers.com, which he describes as the ``first portal for the gaming
community.''
</P>
<P>
   And that ``community'' takes itself very seriously. Within a few
days of the launch, one user complained on the site's message board
that ``Thresh and his merry band of Web site portal wannabes'' had
not, in fact, created the first games portal. Some came to praise
and others came to talk trash about the site's features. No one was
ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the way this game is played. Fong works 18 hours a
day on the venture, working toward the day that electronic games
will be as popular a leisure activity as, say, television. The
company has grown to employ more than 100 people; Fong considers
himself acting president, but really prefers the title of Chief
Gamer. He's currently looking for a management team to run the
day-to-day operations. ``People come in and say, `Geez, you guys
are going to make so much money,' and I'm like, `No thank you,' ''
he says. ``They have to believe in our industry. They have to be
excited. They have to have passion.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Fong, he doesn't have much time to practice his passion
these days; he's too busy building the company. In his rare moments
of spare time, he's actually taken up golf. What? Golf? As in plaid
pants and polo shirts? As in totally uncool? ``There's a good
analogy in that,'' explains the entrepreneur. ``Golf has the
stereotype that your parents do it, like `God, you play golf? What
is wrong with you?' But Tiger Woods changed that, and now it is a
cool thing. That's what I see happening with the gaming industry.
It all comes down to the hip and cool thing. Once people see the
professional gaming industry as being cool, it's going to
explode.''

   A Radio That Can Travel Into the Wilderness
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's new 6000 series of Talkabout two-way radios are the
SUVs of talk. The series offers all the features of Motorola's
previous two-way radios _ 14 channels on the public Radio Service
band, 38 privacy codes and a range of up to two miles. The new
radios also have a clock with a stopwatch and an alarm, FM stereo
radio, a headset, channel scanning (so that you can quickly find
your partner with the other radio) and channel scrambling (so that
no one can listen in on your conversation).
</P>
<P>
   But extra features take these new two-way phones, priced between
$129 and $179 each, out of the mall and into the wilderness, or
maybe into a bigger mall. The radios also pack a digital compass, a
thermometer and a barometer. There's even an altimeter for treks
through the Himalayas or to the food court.

   Accompanying a Robot on an Antarctic Quest &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nomad, the very otherworldly robot that is currently searching
Antarctica for meteorites, is sharing its discoveries on the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nomad, a car-size robot on wheels, is being judged as a form of
intelligent life by how it searches for another form of life.
</P>
<P>
   Every year during the brief Antarctic summer, scientists hunt
for meteorites that are preserved in the continent's glaciers. One
theory says that a meteorite from Mars that was discovered in 1984
bears evidence of primitive microscopic life.
</P>
<P>
   Nomad's job is to identify meteorites by using its robot arms
and a mounted spectrometer, distinguishing them from ordinary
rocks. That is something no robot has previously accomplished.
Nomad, which was created at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie
Mellon University, began its mission Jan. 17 and enjoyed success in
its first week in the field. It has since identified five
meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   The site www.bigsignal.net reports on the Nomad's progress,
offering pictures of samples, data and 360-degree views from a
camera mounted on the robot.

   Now, A Few Words From Friends and Sponsors
</P>
<P>
   If you are one of the few people on this planet who has never
received an advertisement via e-mail, just wait.
</P>
<P>
   A string of new Internet companies have developed e-mail
technology that enables your friends to include advertisements in
their correspondence and earn commissions on any purchases you
might be swayed to make.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemic.com, one of the new companies, calls it ``staking your
claim in e-commerce.'' The companies include Favemail, SuperSig.com
and Tomeo.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the companies provide users with tools to create
banners that will show up in the text of their messages. The
banners open Web sites when clicked upon; typically they work like
affiliate programs that give Web-page developers a cut of the
revenue when a visitor buys something from, say, Amazon.com after
clicking on an Amazon.com link.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Wanser, chief executive of Epidemic.com, described the
concept as ``more than just advertising.'' As an example, she said,
``it will be a big opportunity for people who are trying to do
charity fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Catlett, founder of an anti-junk-mail organization called
Junkbusters, is more critical. ``Is that what friends are for?'' he
said. ``As a marketing channel?''
</P>
<P>
   Catlett said he considered e-mail banners an example of
advertising's unhealthy intrusion into daily life. ``If a friend of
mine sent me a letter from Barbados saying `Wish you were here' and
enclosed a coupon for carpet cleaning,'' he said, ``I couldn't help
wondering about the quality of our relationship.'' _ Lisa Guernsey
</P>
<P>
   Dressing Up Your E-Mail By Putting In Some Emotion
</P>
<P>
   For all its utility, e-mail is not an emotional form of
communication. Expressions of deep feeling are pretty much
restricted to emoticons (the ``:)'' happy face, for example),
capital letters (``Don't show this message to ANYONE''), elaborate
punctuation (``didn't you get my message!!!??!!!) or some
combination of all three (``STELLA!!!!!:('').
</P>
<P>
   Altec Lansing has developed an easier method, one that allows
you to throw your voice across the Internet. The VoicePod is a
small USB-enabled voice recorder and player that allows users to
record small voice messages that can then be attached to e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   After downloading the software, the user depresses the Record
button on the VoicePod, speaks his or her mind, then clicks on the
screen to save the recorded message as a WAV file on the desktop.
The user can then drag and drop the file into an e-mail message and
send instructions, protestations or just a blood-curdling scream to
everyone in the recipient list. The VoicePod, which sells for $149,
is compatible with Windows applications and popular e-mail programs
like Eudora.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use the three speakers in the VoicePod device to
listen to the voices full of pleading, anger and exasperation that
are attached to your incoming messages. Isn't that why people
turned to e-mail in the first place?
</P>

   At Work, the Computer Is Play (Then Can Help Find a New Job)
</P>
<P>
   Solitaire is no longer the only game in town for employees
killing time at work.
</P>
<P>
   What occupies workers who have access to company computers these
days ranges from the mundane to the risque.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey commissioned by Pogo.com, an online games service,
found that Web surfing, online job hunting and market watching are
some of the more predictable downtime pursuits. A small portion of
those 1,000 Internet users surveyed, however, are using their
breaks to look for romance and to download pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found the following: 42 percent of employees surf the
Web during their breaks; 21 percent play games online; 16 percent
are planning vacations; 16 percent are checking on their money and
investments; 9 percent are job hunting; 6 percent are looking for
new places to live; 3 percent are looking for new romances; 2
percent download pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found some differences between the sexes. Men
were almost twice as likely as women to surf with no particular
objective, more than twice as likely to use the office computer to
look for a new job and 20 times as likely to download pornography.

DOUBLECLICK'S DOUBLE CROSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I try to avoid repeating myself, but some topics rate a double
dose of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, I wrote in a semijocular vein about an
Internet advertising firm called DoubleClick Inc. that planned to
deploy a new system for tracking the on-line activities of millions
of Web surfers. Now I learn that its system has been activated, and
I'm not smiling anymore.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, businesses have long tracked our Web activities with
the aid of cookies _ little identifiers that are stored on your
computer and read by the Web sites you visit. Cookies let you go
to, say, The New York Times Web site every day without having to
reenter your password. But the cookie doesn't tell The New York
Times computer who you are. It recognizes your browser, not the
individual sitting in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick distributes Internet advertisements and cookies on
about 1,500 popular Web sites, including those run by Wired Online
and the AltaVista search service. Millions of us have DoubleClick
cookies squirreled away on our browsers. No problem _ until
DoubleClick this month began linking their cookies to people's
names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to be a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   If you think Regis Philbin's questions are easy, check out
Netdeals.com. This site just asks for your name and address in its
million-dollar giveaway contest. Your chances of winning are
minimal, of course. But DoubleClick wins every time someone enters.
They've got a deal going with Netdeals and a number of other sites.
Netdeals provides your personal data to DoubleClick and links it to
a cookie on your machine. Whenever you visit any other DoubleClick
site, they'll know it's you. And they'll track the pages you read
and how long you stay there, in an effort to build a personality
profile they can use to sell you stuff.
</P>
<P>
   All this is buried in a mass of small-print legalese at the base
of the Netdeals Web site, which allows the DoubleClickers to say
that the information is all provided voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want DoubleClick looking over your shoulder, the
company lets you ``opt out.'' But the opt-out page is buried so
deep on the DoubleClick site that its Web address is a good six
inches long. Make it easy on yourself: Go to opt-out.cdt.org, where
you will find instructions on how to get off DoubleClick's list.
</P>
<P>
   When DoubleClick was founded, its privacy policy said the
company would not track individuals. Now, they promise that they'll
stop tracking you _ if you ask nicely. Somehow I don't think their
word is worth a whole lot. Better to put your faith in technology.
</P>
<P>
   I've long used Jason Catlett's Internet Junkbuster to filter out
smutty Web ads. The same free software can also be set up to block
all cookies, or just the ones coming from doubleclick.net. Get a
copy at www.junkbusters.com. But be prepared for a bit of
tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   For the average user with a few dollars to spend, there are
simpler choices:
</P>
<P>
   --At www.kburra.com, you'll find Cookie Pal, a $15 program that
you can try out for free for 30 days. It can notify you of incoming
cookies, and let you block them all, or you can easily list
individual cookies that are unwelcome _ from doubleclick.net, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   --You can pay $20 for InterMute (www.intermute.com), a more
sophisticated product made in Braintree, Mass. Intermute blocks
ads, animated images, and music, as well as the cookies of your
choice.Please be sure to block doubleclick.net.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I am hammering these guys. I hate it when greedheads spoil
a good idea, just so they can park a couple more Porsches in the
garage. Cookies are a clever way for honest merchants to
personalize their Web pages without invading their customers'
privacy. If DoubleClick succeeds in perverting the concept,
consumers and merchants alike will suffer, as more people start
refusing all cookies for the sake of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   I'm more selective. I'm just going to ban DoubleClick from every
computer I own, and urge other Web sites to stop hosting
DoubleClick's intolerably nosy cookies. If you value your privacy,
you'll do the same.

GENE PROJECT YIELDS SPINOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stuart Firestein is a biology professor who says he has a poor
sense of smell. But that has not stopped Firestein from becoming a
leading expert in the neurobiology of olfaction _ the science of
smelling. Nor has it stopped him from joining the corporate
advisory board of DigiScents, a privately held company dedicated to
bringing smells to computer games, Web pages and even movies.
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents, based in Oakland, Calif., was founded a year ago by
Dexster Smith and Joel L. Bellenson, co-founders of DoubleTwist, a
biotechnology company whose gene-sequencing software is used by
Columbia University's biology department, where Firestein teaches.
</P>
<P>
   The company is creating a digital language for recording,
re-creating and transmitting fragrances, and is also preparing to
sell a small computer peripheral device, called the iSmell, that
would act as a personal scent synthesizer. When the device becomes
commercially available later this year, users will be able to
activate different combinations of chemicals on a scent palette, or
cartridge, to produce particular scents. Each palette will contain
more than 100 fragrances, each about as strong as an air freshener,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents officials say that just about any digital medium can
be fragrance enhanced in this manner. The company is also building
a registry of thousands of scents that developers can license.
</P>
<P>
   Recent olfactory research, combined with work on the
international Human Genome Project, has brought rapid advances,
Firestein said. (Of the more than 100,000 genes in human DNA, about
1,000 have something to do with the nose.)
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents is ``ideally positioned to work with the sort of
information that's about to pour out of the genome project,''
Firestein said.
</P>
<P>
   Firestein, who is periodically consulted by perfume companies as
well, acknowledges that adding scents to entertainment products
would not have been his first choice for commercializing olfactory
research, but he is enthusiastic nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little more of a stick in the mud,'' Firestein said,
referring to the DigiScents executive team. ``But I've always
suspected that smelling is an undiscovered pleasure.''

(DW) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The museum world's proven standbys _ exhibitions on
Impressionism, Egyptian art, Picasso and most of all van Gogh _
lured record numbers of people into American art museums last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest blockbuster in years, 821,004 people went to the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art to see ``Van Gogh's van Goghs,'' a
show drawn from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam; 473,234 went to
``Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids'' at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, the second most popular show and a more typical
tally for a big exhibition. Nine other exhibitions around the
country attracted crowds of more than 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating again that nothing succeeds like success, the
attendance numbers _ which come from an annual survey of museum
attendance compiled by the The Art Newspaper, a London-based
international monthly _ show another trend: like television
networks hooked on copying the highest-rated shows, museums outside
traditional art centers like New York are increasingly boosting
their attendance with shows on those same popular themes,
especially Impressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Last year two traveling exhibitions, ``Impressionism From
European Museums'' and ``Monet at Giverny from the Musee
Marmottan,'' sent attendance skyward at the Seattle Art Museum, the
High Museum in Atlanta, the Denver Art Museum, the Albright-Knox
Art Gallery in Buffalo and the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. In
each case, museum officials said, the crowds set records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely pleased with the results of the
`Impressionism From European Museums' show,'' said Mimi Gardner
Gates, director of the Seattle museum. ``Getting 316,000 people was
really amazing.'' The museum's previous record was about 236,000
people for an exhibition of the Leonardo Codex in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Newspaper's attendance survey, while the most
comprehensive, has some flaws. Museums report their own attendance
numbers and use different counting methods. Some sell individual
tickets for special exhibitions; others station guards with
clickers at exhibition entrances to count those who enter. A few,
like the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, count all people who enter
and assume they are all going to the special show.
</P>
<P>
   The length of special exhibitions varies from about two months
to, in a few cases, a year, also affecting attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers show that museums are getting better at marketing,
often with support from a local visitors' bureau that helps
organize tourism promotions around exhibitions, including hotel
packages and events at other cultural institutions. Some also
contribute financial support for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases museums are creating their own razzle-dazzle, even
by remaining open through the night.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Gates said, people were undoubtedly interested in
pictures by Cezanne, Monet, Manet, Renoir and van Gogh that were
new to them. ``But,'' she added, ``the fact that we stayed open on
the last weekend from 9 a.m. on Saturday until midnight on Sunday,
that made it an event. It was good marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles museum also kept its doors open around the clock
in the closing days of the van Gogh show, and the Museum of Fine
Arts in Boston did the same for a John Singer Sargent
retrospective, which drew 318,707 people.
</P>
<P>
   The other most popular exhibitions in 1999 were the same Sargent
show at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, with 453,937
visitors; ``Cezanne to Van Gogh: Dr. Gachet's Collection'' at the
Metropolitan Museum, 429,024; Louis Comfort Tiffany at the Met,
371,494; Juliao Sarmento at the Hirshhorn, 334,089; Jackson Pollock
at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, 329,330; ``From van Eyck
to Breugel'' at the Met, 318,741; and ``Picasso: Painter and
Sculptor in Clay'' at the Met, 316,943. (The exhibition of works by
Sarmento, a Portuguese painter, benefited from being on view for
four and a half months just as the reinstallation of the
Hirshhorn's permanent collection was opened to the public.)
</P>
<P>
   The statistics indicate an underlying trend of steady growth in
museum attendance. The number of shows in the United States that
attract more than 200,000 people has grown from 14 in 1996, to 18
in 1997, to 21 in 1998, to 31 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But for some museum officials, the statistics do have a
troubling aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at these numbers, you have the same things doing
well: 19th-century European painting like Impressionism, and
Sargent is related, antiquities, and that's it,'' said Brent R.
Benjamin, the director of the St. Louis Art Museum. ``This is a
real concern to museums because the number of people who come
through the door is only one measure of success. As important are
the experiences people have inside. If you're chasing numbers
alone, you have a narrow range of topics to choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great challenge for museums,'' he said, ``is to build an
audience for exhibitions that are not Impressionism or antiquities.
How do you take an artist like Boucher and make it a big draw?
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason museums like to do Impressionism and antiquities is
with them you can do both, you can have high-quality work and get a
lot of people, and you can teach them something.''

   If America Online completes its acquisition of Time Warner, a
one-year clock will immediately start ticking.
</P>
<P>
   America Online promised investors that in the first year as a
combined company, it would add an extra $1 billion in pretax
operating profits beyond the $10 billion total the companies would
have earned separately.
</P>
<P>
   It is a goal that will be tough to meet, since the two companies
have few overlapping operations, and the high-speed multimedia
Internet services they have promised are years away from becoming
commonplace. So where can they find an extra $1 billion so fast?
</P>
<P>
   The answer pops up, literally, virtually every time someone
signs onto America Online: in-your-face advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the first thing an America Online subscriber sees after
logging on _ before checking e-mail, before slinking off to a chat
room _ is an advertisement. And the ``No Thank You'' button that
gets rid of the ad is much tinier than the ``Buy Now'' and ``Tell
Me More'' buttons.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing advertising techniques to Time Warner's Web sites,
America Online promises that it can find much of that first $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the public credit for America Online's success has
gone to its ability to develop and market a service that appeals to
the masses, it has also done a better job than any other Internet
company in finding ways to cash in on that audience.
</P>
<P>
   From the first pop-up ad to tiny text links on obscure pages,
America Online has found more ways to sell more pieces of its
service than any other online company. And its ad sales force, now
more than 400 strong, is widely considered the toughest, most
aggressive team of deal makers in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those methods can or would be applied across Time Warner
sites like CNN.com and Time.com _ where journalistic convention
would dictate a church-state separation of content and advertising
_ remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online has long argued that the complete separation
of editorial content and advertising is not applicable online. New
media, they argue, call for integration of commerce and content _
sales of kitchen supplies, for example, woven into recipe sections.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, America Online executives are eager to grab Time
Warner's Internet sites _ which also include entertainment sites
for Warner Bros. and Warner Music _ and stoke them with the sales
strategies it has used so successfully with its other brands,
including CompuServe, Netscape and the ICQ chat service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year Time Warner sold $100 million in online
advertising,'' said Michael Kelly, America Online's chief financial
officer. ``We did more than that in our first 90 days of selling
ICQ.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online reported $352 million in revenue from advertising
and electronic commerce in the last three months of 1999, up 88
percent from a year earlier. By contrast, Yahoo, the distant No. 2
in online ads, posted total revenue of $201 million in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, of course, also benefits from its monthly
subscription fees, which brought in $1.1 billion in the most recent
quarter. Moreover, America Online says it now has a backlog of $2.4
billion worth of advertising contracts scheduled to run over the
next several years.
</P>
<P>
   For advertisers, the merger of America Online and Time Warner
would be a mixed blessing. Many of them write big checks to America
Online because of its huge audience and its creativity in placing
ads. But the online giant has also built up a reputation as one of
the hardest companies on the Internet to deal with. And client
companies often accuse it of being aggressive, even arrogant, in
its deal making.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, America Online sold Barnes &AMP; Noble the
right to be the exclusive bookstore on its flagship service,
America Online. Then it sold Amazon.com the exclusive right to sell
books on AOL.com, the Web site that America Online members pass
through on their way to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although America Online says it now tries to sell all of its
properties in a single package, stories like that still abound _
mostly told by people who insist that their names not be used,
because they are still beholden to the online giant for much of
their own sites' traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is the 800-pound gorilla _ they know that, and they act
like it,'' said the chief executive of a company that bought an
``anchor tenant'' position on America Online's shopping mall for
this past holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of another rapidly growing online merchant
said America Online had tried to modify an advertising agreement
just a few months after signing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back to us and said they were going to tear up the
deal and start over,'' the executive said. ``Our category was
hotter than they had thought, and they wanted more money.'' The
executive said that when he pointed out there was a signed
contract, America Online executives had responded, ``So sue us.''
</P>
<P>
   Myer Berlow, the president of America Online's interactive
marketing unit, insists that the company is neither arrogant nor
duplicitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be 800 pounds, but I hope we're guerrillas with an `e'
_ not gorillas,'' he said. ``I don't want an attitude in our group
that we don't have to try harder, because we're No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the online retailer who said America Online reneged on
the newly signed contract, Berlow said he did not know the
specifics. But he speculated that a portion of America Online's
service had been redesigned before a contract based on the old
design had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might go back to a partner that had a 12-month deal and say
we want to cut it off or renew it,'' he said. ``But we would give
credit for whatever they had left. In no case did we not honor our
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlow said America Online's preferred role was not that of a
seller of simple banner advertisements _ although it sells a lot of
them _ but that of proprietor of an online mall. Indeed, the
company pioneered the now widely copied business model in which it
charges online merchants an up-front ``rent'' for placement on its
service and also takes a percentage of each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   For many merchants, this model has proved quite lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiating a deal was difficult and expensive, and there were
several changes of strategy on the fly,'' said Tim Harrington, the
chief executive of FogDog Sports, another anchor tenant in the
shopping channel. ``But once you have a deal done, they are great
partners to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, America Online's staff helped FogDog find new
customers with a promotion offering certain items for $1 _ a pitch
that was displayed on the service's welcome screen. By contrast, he
said FogDog had tepid results advertising on Time Warner's
cnnsi.com sports site.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have people who want to check the scores for the Golden
State Warriors, not buy Air Jordans,'' he said of the Time Warner
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many advertisers say that while their dealings with Time
Warner's various sites have not been as contentious as those with
America Online, they have not been as effective, either.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Time Warner's ad sales efforts, like the rest of its Internet
operations, have been spread through its sprawling and
decentralized empire. The most troubled has been the Time Inc.
magazine group, which has been as unsuccessful in selling online
advertising as the group's defunct Pathfinder site was in
attracting an audience.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Turner television unit has been more effective,
advertisers say, in part because the CNN.com Web site has attracted
a steady audience. Moreover, the Turner unit has found ways to get
its television sales force to sell Internet ads at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge, however, may arise over Time Warner's
longstanding tradition of maintaining strict separation between its
advertising and editorial departments.
</P>
<P>
   One former Time Warner executive predicted: ``There is going to
be a major clash over the church-and-state issue. At AOL, the look
and feel of the product is controlled by the people selling
advertising. At Time Warner, it's driven by the editors, who are
thinking of the end user.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sacks, a former newspaper reporter and magazine
publisher who is general manager of the America Online flagship
service, says his staff can and does rebuff undue influence from
the advertising sales department, but says the issues are different
from those in traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks said that America Online's staff of several dozen editors,
who choose articles for its news and finance sections, operates
with the same independence as traditional journalists. But he said
that on America Online, as on a television network, non-news
programming is subject to different rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bond of trust between a journalistic enterprise and
its audience that is its fundamental value proposition,'' Sacks
said. ``On the AOL service, we make no illusion of a bond of trust,
except in those areas where there is pure journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as Time Warner has experimented with the Internet, it
too has used some aggressive advertising vehicles, not all of which
conform to its magazines' practices. A travel agent, for example,
paid for a link to its reservation services from the travel news
page of its CNNfn.com site.
</P>
<P>
   And the Time.com and Fortune.com sites use pop-up windows, much
like America Online's, to sell subscriptions to the magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Bressler, head of Time-Warner's Internet activities,
said the combined company would be true to Time's long heritage of
respecting the distinction between advertising and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we step up the use of Time Warner content on America Online
sites, if it is going to be appealing to America Online users it's
because of the integrity it has,'' he said. ``I expect that will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, people who know both Time Warner and America Online, say
that the inevitable battles over culture that exist in any merger
will likely break out first in the advertising sales area, because
the two firms are so different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner, like many large corporations, has an implied code
of civility,'' said Linda E. McCutcheon, former president of Time
Inc. New Media and currently chief executive of Internet Tradeline.
``At AOL, civility is frowned upon. It's like the bar scene in
`Star Wars': Everyone is a character, and a tough one.''
</P>
<P>
   To Robert W. Pittman, America Online's president and one of the
team responsible for finding that $1 billion in new first-year
income, being tough is just part of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sure don't give away our space,'' he said. ``But I haven't
found an advertiser who wants to give us extra money either.''

STRONG CAST CAN'T SAVE SHEPARD'S `SIMPATICO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a certain poignancy to ``Simpatico,'' based upon Sam
Shepard's 1994 play, if only because it, like its characters, is
mired in the past _ stuck in a rut it cannot escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simpatico'' is one of the recent works from the playwright's
career, which was prolific in the 1960s and '70s but has dwindled
to near-dormancy in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   And, as has been the case with most of Shepard's plays, transfer
to the movies spells doom. Except for a television production of
``True West,'' his work has proven too non-linear and internalized
for the screen. It needs interaction with audience energy to pulse
to life. Think of Robert Altman's ``Fool for Love,'' starring
Shepard and Kim Basinger. It was a excruciating fiasco of a film
despite the fact it had been a successful Shepard play.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Simpatico'' opened at the Public Theatre in New York, it
received tepid reviews, with critics calling it ``rambling'' and
``lazy'' despite a cast that included Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Beverly
D'Angelo and Marcia Gay Harden.
</P>
<P>
   It contained many of the usual Shepard traits _ a woman riding
away on horseback (like Patricia Arquette in Shepard's directorial
debut ``Far North''), rough-and-tumble men caught in a snare of
one-upmanship, identity transference and a ton of human dysfunction
and betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simpatico,'' which seems like a compilation of other Shepard
plays, is set in the dry Southern California towns of Cucamonga and
Azusa where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Director Matthew Warchus' film cast is as strong as that of the
stage production: Jeff Bridges is Carter, a millionaire from
Lexington, Ky., who is obsessed with horses; Sharon Stone is his
wife, Rosie, who holds the key to the secret of her husband's
success and his continued prickly relationship with the drunken
Vinnie (Nick Nolte), their childhood friend.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years earlier, the trio concocted a scam to get rich
quick. They'd switch slow horses for fast ones and bet on the high
odds. But the racing commissioner Simms (Albert Finney) caught on
and they resorted to a scheme to blackmail him and ruin his career
_ using Rosie as bait.
</P>
<P>
   The film exposes present lives of its characters _ including
Vinnie's girlfriend Cecilia (a wasted, if vibrant, Catherine
Keener) _ and the pasts through flashbacks. While Warchus somehow
manages to bring the work together for a climactic finale, it takes
far too long to get there and rambles incoherently in the interim.
Who knows why any of these characters do what they do or why they
retain such bonds of loyalty to the people who have ruined their
lives?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the film, like the story, is enigmatic and messy and
circles in on itself until there is nowhere to go. John Toll's
(``The Thin Red Line,'' ``Braveheart'') moody cinematography
contributes suitable atmosphere and the actors labor valiantly to
make something of the script.
</P>
<P>
   But they, too, are done in by the fact movies are no place for
Shepard's writing. The actors are as betrayed by the playwright's
romantic myth of tortured, loner antiheroes as their onscreen
characters are by their pasts.
</P>
<P>
   Simpatico. Directed by Matthew Warchus. Written by Warchus,
David Nicholls. Cast: Nick Nolte, Jeff Bridges, Sharon Stone,
Catherine Keener, Albert Finney. Fine Line Features. 106 minutes.
Rated R for language, sexual content.

Thursday, Feb. 3, sent to computer graphics clients of The New York

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A swath of light snow will accompany a fast-moving disturbance
Thursday as it traverses from Michigan to the Maryland coast. The
snow, generally an inch or two, will fall in a 100 mile-wide band
from the central Great Lakes to southern New England, just to the
north of the path of the storm. Usually, these ``Alberta clippers''
are well behaved, however the pitfalls of this forecast are related
to the intensity of the low-pressure system. There are indications
that the disturbance is stronger than computer guidance which would
lead to either a wider swath of snow or more likely, embedded
heavier accumulation, perhaps 4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Much of New England will notice increasing clouds as low
pressure approaches. Snow should reach coastal sections during the
afternoon. Hazardous travel is expected from the Great Lakes across
the northern Ohio Valley and into northern Pennsylvania and
southern New York. Coastal cities from Baltimore to New York may
have a burst of snow during the evening rush.
</P>
<P>
   The South will be bright and cool as high pressure glides east
across the Gulf States. Lingering low pressure near south Texas
will sponsor clouds and drizzle. Brisk and chilly weather will
dominate the upper Plains with high pressure building southward
from Alberta. Light snow will dust the east slopes of the northern
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A large storm near the northern California coast will send a
spoke of clouds and showers onshore by afternoon. Periods of rain
will spread across the central part of the state by nightfall. The
Northwest will see broken clouds and mild readings.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Weather Folklore
</P>
<P>
   Not all weather folklore is created equal. Early Tuesday, an old
and famous bit of weather folklore was celebrated when a groundhog
named Phil was pulled from a burrow in Punxsutawney, Pa. The animal
cast a shadow and his handlers proclaimed that six more weeks of
winter would follow. While this charming folklore has no scientific
support, much weather lore has a valid foundation. Many of the
weather rhymes that have been passed down through generations began
when careful observers of the sky related what they saw to the
typical weather patterns that followed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The nonfiction sports book is not a genre that has traditionally
produced much literature or many best sellers, so it's surprising
that in the past month some of the biggest action in book
publishing has been in the biographies or memoirs of figures from
actual sports or of bulked-up actors in fake athletic contests.
Which makes particularly interesting the news that Roger Angell,
arguably the most elegant of baseball writers, is going to conduct
a sort of Socratic dialogue with the New York Yankees pitcher David
Cone, perhaps the most cerebral of baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   Sports as a metaphor for life has been one of the great cliches
of the more robust gathering of intellectuals. Writers like
Hemingway (bullfighting), A.J. Leibling (boxing), John Updike
(golf), Norman Mailer (boxing), George Will (baseball), David
Remnick (boxing) and David Halberstam (everything) as well as
Angell have been able to turn sports nonfiction into, if not
exactly literature, lofty stuff that often comes close to art.
</P>
<P>
   More enduring is sports fiction, and most of it is about what
seems to be the intellectual's favorite game, baseball, which has
inspired at least three exceptionable works of fiction: Lardner's
``You Know Me, Al,'' Malamud's ``Natural'' and Mark Harris' ``Bang
the Drum Slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the potential of serious writing about what are
really children's games, this is mostly a genre of books so
slapdash that they have often gone unread even by their alleged
authors. Several years ago, Darryl Strawberry, the baseball player,
admitted that he had never even heard of some of the subjects he
supposedly talked about in his autobiography. And Charles Barkley,
the basketball star, said he found his published autobiography
``very interesting'' once he finally got around to reading it,
although he claimed it misquoted him.
</P>
<P>
   This will not be the case with Cone, who Angell described the
other day as ``a ferocious competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Angell said: ``He is an adult, a grown-up who handles the media
and other adversities with absolute aplomb. The writers come to him
after a game, and he is the blue-collar spokesman for this
extremely successful bunch of players, who hold him in awe, and he
sounds like a spokesman for the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Angell, a writer and editor for The New Yorker, received a high
six-figure advance from Warner Books for a book that will be not a
biography or a ``by Dave Cone written with Roger Angell''
autobiography, but rather a book  &UR; by &LR;  the author  &UR; about &LR;  the
ballplayer to be published in the spring of 2001. Angell said he
hadn't worked out the format yet, but that in some way it would be
a book of two guys, both insiders in a different way, talking about
baseball, the art and science of the game. For instance, what is
Cone thinking about when he is setting batters with a sequence of
pitches? How does he pace himself? It will be a discussion of other
subjects as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's career has spanned being one of the wild bunch of New
York Mets _ a group accused of various misdeeds, sexual and
otherwise, with the money and the time to carry them out _ to his
emergence as a mature, thoughtful man, one of the top dozen
pitchers of the last decade, who overcame an aneurysm in his
pitching shoulder in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Angell said: ``Where did these qualities come from? This is an
adult, a grown-up, who is extremely aggressive on the mound yet off
the field is approachable and friendly and a spokesman. I don't
know what kind of book it will be, but we trust each other to see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Wolff, an executive editor at Warner Books, who bought the
Angell-Cone book, is publishing the story of Sammy Sosa, the
Chicago Cubs home run hitter, in May with a more traditional
autobiography format, with Marcos Breton as author. Wolff said he
was trying hard to give the enterprise literary body English.
``It's inspirational, not just sports,'' he said. ``It's hard to
believe the crushing poverty and other obstacles Sosa had to
transcend to get to the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspirational and/or motivational are what editors want in
sports books, to try to break out with a wider readership than just
regional fans.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, the Yankees shortstop, has a two-book deal with
Crown for a reported $600,000 advance. The first, titled ``The Life
You Imagine,'' will be by the ballplayer and his father, Dr.
Charles Jeter, a psychiatrist. Steve Ross, Crown's editor in chief,
described it as ``a sort of motivational, inspirational book about
identifying your dreams and them creating a viable working plan to
step by step achieve them.'' The second book will be, well, a
sports book. Bob Costas, the broadcaster, will have a different
twist; he will dissect major league baseball in a book for Broadway
to be published in April.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list includes two
other, less inspirational sports books, David Maraniss' ``When
Pride Still Mattered'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), the biography of the
football coach Vince Lombardi, sort of the patron saint of
motivators, and ``Hurricane'' (Houghton Mifflin), James S. Hirsch's
book (one of the sources for a recent movie) about the boxer
Hurricane Carter, who was convicted of murder and spent 30 years in
prison before being exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   But the list also records the successes of fantasy, some of it
literary, like the three Harry Potter books on the fiction side,
and some of it the brazen make-believe of simulated violence in
which, except for an occasional accident, no one gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing is a business of the moment, and for now the most
important letter in book publishing is W. It stands for witchcraft
and wrestling. No. 1 on the nonfiction list for Feb. 13 is ``The
Rock Says . . .'' (ReganBooks/HarperCollins) by the Rock with Joe
Layden, a memoir of the professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson, and
No. 4 is ``Have A Nice Day!,'' from the same imprint, by Mick
Foley, the autobiography of the wrestler known as Mankind. Don't
worry if you get through those two quickly. There's more on the
way. Coming soon from Crown is a book in which Goldberg will
discuss how his matches are scripted.

</P>
<P>
   By now everyone has something to say about whether 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez should return to Cuba or remain in Florida. But what
does our opinion have to say about us?
</P>
<P>
   If you think he should go back to Cuba are you un-American?
Worse, are you pro-Castro?
</P>
<P>
   But are you anti-family if you would rather see him stay with
his great-uncle and other brand new relatives than be with his
natural father?
</P>
<P>
   Are you being an American elitist if you argue that any child is
better off living here than under Communism? But are you being
indifferent if you insist he go back to living under Communism?
</P>
<P>
   If you think he could still have a nice life in Cuba are you
hopelessly naive about what life is really like there?
</P>
<P>
   This political soap opera, which started out as a miraculous
survival story, has been running since November. Each new
development brings more questions than answers. As it drags on, the
dialogue becomes skewed, depending on how you feel about everything
from old Cold War politics to Disney World. It also encourages us
to get involved in something we don't know a whole lot about.
</P>
<P>
   Who do you think loved him most? His mother who was willing to
risk her life and his to get them out of Cuba and into the land of
freedom? Or his father who wants him home with him?
</P>
<P>
   Was the mother pressured into getting into that boat? Was she
dominated by the politics of her boyfriend, now dead along with
her? Do you believe Elian's grandmother's take on the boyfriend or
the boyfriend's family?
</P>
<P>
   Do you trust the grandmothers' tears? Do you think they were
coached by Castro agents?
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there is the boy.
</P>
<P>
   He has tasted liberty, says his great uncle. What does that
taste like? Like a puppy and cotton candy? Is that being cynical?
</P>
<P>
   Do you think a 6-year-old knows what he wants? Do you think he
would dare say?
</P>
<P>
   If you were 6 would you rather have some new great toys or get
to play with your old friends?
</P>
<P>
   If you suddenly lost your mother, who would you most want to be
with? And would you care where he or she lived?
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Elian can distinguish between what's democracy and
what's Disney World?
</P>
<P>
   Elian, from what any of us can tell, would make a fine addition
to America. He seems charming and bright. But what about all the
other little kids who would also make fine new Americans?
</P>
<P>
   If you wish Americans would be as kind and loving to desperate
people who sneak over the border from Mexico to pick tomatoes in
California, are you confusing the issue?
</P>
<P>
   Do you wonder how compelling Elian's story would be if he were
Mexican?
</P>
<P>
   Even closer to home, do you wonder where the compassion is for
children in our town who don't have a home anywhere? What about a
break for the kids who can't get to second grade consistently
because they move from motels to cars to shelters?
</P>
<P>
   What about unaccompanied minors who escape to America to end up
in detention homes?
</P>
<P>
   Have you been remembering the story about the boatload of Jews
trying to escape Hitler who were forbidden to land in Florida? Is
that mixing apples and papayas? The political weight of this story
has become so confused with the personal that it's impossible to
separate them. What do we fix first, a diplomatic nightmare or a
little boy's?
</P>
<P>
   Who has the most to gain from how this story ends? Janet Reno or
the activists in Little Havana? Whose job is on the line? Some
future president or the INS commissioner?
</P>
<P>
   What affect will this have on how we treat people who show up in
the belly of cargo ships?
</P>
<P>
   Will we now make it easier for children who are war refugees,
whose parents sell them into prostitution and whose parents are
dead from AIDS to find a new life in the United States? Can we
quickly make them honorary citizens?
</P>
<P>
   Where does Elian have a better chance of being a normal little
kid? If he stays here, will the media leave him alone? If he goes
home, will he have to march in a parade?
</P>
<P>
   Does the Cuban government have the child's best interests at
heart?
</P>
<P>
   Does ours?
</P>
<P>
   If you suggested that President Clinton take him by the hand and
return him to his father and then walk into Castro's office and
start to normalize relations, would they call you a dreamer?

NEW DEAL GIVES WOMEN PARITY IN PAY AND FULL-TIME STATUS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an agreement that for the first time creates salary parity
between the American men's and women's national soccer teams, the
U.S. Soccer Federation and the women's team formally announced
Tuesday a new five-year contract on which they reached agreement
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The pact will also significantly increase the players' earning
potential and provide some long-term assurances for younger
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they win, the more they get,'' Dr. S. Robert
Contiguglia, president of the soccer federation, the sport's
governing body, said during a news conference Tuesday at the
Official All Star Cafe in Manhattan. ``This agreement allows our
women athletes to remain full-time professional athletes playing
soccer and devoted to winning forever, which is our motto.''
</P>
<P>
   The new contract will pay veteran players a minimum of $5,000 a
month through September as they prepare for the 2000 Olympic Games
in Sydney, Australia. Newer players will receive $3,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary provisions are on the same level as for the men.
``We all have had an affect on each other,'' Mia Hamm, the women's
star forward and one of the negotiators, said of the men's and
women's salary scales. Then she added a tribute to a women's
pioneer in another sport: ``If not for Billie Jean King setting out
to get equal pay for women's tennis, we probably wouldn't have had
the courage to do what we did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Each player will also receive a $2,000 appearance fee for each
of the 27 preparatory matches leading to the Olympics, and a $1,000
bonus for each victory. Players will make more money depending on
how they finish in the medal round of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was approved by the 20 members of the team that won
the 1999 Women's World Cup during a conference call last Friday.
The team boycotted a recent tournament in Australia after rejecting
the federation's offer of $3,150 a month for each player. The women
were demanding what they ultimately got.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through this entire process, the one thing we all learned is
that, for us to get where we want to be, we all have to do it
together,'' Hamm said. ``The U.S. national team can't succeed
without U.S. Soccer, and U.S. Soccer can't be as strong as it wants
to be without the national team.''
</P>
<P>
   Carla Overbeck, the team captain, said the group's determination
was fortified when younger players who had replaced them in the
Australian tournament decided to side with the veterans, agreeing
not to play until a contract was signed. ``They knew what was going
on and realized it was their future we were fighting for,''
Overbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract contains a severance package of three months'
pay for players who do not make the team, a provision Hamm said she
had fought for.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm said the two sides plan to meet next week to discuss a
business plan for a professional league. She said the players have
already begun talking privately about forming a union.

FINALLY REVIVING A PLAY THAT AMUSED THE SUN KING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A play that carries the names of both Moliere and
Corneille might seem a likely candidate for posterity, above all
here, where the Comedie Francaise was created largely to perpetuate
the legacies of the two playwrights and their colleague-cum-rival
Racine. Yet until this winter ``Psyche'' had not been staged since
1671, when it had its premiere before Louis XIV.
</P>
<P>
   True, no less than Shakespeare, Moliere and Corneille wrote
plays that flopped in their day or proved forgettable. ``Psyche,''
at least, cleared the first hurdle. In choosing this ballet-comedy
over competing projects presented by Racine and the librettist
Quinault, the king requested a grandiose carnival spectacle, a play
that would also include song and dance and make imaginative use of
backstage machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Moliere, busy directing his own theater company, had little time
to work on the play. He asked Quinault to write the songs and Lully
to compose the music, but he fell behind on the text. So, after
writing the prologue, Acts I and II and the first scene of Act III,
he persuaded Corneille to complete the play. The resulting
production, with its ornate decor and performers who appeared to
fly, won an enthusiastic thumbs-up from the monarch. Soon Moliere
presented it as a ``divertissement populaire'' in his own theater.
</P>
<P>
   The play tells of Venus' wrath at discovering that a beautiful
mortal, Psyche, is competing with her for attention. She orders her
son, Cupid, to punish the girl, but instead he falls for her, even
ordering Zephyr to raise her to heaven. The Goddess of Beauty is
not amused and dispatches Psyche to hell. When Cupid tries to save
Psyche, Venus strikes her dead. A furious Cupid confronts Venus,
who is unmoved. Finally Jupiter steps in to appease Venus and
resuscitate Psyche, and the lovers are reunited.
</P>
<P>
   Why the play was never revived remains a mystery. A widely read
textbook on French literature published in 1947 noted, ``The
spiritual verses of Moliere and the touches of tenderness of the
aged Corneille give a particular charm to this hurriedly written
work.'' Excerpts from the work were occasionally read at ``salons
poetiques'' at the Comedie Francaise. Yet ``Psyche'' had carried a
reputation for being unstageable. Even today, a full five-hour
version, with a chamber orchestra performing Lully's music, would
be exorbitantly expensive to present.
</P>
<P>
   The new production, which is at the Theatre de
l'Athenee-Louis-Jouvet in Paris through Feb. 12 before touring
several French cities, might not have satisfied Louis XIV. It
dispenses with Lully's music and makes no use of the stage
machinery so beloved by the Sun King. Yet the production, albeit
stripped down, has strikingly succeeded in reintroducing
``Psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the revival is Yan Duffas, 29, who is making his
debut as a theater director. He discovered the play nine years ago
when he used a soliloquy from ``Psyche'' as his audition piece to
enter the National Conservatory of Dramatic Art in Paris. He tried
unsuccessfully to present the play at the school, but the idea
stayed with him as he embarked on a career as an actor, which
included a two-year stint at the Comedie Francaise. Now, with a
cast of five women and four men, all more or less his age, he has
achieved his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective was not to become a theater director, but simply
to put on this play,'' he explained. ``It is part of French
heritage and has no reason to be forgotten. I wanted to recover its
verses. They're not perfect _ both Moliere and Corneille did better
_ but they deserve to be remembered. It still puzzles me why it has
been overlooked. As we worked, I kept looking for reasons why it
was not staged and I found no convincing answer.''
</P>
<P>
   He eventually concluded that the text had aged better than
Lully's music. By abandoning the original score, Duffas saw a way
to lift the play out of its Baroque setting and rescue the language
of Moliere and Corneille from what in 1671 must have resembled a
musical comedy extravaganza. He kept all the play's verses, but
asked a young French composer, Celia Reggiani, to write new music
for some of Quinault's songs. Using percussion, acoustic keyboard,
guitar and an African kora, she created a sensual mixture of
Brazilian and African rhythms and minimalist harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to capture the mood of the original production, however,
Duffas kept to the idea of a popular diversion. The costumes make
little pretense at period accuracy, although the earthlings are
dressed in what might have worked in a 17th-century pantomime.
Everyone else wears loose-fitting white and pale-colored gowns
suggestive of a more ethereal world. And for the set, using a
sloping stage that sits atop the main stage like a beached boat,
Duffas has found an ingenious way of recreating the 1671 idea of
``une piece a machines'' by using two large sheets and imaginative
lighting to define the changing scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Where Duffas has most succeeded, though, is in making the play
intelligible. ``One can see it as a children's tale or one can go
further and see in this fairy story the beginnings of
psychoanalysis,'' he writes in production notes. ``It follows two
adolescents discovering love and feelings, it speaks of learning to
deal with human relations, it dwells on the love between mother and
son and between father and daughter and even on the jealousy
between siblings.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffas has done Moliere and Corneille a service by proving that
``Psyche'' can be staged today. But the playwrights have done the
director the favor of pushing him into the limelight, including a
rave review in Le Monde, with his first stage production. So what's
next?
</P>
<P>
   He is evidently not intimidated. For his next production in
spring 2001, he has chosen Brecht's first play, ``Baal.'' And in
the meantime he is hoping for a chance to direct opera. His
``Psyche'' may have paved the way.  &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England _ The intruder smashed a skylight and lowered
himself down a rope, the police say, before tossing a smoke
canister onto the floor of the Hindley Smith Gallery. In an instant
the room filled with smoke, obscuring the view from the security
cameras. The burglar and fire alarms went off, throwing the museum
into chaos that bought the intruder a few precious moments. The
police responded to the alarm at 1:43 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   When he slipped out of the Ashmolean Museum here less than 10
minutes later, melting into the crowds celebrating the New Year
around the city, the thief carried with him exactly what he had
come for, a $4.8 million Cezanne oil on canvas,
``Auvers-sur-Oise,'' which was painted between 1879 and 1882 and
marks an important transition between the artist's early and later
work. He was not carrying anything else. Left behind was a room
full of Renoirs, Rodins and Toulouse-Lautrecs.
</P>
<P>
   So the Ashmolean Museum here became the latest victim of a crime
that has plagued the art world over the years: the daring,
made-to-order art theft. It is a crime deeply connected with the
unsavory underworld of drug smuggling and money laundering, even as
it evokes images of languid, amusing thieves wearing dinner jackets
and relishing their stolen collections, cunningly concealed in
fabulous mansions on remote private islands.
</P>
<P>
   That theory is as good as any at this point, said Duncan McGraw,
a spokesman for the Thames Valley Police, which has six officers
working on the case but hasn't turned up anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   The police withheld some details of the theft, they said, so
they could be sure any ransom request was authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory we're going on is that it was stolen to order,''
McGraw said. ``We think an art lover from somewhere in Britain or
the world probably earmarked the painting for their collection and
hired a professional art thief to steal it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, experts in tracing stolen masterpieces say
that while the Thomas Crown-style plot, in vogue because of the
movie starring Pierce Brosnan as a handsome, self-satisfied thief,
is certainly possible, it is not probable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People obviously like the scenario where there is this
international art thief going around and stealing valuable
paintings for his own pleasure, but I really feel that is
far-fetched,'' said Malcolm Kenwood, a former detective with the
Sussex Police antiques squad who is now the client services manager
for the Art Loss Register, which helps recover stolen art and
antiques. ``The majority of items are stolen because they are
readily convertible to cash in the underworld.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that there is virtually no chance of the painting
coming on the legitimate market without being identified as a
stolen work. Not only is the Cezanne listed on databases of stolen
art, which auction houses and above-board dealers consult every
time an important new item comes up for sale, but it also is
readily identifiable as the Ashmolean's, said Christopher Brown,
the museum's director: ``Anyone offered this painting will walk
over to the shelf and look it up in a Cezanne book, and would see
where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't help, however, if the painting passes from hand to
hand in the vast art underworld, where it can be sold for a
fraction of its value until it finally emerges, years later, in a
legitimate sale. Thefts of art and antiquities are big business,
with some experts estimating that some $4.8 billion worth is stolen
worldwide each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is very easy to transport around the world,'' said James
Emson, the managing director of the Art Loss Register, who noted
that criminal organizations often trade in stolen artworks as
collateral in making deals with one another. ``It's a very valuable
commodity that allows you to launder money very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   There are literally tens of thousands of readily identifiable
paintings that have been stolen and never recovered. Among the
missing, according to the Art Loss Register, are 47 works by Degas,
54 by Rodin, 142 by Rembrandt and 14 by Kandinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cezanne theft, the Ashmolean, became the latest of
thousands of institutions and private collectors to be successfully
struck by art thieves in the last several decades. The Art Loss
Register and the Thesaurus Group, another organization that tracks
stolen art and antiques, each has a database of more than 100,000
missing items ranging from the smallest of sentimentally valued
antiques to the biggest of old masters. Of course, these include
items taken in general burglaries, not just works targeted by art
thieves.
</P>
<P>
   The most shocking art theft in the last decade took place in
1990, when two men dressed as police officers talked their way into
the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in the middle of the
night, bound and gagged the guards and made off with a priceless
trove of items, including ``The Concert'' by Vermeer and ``Storm on
the Sea of Galilee,'' Rembrandt's only known seascape. A $5 million
reward was offered, but the stolen works have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Other famous missing paintings are J.M.W. Turner's ``Shade and
Darkness: The Evening of the Deluge'' and ``Light and Color: The
Morning After the Deluge,'' which were stolen from a museum in
Frankfurt in 1995 while on loan from the Tate Gallery in London;
Caravaggio's ``Nativity,'' which was cut from its frame in San
Lorenzo Oratory in Palermo, Sicily, in 1969; and van Gogh's ``Still
Life,'' stolen from a home in the Dordogne by the Nazis in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Some lost masterpieces do re-emerge. A Cezanne still life,
``Bouilloire et Fruits,'' fetched $26.57 million in a Sotheby's
auction last December, more than 20 years after it was stolen from
a private collection in Massachusetts. Its provenance was uncovered
by a Lloyd's underwriter who checked it against the database of
missing art.
</P>
<P>
   Some pictures are recovered after the thieves demand a ransom,
as in the case of Munch's ``Scream,'' which was stolen from the
National Gallery in Oslo in 1994 by intruders who propped a ladder
against a wall, smashed a window and reportedly left a note saying,
``Thanks for the poor security.'' The painting was recovered, after
the police foiled the ransom plot.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no ransom request for ``Auvers-sur-Oise,'' which
makes the probability of the picture's surfacing soon all the more
remote.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in his office in the heart of the handsome Ashmolean,
which is owned by Oxford University, Brown said he was in London on
New Year's Eve, watching the fireworks along the Thames and
drinking Champagne. He was told of the break-in when an
administrator from the museum telephoned at 2:30 a.m., saying, ``I
have some terrible news.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown hurried back to Oxford and the awful sight of an empty
space on the wall where the Cezanne had been. The thief had taken
the picture out of the back of its frame and smashed the frame on
the floor. ``It was like coming into your own house and finding
evidence of a break-in,'' Brown said. ``Any director builds up an
intense relationship with the works of art that he or she is
responsible for, and this was very personal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Iain Pears, the best-selling detective fiction writer who lives
in Oxford, said by telephone that he had just missed witnessing the
theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a card game. The baby started crying, so there I was
prowling up and down the street with a screaming baby in the pram.
What a pity. If I had been there 10 minutes earlier, I could have
helped them load it into the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Pears, a specialist in ancient crime whose latest book, ``An
Instance of the Fingerpost,'' is set in England after the death of
Oliver Cromwell, had a theory about the smoke canister _ that it
was timed to set the alarm off at midnight so that guards would
assume a Y2K computer glitch was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jolly brilliant,'' he judged.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Pears said he was confident the canvas would eventually turn up.
``Twenty years ago the Ashmolean lost a Persian carpet in a theft.
They eventually got it back from a dry cleaners in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum will be reviewing its security arrangements, Brown
said, but added that there was not much to be done to prevent
incidents like this from happening in museums like the Ashmolean.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The thief was able to take advantage of scaffolding being used
in a construction site next door, he said, and although there were
guards in the museum at the time, they were not in the gallery
where the Cezanne was hanging. ``This is a very, very large
building,'' Brown said. ``Unless you can put staff in every gallery
every night, how can you deal with this?''
</P>
<P>
   Why did the thief _ the police say they think there was just one
intruder, though there may have been accomplices outside _ steal
the Cezanne and leave so many other valuable paintings behind?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the sale of a Cezanne in December made the thief
erroneously assume he could get the same sort of price for a
Cezanne on the black market, said Katrina Burrows, editor of the
London magazine Trace, which tracks stolen art and antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal theory is that they're very media-alert,'' Burrows
said, noting that people had pointed out the similarities between
the Ashmolean theft and the movie ``Entrapment,'' in which Sean
Connery pulls off a stunning art theft. ``It was a combination of
factors that included watching films and reading the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the people who have ``Auvers sur Oise'' may well be finding
that they have saddled themselves with a beautiful,
16-inch-by-22-inch albatross.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the trade are saying right now that the era of the
great art theft is over,'' Burrows said. ``Really serious criminals
are realizing that art isn't worth their while anymore, because
it's so quickly traceable, and they'll get nothing like a decent
market value for it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not much consolation for Brown, who can only wait and
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much else you can do,'' he said. ``We want people
to know that this picture, should it be offered to them, is the
property of the Ashmolean Museum.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Post, which has built its rowdy
reputation on front-page coverage of crime (``Headless Body in
Topless Bar''), sports (``Bellichicken'') and politics (``Shame on
Hillary'') is naming as its editor a journalist who has spent her
entire career covering business (as in ``You've Got Deal'').
</P>
<P>
   Xana Antunes (pronounced SHAH-na An-TOON-ess), who joined The
Post as deputy business editor in 1995, has been acting editor of
The Post since October, when Kenneth Chandler, the editor in chief,
assumed the title of publisher and stepped down from day-to-day
newsroom management.
</P>
<P>
   As business editor of The Post, Antunes, 35, presided over the
introduction of special media and technology business pages and
doubled the number of business reporters. The next expansion, she
said Tuesday, will come soon with the addition of a page devoted to
fashion business.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to appeal to what she calls an ``upmarket''
readership of Manhattanites and suburban commuters, and to
capitalize on the increasing celebrity of business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``A handful of them are'' celebrities, she said. ``Eisner.''
(Michael D. Eisner, chief executive of Walt Disney Co.) ``Gates.''
(Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft.) ``Trump.'' (Donald Trump.)
``But Gerry Levin?'' (Gerald M. Levin, chairman and chief executive
of Time Warner.) ``Would our readers know who that was?''
</P>
<P>
   Antunes let the question hang for a second, before discussing,
in a businesslike fashion, the difficulty of building a tabloid
headline around a stock market report. ``We have a lot of people
who pick us up later in the day, after we're already into a new
market day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Political coverage, however, will still have pride of place in
an election year. Antunes said she had no regrets about the Post's
aggressively critical coverage of Hillary Rodham Clinton's
soon-to-be-announced Democratic campaign for U.S. senator, but she
denied that the coverage had a partisan slant.
</P>
<P>
   In one headline, The Post admonished ``Shame on Hillary'' after
Clinton's initial silence following remarks by Suha Arafat, who in
a speech attended by Clinton on the West Bank suggested that
Israelis were poisoning Arab women and children with toxic tear
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said that she was reluctant to cause an
international incident by denouncing Arafat immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, Antunes and Chandler have made a series of changes
reassigning executives whose newsroom profiles were once higher
than hers. Chandler reassigned John Podhoretz in early December,
saying that his former jobs of running the editorial page and arts
sections had overburdened him, and that Podhoretz would focus on
his twice-weekly column and a planned book.

   In January, Antunes named Marc Kalech, 51, who was once the
Post's managing editor and most recently its Sunday editor, to head
the newspaper's arts and entertainment section. She named Jonathan
Auerbach, 32, who had been her deputy in the business news
department and succeeded her as business editor, as Sunday editor.

<P>
   With Antunes' appointment, both New York tabloids are being run
by women. In 1997, Debby Krenek was named the first female editor
in chief of The Daily News.

LEADERS TRY TO PRESERVE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British and Irish leaders and Ulster politicians worked
feverishly in three capitals Wednesday in a desperate effort to
save the new Northern Ireland government from being shut down by a
dispute over guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt at all there is a serious problem,'' Prime
Minister Tony Blair told Parliament in London, ``and unless there
is substantial progress, then we have a serious difficulty and a
serious crisis on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast, the leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionists,
David Trimble, said he expected to be out of his job as first
minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly shortly. He expects the
imminent suspension of the eight-week-old legislature by Britain
and the reimposition of direct rule from London.
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin, the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, held talks
with Gerry Adams, president of the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, who forecast ``a disaster'' if the fledging
power-sharing administration was mothballed for even a brief
period.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, who is
expected to announce what Britain will do in an address to the
House of Commons on Thursday, spent Wednesday in meetings with the
heads of the Protestant and Catholic political parties that
produced the peace agreement of April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is thought to be leaning toward suspension as the best
way to save the new political institutions in Belfast from total
collapse and keep them in a state that would permit their revival
this spring. In the meantime, a formal review would begin to see if
the weapons dispute that has continually menaced the peace accord
can be settled.
</P>
<P>
   What has given rise to the new crisis is a confidential report
by Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, head of a weapons monitoring
panel, that offered no evidence that the Irish Republican Army has
made any move to start disarming. The report, delivered to the
British and Irish governments just before a midnight deadline
Monday, remains unpublished, but Blair confirmed in Parliament that
it reports no yielding of paramilitary arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be decommissioning,'' Blair said, using the term
for disarmament in the peace accord. ``There has not been
decommissioning. Under the agreement, it is quite clear that
decommissioning is supposed to be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement put him at odds with the political wing of the
IRA, Sinn Fein, which argues that the only commitment it made was
to try to bring about disarmament by the May 2000 date in the
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble argues that Adams left it clear during the review
conducted by George Mitchell, the former senator, last fall that
there would be movement on arms by now if he agreed to take his
Ulster Unionist Party into the assembly alongside Sinn Fein.
Trimble took that step in November, permitting the power-sharing
home rule government to start up in early December.

By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doris Bivens of Granbury, Texas, saw the request for miniature
pecan pies and sent along this recipe. It appeared in the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram some years ago. Several other readers also sent
the recipe under the name ``pecan tassies.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Blend cheese and margarine, stir in flour. Chill slightly for

</P>
<P>
   Serves 16
</P>

   _ 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   _ 3/4 teaspoon double-acting baking powder
</P>
<P>
   _ 3 cups all-purpose flour, well sifted
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 teaspoons freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   _ 13/4 cups granulated sugar

Bake for 1 hour or until a pick inserted in the middle comes out
clean. Glaze while still hot.
</P>
<P>
   CONTRIBUTOR'S NOTE: ``I prefer to pour the glaze into pan,
around the sides and in the middle along the hole while it is still
hot, then letting it cool before removing it from the pan.''

ISRAEL TO RECALL ENVOY IF VIENNA COALITION INCLUDES HAIDER GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel announced Wednesday that it would recall its
ambassador to Vienna if President Thomas Klestil of Austria
authorized a new coalition government that included the rightist
Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inclusion of an extreme right-wing party, whose leaders
have made serious statements about the Nazi regime, in the
government of a European state such as Austria should outrage every
citizen of the free world,'' said a statement issued by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's office. ``The Jewish people wherever it may
be, led by the State of Israel, will never allow the world to
conduct business as usual in light of the events in Austria and
their possible implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office said he would contact European leaders to discuss
common action on Haider, whose statements Barak denounced as
``almost neo-Nazi positions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the European Union warned that it would
diplomatically isolate Austria if the Freedom Party entered the
governing coalition in a deal reached on Tuesday between Haider's
party and the People's Party. The European Union said it would halt
political contacts and effectively downgrade the status of Austrian
ambassadors in the capitals of its 14 member states.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy said Israel would recall its
ambassador ``the very moment'' Haider's party joined the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Israel's one and only moral stance,'' Levy said. ``The
meaning of a Jewish state is not just to remember, but also to
remind.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has taken such action before, recalling its ambassador to
Vienna during the term of President Kurt Waldheim from 1986 to 1992
to protest his actions as an officer with the German army in World
War II. An international panel of historians found that Waldheim
must have known of atrocities committed by his unit in the Balkans,
but had done nothing to stop them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday, the deputy director-general for European affairs in
the Foreign Ministry, Ehud Gol, said that if Israel did withdraw
its ambassador again, that would be followed by ``a reassessment of
our relations with Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   The position received strong support from Ariel Sharon, leader
of the opposition Likud party. ``We all agree that Israel must,
with the entire free world, fight against a manifestation of
renewed Nazism,'' Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of parliament, Avraham Burg, opened its session
Wednesday with a declaration denouncing Haider's likely entry into
the Austrian coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is painful and regrettable that 55 years after the
Holocaust, the Austrian people refuse to recognize the terrible
tragedy that the racist Nazi ideology inflicted on humanity,'' Burg
said. ``The transformation of a right-wing racist party into a
legitimate and central component of any Western state disqualifies
that state from being a full partner in the international political
system.''
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of lawmakers went to the Austrian embassy in Tel
Aviv to submit a letter signed by 30 legislators that urged that
Haider's party be excluded from government. ``The rule of the Nazi
regime also began with democratic elections,'' the letter said.

CRITICISM MOUNTS OVER CONCENTRATED RUSH OF EARLY PRIMARIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Before memories of Iowa and New Hampshire fade
away for at least four years, it may be well to consider if these
early-voting venues will ever emerge again, Brigadoon-like, from
the political mists.
</P>
<P>
   And as the presidential nomination race barrels toward the glut
of primaries over the next six weeks, it could be that the nation
is about to witness a one-time phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   For just beneath the din of the national race itself is a clamor
to junk the current front-loaded nomination system and its kickoff
in super-Anglo Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The dissatisfaction is not new, but both parties seem more
interested than usual in doing something about it. But will
anything really happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of serious concern and a lot of good intentions
out there, but there is no clear and obvious solution,'' said
William G. Mayer, a political scientist at Northeastern University
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about Iowa and New Hampshire, which have almost no
minority voters and lack many of the problems that beset urban
America, are longstanding. Criticism of the concentrated rush of
primaries increased as the early calendar grew more crowded this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints have reached a crescendo this year because the
presidential preference of almost two-thirds of the delegates to
both national political conventions will be set so quickly. The
race is fueled by a 14-state primary March 7 that includes
California and New York, and a Southern splash a week later
featuring Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The agglomeration March 7 is ``a de facto national primary,''
Mark A. Siegel, a former executive director of the Democratic
National Committee who now teaches at George Washington University,
wrote last month in the Christian Science Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The crush of early primaries has ``greatly increased the
importance of money'' in politics, said Barbara Norrander, a
University of Arizona political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, the Democrats' national general chairman, said there
was ``a tremendous amount of momentum'' in both parties for change.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1992, only about a quarter of convention
delegates had been chosen by mid-March. In 1996, it was just barely
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican commission has proposed a number of alternatives,
including:
</P>
<P>
   _ A rotating regional system of primaries, in which Iowa and New
Hampshire would lead off but every four years a different group of
states would go next. This system is favored by the National
Association of Secretaries of State.
</P>
<P>
   _ A population-based system in which the 10 smallest states
would vote first, followed in order by the next 10 largest states
until on the final day of primaries the 10 most populous states
would ballot. A variation has one contender being eliminated in
each successive ballot so that only two candidates would be
standing on the final, genuinely super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ A pre-primary convention in which party leaders would decide
which candidates are eligible to compete. Various forms of the
suggestion have floated around for years and have been rejected
because of its elitist appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have a similar study under way.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Busch, a political scientist at the University of Denver
who addressed the commission, said this week that while the current
system ``is not what you'd design if you were sitting down to start
from scratch, ... changing it is a whole different question.''
</P>
<P>
   A wholesale change, Busch said, is likely only when there is
``some major crisis of legitimacy.'' He said the nation had seen
only two real ones: in 1824 when Andrew Jackson thought he'd been
robbed by the congressional nominating process known as ``King
Caucus'' and in 1968 after the Democrats' riotous convention in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think enough people think we're at a crisis point,''
Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental changes in the process are made difficult because so
many institutions have a role: national party rules, state party
rules, state law, federal laws on campaign finance and candidates
worried about what a change will mean to them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the current complaints stem from changes in the
nominating procedures instituted by Democrats after 1968. Since
then there has been eternal tinkering, especially by Democrats who
are far more likely than Republicans to dictate details of the
nominating process to states.
</P>
<P>
   There had been so much jockeying that in 1988, Bob Slagle, then
Texas Democratic chairman, declared: ``Everybody's damn tired of
rules changes.'' But the jiggering continued, even as Iowa and New
Hampshire held tenaciously to their positions in the starting gate.
Both states still have laws requiring that their caucuses and
primaries be moved ahead of other states.
</P>
<P>
   But the quick advancing of so many primaries worried even
Republicans, who offered states bonus delegates for delaying their
primaries. Almost no state took advantage of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic rules now allow only Iowa and New Hampshire to hold
binding bits of the nominating process before the first Tuesday in
March. But that has led to the delegate gold rush that will occur
in the two super-primaries early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state Democrats are seeking to circumvent the early
March starting date by holding a nonbinding poll Feb. 29. Both Gore
and his only challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey,
looking to get a leg up on the West Coast, are taking the ``beauty
contest'' seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware is holding a similar show Saturday, but neither
Democrat is paying any attention.
</P>
<P>
   To impose a national system of primaries, including the proposal
for regional rotation, would almost certainly require an act of
Congress, and scholars question whether the House and Senate have
the constitutional power to impose one on the states.
</P>
<P>
   Norrander said that 40 pieces of legislation to require regional
rotation of primaries have been introduced since 1972. The only
time that a measure got out of a congressional committee, the Bush
administration threatened a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Some were adopted, such as the rule that automatically sends
many elected Democrats to their national convention as
``super-delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main change has been the rush to get to the front of the
nominating line. And for some states, there is a sense that they
are missing something.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the intense politicking in the Granite State, a
New York Times editorial Sunday concluded: ``The real shame is that
neither national party has designed a primary system that would
allow more states to play host to a week of the kind of riveting
political theater now playing in New Hampshire.''

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   FEDBUD-DEBT _ WASHINGTON _ Not so long ago, it seemed hard to
imagine how this country would pay off the federal debt. When
President Clinton submits his budget to Congress on Feb. 7, though,
it will contain a plan for paying off the publicly held portion of
that debt _ some $3.3 trillion _ by 2013. That, says Clinton, would
be a stunning achievement that would dramatically change the
country's economic landscape for a generation to come. How,
precisely, would the plan work? Who would get paid, where would the
money come from and what impact would it have on the economy? And
why do some economists _ and some Republicans _ say that paying off
the debt might not be wise? (Deans, Cox News Service).

off John McCain once and for all and explore the state's history
and politics. (Greenberger, Austin American-Statesman). 30-40. WITH
MAP.
</P>
<P>
   SC-TOBACC0 _ In South Carolina, the first tobacco growing state
on the primary calendar, Sen. John McCain likely will confront his
role as architect of the failed tobacco bill of 1998. He may be
vulnerable on two fronts, as an anti-tobacco crusader and as
proponent of one of the largest tax hikes in U.S. history. A look
at the history of the tobacco bill and its implications in the

   SCHOOL-FUND _ Several members of the State Board of Education
say their financial expertise is limited to balancing their
checkbooks, choosing retirement plans and maybe selecting a mutual
fund. The members with the most money-management skills are David
Bradley, R-Beaumont, a licensed insurance, securities and real
estate agent, and Will Davis, D-Austin, a lawyer who represents
insurance companies. Yet the nine members of the board are
responsible for investment decisions on the $22 billion school
trust fund. It's been that way since 1845, and some lawmakers and
investment professionals say it's time to change that. None of the
state's other major pension and investment funds rely on elected
managers without expertise in investments. (Brooks, Austin
American-Statesman). 35-40. WITH GRAPHICS.

   MOBILE-CRUISE _ MOBILE, Ala. _ At the eastern end of Dauphin
Street, the Port City's version of the French Quarter _ complete
with shops, art galleries and restaurants trimmed with forest green
wrought iron _ barber Bob Williamson sits in his shop on a lazy
morning and quietly pries the posts out of his silver metal watch
band. Just a few blocks away, a freighter glides through the Mobile
River to the Alabama State Docks. The glitz free scene has
continued for decades in this city of azaleas and magnolias, which
lets down its hair once a year for Mardi Gras. ``Nothing happens
quickly in Mobile,'' Williamson said. To help quicken downtown's
economic pulse _ sapped years ago by strip malls and suburban
housing that sprang up to the west _ business leaders aggressively
are trying to land a cruise ship homeport. (Manuel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Hyde, an artist whose new paintings _ six- and
nine-foot-square throw pillows _ are slumped against the walls at
the Brent Sikkema gallery in Chelsea, quoted Matisse when asked
about his interest in interior design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art should be a soft armchair for the tired businessman,''
said Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   At Tom Sachs' studio on Centre Street, a ``Knoll International''
red trademark logo, meticulously painted by the artist, graces his
new sculpture: a D.J.'s double turntable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the best concept in the world,'' said Sachs, who
was wearing a black rubber-band bracelet that read, ``You are
gifted in many ways.'' ``But if it doesn't look good, what's the
point?''
</P>
<P>
   For years, design has wanted to be art, quoting every art source
it can think of, appealing to collectors and showing up in
galleries and museums. The best work was painterly or sculptural.
</P>
<P>
   Now a generation of artists working and exhibiting widely is
investigating design, from residential architecture to interior and
furniture design to home renovation, envying its ability to reach
the public and be relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists are really seduced by the power that design has to
insert itself into people's lives,'' said Andrea Zittel, an artist
represented with nine others in ``Against Design,'' an exhibition
opening Friday at the Institute of Contemporary Art at the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Installation pieces include Ikea shelving, carpeting,
kitchenettes and lighting. Angela Bulloch's ``Bean Bag Set'' is
just that.
</P>
<P>
   Zittel's signature ``A-Z Living Unit'' is there: a fold-up kit
of severely condensed living space, with a mattress, a dressing
mirror and a hot plate. By creating an appliance that simplified
life with elegant functionality, Zittel used design to make a
social comment. ``I became interested in how design inverts
values,'' she said, ``like simplicity, which is associated with
poverty. But design has made it glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Beyer, the exhibition's curator, said, ``It's a funny
little generational moment.'' The artists included in the group are
largely in their mid- to late 30s. ``Most have been affected by the
built environment _ more affected than by painting and sculpture in
museums.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``These artists are very savvy about the commercial
world, that if you're going to survive, you have to have something
to sell. This is closer to a designer's sensibility _ that kind of
practicality.''
</P>
<P>
   The show includes two queen-size beds, with matching nightstands
and dressers, by Jorge Pardo, a California sculptor, whose clients
live with and sleep on the pieces. Pardo lives in a hillside house
in Los Angeles that he designed in 1998 as an installation piece,
``4166 Sea View Lane,'' commissioned by the Museum of Contemporary
Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became interested in interior design and architecture living
in L.A.,'' said Pardo, who admires Richard Neutra and R.M.
Schindler. ``The museum situation is limited. Some of the most
interesting objects are houses.'' Pardo is now working on houses
for other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting invitations that are pretty straightforward
design,'' he said of recent commissions. ``Design is a lot easier
to understand. It's like collecting baseball cards.''
</P>
<P>
   The right kind of design is also intensely influential right
now. It has not escaped the notice of the art world. With the
hybridization of interior decoration and fashion design by
magazines like Wallpaper and by advertisers like Calvin Klein and
Gucci and with the ubiquity of graphic design in music videos and
on the Internet, a younger generation will crowd a party at the
Gansevoort Gallery, which exhibits design, as quickly as it will
Gagosian Gallery, which shows art. The high-rolling collecting
market for midcentury modern furniture has helped, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, the artist, said he believed that the emergence of Charles
and Ray Eames, designers and artists who have become new American
folk heroes because of the recent exhibition of their work, and the
popularity of their chairs were responsible for much of the
acceptance of design among artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting in one as we speak,'' he said. ``The Eameses
engaged their lives so much with their work. The truth is, how do
you make significance in the cultural area? You can make an
aesthetic statement with a chair as well as a painting. Good design
has become something philosophic.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Solomon, an art critic, thinks that the design citations
are frequently evidence of disappointment in the failure of
20th-century art's utopian social agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The furniture is intended as a symbol for the failed dreams of
modernism,'' she said. ``Art can't save us. It's just something to
sit on.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of placing domestic fixtures in unlikely contexts or
embodying conceptual thinking in furniture is not new. Marcel
Duchamp's ready-mades early in the last century and the work of
sculptors like Scott Burton, who produced chairs in the 1970s,
comprise a short history of it.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Whiteread's ``Untitled (One Hundred Spaces),'' a
room-size installation of resin casts of the spaces beneath chairs,
that was included in the recent ``Sensation'' exhibition at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, investigated the resonance of a simple
habitation, like sitting. The blocks look like archaeological
artifacts, brushed, cleaned and presented in a museum, from a
people who can now only be conjectured: postwar Britain as Pompeii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in a time with so much demographic and technological
change that is directly affecting domestic environments, artists
and architects alike are aware that here is fundamental space _
domestic space _ that can't be taken for granted in its meaning,''
said Joel Sanders, an architect.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Ketter, included in the Philadelphia show, builds sculpture
with shelving and kitchen cabinets that he buys at Ikea.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed with Beyer that it is a generational issue. ``We were
all born in the 1960s and '70s, when `norms' and `standards' were
truly mass-produced, as design,'' Ketter said. ``Rather than buck
that, we embrace it. I walk into Ikea, and I'm a consumer. I buy a
kitchen, but I make art out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Isermann, whose color-field braided rugs, Orlon carpet
canvases and atomic-age interior decor were the subject of a
previous show, teaches himself his artistic techniques from
home-hobbyist books.
</P>
<P>
   For other artists, working with the domestic detail of being at
home is working with what isn't known but what must be uncovered
through autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Zittel questions the pleasures of solitude, designing trailers
as art to travel in. ``I think about this all the time,'' she said.
``I'm 34. I've lived alone most of my life. It's excruciating to
try to share a house with even one other person. We all crave
`going home' and being alone and being safe, but I think it weakens
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rirkrit Tiravanija, a New York artist, replicated his
East Village apartment in plywood, with a working kitchen and
bathroom, for Gavin Brown's Enterprise, an exhibition space on West
15th Street. When in residence, the artist cooked Thai curries for
guests.

NEW YORK: for guests.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent collaborations between art and design have also
created cooperation in both directions. Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch
architect, has commissioned bathroom fixtures from Joep van
Lieshout, a Dutch artist included in the Philadelphia show, who
makes sculptures that are sinks and tubs.
</P>
<P>
   For Sachs, the sculptor, the association between the two fields
seems natural. Sachs studied architecture for two years in London,
including an informal internship with Tom Dixon, a designer, and
later worked with Frank Gehry on Gehry's bent-maple furniture
collection for Knoll. In a recent visit, Sachs, 33, seemed
comfortable with the fact that art and design's current
cross-referencing was fashionable. Sachs trades on it, dropping
names in his art, like Knoll or Hermes.
</P>
<P>
   In his last show at the Mary Boone Gallery in September, Sachs
displayed 1,100 9-millimeter cartridges in an Alvar Aalto Savoy
vase, which opening-night guests were invited to take as favors, a
move that provoked the police, who arrested Boone, more than
critics. Sachs, who was GQ's ``Man of the Month'' in December, was
not included in the Philadelphia show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's work without any of the rigor or structure of anything in
either the design or art worlds,'' said Beyer, the curator.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, who has three assistants who were working on projects for
five imminent shows, thinks his product is good. ``I approach it as
a small business,'' he explained of his art, adding his admiration
for Andy Warhol's factories and Keith Haring's pop shops. ``I would
like to ultimately do things that more people can have, but right
now we need to focus on establishing the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs grew up in Westport, Conn., a neighbor of Martha
Stewart's. He discovered the nexus of art and design when he was
19, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. ``Seeing art like
Richard Serra, then the design department on the fourth floor,
which was real things,'' said Sachs, who recognized Marcel Breuer's
Wassily chair from ``the shrink's office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Later I realized that there was no difference between Breuer
and Serra, except Breuer's a better sculptor and Serra's a better
architect,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Serra, an artist of a different generation, might dispute Sachs'
generosity. An essay in the catalog for ``Against Design,'' by Mark
Robbins, the director of design at the National Endowment for the
Arts, begins by quoting Serra: ``To deprive art of its uselessness
is to make it other than art.''

A MORTICIAN'S CONFESSIONS IN SHADES OF BOOZY GRAY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Benedict Nightingale is the chief theater critic of The Times of
London.  
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The face is pale and pouchy, the mustache threadbare, the body
pudgy and hunched, the clothing mostly black. Is this an upended
turtle glumly trudging about on its rear legs, or a bloated walrus
ill at ease on land, or an aphasic hippo, or a great beetle afraid
it may fall onto its back and stay there?
</P>
<P>
   No, it is the actor Brian Cox, his every fissure suggesting what
he is supposed to be: a mortician, an alcoholic and a man so out of
love with life that you feel he would willingly follow his latest
client down below the sod.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is the epicenter of ``Dublin Carol,'' an impressive new play
by Conor McPherson, 28, the Irish author of ``The Weir.'' Partly
because of its own undoubted quality, partly because the earlier
work has enjoyed such success in London and New York, this is the
piece that was to have reopened the Royal Court Theater, which has
been closed for nearly four years for a $40-million refit.
</P>
<P>
   But the most reliable member of any team of British contractors
is the gremlin. Building problems have caused delays, and delays
have temporarily banished Ian Rickson's sensitive production of
``Dublin Carol'' to the Old Vic.
</P>
<P>
   Some sort of artistic magnetism is always pulling McPherson's
work toward soliloquy. The plays that introduced him to London and
later were seen in New York, ``This Lime Tree Bower'' and ``St.
Nicholas,'' were both monologues, the second and weirder of them
starring Cox himself as a bitter, drunken theater critic who landed
in a den of vampires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weir'' consisted largely of spooky stories told by the
habitues of a seedy West of Ireland bar. But why quarrel with that?
For one thing, it allows McPherson to demonstrate his gift for
spinning vivid yarns. For another, tales about the past can
communicate feelings that create tension and conflict in the
present. So it was with ``The Weir.'' So it often is with ``Dublin
Carol,'' only more intensely, more disturbingly.
</P>
<P>
   The play consists of three shortish duologues, each dominated by
Cox's John Plunkett. He is a kind of booze-ravaged Ancient Mariner,
desperate to unburden himself on the eve of an occasion noted both
for its celebrations and its suicides: Christmas Day. And John is
feeling the pressure. His long-estranged wife has terminal cancer,
his long-estranged daughter wants him to visit the death bed, his
long-estranged son is about to return from England.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his only unestranged kith and kin seem to be his inner
demons and angels, which, respectively, itch to drink and to
confess.
</P>
<P>
   In the gloomy Dublin office where the play is set, a whiskey
bottle empties as the confessions escalate. The first victim is
Andrew Scott's callow Mark, an apprentice mortician still queasy
after burying a young drug addict and somewhat bewildered by John's
tales of the ``filthy, dirty'' pubs that almost reduced him to a
bum.
</P>
<P>
   Then in comes Bronagh Gallagher as John's daughter Mary, to
share his degrading memories and hear his abject regrets. And when
Mark reappears to get his paycheck, his reward is a description of
a drinking cycle, clinical in its detail, terrifying in its zealous
self-destructiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Could so hard a case have become a relatively controlled toper
without the help of AA, therapy or both? Maybe not; but McPherson
writes with such authority that I for one bought John's
explanation, which is that his present employer rescued him from
the gutter by giving him a job. Also, one of the play's strengths
is its deft evocation of offstage characters: the quiet,
inexplicably trusting master-mortician; John's wife, who has
paradoxically been strengthened by his failures; the lonely widow
who became his long-suffering mistress; the wayward son drifting
and drinking in some British slum.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the onstage characters who matter most. In his
understated way, McPherson suggests that Mary is an emotionally
damaged woman who has learned to live with her half-healed
fractures and wounds, an impression reinforced by Gallagher's
pinched face and tense body language.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mark, 20, the outsider, has innate interest, since he is in
the process of ditching his long-term girlfriend and she is
evidently in despair. And this is also dramatically useful, for
John's contempt for her pain surely reveals the manipulative
monster still inside him. If he can persuade another man to neglect
and hurt a woman, maybe he won't feel so bad himself.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is howling ``What kind of filthy husband was I?'' or
baldly stating ``I wish I'd never been born,'' or reduced to
breathlessness by a bleary memory of drunkenly hauling the
7-year-old Mary from school to a pub, Cox rivets you with a
performance that combines power and discipline with ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this repentant sinner wallowing in his remorse? Isn't
there a point at which self-hatred becomes self-indulgence? And how
strong a psychological alibi is the revelation that John himself
had a vicious father? For all the talk, you're left sharing the
confusions of a man who can meticulously describe but not fully
understand himself.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain, though, is that McPherson and Cox give you
every opportunity to sympathize, judge, reflect. Myself, I'll long
remember the play's final moments, in which John ignores his
unfinished bottle, carefully dresses in readiness for his last
visit to his wife, then decides to restore the angel he has just
removed from the office Christmas tree. There is, it seems, a
little hope in the mortician, a bit of faith in the house of death.
This could be a spurious, sentimental gesture. Instead, it gives a
moving, resonant ending to a bleak midwinter play.
</P>
<P>
   If those gremlins don't wreak further havoc, ``Dublin Carol''
will move from the Old Vic to the completed Royal Court on Feb.
17. &QL;

<P>
   It won't be the only transfer worth catching, for the theatrical
removers have been pretty busy in London of late. A revival of Tom
Stoppard's play ``The Real Thing,'' much admired when it opened in
the tiny Donmar Warehouse last year, is making a stopover at the
Albery before leaving for Broadway in April. ``Peggy for You,''
Alan Plater's play about the legendary literary agent Peggy Ramsay,
has just moved from the Hampstead Theater to the Comedy.
</P>
<P>
   And critical and commercial success has propelled Trevor Nunn's
production of ``The Merchant of Venice,'' in which Henry Goodman
gives maybe the finest performance in London, from the National
Theater's smallest auditorium, the Cottesloe, to its largest, the
Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Real Thing'' first hit Broadway in 1984, when Jeremy Irons
played the dramatist who mislaid his poise and urbanity when he was
sexually betrayed by Glenn Close as the actress he married after
himself betraying his first wife. Thanks to his willowy angst and
her vitality, the play definitively answered a long-heard complaint
about Tom Stoppard, which was that his characters lacked much
capacity for personal emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The feelings are less up-front, more inner in David Leveaux's
revival; but you don't doubt the seriousness of the love and pain
linking and threatening the new pairing, Stephen Dillane's dry,
droll Henry and Jennifer Ehle's creamy, dreamy Annie.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Sir Tom's trademark wit and intellectual curiosity are
missing: far from it. Explicitly, implicitly, his characters are
always inviting you to look at passion and commitment from
different angles. Even the roles Annie is playing offstage,
Strindberg's tormented Julie and the incestuous sister in Ford's ``
'Tis Pity She's a Whore,'' become ingredients in a running debate
about whether ``the real thing'' exists.
</P>
<P>
   And when Dillane's Henry is answering his feminist daughter, who
thinks any permanent bond between men and women is
``colonization,'' by insisting that love is ``mess, tears,
self-abasement, loss of self-respect, nakedness'' _ well, he has
the doleful charisma to convince you that, yes, it does. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stoppard was not represented by the late Peggy Ramsay, but
many important playwrights were, among them Joe Orton, David Hare,
Robert Bolt, Caryl Churchill, Alan Ayckbourn and Ionesco, who (as
she would proudly tell aspiring dramatists) seduced her on her
office settee. She was London's version of New York's Audrey Wood,
but more eccentric, quirkier, funnier. She liked to discover and
nurture original talent; but when it became commercially successful
or ceased to live dangerously, she lost interest.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Plater, once a raw North of England dramatist, now a
leading television writer, is just the former client to write well
about her. And so he does, though ``Peggy for You'' is likely to
arrest and amuse laymen less than those in the theatrical know.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the appearance of three dramatists in Ramsay's office
_ a nervous boy, an embittered northerner, a smooth technician _
cannot disguise the fact that it is essentially a one-woman play.
But then it does allow Maureen Lipman, a British actress well worth
discovering by Americans, to give a bravura performance. She cuts a
bizarre figure, fidgeting, fluttering, striking vaguely erotic
attitudes, then prowling her domain in so stylized a way that you
think a very fastidious flamingo has been crossed with a slowly
goose-stepping Nazi; but you cannot miss the shrewdness beneath the
show. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What, yet another ``Merchant of Venice''? For a play with such a
dubious reputation it is revived with great regularity in England,
though often (and awkwardly) with the inference that even
Shakespeare's hero and heroine are cynical Jew-baiters who will
stop at nothing to destroy the outsider Shylock.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Nunn's jazz-era, cafe-society revival is none too
sympathetic with the Christian faction, either. David Bamber
transforms the merchant Antonio into a self-hating homosexual who
winces, squirms and nervily forces his face into ingratiating
displays of fake humor. But the Christians are not unduly demonized
nor Shylock the least sentimentalized.
</P>
<P>
   That is thanks both to the care and balance of Nunn's direction
and to the excellence of his Shylock. At first, Henry Goodman comes
across as a coolly humorous businessman with a dark side that is
revealed less in the bloodthirsty debt he never expects to collect
than in the sudden, angry slap he gives poor Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   But soon you sense the awful loneliness of the widower and
overprotective father, the embattled pride of the Jew who inserts
snatches of Hebrew speech into the original text and leads his
daughter in Yiddish songs. Jessica's abduction by Lorenzo, then, is
a disabling blow: an offense against his family, his house, his
traditions and his heart.
</P>
<P>
   For all his faults, this Shylock has vastly more moral and
spiritual weight than the flighty, frivolous Christians and, with
it, a rare capacity for feeling. Goodman never lets you forget that
a deep, deep pain fundamentally motivates his revenge; but,
equally, he does not disguise the fact that even justifiable rage
can make men ugly.
</P>
<P>
   So implacably does his Shylock pursue his pound of flesh that in
this revival his friend Tubal walks out of the courtroom in dismay.
Yet when he acknowledges his inevitable defeat, ironically placing
his yarmulke in the scales awaiting the flesh of Antonio, you are
left with a feeling that the play's romantic ending cannot
alleviate. Call it tragic.

 &HT;    BUSINESS EXECUTIVES BOOST CLINTON'S INTERNET PLAN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Business executives offered swift support Wednesday
for President Clinton's plan to speed up the drive to make Internet
connections as universal as telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed $2 billion in tax incentives over 10 years for
businesses that donate equipment, software, labor, money or
know-how to help increase Internet use in schools, community
centers and libraries in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed $384 million in grants during the next
fiscal year to train future teachers and to encourage greater use
of computers and other Internet-connected devices in poor or rural
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we'll want to examine the details, but clearly,
it's a move in the right direction,'' said Jeff Modisett, vice
president of TechNet, a Silicon Valley coalition of more than 190
politically active heads of technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraged by the steps he's taking on this,'' said
Rick Lane, director of e-commerce and Internet technology for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He said the chamber will have to see the
details before formally endorsing the plan, which is similar in
some ways to a chamber-backed bill introduced by Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich.

   ``We're obviously the end users of the education system, since
we hire its graduates,'' Lane said. ``We like the concept of

<P>
   A striking overlap between the Democratic president's initiative
and several existing Republican plans make it likely that some
version will be adopted by Congress with broad bipartisan support,
said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Republican
High Tech Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the president is a born-again tax cutter,''
Bennett said, noting the prominence of tax breaks in the plan.
Bennett, several Democratic lawmakers and two high-tech company
leaders _ Steve Case of America Online Inc. in Dulles, Va., and
David Stirling(cq) of epiclearning.com(cq) in Atlanta _ watched
Clinton outline his plan at a student rally in at Ballou High
School in a poor neighborhood of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big goal should be to make connection to the Internet as
common as connection to the telephone today,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   About 93 percent of American homes have a telephone. A
government study released last summer indicated 3 percent of poor
rural households and 80 percent of wealthy households in urban
areas are connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also noted that there is a ``digital divide'' between
low Internet use by blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans and
higher use by others in the same income bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Case and Stirling joined Clinton because they have already
helped fund programs to train urban youth for well-paying high-tech
jobs. They said Wednesday that in addition to helping match federal
seed money for the first three years, they have plans to expand,
enhance and find permanent funding for technology training centers
at Ballou and other sites in poor parts of dozens of cities.
</P>
<P>
   Case's firm offers Internet connections and access to
educational material, while Stirling's trains people online to
obtain certificates that qualify them for many high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Case had a bonus as he and the president toured the high
school's computer lab prior to the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Washington, 17, a senior, told Case that he was an AOL
user. ``You are? Well, that makes my day,'' said Case. They
exchanged e-mail addresses.

 &HT;    BUSINESS EXECUTIVES BOOST CLINTON'S INTERNET PLAN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Business executives offered swift support Wednesday
for President Clinton's plan to speed up the drive to make Internet
connections as universal as telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed $2 billion in tax incentives over 10 years for
businesses that donate equipment, software, labor, money or
know-how to help increase Internet use in schools, community
centers and libraries in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed $384 million in grants during the next
fiscal year to train future teachers and to encourage greater use
of computers and other Internet-connected devices in poor or rural
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we'll want to examine the details, but clearly,
it's a move in the right direction,'' said Jeff Modisett, vice
president of TechNet, a Silicon Valley coalition of more than 190
politically active heads of technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraged by the steps he's taking on this,'' said
Rick Lane, director of e-commerce and Internet technology for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He said the chamber will have to see the
details before formally endorsing the plan, which is similar in
some ways to a chamber-backed bill introduced by Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously the end users of the education system, since
we hire its graduates,'' Lane said. ``We like the concept of
offering government incentives to businesses that offer
contributions and support to schools and others who need better
access to education on and with technology.''

&HT;     POLICE GROUP URGES BOYCOTT OF BENETTON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the country's largest police unions called
Wednesday for a nationwide boycott of Benetton clothing to protest
the Italian firm's new advertising campaign opposing capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cabral, president of the International Union of Police
Associations, which represents more than 80,000 law enforcement
officers, accused the $2 billion Benetton Group of trying to
glorify ``wanton criminals just to peddle some clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   He also charged that the firm was seeking to ``humanize''
vicious killers while ignoring the tragedies of their victims.
``You cannot humanize these inhuman monsters,'' he said, adding
that ``any profits from sales generated by this campaign are
nothing more than blood money.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, titled ``We, On Death Row,'' features
photographs of 26 Death Row inmates in U.S. prisons. Their faces
are appearing on billboards and magazine ads across the world with
the words ``sentenced to death'' in bold letters above their
portraits. The company has also produced a 96-page newspaper
supplement in which the inmates also are interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Death Row'' ads are running on three billboards in New
York City through February as well as in the Feb. 7 issue of the
New Yorker, Vanity Fair for March, Rolling Stone for Feb. 17 and
three other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Benetton officials said they hope the ads will stimulate
discussion about the death penalty and draw attention to continuing
executions in America. Since 1984 Benetton has used its ad
campaigns to focus on global issues like AIDS, racism, religion and
the war in Bosnia. The company has been praised by many for helping
to raise public consciousness about the issues, but it also has
been accused of using them to gain publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Benetton spokesman Mark Major said the new campaign seeks to
provide ``a human face to the prisoners on Death Row'' and to
remind death-penalty advocates ``that the debate concerns men and
women in flesh and blood, not virtual characters eliminated or
spared with a simple click as with a video game.''
</P>
<P>
   But victims' rights groups as well as police organizations have
denounced the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a death penalty issue; it's a human issue,'' said
Nancy Ruhe-Munch, executive director of the Cincinnati-based
National Organization of Parents of Murdered Children, which does
not take a stand on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   She said the ad campaign is ``a slap in the face'' to survivors,
to law enforcement officials who investigated and prosecuted the
cases and to the jurors who convicted the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything these people did, now you have somebody over
in Italy who says, `I don't care, because I have enough money (to
put up) billboards on my views on capital punishment,''' she said.
Ruhe-Munch's group and other victims-rights organizations also have
called for a boycott of Benetton clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Cabral of the police unions association said he will urge
municipal and transit officials around the country to refuse
Benetton advertising on publicly owned buses and billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``No responsible elected official in this country should become
an accomplice to Benetton's greedy disregard for the victims and
their families who suffered at the hands of such vicious
criminals,'' Cabral said.

&HT;     GOVERNORS CLASH OVER WHETHER TO TAX INTERNET SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)

 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michigan Gov. John Engler told a congressional
panel Wednesday that the nation's governors want federal
legislation allowing them to collect taxes on out-of-state sales
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci testified that such a
system would choke off e-commerce, create another bureaucracy like
the IRS and inconvenience people by making them keep track of what
they buy out of state.
</P>
<P>
   The two governors, both Republicans, testified during a Senate
Budget Committee hearing on Internet taxation, a month before a
federal advisory panel is scheduled to recommend to Congress
whether to levy taxes on electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Engler, speaking for the National Governor's Association, said
governors are worried that their states may fall short of tax money
to pay for education, public safety and transportation unless they
can collect sales taxes on Internet sales. E-commerce sales are
expected to explode to over $1 trillion by 2003 and many state
treasurers are concerned that these sales are escaping taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, some Internet vendors voluntarily collect
out-of-state taxes but most vendors don't, especially small
businesses, according to the NGA.
</P>
<P>
   Engler argued that states have a right to collect existing ``use
taxes,'' which require that residents of 45 states and the District
of Columbia _ those with sales taxes _ pay tax on goods they buy
out of state if they didn't pay a sales tax. Unfortunately, the use
tax is largely ignored, Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said the governors want Congress to ``clarify into
federal law that we have the authority to collect'' taxes from
Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Such legislation would supercede a 1967 Supreme Court decision
that said a state can't compel an out-of-state vendor to collect
sales tax for it unless the vendor has a presence in the state. The
court said forcing a vendor to collect the tax would be too
burdensome on interstate commerce. However, in a 1993 case, the
Supreme Court said Congress has the authority to permit states to
compel out-of-states vendors to collect the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Congress put a moratorium on new Internet taxes last year and
appointed the advisory commission to recommend a policy.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said if Congress gives governors the authority to collect
the tax, the states will ``work out the mechanism'' for doing so.
That would involve simplifying sales tax law in 45 states and the
District of Columbia and providing computer software to vendors so
can they can easily collect it.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci, insisting that the Internet must be free from
burdensome taxes in order to thrive, called for a permanent ban on
all Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci added that any new Internet sales taxes might prompt
Internet businesses to move out of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we want to create an incentive for companies to move
off shore?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Celluci said Internet companies are forming every day and
creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anything in the way of this continued growth,''
Cellucci said. He added: ``We don't want to incovenience millions
and millions of people because we have a collection problem.''

&HT;     COMMENTARY: WHY THE NASDAQ IS SOARING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (for use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By J.T. YOUNG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the last three years, the high
technology-dominated Nasdaq stock exchange, has seen annual growth
rates of 86 percent, 40 percent, 22 percent and 23 percent from
1996 through 1999. Recently many commentators have questioned
whether this performance is more indicative of speculation than
economics.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Nasdaq has experienced tremendous capital
appreciation over the last few years. Yet this fact by itself
hardly proves the point that its increase either has been divorced
from real economic factors or that such a rise is detrimental.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the Nasdaq alone that is rapidly increasing.
Historically, all stocks are doing extraordinarily well. From 1966
to 1997, all stocks gave a real rate of return of 6 percent.
However from 1982 to 1997, they have given a real rate of return of
12.8 percent. Thus, it is quite possible to discern different
patterns within overlapping time frames.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the Nasdaq's last four years' performance does just
that.
</P>
<P>
   From the Nasdaq's inception in 1971 through 1994, it experienced
a nominal average annual growth rate of 8.5 percent - in
comparison, all stocks produced a growth rate of 8.4 percent from
1802 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq does not represent all stocks but a specific segment:
the high tech area - the one with the most rapid and arguably the
greatest potential growth. It is also the one in which the United
States is far and away the world's leader. It is not just America's
leading industry, but the world's that is centered in the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, such leadership should be reaping rather
dramatic returns.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has this been the overnight phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Investment in information technology has been going roughly as
long as the Nasdaq itself. Yet for years, it was an axiom of
economic analysis that large `IT'' investments were not yielding
commensurate returns.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently they now are.
</P>
<P>
   As a result productivity, which had existed in the `one
percents'' in every year of this decade (except the post-recession
rebound year of 1992), was 2.9 percent in 1996, 2.2 percent in
1997, 2.8 percent in 1998 and 4.7 percent in the third quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is logical that big returns would follow such dramatic
results and potential.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to examine the comparative returns in other
investments. Of course, the most common counterpoint to stock
investment is bond investment. It is not coincidental that general
stock appreciation has followed a dramatic decline on bond yields.
In December 1980, `stagflation'' (the combination of high inflation
and stagnating economic performance) had driven interest rates on
the 30-year Treasury bond to 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today that bond yields approximately 6.5%.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we must focus on the demand side of the equation: the
source of the wealth driving Nasdaq prices. Baby boomers, America's
largest and wealthiest age cohort, are now in their top earning
years - their time to fund retirement, children's education, etc.
This massive amount of cash has to go somewhere. It is again not
surprising that it would go to the Nasdaq high tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Nasdaq represents the world's leading industry. It
is giving strong evidence of its economic potential. This potential
is greater than either that of the steam or internal combustion
engines because of its ability to penetrate virtually every sphere
of life. America is in fact writing history electronically.
</P>
<P>
   This industry is centered in this country, which gives Americans
an inside track on investing in it. America, with an economy over
twice that of the world's second largest, has simultaneously seen
its largest age group reach its greatest earning capacity and has
experienced a rapid decrease in the return on alternative
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in this scenario smacks of speculation. It represents
not a repeal of economic laws but rather their response to a
coincidence of positive economic factors.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that speculation doesn't exist in the Nasdaq
or any stock market. Certainly it does. Yet this does not detract
from their real economic role of capital allocation.
</P>
<P>
   To those discerning a problem in the Nasdaq's recent growth,
there follows a tacit question: What is to be done? The answers of
the past issue a dire warning to the present and future. For two
generations governments believed they could better manage a
society's wealth than society's private operations. It was only by
freeing America from this mindset and its consequences that the
unprecedented economic growth we have experienced for the last 20
years has been possible.
</P>
<P>
   The worst lesson we could take from the Nasdaq's recent
increases would be that there should again be a government attempt
to control the allocation of wealth.

   CONGRESS-BANKRUPTCY (Washington) _ The Senate voted decisively
Wednesday to make it harder for people to erase their debts, a
measure that would overhaul the nation's bankruptcy laws and raise
the minimum wage by $1 to $6.15 an hour over the next three years.

   OIL-MERGER (Washington) _ Moving to stem the trend of huge
consolidation in the oil industry, the federal government decided
Wednesday to try to block BP Amoco's $30 billion acquisition of
Atlantic Richfield Co. Federal officials asserted, and the
companies denied, that the merger would be strongly
anti-competitive and could lead to significant increases in the
price of gasoline in California and other west coast states, where
prices are already far above the national average. By Stephen

   SC-McCAIN-BUSH (Columbia, S.C.) _ Only hours after Sen. John
McCain's double-digit victory in the New Hampshire primary
dramatically shifted the contours of the Republican race, McCain
and a humbled Gov. George W. Bush both shifted their battle for the
nomination to this conservative state, whose primary is less than
three weeks away. And both wasted little time positioning

   LAMA-RIVALS (Rumtek, India) _ Deshin Shekpa was born during the
year of the male wood mouse (1384), and it is said he could be
heard chanting a mantra and reciting the alphabet while still
inside his mother's womb. At the moment of his birth, he boldly
proclaimed himself to be the fifth incarnation of the Karmapa, one
of Tibetan Buddhism's holiest figures. Now, two rival incarnations
have strained relations between India and China, and one lama says:
``Buddha would not be laughing right now. This is all about
politics. It's a story filled with many traitors and betrayals.''

   But one by one, the tests started coming back positive. Donors
and recipients don't have to have the same blood type, we learned.
Generally, if you can donate blood to another person you can donate
a kidney. And we were in luck there: I'm type-O, the universal
donor.
</P>
<P>
   Then the results of our crucial blood-mixing tests came in:
Great news _ no antibodies had formed. We were compatible. If I
passed an exacting series of physicals, I'd be qualified to give
Jeri a kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jeri's sister, about half of all potential donors wash out
during the physicals. I doubt anybody short of an astronaut
candidate gets as thoroughly checked out: Over the summer I was
probed, pricked, X-rayed, CAT-scanned, EKG-ed and psychologically
evaluated. I had dye injected into my kidneys; I gave many vials of
blood; I spent 24 hours connected to a blood-pressure monitor; I
dutifully collected my urine in a plastic container.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at the end of August, we got the call from Sandy Del
Grosso, our transplant coordinator at UC-San Francisco: I'd passed;
I was fully qualified to be a donor.

<P>
   THE OPERATION BEGINS
</P>
<P>
   It's a sobering milestone in your life when you realize, for the
first time, that you're older than your doctor. And at the age of
43, both Jeri and I were older than the two surgeons who would be
operating on us. But we liked and trusted them both immediately.
Dr. Chris Freise, who would be removing my kidney, was only 39, but
had all the superlative confidence you want in a surgeon and none
of the arrogance. Dr. Peter Stock, who would be installing my
kidney into Jeri, was 42 and a Himalayan climber. I knew enough
about his hobby to know that expedition climbers aren't wild,
hell-for-leather cowboys. Rather, they're experts at assessing
risks and making calm, rational decisions when things get dicey.
Just the sort of person you'd want cutting on your wife.
</P>
<P>
   Midazolam is the most wonderful stuff. One moment I was lying on
my gurney in the pre-op room, squeezing Jeri's hand and clenching
my jaw in a state of high anxiety, and the next _ after the lead
anesthesiologist, Dr. Scott Kelley, had injected me with two
milligrams of the sedative _ I was grinning and gibbering like a
happy idiot. I don't remember this, but as they wheeled me down the
hall toward the swinging double doors of Operating Room No. 4, I'm
told I said, ``Let's party!''
</P>
<P>
   I was still peppering the doctors with questions, I'm told,
until Dr. Kelley injected me with a healthy dose of Sufentanil
Propofol, a powerful narcotic, and I nodded off.
</P>
<P>
   They rolled me onto my right side and onto a special bed-table
that flexes and arches like an inverted V, so my hips were thrust
two feet higher than my head and feet. A bar in the bed gently
pushed up my kidneys from below.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 20 minutes nurses padded, tucked and taped me into
position for the surgery. I'd be spending nearly three hours lying
on my side, and they wanted to ensure I wasn't crimping any nerves
or blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to remove my left kidney; the vessels and duct
connecting it to the blood supply and bladder are longer, giving
surgeons more material to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Neither kidney, though, is particularly easy to get to. The
human rib cage exists in part to protect these vital organs, and
there's no getting around it: Forcing your ribs apart and cutting
though three layers of muscle tissue hurts like hell.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-too-distant future many kidney donors will be spared
this pain, through a new form of surgery involving a much smaller
incision and the use of a miniature camera called a laproscope.
This advance didn't quite come in time for me: Dr. Freise performed
his first laproscopic kidney removal two weeks after he did mine
the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing spectacles outfitted with tiny microscopes, Dr. Freise
made a 6-inch horizontal cut with a cautery unit _ an electric
scalpel _ along my left-side love handle and sawed off an inch and
a half of my 12th rib.
</P>
<P>
   Using metal retractors, the surgeons spread the rest of my 12th
rib apart from my 11th and cut through the muscle tissue beneath to
reveal my left kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Freise clamped off the two major vessels attached to it: the
renal artery that brings dirty blood into the organ and the renal
vein that carries clean blood back out, plus the ureter, the duct
that transports urine to my bladder.
</P>
<P>
   And then he waited for word from the operating room next door.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   FROM JOHN TO JERI
</P>
<P>
   Once I was under anesthesia, orderlies wheeled Jeri into
Operating Room No. 5 next door. Because of her heart disease, she
was labeled a ``very high risk'' kidney recipient. Dr. Kelley later
told me that my wife was 10 times more likely than a normal patient
to have a heart attack on the operating table. He had a ``crash
cart'' with a defibrillator waiting outside in the hallway, and a
team of cardiologists was on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kelley kept a nervous eye on her EKG and blood pressure
levels throughout the three-hour operation, and only toward the end
could he begin to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was rock stable from start to finish,'' he later told me.
``Not even a hint of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Jeri was out cold, Dr. Stock used the cautery unit to cut a
5-inch vertical incision below her belly button.
</P>
<P>
   What surprises most people about kidney transplants is that the
new one doesn't go where the old ones are. It doesn't matter much
where the transplanted kidney resides, as long as it's hooked up to
the blood supply and bladder. To spare the recipient the pain of
having their ribs spread apart, surgeons usually leave the old,
diseased kidneys where they are, and install the new one in front,
next to the bladder. As a result, transplant recipients typically
end up with three kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jeri was opened up, Dr. Stock sent a nurse over to my
operating room to relay the message: ``We're ready. Are you?''
</P>
<P>
   This was the point of no return for my kidney. Dr. Freise cut
the renal vein, artery and ureter, and gently lifted out my organ.
Like Hamlet holding the skull, he lifted the organ up to examine it
in the light. It was warm, and as soon as he had cut off the blood
supply all the color had drained out of it: it changed instantly
from pink-purple to white-gray.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stock came into the room holding a little kidney-shaped
plastic tray full of ice. Dr. Freise gently placed my kidney into
it, and Dr. Stock backed carefully through the double doors into
the scrub room, and then through another set of doors into Jeri's
operating room.
</P>
<P>
   At a table next to Jeri's gurney, Dr. Stock and his assistants
spent several minutes flushing my blood and urine out of the kidney
with a cold saline solution. Then he lowered it into Jeri's belly
and connected the renal artery and vein into her blood system.
</P>
<P>
   Before he attached the ureter, he gave the kidney a little poke.
A stream of urine gushed into the air, like that of a baby boy
getting his diapers changed. Dr. Stock smiled. For a transplant
surgeon, this is a sign of a job well done: It meant that within
minutes of being installed, my wife's new kidney was doing its job
with gusto.

</P>
<P>
   KICKED BY A YAK
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, the day after surgery. I was lying in my bed
in the kidney transplant ward of UC-San Francisco in a mild
narcotic haze, feeling like I'd been gored by a yak. There was a
knock on my door. It swung open, and there was Jeri, in her robe
and slippers, attached to a wheeled pole festooned with IV bags and
tubes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time we'd seen each other since the transplant.
Her face was rosy, and she was beaming. She looked wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been peeing like a racehorse,'' she said. ``Your kidney
is going gangbusters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We Flinns have always prided ourselves on our kidneys,'' I
said. ``But this one's yours now.''
</P>
<P>
   They had assigned us to private rooms on opposite ends of the
transplant ward. There was a reason: If we wanted to see each
other, we were going to have to get up and walk.
</P>
<P>
   Several times a day we'd grab our IV poles, ease ourselves
stiffly and painfully out of bed _ picture the Tin Man just before
he ran out of oil _ and walk laps together around the transplant
ward. I quickly learned to read a medical chart, and as we passed
each patient's room I smiled with pride: Jeri's kidney function was
the best in the entire ward.
</P>
<P>
   We both improved rapidly. By Friday we were able to walk two
laps around the floor without resting. By Saturday we could knock
off four laps without painkillers. On Sunday morning a nurse
brought by some papers to sign, pulled out my IVs and catheters and
told me I could change out of my hospital gown and into my
``civilian clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're being discharged,'' she said. ``You're free to go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   I walked over to Jeri's room to tell her the good news and found
her in bed, looking like she was about to cry. Dr. Deborah Adey,
one of the kidney transplant specialists assigned to the floor, was
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeri's running a little fever,'' Dr. Adey said. ``Just to be
on the safe side, we're going to have to keep her here another day,
at least.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a rejection?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know yet, so we'll have to watch her carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, blood tests showed that Jeri's kidney function had
declined sharply. Her immune system apparently had identified her
new organ as an invader and was attacking it.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, while I was home in bed, a nurse gave her a
large injection of a powerful anti-rejection drug called OKT3.
Derived from a protein found in mouse urine, it's effective but
fraught with side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, Jeri's jaw started to chatter uncontrollably.
Fever and nausea washed over her. The muscles in her hips and legs
trembled and cramped. She lay in her bed and screamed. She felt as
if she was having a seizure.
</P>
<P>
   A friend who had chosen that moment to drop by for a visit ran
out in the hallway and found a nurse, who eventually came in and
gave Jeri a shot of Demerol, a painkiller. Moments later the
tremors subsided and her cramped muscles relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment called for Jeri to get an injection of OKT3 each
day for the next week to 10 days. She made sure to have a nurse
standing by with Demerol the next time, but the reaction was never
as bad as the first time.
</P>
<P>
   And the OKT3 did its job: Jeri's kidney function improved
rapidly, a sign the rejection had been beaten back. On Friday, nine
days after the operation, she was discharged from the hospital;
she'd be allowed to come back for the rest of her shots as an
outpatient.
</P>
<P>
   As a parting gift, the hospital presented her with the totem of
a kidney transplant patient: a red plastic tackle box filled with a
dozen different prescription drugs, most of which she'll have to
take every day for the rest of her life.

<P>
   After major surgery, Jeri and I have an odd little ritual: As
soon as she feels good enough to get out of the house we celebrate
with a round of miniature golf. On a sunny November afternoon,
three weeks after she was released from UC-San Francisco, we were
at the Malibu Grand Prix course in Redwood City, lining up putts
through dragons' heads and spinning windmills. After the last hole
I added up our scores: Jeri, 61; John, 61. As a tie-breaker, we
played another round. Final score: Jeri, 59; John, 59.
</P>
<P>
   We turned out to be a pretty good match after all.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I meant to be tender, but I was squeezing Jeri's
hand so hard she winced.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing matching hospital gowns and attached to a bewildering
profusion of tubes and monitors, my wife and I were lying side by
side on twin gurneys pushed together in the busy fourth-floor
pre-op room at UC-San Francisco's Moffitt/Long Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, I'd been full of hearty, but false, bravado. ``Hey,
how bad can it be?'' I'd say. But now my bluff was being called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be OK,'' Jeri whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, residents and interns were
crowding around us, jotting down information on medical charts,
conferring solemnly with each other and porcupining our arms with
needles for blood extractions and intravenous fluid drips.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hallway, side-by-side operating rooms were being
readied.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, we're going to take you first,'' said Dr. Chris Freise,
the surgeon in charge of the team performing what's known in the
transplant business as ``the harvest.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeri, they'll come get you in a little while, once we're under
way with your husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ready, John?''
</P>
<P>
   I rolled over, kissed my wife and squeezed her hand one last
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck in there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year in the United States, kidney transplants gave 12,000
critically ill people a chance at life. A tiny percentage of these
involved a group of donor-recipient pairs who wouldn't even have
been considered a few years ago _ husbands and wives. This is the
story of one.
</P>
<P>
   Healers and self-styled wizards have been experimenting with
organ transplants since the time of the ancient Egyptians, but it
wasn't until 1954 _ two years before Jeri and I were born _ that
surgeons began to solve the riddle. In that year a team led by Dr.
Joseph Murray at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston successfully
transplanted a kidney between identical twins, a feat that earned
Murray a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   When physicians tried to repeat the operation with patients who
weren't genetically identical, though, the recipient's immune
system treated the new kidney as an invader _ a massive infection,
in a sense _ and attacked and crippled it.
</P>
<P>
   What doctors needed was a way to trick the patient's immune
system into accepting the organ as the patient's own. That was the
goal in the 1950s, and it's still the goal today. It's proven to be
a tougher problem than anyone imagined.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, researchers looked for ways to weaken the
immune system's defenses without crippling them entirely. The first
steroids designed for this appeared in the 1960s and '70s, but they
were crude tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the dark age of transplants,'' said Dr. Stephen
Tomlanovich, professor of clinical medicine and surgery at the
University of California at San Francisco. ``We were seeing a lot
of side effects and bad outcomes. We really didn't understand the
process of rejection.``
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough came from an unlikely place: a fungus found in
soil above the Arctic Circle. From that source, British researchers
in the late 1970s produced a drug called cyclosporin, which
specifically targeted the cells that attack new organs, without
crippling the patient's entire immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years have seen an explosion of promising new
immunosuppressant drugs, as biotechnology labs have made dramatic
advances fusing human and mouse cells, and creating monoclonal
antibodies, which target very specific cells. Physicians are now
able to prescribe refined, low-dose cocktails of drugs such as
Prograf, Cellcept and Prednisone, which help block rejection with
far fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
   With these new tools, surgeons are now performing operations
that were thought to have little chance of success just a few years
ago, such as live-donor transplants between people who share no
genetic material at all.
</P>
<P>
   People like Jeri and me.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   A LIFELONG FIGHT FOR LIFE
</P>
<P>
   My wife was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 1. Every day
she gets up long before dawn to give herself the first of five
daily injections of insulin. Six or seven times a day she also
pricks her finger to test the level of sugar in her blood. She
counts carbohydrate grams compulsively, and still goes into
diabetic shock several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has ravaged her heart: High blood sugar levels
increase the risk of atherosclerosis, which leads to heart disease.
Jeri had her first quadruple heart bypass operation in 1985, her
second in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 years ago a blood test showed the first signs that her
diabetes was also crippling her kidneys. It was a slow but
inexorable process, and by the beginning of 1999 she'd lost about
85 percent of her kidney function.
</P>
<P>
   If you need a new kidney, there are two ways to get one: You can
put your name on a very long list and wait until you get to the
top, and then pray that someone with a compatible kidney checked
off the donor box on the back of their driver's license before
suffering brain death. The length of your wait depends on your
blood type and where you are, but nationally the average is about 1
1/2 years. Many people can't hold out that long: Every two hours,
on average, someone in the United States dies waiting for a kidney.
</P>
<P>
   The other way is for a loved one to offer you one of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The kidneys filter waste and excess fluid out of your
bloodstream, and make hormones that, among other things, produce
red blood cells and regulate your blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   A single kidney can easily handle this job. No one seems to know
why nature supplies us with a spare, while giving only one heart,
liver and pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999, the phone on my desk rang. Jeri was on the other
end, but I couldn't make out what she was saying. She was sobbing.
Finally she got it out: ``UCSF just called,'' she said. ``They
disqualified Sue.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the worst possible news. Jeri's sister Sue had looked
to be a perfect match _ ``practically a genetic mirror image,'' the
doctors had told us. But one of the final tests detected a trace of
protein in her urine, a sign that her own kidneys were not 100
percent healthy. It probably wouldn't cause her problems, the
doctors said, but to be on the safe side they would have to
disqualify her as a donor.
</P>
<P>
   Sue had been our last hope among Jeri's blood relatives. Her
brother had been turned down because of high blood pressure, and
her parents were too old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get tested next,'' I said, trying to sound more confident
than I felt.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, transplant centers will consider a spouse only once
all blood relatives have been ruled out. But from the start, I had
wanted very badly to be Jeri's donor. When she'd had her two heart
bypass operations I'd felt helpless, unable to do anything more
than hold her hand. Now, if by some small miracle I was qualified
to give her one of my kidneys, I could share her burden in a
tangible way.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, we didn't look like a good match: We have different
blood types, and an early test showed that we share only one of six
antigens. (Jeri and her sister had been a perfect six-for-six
match.)

SURPRISED BUSH, McCAIN CONVERGE ON SOUTH CAROLINA 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Presidential hopefuls John McCain and George
W. Bush, both a little surprised by the whipping New Hampshire
voters gave the Texas governor, descended on South Carolina on
Wednesday with a fervor to shore up their faithful and bring in new
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire killed the coronation,'' the Arizona senator
declared after a two-hour nap between his 19-point victory Tuesday
night and his Wednesday morning news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been enjoying the presumption that he had the
nomination sewn up months ago, admitted the size of McCain's win
caught him off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody was surprised. We were having big crowds. At
least my antennae were telling me we were moving pretty good in New
Hampshire,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was ``pleased and humbled'' by his victory, but
stressed the importance of winning South Carolina on Feb. 19.
McCain hopes to build a coalition of college students, senior
citizens and veterans to ``shake up the Republican establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night New Hampshire ended and a national crusade began,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in McCain's candidacy around the country surged, with
Internet surfers making nearly $500,000 in contributions through
McCain's Web site since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is still trailing by 20 points in Palmetto State
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering how his father turned his 1988 campaign around in
South Carolina, Bush appealed to conservatives Wednesday. His first
stop was at Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist Christian
college that forbids interracial dating or marriage among its
students.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also picked up the endorsement of his father's vice
president, Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to ``solidify my base,'' Bush delivered some of his
most strident rhetoric to date in the speech at Bob Jones
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are conservatives because we believe in freedom and its
possibilities, family and its values, and faith and its mercies,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conservatives believe in opportunities for all Americans:
rich and poor, people from all walks of life and all backgrounds,
young and old, born and unborn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later said he opposes the school's ban on interracial
relationships but spoke at the school because of the large
conservative audience.
</P>
<P>
   Then the governor turned his fire on McCain. While exit polls
showed Bush's promise of a $483 billion tax cut did not impress New
Hampshire voters, Bush stood firm and claimed McCain, like
Democrats, wants to keep a large portion of the federal budget
surplus in Washington for spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be spent, government will grow and the reach of the
federal government will expand,'' Bush said. ``It's bad enough when
Democrats speak against meaningful tax cuts. It's worse when
Republicans like my chief rival in this state do so.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he would use the surplus to pay down the
national debt while giving a tax cut half the size of Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began calling McCain the ``moderate to liberal'' candidate
in the race almost as soon as the results were announced Tuesday in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain took what was intended as a slur and ran with it as a
sign of his electability in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a proud conservative Republican,'' McCain insisted, and
his better-than-75 percent voting ratings by conservative groups
bolstered his claim. But he said he won New Hampshire because
``thousands'' of independent voters with differing views registered
as Republicans in response to his message of government reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of waste and corruption. They view me as a
way to get their government back,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electability is all about getting the support of the political
center. With this message of reform, we will attract to our banner
people from all over the political spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, he compared himself to former President
Reagan, who is still revered in this strongly Republican state. He
said Reagan was able to attract voters of different political
stripes without sacrificing his conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also offered a sharp retort to Bush's criticism that the
Arizona senator is running a a campaign targeted at only a handful
of states, while the Texas governor is pushing a nationwide effort
with operations in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``My response is he's now running in 49 states,'' the senator
said, smiling. He said he hopes to prove in the next four primaries
_ South Carolina, Arizona, Michigan and California _ that he can
run well against Bush in all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that Sen. Robert Dole rebounded from a New Hampshire
election defeat in 1996 with a big South Carolina victory over Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina has had a history of ending primaries for
candidates. And South Carolinians enjoy that,'' Bush said. ``So
there's a sense of challenge. They (Bush supporters) welcome the
challenge, and so do I.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not mention that his father shored up his 1988

WALL-TO-WALL TV COVERAGE OF TRAGEDY CAN BE BAD JOURNALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As with carpeting, wall-to-wall isn't always a good
idea when it comes to covering news on television. Most of the
time, local TV's blanket treatment of calamitous events is cynical,
ratings-driven journalism, plain and simple. News directors of the
stations will disagree, but the evidence against them is damning.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Monday as Exhibit A. When Alaska Airlines Flight 261
vanished into the Pacific Ocean, Seattle's three major network
affiliates went with unbroken reporting from late in the afternoon
until the start of prime-time programming at 8 p.m. This might
suggest there simply were no new developments to report after 8,
but the reality is that there were almost no new developments to
report before 8, certainly not enough to warrant staying on the air
with exclusive coverage for more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there's anything we have learned from the crashes of
TWA 800, Swissair 111, EgyptAir 990 and John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
private aircraft, it is that there's precious little real news
emerging in the first few hours after a plane crash, especially
when the plane is in pieces on the ocean floor. Yet we are all
numbly familiar with the drill. We turn on the television, see an
overhead camera shot of dark ocean water shimmering in the lights
of search vessels and instinctively know that a plane has gone down
and that TV anchors/reporters/experts will be filling the next few
hours with repetitive, speculative and sometimes erroneous
information.
</P>
<P>
   To what end? Are the interests of journalism really being served
when anchors tell us for the 25th time that a plane has crashed,
many people are presumed dead and we don't know why?
</P>
<P>
   The usual answer from station management is that not everyone
watches TV the way a TV critic watches TV, that most people might
be tuning in for ``Jeopardy!'' at 7:30, not having heard anything
about the crash. The blanket coverage, they say, is an ongoing
public service to inform as many viewers as possible about a
dramatic, major news event.
</P>
<P>
   What hooey!
</P>
<P>
   If the stations want to provide continuous coverage, all they
have to do is run the latest information in a ``crawl'' at the
bottom of the screen, allowing their staffs to prepare thoughtful,
informative reports for later newscasts. If developments warrant,
the stations can do exactly what they did after 8 o'clock Monday,
that is, break in with updates whenever they considered it prudent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that would serve the public interest, but let's go beyond
altruism for a moment and see what's really at play here. Careful.
This won't be pretty. The real problem is the viewing public,
specifically, our unquenchable curiosity for the dramatic, the
tragic, the unspeakably horrible. When KIRO-TV, the CBS affiliate,
covered the disturbances during the first day of the World Trade
Organization meetings with a breathlessness that suggested Seattle
was on the verge of social collapse, its ratings went north faster
than swallows in spring. Suddenly, the No. 3 station was queen for
a day.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, KOMO-TV's more measured WTO coverage _ it
didn't go wall-to-wall immediately _ left the No. 2 station
reeling. An executive at another Seattle station asked me if I
thought KOMO's news director might get fired because of its poor
ratings performance.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that such a question would even be asked is telling.
(KOMO came out on top Monday.) But if you consider Monday's
coverage pattern, it's pretty easy to become skeptical of each
station's motivation. They all went to blanket coverage around the
time they would be airing their own 5 p.m. newscasts. No problem
there. But to pre-empt all other information, along with the
networks' nightly news shows and the hour of ``fringe'' programming
before the start of prime time, is ludicrous unless there is some
in-house knowledge that the abandonment of all journalistic
perspective will somehow goose the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, during KIRO's coverage Monday, one reporter related
an old saw that aviation people tend to believe. Paraphrased, it
goes something like this: ``Whatever is learned about a plane crash
on the first day is usually wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the blanket coverage persists in the hours immediately
afterward because we viewers have this morbid curiosity. What's a
newscaster to do?
</P>
<P>
   Easy. Responsible journalism requires reporters and editors to
make the best calls they can, with the information at hand, about
what's news and what's not. Sometimes a happy byproduct of these
selective decisions is that readers and viewers become smarter, and
maybe even better, people.
</P>
<P>
   When TV coverage goes wall-to-wall, that rarely happens.
Stations assume that because they have the advantage of immediacy,
they should go on the air quickly and stay on the air, just in
case. That makes perfect sense in public emergencies and maybe even
cases like the shipyard shooting last November, when a gunman was
believed to be on the loose in a Seattle neighborhood. But
providing exhaustive coverage of a calamity when there is nothing
to report doesn't make us smarter people. It feeds our baser
instincts, and while it may be good business for a TV station to
engage in such activity, it's lousy journalism.

&HT;     POLICE GROUP URGES BOYCOTT OF BENETTON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the country's largest police unions called
Wednesday for a nationwide boycott of Benetton clothing to protest
the Italian firm's new advertising campaign opposing capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cabral, president of the International Union of Police
Associations, which represents more than 80,000 law enforcement
officers, accused the $2 billion Benetton Group of trying to
glorify ``wanton criminals just to peddle some clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   He also charged that the firm was seeking to ``humanize''
vicious killers while ignoring the tragedies of their victims.
``You cannot humanize these inhuman monsters,'' he said, adding
that ``any profits from sales generated by this campaign are
nothing more than blood money.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, titled ``We, On Death Row,'' features
photographs of 26 Death Row inmates in U.S. prisons. Their faces
are appearing on billboards and magazine ads across the world with
the words ``sentenced to death'' in bold letters above their
portraits. The company has also produced a 96-page newspaper
supplement in which the inmates also are interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Death Row'' ads are running on three billboards in New
York City through February as well as in the Feb. 7 issue of the
New Yorker, Vanity Fair for March, Rolling Stone for Feb. 17 and
three other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Benetton officials said they hope the ads will stimulate
discussion about the death penalty and draw attention to continuing
executions in America. Since 1984 Benetton has used its ad
campaigns to focus on global issues like AIDS, racism, religion and
the war in Bosnia. The company has been praised by many for helping
to raise public consciousness about the issues, but it also has
been accused of using them to gain publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Benetton spokesman Mark Major said the new campaign seeks to
provide ``a human face to the prisoners on Death Row'' and to
remind death-penalty advocates ``that the debate concerns men and
women in flesh and blood, not virtual characters eliminated or
spared with a simple click as with a video game.''
</P>
<P>
   But victims' rights groups as well as police organizations have
denounced the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a death penalty issue; it's a human issue,'' said
Nancy Ruhe-Munch, executive director of the Cincinnati-based
National Organization of Parents of Murdered Children, which does
not take a stand on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   She said the ad campaign is ``a slap in the face'' to survivors,
to law enforcement officials who investigated and prosecuted the
cases and to the jurors who convicted the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything these people did, now you have somebody over
in Italy who says, `I don't care, because I have enough money (to
put up) billboards on my views on capital punishment,''' she said.
Ruhe-Munch's group and other victims-rights organizations also have
called for a boycott of Benetton clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Cabral of the police unions association said he will urge
municipal and transit officials around the country to refuse
Benetton advertising on publicly owned buses and billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``No responsible elected official in this country should become
an accomplice to Benetton's greedy disregard for the victims and
their families who suffered at the hands of such vicious
criminals,'' Cabral said.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ For the last five months I have been writing
from Nashville, searching for the heart of Music City. I have gone
to the mansions of country stars, the shotgun shacks of forgotten
singers, the offices of music executives, the dressing rooms of the
Grand Ole Opry and the basements where the wax figures of
yesterday's country stars lay vandalized. And then one day I found
it: the soul of a city that residents often say lacks one.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a hotel and bar: a hotel where the hopeful go to
fulfill their dreams, a bar where the jaded go to forget they ever
had dreams. The place was the Quality Inn Hall of Fame Hotel and
Lounge, perched in faded yellow and brown splendor at the head of
the strip of record labels and publishing houses known as Music
Row. For more than 25 years, it has been ground zero for country
music ambition in Nashville: here you find the wannabe, the
has-been and the never-was. The tight jeans, cowboy hats, spangles,
platinum perms and mullet cuts. The talented unknowns, the known
talents and the no talents. Everyone there shares the same dream,
but each has a different story.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to spend a recent Sunday interviewing guests in the
lobby, rooms and bar to chronicle a day in the life of the Hall of
Fame Hotel and Lounge. Nashville is not a great city for live
music. It is more like Detroit: they make the cars there but race
them elsewhere. So a night out in Nashville often means going
somewhere to watch those who are waiting for their chance to get on
the assembly line. Many people in Nashville, from stars to
executives, confess that when they first came to town, the first
place they looked for performance opportunities and business
contacts was the Hall of Fame Hotel, which has been a musical dive
since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The story began in mid-afternoon in the lobby, under the glow of
halogen lights and the gaze of drooping, discolored plastic
flowers. Mark Shaw, a former hotel security guard who had been
staying in one of the rooms for several weeks, was marched into a
squad car outside, accused of violating probation. As the police
sped away, Rickey Lee Watson pulled into the parking lot after a
12-hour drive from New York. A large man with long brown hair
hanging out of a black cowboy hat, a cross earring and a thick
mustache, he strode into the lobby and instantly began handing out
autographed photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Watson came here with a dream 10 years ago and ended up
homeless. ``I slept at the Dumpster where Warner/Chappell and
Sony's offices are for over two and a half years,'' he said. ``I
was skinny as a rail, with no money or food.''
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Michale, interrupted: ``I'd come up here to bring
him back to Florida because he couldn't take it anymore as far as
his health was concerned. I'd tell him not to go back to Nashville,
that it was time for him to get on with his life. And he'd say,
`No, music is my life.'''
</P>
<P>
   At 41, Watson is ready to try again: he plans to complete a new
album and make the rounds at the major labels. But he has learned
to lower his expectations. ``I just expect to get up in the morning
and breathe and try it again,'' he said. ``And I'll keep swinging
until I take a dirt nap.''
</P>
<P>
   Debby Triplett, a 30-year-old sales director who has worked at
the hotel since she was 18, has seen her share of people like
Watson. Sure, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tracy Lawrence and scores more were
regulars at the hotel before they recorded their first albums, and
the walls near the hotel bathroom are decorated with glossy photos
of celebrity guests like Loretta Lynn and Porter Wagoner. But most
often that's not the case. Triplett said: ``I've seen this town
just eat people up. They come in with their dreams and aspirations
and leave with their tail between their legs.''
</P>
<P>
   As dusk fell, the live-music lounge, which has been everything
from a country star hangout to a theater for country-singing
Australian twins, began to fill with regulars: singers, songwriters
and seasoned musicians who have played with Hank Williams Jr.,
Waylon Jennings and Steppenwolf. Beyond music, there were older,
cowboy-hatted characters like Earl Reed. A local B-movie director,
Reed hangs out at the lounge almost every week scouting for new
talent for his films. In his shirt pocket were several photographs
of bar regulars in bloody scenes from his slasher film ``Blood and
Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson walked into the bar and sat near the dartboards.
``Everyone here sings,'' he explained as a newly hired waitress
arrived at the table. ``Are you a singer?'' he asked her.
</P>
<P>
   She shrugged and replied, ``Isn't everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Perkins, a guitarist who used to play with Tammy Wynette
and performs regularly in a bar he runs downtown, sat on the other
side of the room. ``Year 2000! Record deal!'' he shouted tipsily,
slamming his fist on the bar three times for emphasis. ``I'm so
happy! Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most interesting characters in town are the
songwriters, whose presence makes Nashville a Tin Pan Alley of the
South so different from other music capitals. These days
songwriting has a lot less to do with creating a three-minute
Shakespearean tragedy for Southern men and women than with coming
up with a marketing jingle to sell a song to a middle-class
audience _ a lyric like ``I'm a single white female, looking for a
man like you,'' from the recent Chely Wright hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Anthony, a songwriter who used to sleep in the parking lot
across the street, pulled a crumpled royalty check out of his
pocket for a Kiss song he wrote and displayed it to anyone within
earshot, complaining that he had been shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight in a hotel room upstairs, a Kentucky band called
Butcher Holler was meeting with a smooth-talking prospective
manager who was filling their heads with success stories of new
arrivals in town.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage in the lounge, a friendly never-say-die hopeful named
Sammy Harp was singing ``Family Tradition'' with the house band.
Still standing at the bar, Anthony paid the band no mind: instead,
he thumped out a completely different beat on the counter and began
belting out a new song he wrote. With lyrics of self-consolation,
it could be a theme for a night at the Hall of Fame Hotel and
Lounge: ``I may not be a legend,'' he sang. ``I may not be a star,
but I'm still alive.''

   WASHINGTON _ One of the country's largest police unions called
Wednesday for a nationwide boycott of Benetton clothing to protest
the Italian firm's new advertising campaign opposing capital
punishment.
</P>

   Sam Cabral, president of the International Union of Police

``You cannot humanize these inhuman monsters,'' he said, adding
that ``any profits from sales generated by this campaign are
nothing more than blood money.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, titled ``We, On Death Row,'' features
photographs of 26 Death Row inmates in U.S. prisons. Their faces
are appearing on billboards and magazine ads across the world with
the words ``sentenced to death'' in bold letters above their
portraits. The company has also produced a 96-page newspaper
supplement in which the inmates also are interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Death Row'' ads are running on three billboards in New
York City through February as well as in the Feb. 7 issue of the
New Yorker, Vanity Fair for March, Rolling Stone for Feb. 17 and
three other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Benetton officials said they hope the $20 million ad campaign
will stimulate discussion about the death penalty and draw
attention to continuing executions in America. Since 1984 Benetton
has used its ad campaigns to focus on global issues like AIDS,

WEBMONEY (Undated) - Moments after Arizona Sen. John McCain's
landslide victory in New Hampshire was announced, the donations
began flowing in via the Web. By the end of Wednesday, his campaign
had collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from Web
contributors around the country. It's money he desperately needs if
he is to have a chance to defeat Texas Gov. George Bush - and it's
another sign that the Internet is having dramatic impact on the
nature of fundraising. By JON KAMMAN. Story will move in the `A`
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MD80 (Phoenix) - The horizontal stabilizer that caused an American
Airlines MD80 to turn back Wednesday at Phoenix Sky Harbor
International Airport also was a problem a year ago with an MD80
flying in Alaska. Coupled with Monday's Alaska Airlines crash in
which the stabilizer is suspect, we check with aviation-safety
authorities to see if there will be any attempt to step up
compliance with an FAA
</P>
<P>
   directive requiring the stabilizers to be inspected. By MARY JO
PITZL. Story will move in the `A` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - The people of New Hampshire reaffirmed
what I and every other thoughtful journalist who's gotten to know
to Sen. John McCain has said for a long time: The man should be
president. I say this not because, as a long-time Arizona
journalist, I know McCain, but because, as a long-time Arizona
politician, he knows ME. Is that cool, or what? By EJ MONTINI.
Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL;

   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Gail Roper's biography would be perfect for
a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The opening scene would find the Larkfield resident on the stage
of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   She'd be surrounded by famous swimmers Matt Biondi, Donna de
Varona, Mark Spitz and Esther Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The year would be 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to Roper at the microphone where she is making her
acceptance speech _ and thinking back to 1952 and the Summer
Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   So overcome with emotion, she can barely finish.
</P>
<P>
   Then the film begins to tell the story of a long journey, 46
years to be exact, that took Roper from the heartbreak of failing
to win a medal at the Olympics to induction into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Roper's story is one of second chances, or more precisely,
making the most of second chances.
</P>
<P>
   Now 70, the mother of seven got her ticket into the Hall of Fame
by capitalizing on her second career as a swimmer and becoming the
world's most dominant female senior citizen swimmer. She
monopolizes her sport like Tiger Woods monopolizes golf. No, she's
more dominant.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Masters Swimming Association compiles rankings in 18
events for swimmers 70 and older. Roper is No. 1 in all 18 events.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-meter freestyle is the 100-meter dash of swimming. The
athlete with the best time is regarded as the fastest on earth.
Roper hasn't lost a 100-meter freestyle race in 30 years. Two
months ago, she set the world mark of 1:18.67 at a meet in
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Roper is enjoying success and recognition she never could have
envisioned that day in the Helsinki Olympic pool when her dreams
and self-esteem evaporated faster than you can say ``pulled
ligament.''
</P>
<P>
   Roper arrived in Finland as America's best hope for a medal in
the 200-meter breaststroke. The New Jersey native, then 23, was an
eight-time national champion and had finished first in the U.S.
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that day in Helsinki like it was yesterday,'' Roper
said. ``It was the trials to qualify for the finals and everyone
told me I'd have no problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pool was supposed to be heated but the water temperature
was only 70 degrees. It was supposed to be closer to 80. From the
moment I got in the water I started shaking uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when the race began, the cold water caused my muscles to
contract and the next thing I knew I'd pulled a ligament in my
ankle.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to to kick effectively, Roper began falling behind.
Struggling to finish, she failed to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crushed,'' Roper said. ``Winning an Olympic medal had
been my lifelong goal and then to fail, even though it was because
of an injury, was devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Roper was determined to make amends in the 1956 Olympics. She
was ranked No. 1 in the world in the 100-meter butterfly in '53.
However, she said, the U.S. Olympic Committee was no longer
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to be 27 in 1956 and I was told I was too old. All
the top swimmers were in their teens.''
</P>

S.C. TAKES A FRESH LOOK AT MCCAIN _ AND LIKES WHAT IT SEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SC-MCCAIN-BUSH, SC-BUSH) 
 (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ It is virtually illegal in this state to
acknowledge that any event in New Hampshire might possibly
influence the thinking of a South Carolinian. But suddenly, a day
after Sen. John McCain's smashing victory up north, there seemed to
be a lot more McCain admirers eating lunch here than there were
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was for Bush,'' said Barbara Stevens, the
bookkeeper at the Beacon Drive-In Restaurant here, where McCain and
his entourage stopped by for breakfast Wednesday morning. ``But
boy, after I heard McCain today, I just don't know. I really liked
what he had to say, and he just seems so honest.''
</P>
<P>
   An entirely unscientific survey of lunch patrons around
Spartanburg Wednesday found quite a few more people expressing
interest in McCain than a similarly unscientific survey last week
in neighboring Greenville. There are, to be sure, many firm
supporters of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who continues to lead
in the statewide polls two and a half weeks before the Feb. 19
Republican primary here. But his double-digit loss in New Hampshire
has clearly shaken his standing here, even if it does not finally
alter the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I bet that opened Bush's eyes a little bit,'' said David
Graham, who works at Contec, a technical manufacturer here, as he
walked into the Sugar and Spice restaurant. ``And I'm hearing a lot
of people take a second look at McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent pre-New Hampshire poll showed Bush with a
21-point lead over McCain in this conservative state, which has
long been suspicious of political insurgencies. In years past, it
has rejected the candidacies of conservatives like Pat Robertson
and Pat Buchanan in favor of mainstream Republicans like Bob Dole
and Bush's father, former President George Bush, and most political
experts expect it to do so again in the upcoming primary, setting
Bush on a winning course to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders in the Greenville-Spartanburg area, the core
of the state's Republican bulwark, have come out strongly for Bush
and say they will work to ensure that support doesn't drop. Four
well-dressed men getting out of a Buick LeSabre in front of the
Skillet Restaurant downtown Wednesday suggested that McCain's
battle remains uphill. Asked their preference, they responded
individually, machine-gun fire: ``Bush.'' ``Bush.'' ``Bush.''
``Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Miles, a cosmetologist eating at the Sugar and Spice, made
it clear that New Hampshire hasn't changed her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what Bush has done in Texas, and I want him to do the
same for everyone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But across town at the Beacon, there were entire tables of newly
found McCain supporters. Billy O'Shields, an insurance agent, was
discussing the campaign with three friends over a late lunch, and
said he has concluded in the last few weeks that McCain's resume is
more impressive than Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because of New Hampshire _ don't you think that,''
O'Shields said. ``But I personally feel Bush does not have enough
experience in foreign policy. He talks all the time about
education, but what does a president have to do with education?
That's a state thing. McCain just has a lot more experience as a
senator than he does as a governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Collier, who runs the Collier Auto garage nearby and was
also sitting at the table, said he likes McCain's military
background. But he predicted that in the end, the primary would go
to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his daddy's name,'' Collier said. ``He's real popular
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yard signs for Bush seem to outnumber those for McCain around
here, and he has filled local radio stations with advertisements
reminding South Carolina that he has long supported abstinence
programs for young people. One ad closes with the tag line,
``George Bush, conservative Republican for president.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relative conservatism of the two candidates is rarely
mentioned by people who have made up their minds. Most people
interviewed talked instead of the candidates' character, their
background, their personalities. Asked whether he believes McCain
is a candidate of the left, as Bush's local campaign officials are
now maintaining, one man said that was nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is ex-military, and that's what counts,'' said George
Wallace, a former marine who served in Vietnam, walking into the
Sugar and Spice. ``To me, for being president of the United States,
a prerequisite should be ex-military, and knowing how to make up
your mind. When Bush goes wishy-washy on abortion, well, he should
just say whatever he really believes.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle Haney, a computer technician eating at the same
restaurant, was even more emphatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I heard McCain won up in New Hampshire,'' he said. ``But
you know what? I might still vote for the guy.''

LOSING A MUSE AND MOVING ON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Howard Feinstein is a film critic who writes for Detour magazine
and Time Out New York.  
 By HOWARD FEINSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first six films by the Chinese director Zhang Yimou had a
strong structuring device in the stunning form of Gong Li, China's
best-known actress. From their debut feature, ``Red Sorghum''
(1988), through the international hits ``Ju Dou'' (1990) and
``Raise the Red Lantern'' (1991), to ``The Story of Qiu Jiu''
(1992) and ``To Live'' (1994), Zhang was involved personally and
professionally with Ms. Gong. But during the production of
``Shanghai Triad'' (1995), she terminated the relationship, and,
within a year, married a wealthy Singaporean businessman. Filmmaker
and performer have not collaborated since.
</P>
<P>
   Something lost is something gained, according to the 49-year-old
director. ``I gained a new freedom,'' he says now, speaking through
a translator during a visit to New York. Slim, handsome, and with
an engaging smile, he speaks softly in a deep voice. ``Gong Li and
I were together for eight years. Right after our very first film,
she became a movie star. We became a star combination. I was always
thinking about the actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I had an idea, I would wonder: `Can she do it? Would
it be good for her?' We would fight. Working with her implied a
certain shape of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   His first two post-Gong Li efforts, the urban comedy ``Keep
Cool'' (1996) and the rural drama ``Not One Less'' (1999), are
indeed departures for Zhang. That ``Not One Less,'' which opens
here on Feb. 18, took the Golden Lion for best film at the 1999
Venice Film Festival supports the old adage about clouds and silver
linings.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Gong Li, I wanted to do something different,'' Zhang
says. ``Almost all of her parts were bigger-than-life women,
symbols living under the oppression of feudalism and patriarchy.
They were characters close to life, but not close to everyday
people. Sometimes you miss what you have not been eating. I decided
to make films about little people: ordinary, common people.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the characters in ``Keep Cool,'' which never found an
American distributor, are working-class city folk who spend their
time chasing prosperity under the critical scrutiny of Zhang's
jumpy handheld camera.
</P>
<P>
   And almost everyone in ``Not One Less'' is a peasant. Here,
Zhang tackles the enormous problem of rural poverty in China. He
focuses on underfinanced education, especially in the desperate
villages that lack the resources to adequately maintain and supply
their tumbledown schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the young students drop out to work at home or in a
nearby city, often on their own. ``Chinese people are so busy
pursuing material goods that they are not concerned that their kids
are not getting an education,'' says Zhang.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Wei, who produced both ``Keep Cool'' and ``Shanghai
Triad,'' says Zhang is intrigued by the impact of prosperity:
``Yimou wants to show that, with everybody in China making money,
relationships between people are changing.'' In fact, Zhang has
been forced to become more astute about the financial end of
production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a film does not recoup its costs in China, you're not going
to make another one,'' he says. ``And you're not going to make a
film without attracting investors.'' He says that some of his
fellow Fifth Generation filmmakers _ the 1982 graduates of the
Beijing Film Academy, the first trained after the Cultural
Revolution _ must now work in television, largely because they are
unable to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not One Less'' is set far away from the investment worries of
the Beijing film community, although the village of Shuiquan is
only a three-and-a-half-hour drive from the capital. ``You wouldn't
think that so close to Beijing you would have this level of
poverty, this remoteness,'' Zhang says. ``But that's really
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang cast all nonprofessionals, most of them children. They
portray characters much like themselves, and even use their own
names in the film, the story of a class left in the hands of a
substitute when the regular teacher leaves to tend his ailing
mother. The production team looked at thousands of youngsters
before choosing Wei Minzhi to play the film's underqualified,
13-year-old substitute teacher, and Zhang Huike to play her most
troublesome _ and most endearing _ student.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang felt that filming in a documentary style, occasionally
with hidden cameras, would best serve his subject, as it had seven
years earlier in ``The Story of Qiu Jiu.'' (A former
cinematographer, Zhang is equally capable of arrestingly beautiful
imagery when his films demand it: ``Ju Dou,'' for example, with its
freshly dyed bolts of fabric waving in the wind, and ``Raise the
Red Lantern,'' with its symmetrical framing of props and people.)
</P>
<P>
   Wei Minzhi's character, who can barely read and write herself,
is stubborn. Her main, indeed only, concern is to keep the class
intact, for she has been promised a bonus upon the regular
teacher's return only if there is ``not one less'' pupil in the
class than when he departed. After Zhang Huike's invalid mother
sends him to the city of Jiangjiakou to help pay off the family's
debts, Wei Minzhi boldly heads into town to find the boy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She hunts blindly; officials dismiss her. ``Coming up against
these bureaucrats is a fact of everyday life in China,'' says
Zhang, who has a long history of tangling with the Chinese
authorities over historical and political references in his films.
Before they would approve production of ``Not One Less,'' they
demanded changes in the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censorship is worse than ever before,'' Zhang says. But he
makes concessions in order to keep his work from being banned. (The
authorities have always held against him the fact that his late
father was a military man under the pre-Communist Kuomintang, and
that his father's brother was a general who fought against the
Communists and fled to Taiwan.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept reminding me not to show China as too backward and
too poor,'' he says. In the final version of the film, he added
explanatory title cards as a postscript to soften the impact. ``I
had to be very careful with what we used for the numbers of kids
who are not able to return to school in China,'' he explains. ``I
used the number 1,000,000 on the cards. In fact, the number is
triple that. If I didn't do it that way, I wouldn't pass the
censors.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's relatively ``happy'' ending, in which Wei Minzhi and
Zhang Huike are reunited, has stirred controversy, both within and
outside China. Marco Muller, director of the Locarno Film Festival
and a champion of Chinese cinema, says that some Chinese critics
see the film as ``a public service announcement, propaganda, like
those big ads that tell you how to behave in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Barbera, director of the Venice Film Festival, offers a
more generous appraisal. ``The end of the film can be seen as a
surrender to propaganda, but what comes before it is a strong
denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education
for the country children and better life conditions in the remote
peasant villages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree,'' says Zhang, who was sent from his native Xian to
labor in villages like Shuiquan during the Cultural Revolution.
``The girl's spirit is so overpowering that the end doesn't matter.
And even though the story is a fiction, all of the everyday details
in the film are from real life. Less pleasant things do happen to
children, but I wouldn't have been able to make that story. I
wouldn't have been able to make a film in which the child wasn't
found.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Keep Cool'' and ``Not One Less'' indicate that Zhang may be
able to tackle a broader range of subjects without Ms. Gong, his
newest film, ``The Road Home,'' suggests another possibility. A
romantic, lyrical _ and much more conventional _ film, ``The Road
Home'' features a 20-year-old actress named Zhang Ziyi, who plays a
beautiful, illiterate village girl enamored of the new village
schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's camera frequently _ very frequently _ lingers on Ms.
Zhang (no relation), often in slow motion. Like ``Red Sorghum,''
``The Road Home'' (which will compete at this month's Berlin Film
Festival and will open in the United States later this year) tells
a passionate tale of courtship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that Ziyi can become another Gong Li,'' says
Zhang, carefully avoiding any mention of the personal relationship
that has developed between them. ``I selected both of them in their
second year at the Beijing Drama Academy. It's like a repeat 10
years later. When I started working with Gong Li, she was 22. When
I started with Ziyi, she was not yet 19. I am the one who
discovered her and groomed her.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he plans to work with her again, but he makes it clear
that she can be no more than a part-time muse. ``I don't think I
can repeat what I did with Gong Li,'' he says with a laugh. ``I
just can't work exclusively with her.''

BRADLEY FIGHTS ON AS GORE RUSHES BACK TO SENATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
and ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore abandoned a campaign stop in New York on
Wednesday and rushed back to Washington on a commercial flight,
prepared to break a tie vote on an abortion-rights related
amendment before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, tacked onto a major bankruptcy bill, would
prevent abortion-clinic protesters from filing bankruptcy to avoid
paying fines.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Senate, the vice president must cast
tie-breaking votes.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican senators, hoping to deny Gore the opportunity to
be president of anything, tricked Democratic leaders and supported
the abortion-rights amendment, allowing it to pass 80-17.
</P>
<P>
   A former senator also hoping to deny Gore the presidency, rival
Democratic candidate Bill Bradley, signaled Wednesday that the
combative approach he took in the last week of the New Hampshire
campaign would continue into March.
</P>
<P>
   That's when New York, California, Connecticut, Ohio and several
other states conduct primaries that will award a hefty and perhaps
decisive share of the party's nominating delegates. He stated 10
days ago in Iowa that his cerebral, reform-minded message ``takes
time'' and that he would campaign at least through early March even
without an initial victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't hesitate to draw differences between you and your
opponent. I think that's a very important lesson,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he will tone down his criticisms of the vice president
for the sake of allowing him or his opponent to emerge from the
nominating process without too many battle scars, Bradley said,
``The people who are going to say that are largely his supporters.
They'd just as soon not be criticized. But campaigns are a matter
of drawing of distinctions, and so we will go forward'' with
competing proposals on health care reform, gun control and
campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that in the last week of New Hampshire campaigning,
Bradley closed a double-digit gap as he dropped the pretense of a
gentlemanly campaign and started portraying Gore as untrusthworthy.
Bradley finished less than 5 percentage points behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost nipped him,'' Bradley said, without mentioning that
polls several weeks ago showed Bradley ahead in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The former NBA star's wife, college professor Ernestine Bradley,
remarked to the college audience: ``Bill his done with his
warm-ups. And now it's the real time.``
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's one direct shot at Gore during his Connecticut stop
came in a network TV interview. It involved the 1996 campaign
fund-raising scandals, which include Gore's appearance at a Los
Angeles Buddhist temple where monks and nuns gave illegal
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think that the scandals of 1996 hang over his head,
and he's got to make further explanations,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Several political factors change as the primary battle heads
into the bigger states with larger minority populations.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley makes ``racial unity'' a centerpiece of his campaign.
But polls show Gore is way ahead with minority voters across the
country, possibly because President Clinton gets his highest
ratings from blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's New Hampshire tally was boosted by independent voters,
but New York's primary is dominated by more traditional party
regulars, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Bradley conducted a campaign rally in Manhattan
and flew to San Francisco for a Thursday morning rally, showing
that he is willing to fight on coast to coast. His campaign
treasury is as big as Gore's, who ended up in Los Angeles after a
whirlwind tour that began with the ultimately unnecessary jaunt to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who arrived in New York at 1 a.m. got up a few hours later
and went to Grand Central Station to appear on several news shows
and meet voters. While there, Senate leaders called to alert him
that a vote was likely to start at 10:15 and could be a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'Let's go,''' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   But because the pilots of Air Force Two had not had the required
eight hours of rest, Gore had to catch the 9 a.m. USAir shuttle to
the capital in what could be a first for a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore's motorcade raced to La Guardia, sirens blaring, his
staff scrambled to make plane reservations, work out logistics to
get Gore from Washington to an afternoon campaign stop in Columbus,
Ohio, and to find him an extra suit and shoes in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's motorcade pulled onto the tarmac and dropped the vice
president, his staff and Secret Service agents at the outdoor
staircase of the ramp leading to USAir's Flight 6355. The surprised
flight attendants welcomed the vice president aboard, and one
passenger shook his hand, while others ignored him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stopped briefly in the cockpit before taking a seat in the
front row of the plane, surrounded by Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted from the campaign trail, Gore slept most of the
one-hour flight as other passengers watched a lengthy Fox News
interview with Texas Gov. George W. Bush on the plane's small
overhead screens.
</P>
<P>
   Upon landing, passengers were asked to remain in their seats to
allow the vice president and his entourage to leave.
</P>
<P>
   At the capitol minutes later, Gore met with Democratic Senate
leaders and watched the vote. It was a landslide, and he could
resume his presidential campaign.

BUSH PLAYS THE CONSERVATIVE CARD IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Introduced to a hushed crowd as a man who
``deeply loves the Lord,'' Governor George W. Bush emerged from his
crushing New Hampshire primary defeat with a sharpened tone and a
fine-tuned message Wednesday, playing his conservative credentials
to the hilt in a state that could determine the outcome of the
Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   Six times in a single minute Bush used the word ``conservative''
in a speech at Bob Jones University, one of the best-known
fundamentalist Christian venues in the state. He welcomed the
endorsement of former Vice President Dan Quayle. Throughout the
day, Bush tried to turn defeat to his advantage, suggesting McCain
had won as a result of ``liberal'' positions and his appearance as
an insurgent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a good job of making himself look like an outsider. I
need to make clear that he's the Washington insider, he's the
committee chairman,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Bush made his point in mild way, some of his allies in
South Carolina had no such inhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is a Clintonesque Washington politician, who
tailors his views to the audience he is addressing,'' said former
Republican Gov. David Beasley, one of Bush's top supporters. ``If
the crowd is from the left, he plays to the left. If it's from the
right, he plays to the right. We're not going to let him get away
with the deceptive messsage he used in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also put up a new negative advertisement that
challenged McCain's sincerity _ a sharp departure from Bush's
strategy in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In one ad that began running on South Carolina television
stations, the Bush campaign accused McCain of supporting _ along
with President Clinton _ a bill that would have dramatically
increased tobacco taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard edge to the ad was most evident in two unflattering
pictures of McCain side-by-side, with the announcer's voice
declaring, ``Saying one thing and doing another _ that's the real
John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates spent the day campaigning in South Carolina,
where Bush has held a steady lead in the primary polls for weeks.
But after a wide victory margin Tuesday night that surprised even
his own campaign, McCain began using the rhetoric of a frontrunner
for the first time. He even adopted a favorite phrase of the Bush
campaign: Electability.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain sought to turn Bush's sudden emphasis on conservative
issues against him. Arguing that only a moderate could beat the
Democratic nominee next November, the Arizona senator said: ``My
message to Republican leaders is that we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Electability is all about getting the support of the center,
of the political center,'' McCain told reporters. ``I am a proud
conservative Republican who will maintain my base. But with this
message of reform, we will attract to my banner people from all
over the political spectrum, not because they agree with my
conservative views, but because they're fed up with the special
interests ruling Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   After contests in just two states, it was increasingly apparent
that the Republican race has evolved into a two-man affair.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Steve Forbes took a day of rest after placing third in
New Hampshire, with 11 percent of the votes. Gary Bauer spent the
pondering whether to stay in the race. Alan Keyes was campaigning
in South Carolina, but has hardly registered in the polls here.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, delirious with excitement from his blowout, flew out of
New Hampshire Tuesday night and arrived in time for a 3 a.m. rally
complete with disco lights and hundreds of college students. But
Bush, despite his disappointment Tuesday night, did not leave New
Hampshire until Wednesday morning, arriving in South Carolina just
before noon.
</P>
<P>
   It was there Bush gave a first glimpse of the new image he hopes
will buoy his candidacy in coming weeks: conservative, religious,
in line with the tradition and the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife just behind him, Bush stood behind an imposing
podium in the Founders' Memorial Amphitorium at Bob Jones Univerity
and addressed more than 6,000 Christian students who were required,
under school regulations, to attend.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke for the first time of a ``greater purpose'' for his
campaign, and, adding new rhetoric to a stump speech that has
hardly changed in over a month, described the international threats
facing the United States. Bush also used new phrasing to compare
his moral with that of the Clinton Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things I won't do. I won't run our armed forces
ragged with no thought for tomorrow, driving our military like a
rental car,'' Bush said. ``With this current administration, it
seems like they think a strong defense is something they expect
from their lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, got off to a quick start addressing one of
his campaign's gravest needs: money.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday, his campaign had less than $2 million on hand.
Wednesday alone, aides said they received more than $415,000 in
donations that came in through the candidate's Web site. Usually,
the site collects about $10,000 a day via the website, said
campaign manager Rick Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has a great deal of ground to make up. Bush, who
drew in some $68 million in campaign funds last year, has enough
money to fuel his much-touted ``50-state strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain wasn't bothered by that, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``My response is, now he is running a 49-state strategy,'' he
said.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the country's largest police unions called
Wednesday for a nationwide boycott of Benetton clothing to protest
the Italian firm's new advertising campaign opposing capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cabral, president of the International Union of Police
Associations, which represents more than 80,000 law enforcement
officers, accused the $2 billion Benetton Group of trying to
glorify ``wanton criminals just to peddle some clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   He also charged that the firm was seeking to ``humanize''
vicious killers while ignoring the tragedies of their victims.
``You cannot humanize these inhuman monsters,'' he said, adding
that ``any profits from sales generated by this campaign are
nothing more than blood money.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, titled ``We, On Death Row,'' features
photographs of 26 Death Row inmates in U.S. prisons. Their faces
are appearing on billboards and magazine ads across the world with
the words ``sentenced to death'' in bold letters above their
portraits. The company has also produced a 96-page newspaper
supplement in which the inmates also are interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Death Row'' ads are running on three billboards in New
York City through February as well as in the Feb. 7 issue of the
New Yorker, Vanity Fair for March, Rolling Stone for Feb. 17 and
three other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Benetton officials said they hope the $20 million ad campaign
will stimulate discussion about the death penalty and draw
attention to continuing executions in America. Since 1984 Benetton
has used its ad campaigns to focus on global issues like AIDS,
racism, religion and the war in Bosnia. The company has been
praised by many for helping to raise public consciousness about the
issues, but it also has been accused of using them to gain
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Benetton spokesman Mark Major said the new campaign seeks to
provide ``a human face to the prisoners on Death Row'' and to
remind death-penalty advocates ``that the debate concerns men and
women in flesh and blood, not virtual characters eliminated or
spared with a simple click as with a video game.''
</P>
<P>
   But victims' rights groups as well as police organizations have
denounced the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a death penalty issue; it's a human issue,'' said
Nancy Ruhe-Munch, executive director of the Cincinnati-based
National Organization of Parents of Murdered Children, which does
not take a stand on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   She said the ad campaign is ``a slap in the face'' to survivors,
to law enforcement officials who investigated and prosecuted the
cases and to the jurors who convicted the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything these people did, now you have somebody over
in Italy who says, `I don't care, because I have enough money (to
put up) billboards on my views on capital punishment,''' she said.
Ruhe-Munch's group and other victims-rights organizations also have
called for a boycott of Benetton clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Cabral of the police unions association said he will urge
municipal and transit officials around the country to refuse
Benetton advertising on publicly owned buses and billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``No responsible elected official in this country should become
an accomplice to Benetton's greedy disregard for the victims and
their families who suffered at the hands of such vicious
criminals,'' Cabral said.

CASH-STRAPPED MUSEUM TO SELL HITLER LIMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ Strapped for cash and stricken by pangs of conscience,
Canada's War Museum may sell one of its prime exhibits, Adolf
Hitler's limousine.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's director, J.L. Granatstein, thinks the display of
the gleaming black Mercedes and outsized Swastika flag sends the
wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come away with a sense of the power of that regime
rather than its evil,'' he said. ``It glamorizes instead of
demonizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hitler's car has been a fixture of the museum in
Canada's capital for nearly three decades, Granatstein called the
display poorly conceived, in bad taste and at odds with the
museum's mission of explaining Canada's role in various conflicts,
from beating back American invaders during the War of 1812 to
storming the beaches of Normandy on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated the car could fetch as much as $14 million at
auction.
</P>
<P>
   That is money desperately needed by the chronically underfunded
museum, which boasts a staggering collection of war memorabilia _
440,000 muskets, swords, machine guns, artillery pieces, paintings,
diaries, medals, boots, even battle tanks and a midget submarine _
but has always been the poor stepchild of Canada's national
museums. It is trying to raise money for a new building; the War
Museum presently occupies a crumbling old government office
structure whose electricity and elevators regularly fail
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum is meant to honor the Canadians who sacrificed in
wartime, and to present the military history of our country,'' said
Granatstein, one of Canada's most prominent historians. ``It's also
meant to show the weapons of our wartime enemies. But that doesn't
mean presenting Hitler as a striking figure with a cool car.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the possible sale of the limousine raises its own moral
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize this car could become a powerful icon for
neo-Nazis,'' said Granatstein. ``We certainly don't want to see it
falling into the hands of someone who might use it to glorify
Hitler or fascism.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the board of Canadian Museum of Civilization _
the War Museum's parent _ has not made a final decision on whether
to put the car up for bid. But even the prospect of such a sale has
attracted international attention; the museum Wednesday was swamped
with calls from across Europe and North America, with the most
intense interest coming from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Canada was one of the major Allies in the struggle against
Hitler's Third Reich, entering World War II years before the US,
but the vintage Mercedes has no Canadian historical connection
other than its presence in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Pratte, a Quebec businessman, donated it to the museum in
1970 after buying it from another Canadian collector, who bought it
at a US Army auction for $2,725, according to the Ottawa Citizen
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek convertible is the only one of the Fuhrer's fleet of
seven personal vehicles known to have survived the war. At the time
it was given to the museum, it was believed to have been the former
vehicle of Nazi Luftwaffe commander Herman Goering. But museum
research later authenticated the Mercedes as Hitler's own, using
serial numbers and other specifications provided by the German
automobile manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The custom-built 20-foot limo features special compartments for
pistols and armor plating behind the passenger seat. It weighs 4.5
tons and was capable of traveling 105 m.p.h. It is stitched with
seven bullet holes, possibly from an Allied strafing run during the
final days of the war.
</P>
<P>
   According to the War Museum, the auto was seized by American
soldiers at a railroad siding in Salzburg, Austria in April 1945.
It was then painted olive drab and served for several months as a
US military vehicle before being shipped in 1946 to a warehouse in
Boston, where it gathered dust for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   It has since been restored to its original burnished black and
chrome.
</P>
<P>
   The museum exhibit is a curious one: the car is set against a
cheery Bavarian-style courtyard complete with eaves with little
heart designs. There is a dummy driver _ garbed in the black
uniform of the Waffen SS _ standing as if ready to whisk the Fuhrer
away on urgent business. There is a large bust of Hitler and a
mammoth Swastika flag of red, white and black.
</P>
<P>
   Granatstein said it would be happily ironic if the sale of the
Mercedes helps buy a new home for the Canadian museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be a wonderful sense of satisfaction in using
Hitler's car to build a new war museum,'' he told the Ottawa
Citizen, ``to honor the ordinary Canadian men and women who helped
defeat that s.o.b.''

MOTORISTS BREAKING LAW AS MORE TEXANS DITCH FRONT LICENSE PLATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More and more Texans are removing their
vehicles' front license plates and replacing them with unofficial
placards depicting university logos, ``Native Texan'' or the
Confederate battle flag, state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem: The substitutions are illegal, no
matter how widespread. State police say they will continue to
enforce the state requirement for front and rear plates even if
some law enforcement jurisdictions don't.
</P>
<P>
   Though no statewide data is compiled on the subject, an informal
survey of vehicles in downtown Austin indicated that perhaps 1 in
10 cars bears no official front Texas plate. Many were sporty new
cars that had no obvious place to display a front plate.
</P>
<P>
   Flouting the rules has become trendy. One Austin curio shop now
sells 12 varieties of Texas-themed plates, all stamped ``not for
official use.'' Choices include the Confederate flag, ``Don't Mess
With Texas'' and ``GWBUSH for President,'' along with those touting
the University of Texas and Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a no-no,'' said Mike Viesca, the Texas Department of
Transportation official who oversees the state's selection of 100
authorized license plates, including the specialty placards
honoring nearly all Texas universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``State law does require two plates. But that's an enforcement
issue. It's up to the police to take care of that,'' Viesca said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, one of several large states with laws similar to
Texas, enforcement has been vigorous, with about 30,000 tickets a
year written for violations. Officials said a key reason for the
strict enforcement is that state's increasing reliance on cameras
to automatically issue citations to red-light runners.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, confusion about the law may be widespread. While one
Travis County clerk gave a caller correct information about the
two-plate requirement, one man registering his car said a clerk
asked him whether he wanted one plate or two. He took one and now
risks getting a traffic citation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want to get a ticket, the best way is to have
both plates,'' said Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Tom
Vinger. ``It's still the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The misdemeanor offense of ``operation of a vehicle without
license plate or registration insignia'' is punishable by a fine of
up to $200.
</P>
<P>
   State legislation to end the two-plate requirement has been
submitted unsuccessfully each session since 1995. It is opposed, at
least informally, by law enforcement groups and entities such as
airports whose security cameras are positioned to photograph the
front plates of arriving vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. Customs has devices that use front plates to
make note of which vehicles cross the border into Mexico, Viesca
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement favors the two plates for the obvious reason _
you're able to identify a vehicle coming and going,'' Viesca said.

<P>
   Polls of New Hampshire taken before Tuesday's primary election
mostly got each party's winner right, but were often not so
accurate in measuring the size of each victory.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pre-primary polls tended to underestimate the size
of John McCain's eventual victory, and to overestimate the size of
Al Gore's margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, most of the pre-primary polls correctly
showed McCain leading George W. Bush, but usually by only a small
margin in single digits or low double-digits. McCain beat Bush by
18 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, on the Democratic side, most of the pre-primary
polls correctly showed Gore leading Bill Bradley, but in several
cases by double-digit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Gore eventually edged out Bradley by just 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   An example is the Gallup/CNN/USAToday poll which conducted daily
tracking surveys leading up to Prima2y Day. In their final
interviewing on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, they showed McCain
with 44 percent and Bush with 32 percent, correctly indicating the
victor but slightly underestimating the size of the McCain victory.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side the Gallup/CNN/USAToday poll found Gore
with 54 percent and Bradley with 42 percent, again indicating the
correct winner, but somewhat overestimating Gore's victory margin.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the CBS News tracking poll in its final interviewing
Friday, Saturday and Sunday found McCain with only a 4 percentage
point lead in the Republican contest, and Gore with a 16 point lead
in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Frankovic, director of surveys at CBS News, said the
polls got the right share of the vote for the front-runners, Bush
and Gore. but were too low on the challengers, McCain and Bradley,
``because of late deciding voters and the influence of
independents.''
</P>
<P>
   Polling experts over the years have stressed the notorious
volatility and unreliability of polls in primaries, as opposed to
general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in primary elections, for example, often make
their!choice late, so many don't yet know their preference when
called by pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   One quarter of New Hampshire voters on Tuesday said they had
made up their minds on Primary Day or in the three previous days,
according to the exit poll conducted by Voter News Service.

SLAIN POLICE SERGEANT LAID TO REST WITH HERO'S HONORS

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ In a funeral befitting a state hero,
thousands of mourners streamed to a Baptist church here Wednesday
to honor the short life and impressive legacy of police Sergeant
Cornel Young Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Enveloped by dignitaries, friends, and thousands of police, the
family of the 29-year-old officer sat stoically before a
flag-draped casket as they heard repeatedly that Young, son of the
highest-ranking black officer in the Providence police, did not die
in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Gunned down by two white officers who mistook him for a suspect
as he rushed to their aid Friday, Young's death has raised
questions among the black community about whether he was a victim
of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cornel has given us the opportunity to begin to do something
about justice, about fairness, about peace, and about equality,''
said the Reverend Olivier Bala, pastor of the Fourth Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Minister after minister exhorted an estimated 5,000 mourners,
who filled the church and lined the street outside, that Young's
shooting must be used as a starting point for a new dialogue about
community relations in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a ministry, the beginning of a
cause,'' Bala said.
</P>
<P>
   Summoning comforting verse from Scripture and speaking directly
to Young's mother and Major Cornel Young Sr., Bala and other
clergymen said the officer's life will continue to have meaning
because of the exceptional service he gave his community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullets could not stop Sergeant Young's dream, just as the
cross could not stop Jesus' dream,'' said the Reverend Virgil A.
Wood, president of the Ministers Alliance of Rhode Island. ``A
dream is more durable than flesh and blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, a patrolman with less than three years service on the
force, was promoted posthumously to sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers from every community in Rhode Island, as well as
hundreds from Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York, converged on
the church in bitterly cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond, Providence Mayor Vincent
A. ``Buddy'' Cianci Jr., and state Attorney General Sheldon
Whitehouse, whose office will investigate the shooting, also
attended the nearly three-hour service.
</P>
<P>
   As a horse-drawn wagon waited outside to carry the casket in a
procession to Swan Point Cemetery, speakers mixed sorrowful
consolation with smiling reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know Cornel, that you are loved and you are so
important to me and so many others,'' said Sergeant Tanya King,
president of the Rhode Island Minority Police Association. ``God
would not have taken this precious life without a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter vein, Cianci read from a letter written by a former
guidance counselor, who recalled how the 9-year-old Young would
create fantastic stories that starred him as a hero _ winning
football games for Cornell University, or saving President Carter's
daughter, Amy, from a fictitious near-drowning in the mayor's pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then he wanted to be a hero,'' Cianci said. And that he
became, the mayor said, rushing off-duty to the aid of two fellow
officers confronted by an armed man during a late-night fracas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no act more selfless than that,'' Cianci said. ``Let
his light shine . . . and help to heal a community wounded by
grief.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Young sat next to the victim's mother, Leisa, his arm
on her shoulder and his head occasionally touching her cheek. The
pair have been divorced since Cornel Jr. was 2 years old, but
eulogists recalled how the slain officer's strengths were the
product of two loving families.
</P>
<P>
   A family friend read a statement from Major Young, a 25-year
veteran of the department whose community outreach and demands for
equal treatment for all races on the force have made him a
respected and important figure in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, you won't have the opportunity to have a little one
follow you,'' Young said. ``I know that you still hear me. If at
any time in your life, if I ever disappointed you, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of disappointment, however, the funeral was filled with
tributes to a man who strived to do the right thing: as a son,
brother, friend, police officer, and role model for children of all
colors.
</P>
<P>
   The service brought tears to the eyes of Robert Shaw, the father
of the last Providence officer to die in the line of duty. Shot by
a fleeing robbery suspect, Steven Shaw died six years ago today
(Feb. 3).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living my son's death all over again,'' Shaw said as he
sat in the balcony. ``I've been bad since Friday, when Cornel was
shot. But, really, it never goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieving, however, was counterbalanced by inspiration. The
Reverend Marlowe V.N. Washington, pastor of the Allen A.M.E. Church
where the elder Young worships, delivered a fiery oration in which
he said that ``blessed Jai,'' a nickname for the victim, had ended
his life as a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jai was selfless, even in the line of duty, even in
off-duty,'' Washington said, his voice rising in volume. ``He
lives!''
</P>
<P>
   With tragedy can come blessings, Washington said. And one
blessing, he added, was evident Wednesday in the diverse, humbled
gathering at Fourth Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what God wanted,'' Washington said. ``God wanted to
bring a whole family and a community together right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As parts of that community sat respectfully in the church,
10-year-old Jessica Young's thoughts drifted to another place.
``Now Jai is in heaven,'' Young's stepsister said in a statement,
``and Grandpa will take care of him up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica also shared a lesson she had learned from ``Jai's''
death. ``Anyone who has kids should protect and love them,''
Jessica said, ``because we never know what might happen to them.''

HOMETOWN REMEMBERS RAY LEWIS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PERA   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Early on, the football coach at Kathleen High
knew Ray Lewis was special. But beyond his exploits on the field,
Lewis is remembered as a polite, respectful young man who worked
hard and cared for people.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible for his friends and family to believe that
Lewis, an all-pro linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens, had anything
to do with killing two people in Atlanta after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Police have charged Lewis, 24, with the murder of Richard
Lollar, 24, and Jacinta Baker, 21, both of Decatur, Ga. The two
were stabbed about 4 a.m. Monday outside a bar in the tony Atlanta
suburb of Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held without bond awaiting a Feb. 24 preliminary
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was raised by his grandmother, Elease McKinney, a retired
teacher, in her yellow, two-story house on Connestee Road in
northwest Lakeland.
</P>
<P>
   His high school years were full of promise. The strapping
football star was equally adept on the wrestling mat, winning a
state championship. Lightning fast and sturdy as an oak, Lewis had
a soft side as well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, his senior year at Kathleen High, Lewis received an
award from The Ledger newspaper for his leadership and service to
school and community.
</P>
<P>
   He volunteered at several Lakeland elementary schools as a
mentor and help$ purchase new basketball goals and nets for Winston
Elementary. On his award applicaTion, Lewis said he was most proud
of walking his pastor's wife down the aisle on their third wedding
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   That is the side to Lewis that his high school football coach,
Ernest Joe, says the world needs to remember. Perhaps no one had
more influence molding Lewis' youthful talents than Joe, who is
training at Lakeland High to be a school principal.
</P>
<P>
   To Joe, Lewis remains ``the best athlete I ever coached.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew in your heart that he was going to play on Sundays,
that he was going to be an NFL player.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men remain close. Last fall, Lewis paid for Joe and his
wife to fly to Baltimore and see a Ravens game. They stayed at
Lewis' house, which he shares with his brother and identical twin
sisters. Lewis' mother, nicknamed Bussy, also lives in Baltimore,
Joe said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Elease McKinney flew to Atlanta to be close to her
grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives at her home were not in the mood to talk much about
Lewis' troubles. A woman who identified herself as Lewis' aunt but
would not give her name said, ``He's a great kid, I know he didn't
do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same kid he's always been. He never got in any
trouble. He was and still is a role model in our family.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week, images of a handcuffed Lewis, dressed in red
Prison garb, played on a television at his alma mater, where his
legal troubles and athletic legacy were a hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morrell, Kathleen High's athletic director who taught Lewis
history, said his students were hungry for information about the
National Football League star, whose life-size photograph still
hangs in the gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't an A student but he made Bs and Cs in my class,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school student, Lewis was clean cut and respectful,
said Clint Wright, who was Lewis' principal at Kathleen High and
now serves as a district superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you spoke to Ray it was always, `Yes sir, no sir, I'll
get the job done, sir.' I was just devastated when I heard this,
and I just can't believe it,'' Wright said of the murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good, well-behaved kid, a good C-B student, not a
rowdy, boisterous, disrespectful kid. He came from a loving
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos tight end Desmond Clark, who played at Kathleen
with Lewis, said his former teammate has a magnetic personality.
``All of us people wanted to be around him, he was just a friendly
person.
</P>

<P>
   RUMTEK, India _ Deshin Shekpa was born during the year of the
male wood mouse (1384), and it is said he could be heard chanting a
mantra and reciting the alphabet while still inside his mother's
womb. At the moment of his birth, he boldly proclaimed himself to
be the fifth incarnation of the Karmapa, one of Tibetan Buddhism's
holiest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient texts describe the fifth Karmapa as a conjurer of
miracles, able to light the clouds with iridescent colors and
summon flowers to fall from the sky. But his many teachings, while
a source of soothing wisdom, also included a dark prophecy:
centuries in the distance, during the time of his own 16th and 17th
incarnations, the demonic power of ``perverse aspirations'' would
bring the entire Karmapa lineage close to destruction.
</P>
<P>
   This vision seems to have been eerily prescient, for now, as the
world enters the Tibetan year of the male iron dragon on Feb. 5 ,
there is not one claimant to the title of Karmapa but two, both of
them teen-aged boys whose mentors find the aspirations of the other
wickedly perverse.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, one of those boys, 14-year-old Ugyen Trinley Dorje,
fled Chinese-controlled Tibet, enduring an overland journey across
the snowbound Himalayas. On Jan. 5, he arrived in Dharamsala, the
picturesque Indian hill station that is home to the Tibetan
government-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
   His sudden presence, while a ticklish matter between India and
China, which have been working to overcome long-strained relations,
has been a cause for rejoicing among most Tibetans here. The
Karmapa is usually considered the third most revered figure in
Tibetan Buddhism, after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, and
the newly arrived boy had the unusual distinction of having been
endorsed as the 17th incarnation by both the Dalai Lama and the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been significantly less joy in New Delhi, home to
a rival faction that insists it is the one with the genuine
Karmapa. Shamar Rinpoche, a high lama also known as the Shamarpa,
has been championing this second contender since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is not only the leadership of one of the oldest orders
of Tibetan Buddhism but one of its richest monasteries as well. And
that has kept the Shamarpa desperately busy denouncing the newly
arrived teen-ager and his patrons as perpetrators of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddha would not be laughing right now,'' the Shamarpa said.
``This is all about politics. It's a story filled with many
traitors and betrayals.''
</P>
<P>
   Such intrigue is hardly uncommon to the Buddhism of Tibet,
which, before the Chinese occupation in the 1950s, was a theocratic
state where spiritual passions often bumped up against worldly
ambitions. The highest lamas are believed to be so spiritually
advanced that while their physical form may perish, their superior
consciousness lives on in other bodies and can be recognized. Rival
disciples sometimes disagree about which child has become the new
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a rare precaution against such discord, the Karmapa often
leaves a ``prediction letter'' with clues about where to find his
next incarnation. This guiding document, however, sometimes can be
hard to locate and stubbornly cryptic once found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Karmapa dispute is sort of a medieval tragicomedy,'' said
Tsering Shakya, a London-based scholar who has written a history of
modern Tibet. ``Who really knows who the Karmapa is? On one hand,
there are these arguments about dreams and prophecies. On the
other, there are the highly rational matters of controlling money
and property.''
</P>
<P>
   There is international politics as well. The 14-year-old's
escape from Tibet's historic Tsurphu Monastery is an embarrassment
for China. In 1992, government officials had permitted the boy's
enthronement as the 17th Karmapa, using him as a showpiece for a
purported revival of religious tolerance. Chinese officials
explained his departure by saying he was visiting India to fetch
belongings of the 16th Karmapa and warned India against granting
him political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Tibetan authorities in Dharamsala are prudently
keeping the teen-ager in seclusion as Indian and Chinese diplomats
attend to the fractious matter of his status.
</P>
<P>
   If he is allowed to stay, his eventual home is likely to be here
in the village of Rumtek, where the 16th Karmapa, who fled Tibet in
1959, built a lavish monastery in the Himalayan state of Sikkim,
which has since been annexed by India.
</P>
<P>
   The Rumtek monastery has been this conflict's main battlefield,
a place where religious gatherings have turned into brawls. The
buildings are multilayered, with tiers of white, yellow and
oxblood. The Karmapa's throne is centered in a grand assembly hall,
where ornate wooden casements hold 1,000 Buddha statuettes and
hundreds of ancient manuscripts. Stored in a locked room are other
treasured relics, most importantly the bejeweled black hat that has
been worn by every Karmapa for 600 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the monastery's monks were ecstatic. Some recently
had been to Dharamsala and seen the 14-year-old and were speaking
of his aura, his calm and the ways he reminded them of his previous
incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ugyen Jigme, 62, wept, overcome with wonderment. He had been
the 16th Karmapa's personal physician. And now he had met the boy.
``I could tell he knew everything about me,'' he said. ``He still
has the same gestures, the same laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, however, the mood was dour, the monks
disconsolate.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, dozens of them _ they put their number at 115 _
have been outcasts, followers of the less-acknowledged Karmapa.
Many of them live in shacks, tents and converted animal pens. Their
small prayer hall has walls of corrugated metal and a floor of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Lungtok Dawa had lived in the Rumtek monastery for most of his
life _ and claims to have been beaten up for his rebellious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will come a day when the rightful Karmapa will live in
the monastery and wear the black hat,'' he said mournfully. ``But I
don't know when this will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Karmapa left his physical shell in 1981, succumbing to
cancer in a hospital near Chicago. His dead body, many followers
believe, maintained its normal temperature for three days as if in
gentle meditation. He was cremated in Rumtek, and when a charred
part of the remains fell from the pyre, it was presumed to be the
Karmapa's haart and has been preserved in a golden shrine in the
mo~astery.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for locating the next incarnation fell to
four young regents, themselves incarnate lamas with titles that go
back hundreds of years. They had been the 16th Karmapa's chief
disciples, and two of them _ the 12th Tai Situpa and the 13th
Shamarpa _ were rivals for the position of second in the hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, the Tai Situpas had been emergent while the
Shamapas fell into disrepute. The 10th Shamarpa had been accused of
starting a war between Tibet and Nepal, and, as punishment, his
reincarnation as a high lama was forbidden. During the next 150
years, his embodiments lived in obscurity.

BRADLEY, GORE CONTINUE SPARRING ON ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No sooner did the bitter race for the Democratic
presidential nomination shift from New Hampshire to New York
Wednesday than former senator Bill Bradley unleashed a new assault
on Vice President Al Gore's integrity and their sparring over
Gore's abortion record started anew.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, after shaking hands with commuters at Grand Central
Station in the morning, suddenly ditched his campaign schedule and
boarded the next US Airways shuttle flight to Washington so he
could cast the tie-breaking vote, if necessary, on an abortion
rights amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Two was not available because the flight crew had not
gotten enough rest after an early morning flight from New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took a front-row seat on the 9 a.m. flight, with Secret
Service agents seated behind him. Gore, who said he didn't know
whether a sitting vice president in recent history had ever flown
commercial, slept during most of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he received early-morning calls asking
for his help from Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle and
Democratic Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Charles Schumer of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They formally requested that I return in the event it is a
tie, and the only way I could get back that quickly was to get on
the shuttle,'' Gore said. ``I said, `Let's go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republicans, intent on denying him the opportunity to
further legitimize his stance on the abortion issue, had a
last-minute change of heart. They voted with the Democrats for the
amendment that would prohibit abortion clinic protesters from
filing for bankruptcy to shield themselves from fines and civil
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a tie, the vote wasn't even close, 80-17.
</P>
<P>
   Had Gore cast the tie-breaker, the vote would not have come at a
more auspicious time for the vice president, who has been put on
the defensive by Bradley on the issue. Gore, who now defends
abortion rights, once opposed providing federal funds to poor women
for the procedure and in 1984 supported an antiabortion amendment
that defined a fetus as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't manufacture a vote,'' Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign
chairman said Wednesday. Asked about the political benefits to Gore
of returning to Washington for the vote, Coelho said, ``It's a
continuation of his commitment. This isn't anything new.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, with a clear touch of sarcasm, said, ``The vice
president supposedly cast a tie-breaking vote. I'd rather be in New
York, quite frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, went a step further. ``They
clearly decided they wanted to be part of this issue in
Washington,'' he said. ``It should not be used as a political
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's early morning drama, he managed to get back on
schedule, taking Air Force Two to Columbus, Ohio, where he spoke at
a rally at Ohio State University, promising, among other things, to
fight for ``a woman's right to choose.'' Then he flew to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was in Washington, Bradley kicked off his push toward
the March 7 primaries in 15 states, by citing an incident last
Sunday in Somersworth, N.H., in which Gore supporters purportedly
threw mud at Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and called him a
``loser'' and a ``cripple.'' Kerrey, a Bradley supporter, lost a
leg in the Vietnam War as a Navy Seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would simply ask Al Gore to take responsibility for his
campaign and their actions as well as his own words,'' Bradley told
supporters at a church across from Washington Square in Greenwich
Village. ``When his campaign demeans a Medal of Honor winner like
Bob Kerrey, there should be an apology from Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign denied Bradley's version of the incident.
``We're not aware of anyone using those words to describe Senator
Kerrey,'' said Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane. ``He's a great war
hero and a great American. The Gore campaign would never condone
that type of name-calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley told reporters in Greenwich Village that he waited to
demand an apology from Gore until he spoke to Kerrey and confirmed
the details.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrey, without refuting Bradley's version, told reporters
in Washington, ``This is part of politics, and the vice president
certainly does not owe me an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   The contretemps came as Bradley sought to capitalize on the
momentum he gained last week with a five-day attack on Gore's
ethics and honesty. After falling behind by double digits in some
polls, Bradley finished four points back in New Hampshire, keeping
alive his candidacy for next month's contests.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, basking in a cradle of liberalism in Greenwich Village,
was flanked by some of the city's off-beat icons, from former Mayor
Ed Koch to singer Patti Smith. He started the day with a rally at
Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., and he ended it with a flight
to San Francisco for a rally Thursday.

 RUMTEK, India: in obscurity. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 16th Karmapa himself resurrected the position. H% may have
had other reasons, but the boy identified as the 13th Shamarpa was
also his nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Tashi Delsapa, the secretary for culture in Sikkim, has known
both the current Tai Situpa and Shamarpa since they were children
and describes something like a sibling rivalry. ``Jealousies crept
in, and they involved mundane, not religious things,'' he said.
``There was a lot of money to control. Shamar, being a nephew, may
have thought that control of money and the monastery was his
inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa is the best-known figure among the Kagyupas, one of
the four main orders in Tibetan Buddhism _ and one with a wide
following across Asia and the West. Wild speculation is often made
about the sums controlled by the Karmapa Charitable Trust and
associated legal entities, but these estimates are largely
guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, both Tai Situpa a~d the Shamarpa spent much of
their time abroad. No one had been able to find any memento with
the deceased Karmapa's cryptic clues, let alone his incarnation.
The faithful were frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at an extraordinary meeting of the regents in 1992, Tai
Situpa announced he had found the guiding missive. To the
astonishment of some, he said he had unwittingly worn the vital
document for 11 years. It was folded inside a talisman attached to
a string, a gift from the 16th Karmapa.
</P>
<P>
   One translation of the letter reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``From here to the north in the east of the land of snow
</P>
<P>
   Is a country where divine thunder spontaneously blazes
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   With the miraculous, far-reaching sound of the white one
</P>
<P>
   This is the one known as Karmapa.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Tai Situpa reported that a search party in
Tibet had found the appropriate lad, the son

FED RAISES RATES A QUARTER POINT AS INFLATION BUFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board nudged two key interest rates up by a
quarter percentage point each Wednesday, warning that the
fast-growing US economy continued to produce ``heightened
inflationary pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Federal Open Market Commitee said they plan to
raise the federal funds rate banks charge each other for overnight
loans by a quarter point, to 5.75 percent. The discount rate at
which the central bank makes loans also was raised by a quarter
point, to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets took the Fed action in stride. There was
apparently little surprise about the rate hike, which was widely
expected in the wake of Friday's plunge in stocks after new federal
data revealed the economy grew rapidly in the fourth quarter and
wage inflation surged.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 37.85 points,
closing at 11,003.20. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index
gained 21.98 points, closing at 4,073.96.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst interpretations of the Fed's intentions about future
monetary policy were divided. The Federal Open Market Committee's
statement is the first under a new procedure in which it will no
longer signal the future direction of interest rates but will
assess inflation risks in the economy. The Fed changed its policy
after determining that financial markets were over-interpreting the
Fed's remarks as definite expressions of the bank's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's statement, the FOMC said members believe ``the
risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate
heightened inflationary pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   While some noted the Fed action was modest _ a half-point rate
hike had been in the wind _ others economists said it is only the
first interest-rate increase of the year and another would come
when the Fed next meets, on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is, `We're in the process of raising rates, and
another hike is coming in March,' '' said Allen Sinai, president of
Primark Decision Economics, a Boston economic consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different game now. The (Fed's) game is to take
something out of the economy and to cause the unemployment rate to
go up,'' Sinai said.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are viewed by the Fed as necessary to cool
a US economy the federal government last week said grew at a
sizzling 5.8 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, repeating
the third quarter's rapid growth. In addition, the employment cost
index, a measure of wage growth, surged 1.1 percent in the fourth
quarter and fueled fears inflation would begin to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   The news jolted the Dow, which shed 289 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in other interest rates charged consumers for car
loans and mortgages are expected to rise in tandem with Fed rates.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bader, chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage Co., a
national lender based in New York, predicted rates on 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgages, currently at about 8.5 percent, could rise to
9.5 percent by June but ``will have virtually no effect'' on the
housing market. The US Department of Commerce said Wednesday sales
of new homes in the United States reached a record for a second
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   John Youngdahl, vice president and senior money market economist
for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York, said the Fed's statement on
inflation was unusual because it failed to explicitly mention the
extremely tight labor market. It did so repeatedly last year when
announcing interest-rate increases. Unemployment is at a 30-year
low of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line,'' Youngdahl said, ``is they could've taken a more
hawkish slant by renewing their stated worries about excessive
tightness in the labor market and consequences of'' rising
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's sluggish behavior to some extent reflected
confusion among investors _ and the Wall Street economists who
advise them _ about the Fed's new, more veiled statements.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: investors in this high-flying stock market
will continue to watch closely what the central bank will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one chapter in the book, and there are more to be
written,'' said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist Salomon Smith
Barney.

   SUNDANCE-FILMS (Park City, Utah) _ This year's Sundance film
festival, which ended its 10-day run here a week ago, was widely
viewed as among the most successful of recent years with fresh and
surprising entries in all of the festival's categories. By Rick
Lyman. (Moved). &QL;

   FRENCH-WOMEN-FILMS (Undated) _ The French, a stubborn people,
may be the last nation on earth for who the ``magic'' of women is a
simple, unshakable article of faith. The French Institute/Alliance
Francaise in New York is currently conducting a kind of revival
meeting devoted to reasserting this durable tenet of the national
religion (i.e., the cinema) in the form of a 10-film tribute to
Carol Bouquet, Sandrine Bonnaire and Juliette Binoche. Strictly
speaking, these women have little in common. But if you compare
them with American actresses of similar accomplishment (say, Julia
Roberts, Meg Ryan and Michelle Pfeiffer) you can't help noticing
that the Frenchwomen are, collectively, a much graver and more
mysterious bunch. By Terrence Rafferty. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   DOROTHY-ARZNER-FILMS (Undated) _ Three days into the last
century, the wife of a San Francisco cafe owner gave birth to a
child who would grow up to be the lone female filmmaker of
Hollywood's golden era. Dorothy Arzner will not receive a fraction
of the tributes accorded that other recent centenarian, Alfred
Hitchcock. But Arzner warrants a place in film history, and not
simply because she broke into the super-macho profession that movie
directing was in the '30s an$ '40s. Looked at today, Arzner's films
are startling in their pre-feminist probings of women's place in
American society. By Graham Fuller. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   CHINA-ZHANG-FILMS (New York) _ The first six films by the
Chinese director Zhang Yimou had a strong structuring device in the
stunning form of Gong Li, China's best-known actress. From their
debut feature, ``Red Sorghum'' (1988), through the international
hits ``Ju Dou'' (1990) and ``Raise the Red Lantern'' (1991), to
``The Story of Qiu Jiu'' (1992) and ``To Live'' (1994), Zhang was
involved personally and professionally with Ms. Gong. But during
the production of ``Shanghai Triad'' (1995), she terminated the
relationship, and, within a year, married a wealthy Singaporean
businessman. Filmmaker and performer have not collaborated since.
His first two post-Gong Li efforts, the urban comedy ``Keep Cool''
(1996) and the rural drama ``Not One Less'' (1999), are departures
for Zhang. That ``Not One Less,'' which opens here on Feb. 18, took
the Golden Lion for best film at the 1999 Venice Film Festival

   KATHLEEN-MARSHALL-DANCE (New York) _ In her three and a half
years as the artistic director of the Encores musical concert
series, the choreographer Kathleen Marshall has become something of
an expert in the fine art of instant entertainment. Productions at
Encores, after all, rarely rehearse for more than 10 days before
showing off the results for 3,000 spectators a night at City
Center. So imagine her surprise last fall when she found herself
working on the revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' a project two years in
the making whose rehearsal schedule stretched out over six weeks, a
period unthinkable for any Encores veteran. By Jesse McKinley.

   BLACK-DANCE (New York) _ The arts organization 651 ARTS, which
was founded in part by the Brooklyn Academy of Music and identifies
itself as an African-American performing arts presenter, will
feature a dance program called ``Black Dance: Tradition and
Transformation'' that runs Feb. 16 through 19 at the BA M's Harvey
Theater, the headquarters of 651. The new yearly series will
examine the past, present and future of black choreography with
performances, master classes, lectures and discussions. By Jennifer

   BRAZILIAN-DANCE-TROUPE (New York) _ Since the Brazilian
choreographer Deborah Colker established her dance troupe in Rio de

14-member Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker makes its North
American debut at the Joyce Theater Feb. 15 through 20 with the
full-evening work ``Rota'' (``Route''), a hit in South America and
Europe that has been ceen by more than 200,000 people since 1997.

   JAPANESE-DANCE-TROUPE (New York) _ You've proba`ly heard that
you can't put your elbow in your ear. Well, don't tell it to H Art
Chaos, an all-female dance group from Japan. A seeming hybrid of
Pilobolus and Gumby, these 11 hyperlimber women have complete
disregard for the laws of physical possibility: they hang from
their heels, pirouette at whiplash speed, writhe convulsively on
the floor, launch themselves violently into the air and
occasionally fly around the stage carrying chairs and sometimes one
another. This apotheosis of energy can be experienced Tuesday
through Sunday at the Joyce Theater in ``Secret Club _ Floating
Angels 2000,'' a highly theatrical 80-minute work, much praised in
Japan, that has been evolving since 1993. By Annette Grant.

   DUBLIN-CAROL-THEATER (London) _ ``Dublin Carol,'' is an
impressive new play by Conor McPherson, 28, the Irish author of
``The Weir.'' Partly because of its own undoubted quality, partly
because the earlier work has enjoyed such success in London and New
York, this is the piece that was to have reopened the Royal Court
Theater, which has been closed for nearly four years for a
$40-million-plus refit. But the most reliable member of any team of

   JANE-EYRE-THEATER (London) _ What is left to discover about
``Jane Eyre'' after at least four film versions and various
important critical writings, not to mention Charlotte Bronte's 1847
novel itself? If you are in the theater, perhaps it is the
opportunity to physicalize the book while animating its
time-honored passions anew. That seems to be the case with Polly

statement? Not here, I am afraid. Most of these pieces, despite the
performer's protestations, took their mission as a joke. Some were

Music, owned by Seagram along with Universal's movie and television

Warner announced plans to merge with America Online. Then, in

Mark McKinney, Dave Foley, Scott Thompson, Bruce McCulloch and
Kevin McDonald have reunited for an 18-city tour of the United
States and their native Canada. During those years a strange thing
has happened: these cult comedians seem to have become quasi-rock

trick is harder to pull off than one might think. But Elizabeth
Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, the New York architects, have been

recent projects, both realized in ephemeral forms, have expanded
the New York audience for the work of these gifted space-timers.

 &HT;    Halting executions sets example
 &HT;    (Eds: This is an editorial from Thursday's Atlanta Constitution)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Illinois Gov. George Ryan, long a believer in the
death penalty, this week ordered a total moratorium on executions
in his state. He had finally come to realize that the legal checks
designed to prevent the execution of innocent people just weren't
working.
</P>
<P>
   That realization did not come easily. Ryan wasn't even fazed
last year when an Illinois inmate was found innocent a scant 48
hours before he was to be executed. In Ryan's estimation, that
close brush with wrongful death was a sign the legal system worked.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence to the contrary has piled higher than the Chicago
skyline. Since the reinstitution of the death penalty in 1975,
Illinois has freed more inmates on death row than it has executed.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago Tribune investigation showed that of the 260 capital
convictions appealed to a higher court since Illinois reinstituted
the death penalty, fully half have been reversed. Why? Because
witnesses recanted testimony. Because prosecutors withheld
exculpatory evidence. Because judges made improper rulings. Because
defendants were assigned unqualified, even disbarred lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with the moral implication of those findings _ at the
very least, the state of Illinois had repeatedly come close to
executing innocent people, in essence murdering them _ Ryan decided
to halt executions in his state until he is convinced to a moral
certainty that capital punishment is administered only to those who
have earned it. To that end, he will appoint a commission to
examine the entire process and recommend fixes.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much time, money and expertise is devoted to
making the system foolproof, it will still be designed and operated
by mere mortals and will inevitably be subject to error.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's courageous decision should set an example for governors
and lawmakers in the 37 other states that practice capital
punishment. Is Illinois all that unusual in discovering innocent
men were slated for execution? No. At last count, 85 condemned men
have been taken off death row since the Supreme Court legalized the
death penalty in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these reprieves, can anyone confidently say that
every single one of the 598 persons executed in America during the
last quarter-century was guilty as sin? Can anyone in good
conscience say taking even one innocent life is justified by the
desire to dispose of all of the others?

SCHWAB BUYS DISCOUNT INTERNET BROKER, CUTS COMMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest shot in the lucrative war for on-line investors,
Charles Schwab Corp., the nation's largest discount stock
brokerage, acquired a sophisticated, low-cost Internet broker and
slashed trading commissions &UR;  &LR; Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The big moves reflect a growing push by financial services
firms, amid major inroads by Web-only brokers, to attract and
retain investors of all stripes. And they suggest that lower costs
and top-notch services for frequent traders _ both prominent at
upstart cyber brokerages _ are increasingly key weapons in the
battle for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, of San Francisco, will pay $488 million in stock for
CyBerCorp Inc., a Web-only broker based in Austin, Texas, whose
specialty is nailing down the best quotes through links to trading
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Launched two years ago, CyBerCorp caters to hyperactive day
traders, who buy and sell stocks scores of times a day. The
company, which reported revenues of only $25 million last year, is
already a top-10 online broker as measured by daily trades.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty purchase comes only weeks after Schwab said it would
court a different kind of client _ wealthy investors _ by acquiring
U.S. Trust Co, a well-heeled asset management firm.
</P>
<P>
   Together, both deals reflect a broadening of focus by Schwab to
attract both stable long-term investors and shorter-term day
traders. While active traders are a tiny portion of the investing
public, they tend to be more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab also said it would halve commissions for its most active
traders. The giant, which used to command a flat rate of $29.95 per
trade, will now charge frequent investors anywhere from $14.95 to
$19.95, depending on how often they buy and sell. Occasional
traders will still pay the old $29.95 rate. To qualify for the
reduced fees, customers must have at least $50,000 in their
accounts. Most CyBerCorp customers now pay Schwab's new lowest
rate.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where some Web-only brokers charge as little as $5
per trade, Schwab's moves might not seem extraordinary. But in an
investing revolution that is increasingly shifting control away
from expensive brokers and toward cheap, do-it-yourself services,
price counts. ``We've lost share in online trading,'' Schwab's
co-chief executive officer, David Pottruck, said Wednesday in a
conference call, referring to low-cost services from Web-only
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's moves are not just aimed at ETrade, the number-two
online broker behind Schwab, and other Web-based competitors that
have come from nowhere in recent years to grab a 16 percent share
of the do-it-yourself investing market. Many Schwab customers also
keep accounts at Web-only brokerages _ assets Schwab now wants to
pull in.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is also responding to Fidelity Investments, the nation's
biggest mutual fund firm and second-largest discount broker, which
also charges its most active traders $14.95 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means is that Fidelity will have a tougher time
pulling accounts away from Schwab now,'' said Dan Burke, an online
brokerage analyst at Gomez Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Fidelity Wednesday reported record growth in its
online brokerage service, now the firm's fastest-growing segment.
``We have made great strides in reshaping our whole model to take
advantage of'' the growth of the Internet,'' said Gail McGovern,
who heads Fidelity's brokerage and ``retail'' fund sales division.
``Our goal has been to become even more Web-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Fidelity had no intention of cutting its rates in
response to Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity said its online business, relaunched a few months ago
as ``Powerstreet'', more than doubled last year. Assets on line
rose to $269 billion from $134 billion. Average daily
commissionable trades rose to more than 55,400 from 25,500. Around
82 percent of all stocks traded through Fidelity are now done on
line.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, who recently replaced top Fidelity executive Gary
Burkhead, who retired, dismissed Schwab's price cuts as a
``me-too'' response and said customers were more interested in
sophisticated services. To that end, Fidelity plans to beef up its
wireless services, which allow investors to trade via pagers,
create more access to initial public offerings, and make its Web
site more interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schwab and Fidelity are also competing against traditional
brokerages like Merrill Lynch, which have slowly waded into
low-cost Web investing. The average customer of a traditional
bricks-and-mortar brokerage has more than $300,000 in assets, while
the average Fidelity customer has around $100,000, according to Jim
Lowell, who publishes an independent newsletter, Fidelity Investor.
``It's clear,'' Lowell said, ``that Fidelity and Schwab want to
compete against both the big brokerages and the online-only
players.''

MARKET PLACE: INVESTORS GREET FED RATE INCREASE WITH A YAWN
</HEADLINE>
   (With FED-RATES and graphic) 
(rk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who's afraid of the Federal Reserve? Not Wall Street,
it would appear.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's fourth increase in interest rates since
last summer was greeted by investors with a collective yawn
Wednesday. Stock and bond prices rose before the announcement and
then bounced around within relatively narrow bands. By the end of
the day, stock prices were mixed while bond prices were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was more restrained than those that followed two of
the three increases last year. Then stock prices soared as
investors concluded _ wrongly, as it turned out _ that the Fed was
through with increases. This time the Fed's statement warned of
``inflationary imbalances'' and hinted strongly that at least one
more rate increase was coming.
</P>
<P>
   If so, one might ask, why not do it now and get it over with?
``If they did everything at once, the markets would rally,'' said
Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist of Merrill Lynch. ``By doing
this Chinese-water-torture effect, the Fed keeps the markets off
guard. It wants the markets to help slow down the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Off guard the markets may be. Worried they are not. There was a
time when the Fed's rate actions were viewed as crucial, and the
saying ``three steps and a stumble'' was well known. It meant that
if the Fed raised interest rates three times, stock prices would
probably fall. But the Fed's raises last year did not slay the
bull, and fear of the Fed seems to be waning.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Wednesday's meeting of the Fed's Open Market
Committee, the consensus forecast had been that the Fed would raise
rates a quarter-percentage point, but some had thought a half-point
increase was possible. Now there is a general expectation that the
Fed will raise rates again in March, and some think it will do so
again in May.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an expectation that the Fed won't stop there, said
Dan Bernstein, the research director of Bridgewater Associates, a
money management firm. The September Fed funds contract closed
Wednesday at 6.575 percent _ much higher than the rate of 5.75
percent that the Fed set Wednesday. That level suggests at least
three more tightenings. But the prospect is not alarming investors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the evidence is that the Fed's previous three rate
increases _ in June, August and November of last year _ have done
little to slow the economy, which has continued to boom. Even
construction spending, which traditionally is very sensitive to
interest rates, has recently been rising at an impressive clip.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, the record is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, traditionally the most widely
watched barometer, has made little headway since the first Fed
action. On June 30, that first increase led to a 155-point gain,
leaving the Dow at 10,970.80. Wednesday, the Dow fell 37.85, to
11,003.20, barely higher than the June figure. Higher interest
rates have hurt many stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But a completely different picture emerges when one looks at the
Nasdaq composite, an index dominated by so-called new economy
stocks attuned to the Internet. It closed at 2,686.12 on June 30.
Wednesday, it rose 21.96 points, to 4,073.94, or 52 percent higher
than it was after the first rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   The market's assurance appears to be particularly frustrating to
the Fed, which is worried that the economy is growing too rapidly,
raising inflation concerns and causing a huge and growing trade
deficit as consumers buy far more than the American economy can
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, thinks that the wealth
effect _ the feeling by investors that they are richer because the
value of their portfolios has risen _ is a major reason for that
spending, and he has forecast that the markets will slow the
economy down. So far, they have not. Higher interest rates have
slowed the market for old economy stocks, but not for the stocks
that are pacing this bull market.
</P>
<P>
   And now, interest rates are not even rising. Even as the Fed was
raising short-term interest rates Wednesday, the bond markets were
cutting rates. The biggest decline was in 30-year Treasury bonds,
where the yield fell from 6.42 percent to 6.28 percent. But some of
the decline was because of concerns that there will not be enough
bonds to go around. The Treasury Department announced it was
planning to reduce the amount of such bonds it issues and buy back
some of the bonds that are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in yield was smaller on 10-year bonds, where supply
factors are less pronounced, from 6.62 percent to 6.57 percent, and
there were also declines on the short end of the spectrum, with the
yield on three-month Treasury bills falling from 5.71 percent to
5.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rates are up substantially since they began rising last year,
but it appears that the Fed will have to do a lot more if it wants
to raise rates enough to scare investors. The fact that investors
are not easily alarmed is a tribute to just how much confidence
they have that Greenspan and his colleagues will keep the economy
in good shape. That confidence makes it all the more difficult for
the Fed to slow the economy, no matter how much it wants to do so.

WEBSITE OFFERS TUITION MONEY FOR PERSONAL FACTS

<P>
   In the latest effort to entice Web surfers to spend time _ and
share information that marketers covet _ a Website scheduled to
launch Thursday will give away $10,000 every day for scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   freescholarships.com (cq lowercase f) hopes to lure the vast
majority of high school and college-age students who are not
national merit scholars or promising athletes _ as well as their
Baby Boom parents who are worried about paying for college.
</P>
<P>
   Freesholarships.com, the Internet venture of software company
Mathsoft Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., plans to award another $25,000
monthly and $50,000 each quarter, or more than $4.1 million
annually in scholarships that can be used to pay tuition from
pre-school through graduate school, and even be used to pay off
student loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generation Y and baby boomers are both the most lucrative
market. And this site is unique because it will not just attract
college and high school students, but their parents as well,'' said
Charles Digate, the company's founder, chairman and chief
executive. Digate is also chairman and CEO of Mathsoft, which
provided free scholarships with its initial funding of $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The site will help visitors research financing a college
education, provide advice on how to choose a school and on the
application process.
</P>
<P>
   Those who visit the site and participate in surveys, play games,
enter contests, and purchase items ranging from books to music at
the company store, will receive points or ``schollars'' which can
be used to bid on planned auctions on the site for items _
including scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   By participating in activities on the site, individuals increase
their chance of winning the daily scholarship. Also, by referring
friends and relatives to the site (they must register), individuals
can also earn points and increase their chances of winning
scholarship money.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone 13 years old or older is eligible to win, but adults can
win scholarship money for children in private elementary school,
even preschool.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of winning depend on the number of people who visit the
site each day. Digate would not say how many visitors he expects,
but said the number should grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Some education officials reacted coolly to the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advice that I could give any family about financial
aid is to ask at a college near you,'' said Terry Hartle, senior
vice president of the American Council on Education, a trade
association representing 1,800 two-year and four-year private and
public colleges. ``Colleges are selling a product and in order to
help people buy it, they need to help them with financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Digate said funding for the site could come from other
investors, or from a three-prong revenue stream from the site
itself _ advertising on the site or through e-mail to participants;
the ability of companies to sponsor scholarships as a form of
advertising; and commerce through the planned company store and
developing relationships with existing online merchants including
banks and online brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't this be an obvious place for people to save money?''
Digate asked.

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Every morning, Stan Pestotnik, a pharmacist,
studies reports on several dozen patients at LDS Hospital, one of
the nation's most technologically advanced hospitals. He zeros in
on two or three who have been flagged by a computer as dangerously
close to being harmed by medications they are taking.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously ill patients often take 10 or 20 drugs at doses so
high that vital organs can be destroyed. As soon as tests indicate
deterioration, the computer issues an alert and suggests changes.
Pestotnik visits the patients and consults with nurses, then
telephones their doctors, typically recommending stopping a drug or
reducing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with growing concern about sometimes fatal medical errors
_ often errors in medication _ hospitals nationwide are
increasingly turning to computers for a timely safety check.
</P>
<P>
   LDS is in the vanguard _ one of a handful of medical centers
that have spent years developing electronic systems that make
treatments safer and more effective.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the big New York medical centers are also in the thick of
the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a revolution in the making,'' said Dr. Joseph Hayes, a
cardiologist who is medical director of clinical information
centers at the New York Weill Cornell Center of New York
Presbyterian Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And the business of high-technology safety is not far behind.
Pushing the idea that lives _ not to mention money _ are at stake,
at least a dozen technology companies, like Cerner and McKesson
HBOC, are selling off-the- shelf versions of systems often
developed at teaching hospitals like LDS. They include Internet
links to a doctor's laptop, advice-giving software equipped with
artificial intelligence, wireless devices that transmit medical
orders and bar-code systems to avoid drug errors.
</P>
<P>
   The public became painfully aware of the darker side of health
care in November when the Institute of Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences reported that medical mistakes killed anywhere
from 44,000 to 98,000 people a year. More than 7,000 deaths were
caused by medication errors.
</P>
<P>
   The institute made a number of recommendations, including more
use of technology, and federal health care agencies are scheduled
to respond in a report to the White House in early February.
Congress has already begun hearings on patient safety, and a
coalition of big employers plans to use its buying power with
health plans to press for specific improvements. Technology could
also be used to educate doctors who make an abnormally high number
of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Technology, of course, is not the only key to improving safety.
Many hospitals have made big advances by changing procedures, like
requiring both a nurse and a physician to be present when therapy
begins with powerful cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But technology can make a sizable difference. Computers at
hospitals like LDS, which used to belong to the Church of Jesus
Christ for Latter-day Saints, have cut drug-related errors sharply
by automatically checking each patient's allergies and drug-to-drug
interactions against results from the blood laboratory and other
data.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, though, most hospitals have been slow to adopt
such systems. About one hospital in three already has at least one
important safeguard: a system for doctors to enter orders for
drugs, tests and the like in a computer _ a system the institute
called ``a powerful method for preventing medication errors.'' But
Dr. Arnold Milstein, medical director of the Pacific Business Group
on Health, a coalition of employers, said that ``fewer than 1
percent require their doctors to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most younger doctors are committed members of the Internet
generation, but older physicians are often computer shy. ``I didn't
go to medical school to be a typist'' is the classic mindset.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the technology can be clunky and expensive _ $5 million
to $15 million for fully computerized patient records at a
medium-size hospital. And scribbling an order, even if a doctor's
handwriting is illegible, is still faster than keying it in.
</P>
<P>
   Many medical centers have already invested in an array of
computer systems _ serving the pharmacy, laboratories, cardiology
and radiology units _ that do not communicate with one another. It
is ``a tower of Babel,'' said Dr. George Isham, chief health
officer of HealthPartners, a big Minneapolis-based health
maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Mayo Clinic, which recently introduced electronic
ordering of prescriptions at its headquarters in Rochester, Minn.,
has to deal with systems from different manufacturers at its
branches in Jacksonville, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many technology companies have a distressing habit
of declaring products obsolete every three years, said Dr. George
Hripcsak, who directs clinical information systems at the
Columbia-Presbyterian Center in New York. But ``it takes longer
than three years to install an electronic order-entry system for a
1,000-bed hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, a former undersecretary of Veterans
Affairs who recently became chief executive of the Quality Forum, a
public-private health care coalition, said: ``Health care is still
very much of a cottage industry. It hasn't put in place the systems
you see in financial management, transportation and lots of other
industries.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although computerized records can avert errors that generate
lawsuits some hospital executives worry that full and accessible
records could lower the threshhold for such suits.
</P>
<P>
   The LDS system has 20 different functions, Pestotnik said. One
ensures that the right antibiotics are given after surgery, another
helps patients with breathing problems become independent of
respirators, and another alerts doctors immediately if the wrong
strength of a drug is prescribed.

 &HT;    Markets take interest rate increase in stride
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Inspired by Groundhog Day, First Union economist David
Orr explained the Federal Reserve's interest rate increase
Wednesday this way: ``They emerged from their meeting, saw
inflation and raised interest rates, with more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and most other analysts believe that the fourth rate
increase since June, plus maybe one or two more later this year,
will be all that's needed to cool an overheated economy and hold
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect GDP (gross domestic product) growth to be at an
annual rate of 3.5 percent by midyear, which is what the Fed
wants,'' said Orr.
</P>
<P>
   That would be much cooler than the 5.8 percent rate in the
fourth quarter of 1999, which virtually guaranteed that the Fed's
policy-making Open Market Committee would raise rates at this
week's meeting, the first of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The rate-sensitive bond market had gained early in the day and
held on to the advances after the Fed meeting concluded. The
30-year Treasury yield ended at 6.28 percent, the lowest since Dec.
13 and continuing what is a 7 percent decline since Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average recorded a
modest decrease on profit-taking. But a rally in technology stocks
pushed the recently battered Nasdaq composite, as well as the
Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest move, the Fed raised its key short-term federal
funds rate _ the interest on overnight bank loans _ a quarter of a
percentage point to 5.75 percent, a four-year high. The Fed also
raised the largely symbolic discount rate by a quarter percentage
point to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in a new move designed to improve communications with the
markets and the public, the Fed issued a statement saying that
economic risks are still ``weighted toward conditions that may
generate heightened inflation pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts interpreted that as another way of saying the Fed
is likely to raise rates again, possibly as early as March and
possibly to as much as 6.5 percent before it's over.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts cautioned that the Fed's statement may not be
as frightening as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't read more into it than is there,'' said Alan
Skrainka, chief market strategist for Edward Jones in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This move was widely anticipated. The Fed has now changed
rates seven times since September 1998, and the Dow has gained
3,000 points and Nasdaq has more than doubled in that time. The
lesson here is not to make a knee-jerk reaction to investments when
the rates change.''
</P>
<P>
   The market's reaction is significant, since the wealth effect of
Americans' investment in stocks is credited with fueling much of
the economic expansion, now in its record-breaking 10th year
without a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State University economist Donald Ratajczak credits the
bull market for the economy's growth in 1999. Major stock indexes
posted their fifth straight year of double-digit growth last year,
and the economy posted its fourth straight year of 4 percent
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what happened to the stock market, I can explain what
happened to the consumer, and that is why the economy grew 4
percent again,'' Ratajczak said prior to the Fed's meeting. ``But
that (explanation) really cheats because there is nothing that
explains why the stock market did what it did _1999 was an
aberration in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has been concerned enough about the
market to warn that a sharp setback in share prices could send the
economy into a slump. The latest rate increase is expected to take
at least some steam out of stocks, without ending the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Fed raised rates four times in quick
succession _ in 1994 and early 1995 _ the funds rate climbed a
total of 2.5 percentage points. The economy braked sharply, slowing
to an 0.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 1995 from a
6 percent rate at the end of 1993. Consumer and mortgage rates
rose, curtailing sales of cars and homes.
</P>
<P>
   But Orr doubts that that much slowing will happen this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had the Mexican currency crisis in 1994, which hurt
manufacturing. Also, the stock market was not doing as well then,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do think we will have more moderation in growth this
year than a lot of people expect,'' he added. ``A lot of people
think the economy is impervious to policy actions, but I don't.''

 SALT LAKE CITY: Medicine report.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hospital's owner, Intermountain Health Care, is working on
spreading the system to clinics and doctors' offices. Dr. Brent C.
James, vice president for medical research at Intermountain, is one
author of the Institute of Medicine report.
</P>
<P>
   Intermountain plans to expand its database to include a million
members it serves through its own HMO and other health plans.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the Brigham and Women's Hospital credited its
computer system with helping to reduce serious drug-related
problems by 55 percent, saving $500,000 a year. Overall savings
were up to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham's sister in the Partners
Healthcare System, installed the same system last year. ``This is
an exciting time,'' said Dr. David Bates, chief of general medicine
at Brigham. ``We've shown some things that can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Clement J. McDonald, a professor of medicine at Indiana
University, developed an electronic system that includes medical
records from all five hospitals in Indianapolis. Doctors, he said,
loved ``the ability to instantly get the information they needed.''
</P>
<P>
   He is testing an electronic reminder system for patients at
Wishard Hospital and 40 clinics, which covers everything from flu
shots to heart drugs. ``By next June, we will have it in all five
hospitals and their satellites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some innovations are born of serendipity. Sue Kinnick, a nurse
at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Topeka, Kan., noticed the
hand-held check-in devices when she was returning a rental car and
asked herself, ``Why couldn't we do that in health care?'' The
result was a barded safety system for drugs now being installed at
170 VA hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   A bar code is attached to the day's pills. The nurse swipes the
code on her badge to identify herself, registers the codes on the
drug package and the patient's ID bracelet, then checks a hand-held
device to confirm that the codes match.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we tested the system in Topeka there was a 57 percent
reduction in errors,'' said Dr. James Bagian, director of the VA's
national center for patient safety.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York use
hand-held devices to record a patient's vital signs and when a drug
is taken. Doctors in their offices can take calls from nurses, call
up the patient's electronic ``chart'' on a laptop, and order
medicine or tests.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Matthew Berger, medical director of clinical systems at
Montefiore, said the computer program, inaugurated last spring,
issues an alert if a prescription conflicts with a patient's other
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia-Presbyterian, information on almost 2 million people
is in the electronic record, Hripcsak said. In November, the
records were transferred to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He said 4,000 doctors and nurses use the Columbia system,
including many who log on at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell Center, Columbia's partner, has adopted features of
the Brigham and Women's system, including advice that a doctor may
accept or ignore, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors and nurses also type orders into computers at both
hospitals of the Mount Sinai and New York University Medical
Center. The NYU system issues an updated printout of patient data
hourly, including warnings about allergies and drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of big employers _ including General Motors, General
Electric and the Pacific Business Group on Health _ plans to press
hospitals and health plans to show measurable advances. The
business leaders plan to meet in March with 11 big health insurance
companies to discuss ways to avoid errors by computerizing medical
orders and other improvements. ``Patient safety has finally come
out of the closet,'' Dr. Kizer of the Quality Forum said.

SYSTEMS FOR PREVENTING MEDICAL ERRORS A GROWING BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With HOSPITAL-SAFETY-TECH) 
(bl) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With demand surging for computerized medical records, at least a
dozen companies are selling electronic systems that can help
hospitals and large medical groups avoid dangerous errors.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say health care purchasers spend $20 billion to $30
billion annually on information technology, mainly for billing and
administration. But systems that reduce errors in transmitting
doctors' orders and warn of patients' problems like allergies are
``the most rapidly growing segment of health care information
systems,'' said Christopher Brinzey, a Wall Street analyst at
Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Public concern about avoidable mistakes has mounted since the
Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences recently
blamed such errors for the deaths of as many as 98,000 patients a
year. ``The only way to achieve the institute's goal of a 50
percent reduction in errors is by aggressively implementing
computer-based patient records,'' said Dr. Barry Hieb, a research
director at Gartner Group, a consulting firm based in Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tonya Hongsermeier, a customer support manager at Cerner
Corp., an information technology maker, said: ``The airline
industry realized a long time ago how to automate to be safer. The
health care industry is on the brink of being able to do that same
transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel C. Russler, a vice president of McKesson HBOC, which
has sold introductory components of the systems to 200 of the
nation's 4,000 hospitals, said, ``It is still a young market.''
After a fallow period for these systems while hospitals were
distracted by Year 2000 issues, investors recently pushed up the
stock prices of Cerner and a number of competitors. Since October,
Eclipsys doubled, Cerner rose 70 percent and Shared Medical Systems
gained 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies are offering Internet adaptations so doctors can
dial up patients' records in their offices and homes. ``They learn
to use the system in 20 minutes,'' said Melinda Costin, a customer
operations manager at the health care unit of Minnesota Mining &AMP;
Manufacturing. ``They all know how to get to the stock market on
the Web.'' &QL;

OVERPRODUCTIVE GUINEA PIGS TURN UP IN WINTRY FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How a pack of homeless guinea pigs wound up in the Falmouth,
Mass. woods last week is anybody's guess. But one theory, floating
through town, seems particularly credible: They were probably too
fertile for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   As every amateur biologist knows, guinea pigs have a penchant
for acting like rabbits; it doesn't take long for a handful to
become a hungry, squeaking herd. Which might be why an overwhelmed
pet owner dropped 40 pigs into Beebe Woods -- and started a hubbub
that has yet to die.
</P>
<P>
   If any town would pour its heart out for a pack of hungry
rodents, Falmouth would be it. This Cape Cod town is well-known for
its animal lovers, who take pride in their no-killings pound and
have formed such groups as Friends of Falmouth Dogs and People for
Cats. So when a jogger discovered the guinea pigs last week, a
swarm of volunteers joined the effort to save them.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the pigs had spent a day or two in the wild, sleeping
in a stone wall and passing the time running from dogs and
attracting lice. They were nervous and filthy by the time residents
and animal control workers came to scoop them up.
</P>
<P>
   A few rescuers took pigs home, but most of the rodents went to a
local pet store, the Falmouth Pet Center. There, animal technician
Kirsten Kennette -- who now calls herself a ``pig wrangler'' --
spent two days bathing them, cleaning their ears with Q-tips, and
dressing their scrapes with first-aid cream.
</P>
<P>
   They were easy to care for, she said, except for one problem:
True to their nature, they've been reproducing. Since the rescue,
there have been several multiple births, and two more females are
``very pregnant,'' Kennette said. Two males, especially eager for
love, have been separated from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   The risks of reproduction aren't fazing Falmouth residents,
Kennette said; adoption requests have been streaming in. But
officials with the Animal Rescue League of Boston, who plan to
prosecute the culprit, who they have not yet identified. They say
they need to keep the animals in custody. The guinea pigs are
evidence, Animal Rescue spokeswoman Sonia Beals said.
</P>
<P>
   So league workers are moving the pigs to shelters in Brewster
and Dedham, Mass., where Beals said they'll be held until justice
is served. She was quick to scuttle rumors that the pigs are in any
danger. As long as the animals are healthy, she said, there's no
risk of euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   But Noni Davies, a Falmouth real estate agent and guinea pig
crusader, said she isn't convinced. She has been monitoring the
guinea pigs' fate all week, she said, and some animal control
workers have told her, flat-out, that they can't possibly care for
40 to 60 small rodents.
</P>
<P>
   Other animal lovers have heard the same story, and fear the pigs
will soon be history, Davies said. The guinea pig rescue movement
is still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of phones ringing all over Falmouth right
now,'' she said.

CHINA PROTESTS HOUSE VOTE EXPANDING MILITARY TIES WITH TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China vehemently protested Wednesday against the vote
in the U.S. House to expand military ties with Taiwan, calling it a
``serious encroachment on China's sovereignty'' and a ``gross
interference in China's internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Joseph Prueher was summoned to the Foreign Ministry
to hear the protest.
</P>
<P>
   China considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and had
previously warned that passage of the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act would seriously damage Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Taiwan, which is seeking new advanced weapons from
the United States, said they welcomed Tuesday's vote in the House
as a symbol of American support, even if the bill is unlikely to be
approved by the Senate, and the Clinton administration has
threatened a veto on the ground that the measure would
unnecessarily complicate relations with China and could aggravate
regional tensions in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Approved 341-70, the bill seeks more direct military
communications between U.S. and Taiwanese forces, expanded U.S.
training of Taiwan's officers and an annual report on Taiwan's
security.
</P>
<P>
   The United States already sells weapons to Taiwan for defensive
purposes and has pledged military aid in the event of a Chinese
attack. But it has shied away from an overt alliance that could
embolden Taiwan to declare independence, drawing the United States
into a war.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint made Wednesday to Prueher, an account of which
was later provided by the foreign ministry, Deputy Foreign Minister
Yang Jiechi said the House bill violated previous commitments by
the United States to moderate its military aid to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   What most frightens China about proposed weapons sales to
Taiwan, as well as the deepened military ties called for in the
House legislation, is not just the arms that might be transferred,
Western experts say. China also is worried about expanding
operational ties that could ensure rapid American involvement in
any combat across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Chinese point of view, it isn't so much the
hardware,'' said Steven M. Goldstein, a China specialist at Smith
College. ``It looks to them like we're beginning to rebuild a
military alliance.'' He added that this in turn could encourage
Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   The House action comes six weeks before Taiwan's presidential
elections, though it was not expected to have a major impact on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's electorate is acutely aware of the danger of provoking
China, which has vowed to adtack if the country moves toward
independence. The three major candidates have gone out of their way
to support the status quo, in which Taiwan is functionally a
sovereign state but does not forswear talks with China on eventual
unification.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most Taiwanese welcome any measure that underscores
American support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically speaking, people hope for an American defense
umbrella over Taiwan,'' said Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the
private China Council of Advanced Policy Studies, in a telephone
interview from Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is increasing its defense budget and hopes to buy, among
other American weapons, Patriot anti-missile systems, Aegis
guided-missile destroyers, long range radar and advanced air-to-air
missiles to fit on its fleet of F-16 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   While sales of the Patriots are apparently proceeding,
Washington has not revealed what other cutting-edge weapons could
be approved under a law that permitted sales of defensive weapons
to Taiwan.

   NEW YORK _ Regional ballet companies don't drop into New York as
often as in the past. All the more reason to see the excellent
dancers that the Colorado Ballet put on display in its Manhattan
debut on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Even the program had something rare: an innocent eclecticism.
Frederick Ashton's ``Facade''(1931) is a must for those who have
never seen this early comic gem or who recall its whimsy in
performances with the Joffrey Ballet and the Royal Ballet. Two New
York premieres on the bill, which runs through Sunday night, have a
certain curiosity value.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Picture of Sedalia,'' Peter Pucci's choreography is
polished, showing both originality and Pucci's roots in Pilobolus.
It is a strange piece, promising to be a crowd pleaser set to Scott
Joplin's ragtime but full of dark surprises. In the second
premiere, the young Australian choreographer Stanton Welch offers a
languorous tribute to his mother, the ballerina Marilyn Jones, in
``Of Blessed Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The dancers' strong classical training comes through in the
neo-classical choreography, which is less than persuasive in its
ruling image of a mother and her brood, some of whom look like her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Those who caught a glimpse of this company from Denver when it
performed in 1993 and 1998 at the Brooklyn Center for the
Performing Arts (Brooklyn College), would have been struck by the
troupe's stylistic unity. Martin Fredmann, its artistic director,
has transformed it from an international gaggle of disparate
dancers into a true company. Fredmann has been especially
hospitable to dancers from the former Soviet Union, but the perfect
symbols of the present communal entente are Sharon Wehner of
California and Koichi Kubo of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   What they lack in height they deliver in technique and presence.
Kubo, who won the silver medal at the 1989 International Ballet
Competition in Moscow, and the sparkling Wehner had an opportunity
to pull out the virtuosic stops in the ``Don Quixote'' pas de deux
in 1998. There are no conventional showpieces on the current
program, but their brilliance is apparent.
</P>
<P>
   New and familiar dancers also stand out. Igor Vassin, once with
the Estonian Ballet, remains a remarkably pure classicist, and
Maria Mosina, trained at the Bolshoi, conserves her dramatic
quality. Both make something profound out of the love duet that is
at the center of the Welch ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Ilya and Sasha Kozadayev, whose parents were in the
Maly Ballet in Leningrad, are Colorado-trained newcomers whose
teen-aged freshness and precision immediately catch the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Colorado Ballet has arrived with a modest
program that reveals only part of the company's range. The Pucci
work is danced in jazz shoes, starting out conventionally as an
essay on popular music.
</P>
<P>
   The Joplin recording, however, features Itzhak Perlman and Andre
Previn, and there is more here than an image of townfolk in
Sedalia, Mo., birthplace of Joplin's ragtime.
</P>
<P>
   Characters emerge out of the constantly moving patterns. Tiffany
Helm is the hip-thrusting hussy. Vitali Prokhnitski and Edward
Stegge are two high-flying youths. Gregory Gonzales, arm bent up
like a hammer, is a preacher who gets the folk down on their knees
to pray. Wehner whirls like a sweet young thing, and Kubo, a
compact fireball of energy and virtuosity, is her sweetheart. The
preacher parts them, Kubo gets beaten by the male ensemble, and
Wehner is surrounded by finger-wagging women. When the coda brings
all together, it is not clear whether ``Picture of Sedalia'' is a
narrative piece or a suite of dances.
</P>
<P>
   Ar the Australian Ballet confirmed last fall, Welch has become a
more sophisticated choreographer since he created ``Of Blessed
Memory'' in 1991 in Melbourne. It was a risk to set the work to the
well-known ``Songs of the Auvergne'' by Josef Canteloub. The
music's trills and nature imagery do not help to define Olga
Volobuyeva as the mother recalling the past, including the death of
a daughter. The choreography is essentially a flow of duets, trios
and ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   The company was more at home in `0Facade,'' Ashton's vignettes
on popular dances of the 1930s to William Walton's score. Sasha
Kozadayev, Sandra Kerr and Leslie Morton led off with a sprightly
Scottish fling, Helm was the winsome milkmaid, and Wehner, in
bloomers, offered a saucy polka. The soft-shoe duet needed more
panache, but Mosina and Andrew Thompson gave the famous tango the
right dated quality.

 &HT;    Ford hires UPS Logistics to manage vehicle deliveries
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ford Motor Co. is hiring United Parcel Service's
logistics subsidiary to speed delivery of vehicles to dealers and
provide Internet tracking.
</P>
<P>
   The deal provides Sandy Springs, Ga.-based UPS' Logistics Group
with one of its biggestcontracts to date, a spokeswoman said,
although financial terms weren't released.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it expects the deal, described as a ``strategic
alliance,'' to cut five or six days off the plant-to-dealer
delivery time, currently 14 to 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial savings will result by reducing delivery and
inventory maintenance costs, Ford said. The system also will allow
Ford and its dealers _ and eventually customers _ to track the
status of individual vehicles over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   UPS Logistics Group ultimately will manage Ford's delivery
network, said Dan DiMaggio, chief executive of the UPS subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are re-engineering the Ford delivery network _ introducing
new management practices, eliminating bottlenecks, minimizing
delays and providing information technology systems that greatly
improve the monitoring of vehicles across the entire journey to the
customer,'' DiMaggio said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS won't actually deliver cars and trucks but will manage
deliveries by other road and rail carriers.
</P>
<P>
   One major carrier of Ford vehicles is Decatur, Ga.-based Allied
Automotive Group, North America's biggest car hauler.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Chief Executive Mitchell Poole said Wednesday the
Ford-UPS deal was expected, adding he does not see it as a threat
to his company's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be a valuable ally of both Ford and UPS in
achieving their objectives,'' Poole said. ``UPS has tremendous
strengths in logistics management, but it is not in the same
business as Allied Holdings. We are the global leader in providing
the type of distribution and transportation services that the
Ford-UPS venture will need.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS and Ford described their deal as a ``multiyear'' arrangement
that will first involve 100 UPS Logistics employees, then 150. UPS
Logistics has agreed not to offer similar services to other
automakers for one year while the Ford system is set up.
</P>
<P>
   UPS stock fell $2.25 Wednesday to $58.25, resuming a trend that
started Monday when the company made its first earnings
announcement since going public. Despite a 37 percent jump in
fourth-quarter profit, analysts believe some investors expected
more volume growth from UPS' role in delivering holiday goods
ordered via the Internet.

 &HT;    Shaw a penny shy of profit forecast
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shaw Industries fell short of analysts' estimates by a
penny Wednesday on a 28 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit,
before charges.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest carpet maker reported earnings of $51.4
million, or 38 cents a share, before a charge, compared with $40.1
million, or 28 cents a share, one year ago. Dalton, Ga.-based Shaw
Industries was expected to earn 39 cents a share, according to a
First Call survey of analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw Industries recorded one-time, after-tax charges of $3.5
million in the fourth quarter for the closing of its retail
business and a yarn plant.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the fourth quarter rose 5 percent to $1 billion, up
from $952.4 million in the year-ago period. Shaw released earnings
after the market closed. The stock closed Wednesday at $13.37 1/2,
up 25 cents. On Tuesday, Shaw hit a 52-week low of $12.87 1/2.

ISRAELI LAWMAKERS HOLD QUICK DEBATE ON NUCLEAR ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's parliament on Wednesday begrudgingly held
its first public discussion in more than 35 years about the
country's long-secret nuclear arms programs, and the usually
loquacious body had so little to say that the debate was over in 52
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament's speaker, Avraham Burg, tried to limit raucous
catcalling in order, he said, ``to put this subject behind us as
quickly as possible.'' Indeed, despite verbal fire between Jewish
and Israeli Arab legislators, the whole affair took less time than
the debate about prostitution that immediately preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of silence, old habits were hard to break.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has a longstanding policy of ``deliberate ambiguity''
about its nuclear weapons, and politicians on the left and right
have helped keep the lid on any public conversation about what The
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists calls the sixth-largest nuclear
arsenal in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today reaffirms the fact that Israelis do not
want to talk about this issue and that the inhibition is
self-imposed rather than imposed by censorship,'' said Avner Cohen,
a senior fellow at the National Security Archive in Washington who
wrote ``Israel and the Bomb'' (Columbia University Press). ``This
is perhaps the last Israeli taboo.''
</P>
<P>
   Burg allowed the discussion Wednesday after an Israeli Arab
legislator, Issam Makhul, petitioned the Supreme Court to request
it. Speaking Wednesday from the podium, Makhul opened by declaring
a ``historic day'' as rightist legislators marched out as a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're my enemy,'' one legislator, Zvi Hendel, spat at Makhul
as he was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of court cases challenging its secrecy, the
government has started to modify its traditional refusal to say
anything about its nuclear arms programs. Government officials have
made terse statements about nuclear policy, and in November the
government allowed a newspaper to publish censored excerpts from
the treason trial 12 years ago of a whistle-blower on the nuclear
industry, Mordechai Vanunu.
</P>
<P>
   After the publication, Makhul pushed for an open airing of the
issue in Parliament, whose sessions are broadcast on cable
television. And some Israelis eagerly looked forward to what they
imagined would be a ``precedent-setting discussion of Israel's
nuclear policies,'' as Danny Rubenstein, a senior writer for the
newspaper Haaretz wrote in Wednesday morning's issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubenstein predicted correctly that Makhul and his Communist
Party would ``stand ostracized, facing the Parliament alone,
thereby reinforcing the perception of the nuclear issue as a
trivial curiosity that is of interest only to extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Makhul began by attacking David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founding
prime minister. He criticized Ben-Gurion for establishing the code
of silence by insisting from the start that Israel's nuclear
reactor, in Dimona, was intended solely for ``research and peaceful
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world knows,'' Makhul said, ``that Israel is a large
warehouse of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.'' He
asserted that only Israeli citizens were kept in the dark about
Israel's nuclear arsenal _ some 200 to 300 warheads, he said _ and
conditions at the aging Dimona reactor.
</P>
<P>
   He declared that Iran and Iraq were ``threatened by Dimona,''
and not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the government, Chaim Ramon, a cabinet minister and
the only other speaker, asked him, ``Do you want us to announce to
Iran and Iraq exactly what we have?'' Even in other democratic
countries, Ramon asserted, discussion about nuclear arms policy is
limited and Israel should not have to ``invite all our enemies to
listen in.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There has not been total secrecy: Israeli legislators are
briefed in detail about the nuclear program in closed-door
classified committee meetings, and some tour the Dimona nuclear
reactor plant. But there has been no discussion on the floor of
Parliament since the early 1960s, when similar attempts at airing
the subject failed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ramon stated what he said were the guiding principles of
Israel's nuclear policy:
</P>
<P>
   _ Israel will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   _ Israel, which has not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty, supports, in principle, preventing the spread of nuclear
weapons, even though international support of the concept has been
ineffective in curtailing Iranian and Iraqi weapons production.
</P>
<P>
   _ Israel supports the creation of a region free of nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles once there is a ``proven peace over
a sustained period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many representatives of international anti-nuclear
groups and foreign governments attended the midday session, few
Israeli politicians sat through it. Makhul acknowledged the
presence of representatives of Egypt, which has taken the lead
among Arab countries in pressing Israel to open its nuclear arms
program to international inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, some Israeli academics and journalists lamented the
way the discussion, boxed between the official government view and
that of the Israeli Communist Party, was born and died in under an
hour. There are ways to discuss Israel's nuclear program, they
said, without giving away state secrets but providing for greater
oversight and public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   But some, like Dr. Ernesto Kahan, an epidemiologist and head of
an Israeli physicians' peace group, were pleased that the first
steps of a public conversation had been taken. ``I think these
things will gradually be discussed much more in depth as the peace
process continues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer debate on prostitution, which was touched off by a
television documentary on prostitutes imported from the former
Soviet Union, the legislators discussed everything from legalizing
prostitution to passing laws to criminalize the international
traffic in human beings.

STUDY SAYS CHILDREN WITH CANCER SUFFER MORE THAN NECESSARY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children who are dying of cancer suffer greatly because they are
not given adequate treatment for pain, shortness of breath,
profound fatigue, nausea and other distressing symptoms, according
to a study being published Thursday in The New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments for those symptoms do exist, but doctors are not
using them well enough, concluded a research team led by Dr. Joanne
Wolfe, a pediatric oncologist at Children's Hospital and the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Their report is based on
medical records and interviews with parents of 103 children, and it
is the first published survey of parents whose sons or daughters
died of cancer. According to the parents, 89 percent of the
children suffered a great deal from at least one symptom in their
last month of life.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study said more attention should be paid to
treating pain and discomfort in children with cancer, and not just
at the end of life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard H. Wexler, a pediatric oncologist at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said: ``This paper is
pretty humbling. I think it will force institutions to ask
themselves, `Are we doing an adequate job of meeting patients'
needs at the end of their lives?'''
</P>
<P>
   Children's suffering, the authors said, may be neglected because
doctors do not recognize it, because they are more focused on
curing cancer than on treating pain, and because many doctors have
little training or experience in taking care of dying children _
especially since 75 percent of children with cancer today are
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms may also be overlooked because, traditionally, the goal
of treatment has shifted from cure to comfort only after the battle
against cancer has been lost, and both doctors and parents dread
taking steps that symbolize giving up hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results will come as a surprise to the treating
community,'' said Dr. Jane Weeks, an author of the study and a
professor of medicine at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But another specialist in cancer in children, Dr. Elaine Morgan
of Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said the findings were
no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area of end-of-life care has been largely ignored over the
years,'' she said.``The expertise required for that kind of care is
very specific and has not been cultivated the way curative medicine
has. Doctors are trained to cure, and that's what we like to do.''
She said both children and adults needed better end-of-life
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, 12,400 children in the United States develop cancer.
In 1998, 2,500 died, making cancer a major cause of death in
childhood, exceeded only by accidents and guns.
</P>
<P>
   In their study, Wolfe's team reviewed medical charts and
interviewed one parent of each of 103 children who died from 1990
to 1997 and had been treated at Children's Hospital or the
Dana-Farber center or both. The children were 3 to 18 years old
when they died; the average age was 11. Eighty percent died of
cancer, and the rest from complications of treatment. About half
died in the hospital, and half of those in an intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been hesitation to contact these families out of a
sense of trying to protect them,'' Wolfe said. ``But we found the
families welcomed the opportunity to finally talk about their
experiences. The interviews lasted 110 minutes, on average.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents were asked whether, during the last month of life,
their children had pain, poor appetite, nausea and vomiting,
constipation, diarrhea, shortness of breath or fatigue. They were
asked to rate the child's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reporting high levels of suffering, the parents
said that efforts to treat the symptoms often did not succeed:
treatments worked for pain in 27 percent of patients, for nausea
and vomiting in 10 percent and for shortness of breath in 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers acknowledged two possible weaknesses in their
approach: it included patients from only one institution, and it
relied on the memories of grieving parents to assess the pain of
their dying children.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly important finding, the researchers said, was that
the patients who had the most trouble controlling pain were those
whose primary doctors were no longer involved in their care as
death closed in. In addition, the patients who had the most
peaceful final month were those whose parents had discussed hospice
care with doctors earlier rather than later during their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Hospice care is palliative, meant to relieve pain and suffering
rather than bring about a cure. It is generally provided by
agencies that help families take care of dying patients at home,
but Morgan noted in her editorial that the United States has very
few palliative care organizations for children.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to create more. Last November, Congress
appropriated $1 million to establish five model hospice programs
later this year for children with life-threatening conditions.
Children's Hospice International, based in Alexandria, Va., will
help set up the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the suffering that parents in the study reported, 70
percent said their children's deaths had been peaceful, and most
said the children had received good care. The researchers, however,
said more could have been done to treat symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   For both pain and shortness of breath, for instance, morphine
and other painkillers can be provided in patient-operated pumps
that let children and parents control the doses. Nerve blocks can
sometimes be used for pain that is hard to control, and doctors say
that nausea and vomiting can be controlled with medication.
Transfusions and better attention to nutrition can help with
debilitating fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors warned that not every symptom can be controlled, even
with the best of care. ``It is unrealistic and unfair to perpetuate
the television image of a symptom-free, beatific death,'' Wexler
said. ``It doesn't happen.''

RUSSIAN MILITARY SAYS IT IS ABOUT TO TAKE GROZNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian military insisted Wednesday that it had
thwarted a rebel attempt to break out of the besieged city of
Grozny and would soon capture the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who visited Russian
troops near Grozny on Wednesday, said that 586 militants had been
killed trying to escape and that the Russian advance on Grozny had
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   With virtually all of the Western press barred from the battle
zones in Chechnya, however, there was no way to confirm the Russian
claims.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russian military's account was contradicted by Bislan
Gantamirov, a pro-Moscow Chechen paramilitary leader who has been
fighting alongside Russian troops in Grozny. He said that thousands
of militants were not trapped in Grozny but had managed to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last three days about 3,500 fighters have left,''
Gantamirov told reporters in the Chechen town of Urus-Martan. ``I
cannot say how many are still in Grozny, but those who were able to
leave have left and the last group left today.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the rebels is one of the larger mysteries in the
four-month-old war. Even judged from afar, it seems clear that the
fighting within Grozny has reached a turning point and that the
Russians finally appear to be on the verge of taking the city.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny, however, is a ruin and its capture is of more symbolic
than strategic importance. By planting the Russian flag in Grozny,
the Russian military will re-establish control over a city that was
the scene of some of their greatest humiliations during the
1994-1996 war. But the capture of Grozny will not end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The militants, however, almost certainly never planned to keep
the city. Their plan was probably to inflict high losses on the
Russian side and then flee to fight another day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The main aim of the rebel attacks in recent days was to blast an
escape route through the Russian blockade of the city. According to
NTV, an independent television network, the rebel assault began
when 800 militants left their settlements in Chechnya and assembled
near Alkhan-Kala, just southwest of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal was to help establish a corridor so that their
comrades within the city could escape. At the same time, rebel
fighters within the city s/ught to break out.
</P>
<P>
   Some rebels were killed and injured when they stumbled into a
Russian minefield. And Russian troops eventually fought their way
into the center of Alkhan-Kala.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military said it had confirmed that Shamil Basayev,
the Chechen warlord, had been injured by a mine while trying to
flee Grozny and had lost a leg. Gantamirov said that he also had
information that Basayev was wounded in the leg, but did not say
how serious the injury was.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian military did not capture Basayev and his
whereabouts were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have also said that several of their senior
commanders were also killed in the attempt to escape from Grozny,
including Lecha Dudayev, the Grozny mayor and nephew of the first
president of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging they had suffered significant losses, the
rebels insisted they would carry on the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have conducted a tactical withdrawal from Grozny similar to
the tactical withdrawal of 1996,'' they said in a statement on
their Web site (www.qoqaz.net) ``We pledge, however, to return.''

 &HT;    Pat Mitchell, head of CNN Productions, likely headed to PBS
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pat Mitchell, the head of CNN Productions and a Turner
executive with deep roots in Georgia, appears poised to become the
next president of PBS.
</P>
<P>
   She will be recommended by a search committee to the PBS board
of directors this weekend. If she is approved, an announcement
could come Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers throughout CNN were buzzing Wednesday about the pending
appointment, following a brief item on trade magazine Broadcasting
&AMP; Cable's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell declined to comment Wednesday, referring questions to
PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 57, has had a hugely successful tenure at CNN
Productions, culminating last year with a prestigious Peabody Award
for the 24-hour series ``Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was also handed a major blow last year when Ted Turner
himself scrapped plans for the Women's Network, a new cable network
that Mitchell was supposed to run. After Mitchell was announced as
the network's president, Turner pulled the plug, concerned that the
network would not be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has a long-standing reputation as an extremely
hard-working executive. ``She has a schedule that would kill
Superwoman,'' said Barbara Pyle, a CNN documentary producer. ``I
don't know if she fits the technical definition of a workaholic,''
said her son Mark, ``but she's probably pushing the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   If the appointment comes through, Mitchell would head the Public
Broadcasting Service, which provides public television programming
to member stations nationwide. She would potentially be able to
exert enormous influence on the types of shows PBS makes and
distributes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Epstein, vice president of communications for PBS, would not
confirm Mitchell as the candidate, but said the PBS board will meet
Friday through Sunday in Key Largo, Fla., where the search
committee will make its recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was born in Statesboro, and grew up in Swainsboro. She
attended the University of Georgia, eventually getting her Masters
from UGA in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching at Virginia Commonwealth University in the late '60s,
Mitchell became interested in journalism. She worked for Look
magazine and as a speechwriter for New York Mayor John Lindsay. In
the '70s, she was an anchor and talk-show host in Boston and
Washington, and in the '80s, hosted her own syndicated show,
``Woman to Woman,'' and sometimes subbed for Jane Pauley on
``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, she was hired to run TBS Productions, Ted Turner's
documentary division, and from there climbed to president of CNN
Productions and of Time Inc. Television.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell serves on the boards of the Sundance Film Festival
Institute and Green Cross (an environmental group) and Girls, Inc.,
a mentoring organization.
</P>
<P>
   If she is approved, Mitchell would replace Ervin Duggan, who
resigned as PBS president in October. John Swope, a member of the
PBS board, has been interim president while the search committee
has been preparing its recommendation.

 &HT;    Willie B.: Atlanta says goodbye to old friend
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He was, in every sense, huge.
</P>
<P>
   He was ours; he was the world's. Willie B., probably the most
famous gorilla on Earth and surely the best-loved Atlanta citizen
of any species, died of heart failure during a peaceful nap
Wednesday afternoon. He was 41.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 400-pound lowland gorilla, named after former
Atlanta Mayor William B. Hartsfield, was born in the wild and
became the star of Zoo Atlanta from his arrival in 1961. He leaves
behind four daughters, a 2-year-old son, Kidogo _ who will be
renamed Willie B. Jr. _ and legions of heartbroken fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like losing one of your closest friends,'' says Zoo
Atlanta Director Terry Maple. ``This was a magnificent animal, a
great ambassador for the city, a great father. This will always be
his zoo _ he built it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, old, rich, poor, black, white, animal lovers and those
who couldn't care less about a zoo _ everybody in Atlanta knew
Willie B. Toward the end of his life it was not necessary for him
to roar, or beat his chest, or even to move around very much (the
arthritis in his back and knee had gotten worse in recent years).
When you've got a 40-inch neck, it doesn't take a lot to command
attention. The silverback merely had to sit, ruminate, preside over
the 10 other gorillas in his troop and be his lordly self.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was growing up and my parents took me to the zoo,
Willie B. was the thing to see _ we were crazy about that big ol'
guy,'' says Lauren Neal, 22, a dental assistant from Atlanta.
``Then the pandas came in with all that fuss and ... well, I just
hope Willie B. didn't feel a little forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much chance of that, judging by the get-well cards, promises
of prayer and loads of goodies (including M&AMP;M's and Reese's Pieces,
the big guy's favorites) that poured into the zoo during his
six-week bout with pneumonia and heart trouble. He was diagnosed
with cardiomyopathy, the same weakness of heart muscle that
afflicts humans, and appeared to be rallying in recent days. But
Wednesday, after Willie lay down for a customary midday nap, he
could not be roused.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback gorilla
</P>
<P>
   Willie B. was a true survivor _ not just in life span, but in
his ability to thrive through good times and bad. There's little
debate that until Maple and his bolstered budget arrived in the
late '80s, times were bad at the Grant Park Zoo (as Zoo Atlanta was
formerly known). It was once ranked among the nation's worst. Many
animals died prematurely, including the first gorilla named Willie
B. He died of a virus at age 2, and the mayor was so disappointed
he called for the replacement we now know as Willie B., who was
purchased from a Kansas City animal dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Willie B. had no contact with other gorillas, never went outside
his cages, for a quarter century. Though some residents were
outraged that he had no amusement other than a TV set, he made a
cute feature story. When it was reported on local TV that the great
ape liked the show ``Real People,'' the NBC program came to Atlanta
to profile its, er, biggest fan.
</P>
<P>
   Though often described as gentle-natured, Willie was not one for
humans to cuddle. One of his keepers found out the hard way in
1980. When a cage door was left open, the gorilla slipped up behind
the keeper and tossed him against a wall, breaking his leg and
knocking him unconscious. Since the ape could easily have killed
the keeper then, but didn't, it was concluded that Willie was
probably trying to play.
</P>
<P>
   As Maple revitalized the zoo, the gorilla began to show up in
pictures and articles throughout the international news media.
Another boost to Willie B.'s renown was his role as one of the apes
studied by the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Says Maple, ``For me, a high point in Willie B.'s career was
seeing him go outside for the first time in maybe 15 years,'' with
the opening of the zoo's Ford African Rain Forest habitat in 1988.
``He clearly enjoyed it very much _ feeling the sun and wind on his
face after so long. Just watching him touch a tree, explore his
surroundings, was a moving thing to see. People were weeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedroom adventures
</P>
<P>
   In matters of romance and reproduction, Willie B. was as closely
watched and talked about as a newlywed prince of the British royal
family (but with even less privacy). What made him especially
fascinating is that by the time he interacted with any eligible
female, he was far past the prince stage, a confirmed middle-aged
bachelor of 30. Like a clueless geezer in a singles bar, he managed
to get his face slapped by the first female he touched in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   All Atlanta hoped and prayed that before it was too late Willie
B. would do his part to expand the world's perilously small gorilla
population, and leave an heir.
</P>
<P>
   Those prayers were answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a phone call from Charles Horton, Willie B.'s keeper,
saying, `Get up here now _ there's something you've got to see,'''
Maple recalls. ``I literally ran up that hill. There was Willie B.,
and he was breeding all right. Doing what comes naturally. Until
that moment we had no idea if he ever would.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie B.'s first daughter, Kudzoo, was born Feb. 8, 1994. Two
more daughters, Olympia and Sukari, and son Kidogo followed. In
1999, at age 40, Willie B. became the oldest gorilla ever to sire
in captivity with the birth of daughter Lulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so proud to have watched Willie through all his phases
_ succeed at his life,'' said Horton, the gorilla's keeper from
1974, who delighted the ape with a kind of peekaboo game _
scurrying out of sight whenever Willie pretended to charge. ``It
was like sending a kid off to college: seeing him adapt to new
environments, get along with the other gorillas and mate. I don't
know where he learned it all after all those years. All the
gorillas respected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``An animal like this,'' Horton added, ``affects you more
strongly than you might think.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ape's pneumonia and heart trouble, he was kept apart
from his troop, but all 10 of them _ his children and five adult
females _ would crowd into a ``visiting room'' to watch the ailing
patriarch. He would gaze back, making low, rumbling grunts of
reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   While there are two other adult male gorillas at Zoo Atlanta,
Ozzie and Ivan, with their own separate troops, all eyes will be on
Kidogo, Willie B.'s only son, as he officially takes the name of
Willie B. Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of Willie B. will always go on at Zoo Atlanta,''
Maple said.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo is searching for a sculptor to create a realistic
life-size bronze of Willie B., so that he may continue, in a
fashion, to preside over his old stomping grounds. The gorilla will
be cremated, and if corporate sponsorship is forthcoming, his ashes
will be flown to Cameroon and scattered over the jungles of his
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The duty of a king
</P>
<P>
   Like a great actor or statesman, Willie B. had a face capable of
great expressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When crowds pressed against the glass of the gorillas' viewing
house, waving and pointing to the silverback seated just a few feet
away, he might deign to glance at them for a moment. A bit of
distaste or boredom might flicker across his leathery visage, as if
he were yearning for the good old days before celebrity madness
took hold. But there was also patience and forbearance there, a
look that seemed to say: ``Yes, the people must see me, for it
lifts their hearts. It is the duty of a king to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports stars can lose championship games, tycoons can get caught
in love nests, politicians can make enemies _ we all make mistakes
because we're human. Willie B. had no such problem. He could do no
wrong. In this sense he seemed to rank slightly higher on the
evolutionary tree than all of us who crunched our snack foods and
gawked at him. Calm, stoic, a bulging bundle of terrifying power in
the peaceful autumn of his years, he seemed to possess behind those
wary eyes some deep wisdom. The only reason he didn't explain it to
us, it seemed, was because he had better things to do.
</P>
<P>
   Like sit and watch his kids romp around him.
</P>
<P>
   You knew something, all right, Willie B. Goodbye, old friend.
</P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Today the law school campus at the old
Leningrad State University, which is located on the 22nd Line of
Vasilyevsky Island, is dotted with cozy little cafes and
restaurants. But some three decades ago the nearest eatery offered
watery slop that simply went by the name of coffee, and it was
several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   That was when a twentysomething, bright Vladimir Putin, who is
now Russia's acting president, majored in law there, after
finishing secondary school in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the rambunctious students used to buy cheap
fortified wine in a cellar shop nearby and drink it at home in
their kitchens. True, we don't yet know whether Putin had ever been
observed thus amusing himself. Today the university alumni mostly
recall the energetic prime minister's athletic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during his undergraduate days Putin actively engaged in
what were at the time exotic martial arts: sambo and judo. In 1974
he won the Leningrad judo championship, earning a title of
Candidate Master of Sports.
</P>
<P>
   While still a sophomore, Putin was entrusted with forming a
college sambo team to compete in a University championship. Because
experienced wrestlers were few and far between, Putin persuaded a
fellow student, who had just learned a few sambo throws and holds,
to take part in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The team was formed, but the championship matches ended in
tragedy: Putin's friend injured his cervical vertebra and died in
the hospital several days later. It was a serious blow to young
Putin: He withdrew into himself and remained something of a recluse
until graduation. In any event, none of Putin's former classmates
can now boast of an early, close friendship with the acting
president.
</P>
<P>
   In his final year at the university, Putin was approached by a
Leningrad KGB officer, who invited him to collaborate with state
security agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed at once,'' Putin recalls in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be said that in those years it was common practice to
recruit future security officers, as well as ordinary informers,
from the ranks of college students. To all appearances, however,
Putin was offered duties more advanced than just informing on his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the latter recall that shortly before graduation,
Putin became the proud owner of a Zaporozhets mini _ a luxury
automobile at the time. Putin personally explained that he had won
the car in a lottery, but few people believed that.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he graduated cum laude in 1975, Putin, along with two
other graduates, was assigned to work as a junior officer at the
KGB Foreign Intelligence Directorate. For a long time he worked in
Germany as a KGB undercover agent. Later on, when he was discharged
into the reserve, he got a job at Leningrad University as the
pro-rector's assistant for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 he became an adviser to Anatoly Sobchak, chairman of the
Leningrad city council, and in 1992, chucking his KGB career, Putin
accepted Sobchak's offer of a full-time job at Smolny, the city
hall, becoming head of the St. Petersburg mayor's office External
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A former intelligence officer turned public figure in St.
Petersburg _ it was news. And Putin practically never turned down
journalists' requests for interviews either. True, Putin's comments
were not particularly popular with readers. In print, he had the
reputation of being articulate but vague.
</P>
<P>
   Some rather cynical journalists dubbed him ``the Smolny gray
eminence.'' In St. Petersburg law-enforcement structures he was
nicknamed ``Stasi.'' Ill-wishers called him simply ``the KGB man,''
and everyone instantly recognized the reference.
</P>
<P>
   It was of course Sobchak who introduced Putin to big-time
politics. They first met on the way to Vasilyevsky Island and in
the mid-1970s, Professor Sobchak was teaching law at the University
where Putin was an undergraduate. Yet they did not become really
close until the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They say it was Rector Merkuryev of Leningrad University who
recommended Putin to Sobchak as a highly efficient person. Over the
10 subsequent years Putin lived up to that recommendation: He
followed Sobchak like a shadow to official receptions as well as to
more artistic functions such as concerts by the pop star Alla
Pugacheva, who was greatly admired by the Sobchaks, even though
Putin himself preferred the Mariinsky Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Soon no decision at the city hall was made without Putin's
knowledge. Sobchak, who rarely trusted anyone and who often changed
his opinion about the people around him, seemed to trust Putin
absolutely, saying he was the man one could depend on in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1993, during a rebellion by the deputies after
President Yeltsin had dissolved the parliament, a contingent of
combat tanks stormed the building. In that atmosphere of chaos,
Putin prudently met the mayor at the airport with a reinforced
security detail.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1996 presidential election, Putin led, on Sobchak's
orders, the St. Petersburg NDR (``Our Home Is Russia'') office.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996 Putin ran Sobchak's election campaign and
also sued Alexander Belyayev, who was then the chairman of the
Legislative Assembly. At the height of a gubernatorial election
campaign, he alleged that Sobchak and Putin owned real estate
abroad and kept large amounts of money in foreign banks. Belyayev
had to apologize and soon disappeared from the St. Petersburg
political scene.
</P>
<P>
   After Sobchak's defeat in the gubernatorial election, Putin
flatly refused to work with the new team, saying that ``it would
look like an act of treachery.'' Sobchak's recent triumphant return
from self-imposed exile in Paris was largely attributed to Putin's
increased clout.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, only a short while ago it was rumored in St.
Petersburg that Putin might become the next governor. Yet,
responding to my question about the likelihood, Sobchak said that
Putin's potential was much bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   One of Putin's former colleagues at Smolny recalls that he
always acted in an admirably manly style: ``If he was friends with
someone, that was great luck, but those he was down on were in real
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, when moving into a new office, Putin never initiated
any redecoration jobs, which never failed to stun some of the
bureaucrats. Thus in St. Petersburg, when he first entered Putin's
office, Sergei Tkachev, the office's former occupant just appointed
chairman of the Smolny External Relations Committee, could not hold
back his astonishment: ``Why didn't he have the furniture changed
at least?''
</P>
<P>
   Putin liked meeting with his friends at a suburban dacha which,
incidentally, burned down as soon as he moved to Moscow and has not
been rebuilt. His wife with two daughters immediately followed her
husband to Moscow. Putin's parents are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in St. Petersburg, Putin has just a handful of friends, and
also his wife's relatives. And of course, the Neva River, the
Mariinsky Opera House and Vasilyevsky Island too.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin is a hero to anyone it is to the military. By his
edict, the defense budget will now have more money for guns and
less for nuclear bombs. At a government cabinet session on Jan. 27,
Putin said defense spending this year will be 50 percent higher
than last year. A bigger defense budget, he stressed, was a
``conscious choice,'' not related to the recent events in the North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem here runs deeper and it has to do with the fact
that the military has been underfunded for many years in a row,
which has led to negative consequences for the country's defense
capability,'' Putin summed up. He is the first Russian leader in
recent years to state bluntly that Russia intends to put more money
into weapons production and its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Putin's habit to carefully select the venue and
timing for such statements, his address at the cabinet session was
a well-calculated move that clearly had a specific target audience
_ above all, the Russian armed forces, who remain desperate for
support, and the outside world, which is concerned more about the
security of Russian nuclear stockpiles than about tanks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in many years, the defense production and
arms-procurement program has been approved in January. Previously,
neither the Defense Ministry, which places production orders, nor
the defense production enterprises knew what to produce, or in what
volumes, until summer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, 80 percent of all funds was spent on the
Strategic Nuclear Forces, with conventional weapons programs _
given the chronic underfunding of the defense sector _ getting just
a pittance. This year, according to Ilya Klebanov, vice premier in
charge of the military-industrial complex, 30 percent of the
defense budget will be spent on the nuclear forces while the
remaining 70 percent, on conventional weapons systems. Considerable
sums will be spent on R&AMP;D projects.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin denies the new defense budget is linked to the
war in Chechnya, there is a link. The war has apparently affected
the military's kitty. After the outbreak of the second military
campaign in Chechnya, the state disbursed, as a matter of urgency,
an extra 4 billion rubles for arms procurement programs and
immediately raised the question of increasing the share of defense
spending in the 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   True, the government has yet to find the money _ not just on
paper. Before the operation in Chechnya began, the defense sector
received only 46 percent of the earmarked funding, whereas by the
end of last year this figure had grown to 86 percent, which is an
all-time record in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Putin remains a unique candidate on the scene. For the
first time since the 1917 Revolution, the next head of state in
Russia could be a person born in a capital city _ in Putin's case,
in Leningrad on Oct. 7, 1952. And not in snobbish Moscow either,
but in Europeanized St. Petersburg.

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Today the law school campus at the old
Leningrad State University, which is located on the 22nd Line of
Vasilyevsky Island, is dotted with cozy little cafes and
restaurants. But some three decades ago the nearest eatery offered
watery slop that simply went by the name of coffee, and it was
several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   That was when a twentysomething, bright Vladimir Putin, who is
now Russia's acting president, majored in law there, after
finishing secondary school in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the rambunctious students used to buy cheap
fortified wine in a cellar shop nearby and drink it at home in
their kitchens. True, we don't yet know whether Putin had ever been
observed thus amusing himself. Today the university alumni mostly
recall the energetic prime minister's athletic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during his undergraduate days Putin actively engaged in
what were at the time exotic martial arts: sambo and judo. In 1974
he won the Leningrad judo championship, earning a title of
Candidate Master of Sports.
</P>
<P>
   While still a sophomore, Putin was entrusted with forming a
college sambo team to compete in a University championship. Because
experienced wrestlers were few and far between, Putin persuaded a
fellow student, who had just learned a few sambo throws and holds,
to take part in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The team was formed, but the championship matches ended in
tragedy: Putin's friend injured his cervical vertebra and died in
the hospital several days later. It was a serious blow to young
Putin: He withdrew into himself and remained something of a recluse
until graduation. In any event, none of Putin's former classmates
can now boast of an early, close friendship with the acting
president.
</P>
<P>
   In his final year at the university, Putin was approached by a
Leningrad KGB officer, who invited him to collaborate with state
security agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed at once,'' Putin recalls in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be said that in those years it was common practice to
recruit future security officers, as well as ordinary informers,
from the ranks of college students. To all appearances, however,
Putin was offered duties more advanced than just informing on his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the latter recall that shortly before graduation,
Putin became the proud owner of a Zaporozhets mini _ a luxury
automobile at the time. Putin personally explained that he had won
the car in a lottery, but few people believed that.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he graduated cum laude in 1975, Putin, along with two
other graduates, was assigned to work as a junior officer at the
KGB Foreign Intelligence Directorate. For a long time he worked in
Germany as a KGB undercover agent. Later on, when he was discharged
into the reserve, he got a job at Leningrad University as the
pro-rector's assistant for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 he became an adviser to Anatoly Sobchak, chairman of the
Leningrad city council, and in 1992, chucking his KGB career, Putin
accepted Sobchak's offer of a full-time job at Smolny, the city
hall, becoming head of the St. Petersburg mayor's office External
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A former intelligence officer turned public figure in St.
Petersburg _ it was news. And Putin practically never turned down
journalists' requests for interviews either. True, Putin's comments
were not particularly popular with readers. In print, he had the
reputation of being articulate but vague.
</P>
<P>
   Some rather cynical journalists dubbed him ``the Smolny gray
eminence.'' In St. Petersburg law-enforcement structures he was
nicknamed ``Stasi.'' Ill-wishers called him simply ``the KGB man,''
and everyone instantly recognized the reference.
</P>
<P>
   It was of course Sobchak who introduced Putin to big-time
politics. They first met on the way to Vasilyevsky Island and in
the mid-1970s, Professor Sobchak was teaching law at the University
where Putin was an undergraduate. Yet they did not become really
close until the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They say it was Rector Merkuryev of Leningrad University who
recommended Putin to Sobchak as a highly efficient person. Over the
10 subsequent years Putin lived up to that recommendation: He
followed Sobchak like a shadow to official receptions as well as to
more artistic functions such as concerts by the pop star Alla
Pugacheva, who was greatly admired by the Sobchaks, even though
Putin himself preferred the Mariinsky Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Soon no decision at the city hall was made without Putin's
knowledge. Sobchak, who rarely trusted anyone and who often changed
his opinion about the people around him, seemed to trust Putin
absolutely, saying he was the man one could depend on in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1993, during a rebellion by the deputies after
President Yeltsin had dissolved the parliament, a contingent of
combat tanks stormed the building. In that atmosphere of chaos,
Putin prudently met the mayor at the airport with a reinforced
security detail.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1996 presidential election, Putin led, on Sobchak's
orders, the St. Petersburg NDR (``Our Home Is Russia'') office.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996 Putin ran Sobchak's election campaign and
also sued Alexander Belyayev, who was then the chairman of the
Legislative Assembly. At the height of a gubernatorial election
campaign, he alleged that Sobchak and Putin owned real estate
abroad and kept large amounts of money in foreign banks. Belyayev
had to apologize and soon disappeared from the St. Petersburg
political scene.
</P>
<P>
   After Sobchak's defeat in the gubernatorial election, Putin
flatly refused to work with the new team, saying that ``it would
look like an act of treachery.'' Sobchak's recent triumphant return
from self-imposed exile in Paris was largely attributed to Putin's
increased clout.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, only a short while ago it was rumored in St.
Petersburg that Putin might become the next governor. Yet,
responding to my question about the likelihood, Sobchak said that
Putin's potential was much bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   One of Putin's former colleagues at Smolny recalls that he
always acted in an admirably manly style: ``If he was friends with
someone, that was great luck, but those he was down on were in real
trouble.''
</P>
<P>

incidentally, burned down as soon as he moved to Moscow and has not
been rebuilt. His wife with two daughters immediately followed her
husband to Moscow. Putin's parents are dead.

 THAT 30-YEAR BENCHMARK? THINK 10-YEAR, TREASURY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since 1977, when the federal government began regularly issuing
30-year bonds, they have been the benchmark of the American bond
market. But Wednesday the Treasury signaled that those days should
soon be over.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that could eventually eliminate the 30-year bond
altogether, the Treasury Department announced plans for a reduction
in new issuance of the bonds and the buying back of other long-term
Treasury debt.
</P>
<P>
   The department's under secretary for domestic finance, Gary
Gensler, said bond market investors were already starting to regard
the 10-year note as the benchmark. ``The focus,'' Gensler said,
``is more and more on the 10-year note than on the 30-year bond.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes the Treasury announced were forced by growing
federal budget surpluses, which have allowed the government to pay
off some of the publicly held government debt, which now stands at
about $3.3 trillion. In this quarter, the Treasury expects to
reduce the public debt by $17 billion followed by a record payoff
of $152 billion in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to the 10-year note as a benchmark had already begun
because of its wide use as a pricing point in the corporate and
mortgage markets. But the change has accelerated because of the
distortion in the performance of the 30-year bond since the
Treasury first announced last month that it was going to buy back
old Treasury securities. Since then the yield has fallen almost
half a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not surprise me if the Treasury phases out the
30-year bond over the next several years,'' said Ward McCarthy,
managing director at Stone &AMP; McCarthy in Princeton, N.J. ``It's
trading like it's a collectors' item.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson &AMP; Associates,
said the Treasury itself had hastened the shift from the 30-year
bond by announcing the buybacks. The Treasury, he said, ``triggered
the event that has called into question the reliability'' of the
30-year bond.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury said Wednesday that it would reduce the issuance of
its 2-year, 5-year and 10-year notes and its 30-year bond. It will
also reduce the issuance of its 30-year inflation-indexed bond.
Together, the issuance of regular and inflation-indexed 30-year
bonds will be less than half the $45 billion total in the fiscal
year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Crandall said that based on what has been issued so
far this fiscal year, the $10 billion in new 30-year bonds to be
issued next week will be followed by about $5 billion in May. The
May figure is significantly less than the $10 billion many analysts
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury also said it would reduce the issuance of one-year
bills by cutting the schedule from every four weeks to four times a
year. Officials are also considering the elimination of the
one-year bill. At the same time, the Treasury will increase the
supply of three-month and six-month bills.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction of longer-term debt issuance and the shift to more
three- and six-month bills will help lower the overall cost of
government borrowing, which is one of the Treasury's main goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury buybacks will start in the next two months. The
initial buybacks will be about $1 billion at a time. Gensler said
the buybacks would give the Treasury and investors the experience
they need before moving to larger buybacks. Investors are not
required to sell their Treasury securities back to the Treasury, so
a premium price will have to be offered. The Treasury said it hoped
to buy back up to $30 billion in longer-term securities by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the details of buying back long-term debt
and the reduction of issuance of new 30-year bonds had a marked
effect. The price of the 30-year bond jumped 1 27/32 to 97 29/32,
while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to
6.28 percent, from 6.42 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond is now not much higher than the
yield on the one-year Treasury bill, which was at 6.19 percent
Wednesday. And it is lower than the yield on the Treasury's
two-year note at 6.58 percent, the five-year note at 6.65 percent,
and the 10-year note at 6.57 percent, down from 6.62 percent on
Tuesday.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Independents had a major impact on both
parties' pivotal primary elections in New Hampshire on Tuesday, and
it was by no means the last that will be heard of them this year.
</P>
<P>
   That is very good news for Sen. John McCain of Arizona and
former Sen. Bill Bradley, the two insurgent presidential
candidates. Of the independents who chose to vote in the Republican
primary, 61 percent went for McCain, as compared with 19 percent
for his main rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Of those who took
Democratic ballots, 55 percent supported Bradley, as compared with
43 percent for his opponent, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Steve Forbes, Bush's main rival in Iowa, drew the
largest share of the independents' votes in last week's Iowa
caucuses as well, though Gore did better in Iowa than in New
Hampshire. Independents in Iowa accounted for a much smaller
proportion of the total vote, less than 20 percent; in New
Hampshire, they totaled 41 percent in each party primary. The rule
seems to be, the bigger the independent turnout, the better chance
the ``outsiders'' have to win.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of New Hampshire alone _ McCain skipped the Iowa
contest _ he is the independents' favorite. Pooling all
independents, the surveys taken by the Voter News Service, a
consortium of the television networks and The Associated Press,
indicated that 38 percent of their votes went to McCain and 21
percent to Bradley, with the rest distributed among five other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Many other states exclude independents from primaries, including
New York, where the balloting will take place on March 7, the
so-called Titanic Tuesday when primaries will be held in many
populous states.
</P>
<P>
   But the list of states that do not exclude them surprised many
of the politicians who scurried Wednesday morning to check the
complex voting regulations with secretaries of state across the
nation, now that drawn-out struggles for both parties' presidential
nominations seem probable.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the next big test for Republicans, with a
primary on Feb. 19, there is no party registration, so not only
independents but also Democrats are free to cast their votes in the
Republican primary. Voters in South Carolina have a well-developed
tradition of party-switching, and the Democrats do not start making
their choices there until March 9, which could give further
incentives to cross-over voters and independents to jump into the
Republican contest, with unpredictable results.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina voting could be crucial. In 1988, Lee
Atwater, an innovative Republican strategist who grew up there,
built what he called a ``firewall'' to ensure that an indifferent
performance in Iowa or New Hampshire by George W. Bush's father
would be offset in the South Carolina primary. It worked. The
younger Bush is even more in need of a firewall, but Atwater is not
around to help build it, having died at 40 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Republican primary, scheduled for Feb. 22, is wide
open, but Arizona's, on the same day, is limited to Republicans.
Bush has been plotting to embarrass McCain on his home turf in that
one.
</P>
<P>
   On March 7, when both parties will hold primaries in many
states, there are almost as many rules as states. But in several of
the most important, including Georgia, Missouri and Ohio, anyone
who is registered to vote can do so in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   California, the most-populous state, also votes that day, but,
as ever, it is more or less incomprehensible. Each voter there will
be handed an identical ballot, listing the candidates of seven
parties, including the Republicans and Democrats. The ballots,
officials explained, will be counted twice _ once for the top
vote-getters in a nonbinding ``beauty contest'' involving the
candidates of all parties, and a second time by the parties for the
purpose of selecting delegates to the Republican and Democratic
National Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, McCain's and Bradley's independent backers in a
number of important states will have the chance to support them,
providing, of course, that they keep their campaigns alive long
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The number of independents is growing rapidly across the
country, part of the gradual weakening of the parties and the
resultant breakdown in partisan affiliation. About 15 percent of
national registration is independent, up from less than 1 percent
40 years ago, and that does not take into account the large number
of states with no party registration.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, where those who declare allegiance to neither
party when they register are officially termed ``undeclared,'' is
experiencing a big increase in such voters.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures supplied by the office of William Gardner,
the secretary of state, they now constitute the largest bloc in the
electorate. As of last November, the latest date for which figures
are available, the state had 274,927 independents, 265,679
Republicans and 197,816 Democrats. About eight out of 10 new voters
register as independents. Many are young, well-educated
professionals, attracted by New Hampshire's low-tax environment or
its booming technology industry, centered on the city of Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Andrew Smith, the director of the University of New
Hampshire Survey Center, said that independents in the state tended
to be younger and better educated than the electorate as a whole.
But in Tuesday's balloting, the most noticeable trait was the
gender gap. In that regard, the independents behaved like
partisans. Independent women voted mainly in the Democratic
contest, while independent men voted mostly in the Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, perhaps, self-described liberal independents
tended to vote Democratic, and self-described conservative
independents to vote Republican. Moderate independents split evenly
between parties.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also said that many independents _ those who so term
themselves and those who declare no party affiliation when
registering _ are, in fact, closet Republicans and Democrats, who
tend to vote for one party or the other all of the time or most of
the time. Adopting the independent label, he said, ``conveys the
impression that you think for yourself, which confers a certain
prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the New Hampshire rules, registered voters cannot change
their partisan affiliation after October of the year preceding the
voting; Republicans are barred from the Democratic primary and vice
versa. But unregistered voters can simply show up at the polls,
register and ask for whichever ballot they choose. According to the
polls, about 5 percent of the voters did that on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the independents considered voting for either McCain or
Bradley, one a mostly conservative Republican, one a liberal
Democrat, but both sworn enemies of what they term the
establishment. A quarter of the McCain voters said they had thought
about backing Bradley, and 38 percent who eventually voted for
Bradley said they had considered McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Bill Bradley's ideas better than any of the others,''
said David Ropple, 33, a railroad surveyor, in a comment typical of
New Hampshire independents. ``I voted for him today. He seems more
personable. If I had to pick a Republican, though, it would be
McCain. He's a good candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   There were many last-minute decisions among independent voters,
with 29 percent of them making up their minds in the last three
days.

&HT;     WHY PRESIDENTIAL BOTTOM-FEEDERS STAY IN THE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To almost anyone else, finishing at the bottom in
the New Hampshire primary might suggest that now is good time to
break for the exit.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Republican also-rans Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes are staying in. Political analysts and campaign
operatives offer explanations ranging from a desire to make an
indelible imprint on the GOP nominating process to outright denial
that victory is out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at how to take advantage of the front-runner
collapsing,'' said Forbes' campaign manager Bill Dal Col, referring
to Texas Gov. George Bush's second-place finish in New Hampshire,
19 points behind the winner, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who
garnered 49 percent of the vote. ``We're going primary by primary.
It's far too early to look at the scenario'' of whether to stay in
the race even though victory is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing scion Forbes, champion of the flat tax and a
come-lately to the anti-abortion cause, finished third in New
Hampshire with 13 percent. With $28.7 million of his own money
committed to the 2000 race, Forbes is under no pressure to get out
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Radio commentator Keyes, who has made the moral and religious
revitalization of America his calling card, came in fourth with 6
percent. Keyes has always run a shoe-string operation, and he did
better than anyone expected in New Hampshire and in the Jan. 24
Iowa caucuses, where he came in third with 14 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a former Reagan administration official and former head
of the anti-abortion Family Research Council, came in last with 1
percent. He served up his campaign's own metaphor Monday when he
fell off a stage during a pancake-flipping contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer was the only one who hinted at quitting, telling reporters
after the New Hampshire returns came in that ``I'm a fighter, but
I'm not delusional.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Richard Lessner, Bauer's senior campaign adviser,
denied a suggestion that Bauer will remain in the race only to push
his favored issues: opposition to legal abortion and getting tough
with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Bauer never got in this race to send a message,'' Lessner
said. ``He's in this to win the nomination.'' Still, Lessner
acknowledged that ``you've got to win some primaries, and if you
don't, your candidacy won't last long.''
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts have dismissed the Forbes, Bauer and
Keyes candidacies as irrelevant and have framed the GOP nomination
battle as a race between Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fowler, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for
the Social Sciences at Dartmouth College, said that ``people who
are running to win don't stay in if their campaigns don't take
off.'' But she said that ``cause'' candidates who use campaigns to
get their views heard ``will stay in as long as they can last.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Bauer and Keyes and, to a lesser extent, Forbes thrived
in televised GOP debates that seemed to put them on equal footing
with Bush and McCain. ``That encourages them to stick around,''
Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about apparent losers who dig in, James W. Davis, a
political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, said,
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never completely discount ego. They may stay in
because they want to send a message or have an impact on the party
platform. It's entirely possible that some may find this fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Former presidential candidates also raise their public profiles
and command higher speaking fees. But candidates have to be careful
not to suffer from overexposure, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited one-time Minnesota Gov. Harold Stassen, who became
something of a laughing stock because he perennially ran for
president from 1948 through 1992. `You can't stay in the race too
long or people will question your judgment, and your speaking fees
will go down,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. John B. Anderson, R-Ill., launched an ill-fated
third party presidential bid in 1980 after Ronald Reagan trounced
him in Iowa and a number of primaries including New Hampshire's.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Anderson, now 77 and chairman of the Center for
Voting and Democracy, which advocates electoral reforms to increase
voter participation, said he stayed in because he felt an
obligation to supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when you've got to maintain the faith and
trust the people have placed in you as a candidate, carrying their
hopes, believes and aspirations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By sticking it out and winning 7 percent of the vote, Anderson
qualified for $4.2 million in federal campaign subsidies, which
helped his campaign pay off its $5 million debt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan fought then
Vice President George Bush almost all the way to the Republican
National Convention in Houston. For his troubles Buchanan won a
prime-time speaking role, which he used to talk about `a cultural
war'' between Democratic candidate Bill Clinton and conservative
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan ``wouldn't have gotten that if he hadn't toughed it
out,'' said George Edwards, a political scientist in charge of the
Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   The speech highlighted the combative, conservative tone of the
convention that Democrats and moderate Republicans later said
contributed to Clinton's victory over Bush.

WHODUNNIT HIS WAY? WALTER MOSLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of writers dream about it, and a decade ago, Walter
Mosley did it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Mosley's ``Devil in a Blue Dress,'' a mystery novel
featuring black handyman/detective Easy Rawlins, captured the
public fancy, sold lots of copies, was turned into a hit movie, and
paved the way for a series of Rawlins adventures, each with a
color-themed title. Four more followed, and then Mosley balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to get pushed into a niche so deeply I couldn't
get out,'' Mosley said during a recent stop to tout his latest
novel, ``Walkin' the Dog'' (Little, Brown, $24.95), a short-story
collection featuring Socrates Fortlow, another African-American who
solves mysteries. ``When I did books other than that (Easy Rawlins)
series, people told me I would severely hurt my career. Maybe I
did, but that was the career they were thinking of, not the one I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   His ideal career, the 47-year-old Mosley said, is ``writing
about things I am drawn to. Sometimes, like with `Blue Light' _ a
story involving extraterrestrials and a biracial protagonist _ half
the people who read it hate it. But I have the notion of writing
books that push a little, always with a black man at the center of
the story. So I write `Blue Light,' or about blues (''RL's
Dream,'') and that makes some people, especially publishers,
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains why Mosley does more than his share of bouncing
among publishers. Norton, with its reputation as a ``literary''
house, is glad to print Easy Rawlins mysteries and ``Always
Outnumbered, Always Outgunned,'' the first Socrates Fortlow
adventure. But Mosley has found a home for his more far-out
material with Little, Brown, and has even published ``Gone
Fishin','' the first chronological Easy Rawlins adventure (though
the fourth in the series) with Black Classic Press, a small company
that couldn't afford a massive publicity campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do the right thing,'' Mosley said. ``I support Black
Classic Press, all the small, minority-owned presses trying to make
it (by) publishing minority writers. I made 10 percent off the
cover price of the book, but that wasn't the issue. There are other
kinds of profit. There are 30 or 40 of us (African-American
writers) who could do this kind of thing once every four or five
years and help out publishers who need it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mosley also wants to reach a wide readership. He describes
himself as an aspiring ``pop'' writer _ in the sense that the best
authors write so well that all sorts of readers can learn from and
enjoy their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare is exactly like that,'' Mosley said. ``I want
everyone to understand what I'm writing about. That's the whole job
of a writer. I get mad when some writer says it's up to the reader
to get what he's trying to say. Well, man, if I'm a reader, I'm not
going to read something that makes me feel stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for the present, Socrates Fortlow, a 60-ish ex-con with a
mean and spiritual streak, carries Mosley's fictional water. He's
soon to be replaced with Paris Minton and Fearless Jones,
protagonists of ``Messenger of the Divine,'' a Mosley work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll laugh at them a little more,'' Mosley
predicted. ``One's got a smart brain, the other a smart heart. I'm
having a great deal of fun writing it, but if I only wrote books
like this, I'd go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown will probably be the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``My editor there thinks I might be an important writer,''
Mosley said. ``I call him up to ask how `Walkin' the Dog' is
selling, and he says it doesn't matter. He thinks of me as a writer
for the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   But whoever publishes ``Messenger of the Divine,'' Mosley said,
won't tell him what to write next, or how to write it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the whole issue,'' he said. ``I want to do what I think
is important in my life and work. So I have to put myself in the
position of not being told what to do.''

WOODS STALKS SIXTH STRAIGHT VICTORY ON PGA TOUR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ As he walked to meet Tiger Woods at the
driving range this morning, Butch Harmon was asked if Woods expects
to contend every week. Harmon laughed at the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger doesn't expect to contend every week,'' said Harmon,
Woods' only coach since turning professional. ``Contending isn't
good enough. We expect to win every time we tee it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you have to be realistic. Winning is not always going to
happen. But he's driven to be the best. With him, it's not about
money, it's not about fame. It's about being the best there ever
was. That's the challenge, and everything he does is directed
toward that goal. To do it, you need longevity, and only time will
tell. But winning is always the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus will remain on Woods beginning Thursday, when he
attempts to win his sixth consecutive start on the PGA Tour at the
AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Only two players in Tour history
have won more than five consecutive starts _ Byron Nelson, who won
an incredible 11 consecutive starts in 1945, and Ben Hogan, who won
six consecutive starts in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has played down his current streak, because it has
stretched over two calendar years, and because he did not win the
Johnnie Walker Classic last November in Taiwan, nor the Williams
World Challenge in January. Those were not official Tour events,
however, so until Woods loses on tour, he can expect scenes like
Wednesday, when more than 50 reporters surrounded him following his
practice round at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The streak may not motivate Woods. But winning does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what competitor likes finishing second,'' said
Woods, who will be playing for the first time in three weeks since
winning the Mercedes Championships last month in Hawaii. ``My
ultimate goal is to win, and anything short of that, I'm always
going to be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared in California, Woods would love to win at Pebble
Beach, one of the world's most picturesque courses. He came close
to winning the tournament in 1997, when he tied for second place
with David Duval, one stroke behind the winner, Mark O'Meara. Woods
made a dramatic weekend charge in '97, shooting a third-round 63,
and a final-round 64, which nearly erased a seven-stroke deficit on
Sunday. Needing an eagle on Pebble Beach's famous par-5 18th hole
to tie O'Meara, Woods reached the green with a 3-wood from 267
yards on his second shot, but he just missed a 35-foot putt that
would have tied him for first.
</P>
<P>
   That experience gives Woods even more confidence heading into
this weekend, as if he needs more confidence. His victory in Hawaii
was a classic. Ernie Els played superbly in Hawaii, and against
anyone else, it probably would have been enough to win. But it
wasn't enough to beat Woods. Both Els and Woods made eagle at No.
18 to force a playoff, but Woods ended the duel two holes later,
making a phenomenal 40-foot putt for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Els left wondering what else he could have done. Woods left with
another dramatic victory.
</P>
<P>
   Can Woods top last year, when he won nine times worldwide and
eight times on the Tour? Harmon would not rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   `` I think you're going to see him get a lot better this year,''
Harmon said. ``He hit 71 percent of his fairways last year, and
we'd like to get that up to 75. His bad shots are going to get less
erratic. His swing is continuing to improve. He may not win 10
times, but he's going to play better golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather is usually a factor at Pebble Beach, where strong
winds and rain are commonplace. But Woods dealt with strong winds
effectively in Hawaii, using a low-trajectory 3-wood shot off the
tee that he has worked on during the past year. If the wind blows
this week, Woods will actually welcome it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It separates a lot of players,'' said Woods, referring to the
wind. ``You have to focus a little bit harder, grind it out. Some
of the guys don't want to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods will play Thursday at Poppy Hills, one of three courses on
which the tournament is held. On Friday, Woods moves to Spyglass
Hill, before playing both Saturday and Sunday at Pebble Beach.

(DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving in ``k'' commentary
category) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It snowed today. In the middle of the week, in the middle of the
day, in the middle of Texas _ it snowed.
</P>
<P>
   When flakes of frozen water fall from the sky in this part of
the world, the clocks stop. The streets are as empty of cars as the
sky is empty of sunshine. I am at my office biding time as dust
falls on my bills.
</P>
<P>
   Gray skies and still hands give me the blues.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the sky and inactivity that's got me down, to
be honest. I suppose I've been affected by the story that I just
read in ``Newsweek'' about Alzheimer's disease. The article said
that one in five Americans in the age group 75-84 are afflicted
with this disease. It goes on to explain in great detail what
scientists now know about this problem, which affects more than 4
million people in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Greatly simplified, it appears that certain proteins in the
brains of Alzheimer's patients form clusters that expand into
plaque that displaces and damages brain cells. Other proteins,
which normally help support neurons, break loose to form tangles
and, subsequently, the neurons start to die.
</P>
<P>
   The result is loss of memory, dementia, and a slow slide into
total dependence.
</P>
<P>
   Watching an adult whom you love become like a child whom you
love is a painful experience.
</P>
<P>
   I know because I've done it.
</P>
<P>
   My paternal grandmother was found to have Alzheimer's in 1980.
She kept it from us for a while. Then, one day, she almost burned
her house down because she forgot that she was cooking. Her doctor
insisted that the family be informed.
</P>
<P>
   The closest living relative was me. I am the only child of an
only child. My father and grandfather died while I was still in
elementary school. At the time of the diagnosis, I was a teen-ager
living with the parents whom I still call Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   I remember going to my grandmother's house where we convened in
the kitchen around the square table with the yellow Formica top and
ribbed aluminum trim. The room smelled faintly of Pine-Sol.
</P>
<P>
   There weren't many options. Of those presented, my grandmother
chose the nursing home. And we could not change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as I watched her clean the same spot on her spotless white,
gas stove, her floral dishtowel winding around, over and over, I
knew that she would have preferred to remain in her home.
Inimitable and independent, as always. It was a sad day.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, she still had mostly good moments filling mostly
good days. So she packed her things and stored them away.
</P>
<P>
   The first few months in the nursing home, she seemed depressed,
but she was lucid. Then our visits became more and more difficult
as she struggled to recognize me. Sometimes she seemed perfectly
fine except that her conversation was from a period 15 years in the
past. As the months went by, she seemed to spend more and more time
in that place.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think that she did that because that was a happier
time, when her husband and son were alive. Then it occurred to me
that she was simply packing up her memories, starting with the most
recent. When she was done, she stored them and locked them behind
eyes that didn't focus and a mouth that didn't speak.
</P>
<P>
   Years went by. I would visit her warm body as often as I could.
It was clear to me that her mind had already left.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she stopped swallowing. That was all.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you wonder why I share these things, so personal and
sometimes painful.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I'm simply storing my memories, too, and I don't want
them locked away where no one, including me, can retrieve them.

AGASSI IS ALREADY A FORCE IN ZIMBABWE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Sure, he admitted that he could have used the
time off between winning the Australian Open and playing in San
Jose, Calif., by the middle of next week. But Andre Agassi had
committed himself to the flag and John McEnroe, though not
necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a responsibility,'' said the man who has also succeeded
so wonderfully over the past 12 months in being accountable, first
and foremost, to himself. ``Davis Cup is rarely ever convenient. It
requires some sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi held a news conference Wednesday afternoon in a cramped,
steamy room at the Harare Sports Center, where deep breaths were
hard to come by, and not just because Agassi was coughing up a
handful of words on behalf of the Davis Cup competition between the
United States and Zimbabwe, which begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time an American Davis Cup team has come to
Zimbabwe _ or Africa, for that matter _ and that has created a
significant buzz. But even with Pete Sampras injured, with McEnroe
only available to lose his temper by the U.S. bench, with the rest
of the team made up of names that weren't on the front page of the
local newspaper, there is the feel of a happening here. Agassi is
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Gilbert, not Steffi Graf, accompanied him to town. Not to
worry, though. One tennis legend (McEnroe) working the town and
another just making the scene have been more than enough to turn
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi-McEnroe may not be as appealing a twosome as Agassi and
Graf, but the two do go back. They first played each other at
Stratton Mountain, Vt., in 1986, and this is what Agassi remembered
about the day: He lost, 6-3, 6-3. In the first game of the match,
he was looking out for McEnroe's vaunted service out wide and was
aced down the middle. And then McEnroe served up some colorful
commentary about the teen-ager's ``rat nest haircut.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't exactly develop a relationship until 1989, when
Agassi was the young pup on the Davis Cup team and the Americans
played France in San Diego. McEnroe took note of the fact that
Agassi seemed to enjoy Davis Cup, as did he.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't until 1993 that the communication really opened
up,'' Agassi said. ``He was going through some tough times
personally. He was a solid factor in helping me win Wimbledon after
I beat him in the semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, McEnroe understands that Agassi, like him, is an unusual
and somewhat eccentric talent. McEnroe never had much of an
appreciation for mediocrity, or cookie-cutter tennis. Wednesday, he
shook his head in admiration as Agassi, sweating off jet lag in a
sleeveless shirt, punished his practice partner, Paul Goldstein,
with cannon shots off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I feel at every stage of the match that I know
what I have to do to make it more difficult for my opponent,''
Agassi said. ``But I do enjoy a captain who knows what it's like to
be out there, a captain who will fight for you on the line calls.''

 &HT;    Time Warner to open cable network to competitors
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a dramatic reversal of a long-standing policy,
Time Warner said Wednesday it plans to open its high speed cable
network to competitors _ allowing customers to decide which
Internet provider to use.
</P>
<P>
   Based on competitive pressure caused by that move, other cable
television systems are almost sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be multiple brands on all cable systems,'' says
Gerald Levin, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, owner of
the second largest cable TV operator.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's comments, made at a quarterly financial briefing with
reporters here on Wednesday, marks a big shift in his position and
the conventional wisdom of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cable operators have long considered their networks exclusive
and proprietary. They've resisted pressure that America Online,
MindSpring and other Internet providers get access to the new
digital networks, which provide high-speed access to the Internet
for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several months, that stand has begun to weaken as
new players enter the industry. First, AT&AMP;T, which will soon become
the largest cable operator, said it would negotiate to let AOL use
its digital systems. Early in December, AT&AMP;T and Atlanta-based
Internet service provider MindSpring delivered a letter to FCC
Chairman William Kennard saying AT&AMP;T planned to let its broadband
customers choose providers beginning in mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   No timetable has been set for Time Warner's new open access
policy, which probably will come after the merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's change in stance comes in the wake of selling his
company to AOL, the online service that led the fight to open
digital cable systems to other Internet access providers. The
companies will create a new entity called AOLTime Warner in a deal
valued at between $140 billion and $165 billion, depending on the
price of their stock on any given day.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has been offering high-speed Internet access to its
12 million cable TV customers exclusively through its Road Runner
brand. So far, 500,000 subscribers have signed up for the service.
</P>
<P>
   Now that strategy of exclusivity will change. ``The current
structures governing our Internet service won't survive the
merger,'' said Levin.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in Levin's position comes as the popularity of the
company's digital services, including digital television, are
growing. Time Warner expects to complete the conversion of all its
cable to digital technology by the end of this year, company
officials said. Digital technology allows more advanced features
including high speed access and interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to quadruple the number of subscribers taking our
digital services this year,'' said Levin. ``We install every
set-top box we can get and we can't get enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are adding 13,000 to 14,000 customers a month,'' added
Richard Bressler, head of the company's Digital Media Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The strong demand has prompted Time Warner executives to
reassess predictions on market penetration. In the past, they
thought the upper range would be 30 percent. Now executives say
that 50 percent is possible.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL merger is driving the higher penetration. Although it
won't close for about a year, the two companies already are
beginning to embark on new partnerships. For example, Time Warner
has begun offering AOL's free installation software in its flagship
merchandise store in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Time Warner's CNN cable news channel, based in Atlanta,
offered some live Web casts of the World Economic Conference in
Davos, Switzerland, last week using AOL's Netscape technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many meetings going on between Time Warner and
AOL about synergy between the two companies,'' said Bressler.
``We're trying to see how we can make 2 plus 2 equal 5.''

LEBANESE VILLAGES BRACE FOR HEIGHTENED ISRAELI ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAKURA, Lebanon _ A construction crew hoisted more cinder blocks
to strengthen the outer wall of Samir Farhat's already
fortress-like home as he eyed Israeli war planes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, Israel was carrying out restrained
retaliatory strikes against Hezbollah after the Islamic group
killed three Israeli soldiers in an ambush and assasinated a senior
leader of the pro-Israeli militia in south Lebanon's so-called
``security zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the Lebanese who live in villages inside the zone,
Farhat fears the conflict is about to reach a critical stage. At
his fortified three-story home, with the reinforced bricks and
mortar, he is bracing for what he calls the ``beginning of the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are we supposed to go? We turn back to Lebanon and we
are killed by Hezbollah. We turn toward Israel and we are
collaborators,'' said Farhat, 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is I don't think we can live much longer stuck in
the middle,'' he added Tuesday, as he stood Tuesday outside the
building with a castle-like turret and a protective wall where he
lives with his wife and children in this border village. ``I will
stay and fight for my home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday killing of the South Lebanon Army field commander Akl
Hashem has deeply shaken the communities here that have resorted to
alligning themselves with the SLA, a militia of some 2,500 soldiers
on the payroll of the Israeli Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
   To Hezbollah, the well-trained and increasingly effective
Islamic militant guerrillas fighting against Israel's 22-year
presence in Lebanon, Hashem and SLA supporters are collaborators
with a sworn enemy and therefore a legtimate military target.
</P>
<P>
   To SLA supporters and even to many people simply caught in the
middle, Hashem was a popular leader. The daring Sunday morning
bombing attack on his home has hurt SLA soldiers' morale, and left
their families feeling vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Farhat, who owns a popular store that sells duty free stereo
equipment and appliances imported from Israel's port in nearby
Haifa, was a close friend of Hashem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, he (Hashem) was our leader, the man
who kept order. He was like a judge, a priest and a commander all
in one,'' said Farhat. ``With him gone, I worry about the collapse
of order. I worry everything can fall apart now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is largely economics that drives the men of these villages to
join the SLA. A soldier is paid by the Israelis roughly $500 a
month to fight, and more importantly family members of SLA soldiers
are permitted to work in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the residents, Farhat fears not only the immediate
escalation of fighting, but the growing sense that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak will live up to his promise to have Israeli
troops out of Lebanon by end of July. Without an Israeli presence,
he fears that Hezbollah forces will exact revenge on those who cast
their lot with the SLA and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the SLA villages hear the Hezbollah backers in
neighboring villages firing guns to celebrate the assassination of
Hashem and the killing of the three Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah seems to have a reinvigorated sense that their victory
is at hand, that Israel has tired of burying its young soldiers and
that Barak will pull out the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   As Timur Goksel, senior adviser to the UN peacekeeping forces in
Lebanon, said that Hezbollah's strikes were not a violation of the
agreement by both sides not to target civilians. That, he says,
makes the Israeli response difficult. When Israel civilians have
been targeted, Israel has responded with punishing strikes, such as
attacks in Beirut last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will see Israel searching for precise military
targets and that will take time,'' said Goksel. ``The problem is
reaction begets reaction, and the conflict could now escalate
quickly and dangerously.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak seems keenly aware that he must balance his desire to
strike back with renewed peace talks with neighboring Syria, which
has some 35,000 troops in Lebanon. Monday night Barak lashed out at
Syria, announcing he would not resume peace talks until Syria
reined in Hezbollah. But after attending funerals for the soldiers
Tuesday, Barak was backing off that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves analysts wondering how Israel will react to
Hezbollah's attack on the peace process, on the troops, and on
their confidence. If Barak carries out an Israeli troop withdrawal,
even villagers who say they are neither pro-SLA nor pro-Hezbollah
are worried about the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant owner Ali, 48, who spoke on condition his last name
not be used, said: ``When Israel pulls out of Lebanon that will be
very good. We all want that to happen. This is our land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not Hezbollah, and I am not SLA. But I am worried about
what will happen,'' said Ali, sipping coffee and peering at UN
troops who rolled by in white armored personnel carriers. ``Whether
you supported the SLA or not, Hashem was someone who upheld law and
order here. His death is a sign of the chaos that's coming.''

ROCKER SUSPENSION DAMAGES SELIG'S CREDIBILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Until this week, the longest limb in sports commentary appeared to
involve the case of that dim bulb known as Big Johnny Rocker.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Climb on out there. Way out there. Demand that Bud back off a
bit, ``Bud'' being baseball commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   An overreaction from high sheriff Selig was not necessary.
Neither was caving in to the loud wails of this or that group, or
to the financial muscle of baseball advertisers who run scared of
any racial issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker opened his mouth, and insulted basically all persons. So
now force him to walk many a long mile in the racial diversity that
is Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, pitchers do bat in the National League. And flame-throwers
from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela do pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The best punishment of all, however, would have been on opening
day of spring training for the Braves. Mr. Rocker walking into the
clubhouse and going eye-to-eye with Atlanta's two Hispanic catchers
_ I'd pay luxury suite prices just to watch that. And watch how
other teammates dealt with Rocker, particularly the white players,
who have been more openly critical than even the minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's comments were a disgrace to a game that is approaching
50 percent minority, most of that being Hispanic. But Rocker would
get his. Would he ever.
</P>
<P>
   Long story made short, however. Selig totally overreacted, and
Rocker is suspended until May 1, meaning a month into the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   But what came next was a total surprise, at least to those of us
who as late as last week thought we were climbing out on the Rocker
limb with an unpopular don't-overreact-Bud opinion.
</P>
<P>
   What seemingly had been a national uproar against Rocker has
flipped to massive criticism of Selig and his decision. This is
amazing. Selig is being blistered in the national media, and public
reaction also doesn't appear to be in support of the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone calls we've received here, and it's been a very
substantial number, are running about 50-50,'' said Rich Levin
yesterday from New York. Levin is Selig's top public-relations
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as media reaction,'' added Levin, ``it has certainly
been going against Bud, although much more the first day than the
second day.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, with his Rocker decision, Selig did disappoint me _ for
whatever that's worth _ one reason being I've known him many years,
respect him, and have high expectations that this is the guy to
finally restore leadership to a sport totally void of same.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from that long limb, but now I almost find
myself wanting to defend Selig. ``Almost.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there's the misguided advocates of the First
Amendment. Selig is hearing plenty from them. No one enjoys freedom
of speech more than those of us who earn a living at it. But at
some point, freedom of speech no longer applies, unless you are
independently wealthy or Howard Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, say anything you want to say. But if those words cross
a certain line, then your boss will have the final say. Rocker
works for the Atlanta Braves, and the Braves answer to Selig. So
Rocker had to answer to Selig, which is the way it is with freedom
of speech.
</P>
<P>
   What Selig has created here, however, is a major credibility
issue. He has opened a sack of snakes, not so much by being a
policeman over ``words,'' but by dealing out severe punishment for
something spoken.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse for baseball _ Rocker's dumb opinions or a star
player spitting in the face of an umpire? There is simply no
comparison in damage done to the game, yet the spitter, Roberto
Alomar, was suspended five games. And remember, those five games
were applied to the beginning of the next season, allowing Alomar
to play in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   An argument can be made that Selig was not involved in the
horrendous decision. The wimpy Gene Budig, then the American League
president, made that Alomar call. But Selig was the acting
commissioner. He could have privately ordered Budig to be tough,
just as he could have stepped aside and allowed the Atlanta Braves
to discipline Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Selig became a hanging judge in the Rocker case. But what about
next time? Every disciplinary decision he makes will be compared
with this one, and Selig's credibility will always come under
question.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner has crawled out there on a long limb of his
own. \Ntagtop:Randy Galloway's ``Sports at Six'' can be heard
weeknights, 6-8 p.m., on WBAP NewsTalk 820.

MCCAIN WIN PUTS PRESSURE ON BUSH IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. -- In the past, this state's Republican primary
has been as much a graveyard for political insurgents like Sen.
John McCain as New Hampshire has been a launching pad. But
Wednesday, the uncommonly crisp winter air echoed with suspicions
that the past may not be prologue.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the GOP primary here on February 19 _ open to
Independents and Democrats with no competing Democratic contest _
has a new label on it. Two days ago, it was the primary McCain had
to win to stay alive. Though it may still be that, McCain's
decisive victory in New Hampshire has now made South Carolina the
primary Texan George W. Bush cannot afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush knows he must beat John McCain here. If McCain
wins South Carolina after what he did in New Hampshire, he'll be
hard to stop. His momentum would be huge,'' Henry McMaster, the
South Carolina Republican chairman, who is neutral in the race,
said in an interview. Even Richard N. Bond, who was GOP national
chairman under President Bush, said a McCain victory here would
make the Arizona senator's nomination a real possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush retains a strong advantage here. He has a sizable lead
in recent polls. Voters, among them large contingent of religious
conservatives, have political sentiments more to his liking. And
Bush appears to have a strong organization and unlimited money to
spend.
</P>
<P>
   But after Tuesday, there's queasiness aplenty among Bush
loyalists. His lead in the polls here seems certain to shrink -- it
was 20 points in a poll a week ago. The organization behind him has
its own fissures. And McMaster, among others, said he expects a
huge turnout among Independents and Democrats who have shunned the
low-turnout Republican primary in past years.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing against Bush's many advantages here is one looming
disadvantage: Much of his support in polls, here and nationally, is
based on the premise that he was invincible in the nominating
process, and would be the GOP's strongest candidate in November.
And while Republican voters here have been more comfortable with
establishment candidates in the past, GOP National Committeeman
Buddy Witherspoon, a Columbia orthodontist, said they also want to
nominate a candidate who can reclaim the White House from the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with New Hampshire's results, McCain is now certain to
raise that issue constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have pierced the perception that George Bush is the
inevitable nominee and the strongest general election candidate. At
no time in modern political history has a frontrunner taken such a
drubbing right off the bat,'' said Trey Walker, McCain's national
field director and a former director of the state GOP here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Democrats await their next electoral matchup, the
multi-state primaries on March 7 that include a caucus here, South
Carolina's GOP primary has taken on outsized proportions. And while
Bush and McCain will not be alone on the ballot, they alone have
invested heavily here.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina is now like New Hampshire. Our importance will
also be greatly magnified,'' said William V. Moore, a political
scientist at the College of Charleston. If New Hampshire
transformed what appeared to be a lopsided contest in Bush's favor
into a two-man battle, Moore said, then South Carolina may well go
a long way toward determining the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   McCainsupporters, elated over the breadth of their candidate's
victory on Tuesday -- he even beat Bush handily among registered
Republicans -- say the landscape here has changed dramatically in
their candidate's favor. Still, many of them concede that Bush
remains the favorite and say McCain cannot afford a misstep here in
the next 16 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved from what was always our best state, New
Hampshire, to a very difficult state for us, given George Bush's
advantages in South Carolina,'' noted William D. McInturff,
McCain's polltaker and long-time adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, McInturff said, Bush has an advantage among
self-described Christian conservatives that McCain must work to
overcome. In New Hampshire, Christian conservatives constituted
just 16 percent of GOP primary voters and favored Bush over McCain,
according to exit polling data. In South Carolina, an estimated 35
percent of GOP primary voters, and maybe more, consider themselves
part of the so-called religious right.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain is vulnerable with conservative Christian voters,
abortion is clearly the reason. Some of his statements on the issue
have been ambiguous, despite his strong antiabortion voting record.
The National Right to Life Committee is already running radio ads
attacking McCain here.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain has three different positions on abortion, and
we're not going to let him get away with that here,'' former
Republican Gov. David Beasley said in an interview Wednesday.
``John McCain will not win conservative votes here. He will not win
any Christian conservative votes.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset here, McCain has claimed his own advantage, and
Walker reemphasized the point in an interview: No state, he said,
has a higher proportion of military veterans than South Carolina --
and they are natural McCain supporters. But McCain's campaign may
have overstated the numbers, according to a Globe examination of
government data on veterans. Twenty-five states, New Hampshire
among them, have higher percentages of veterans than South
Carolina. And here, more than a quarter of veterans are blacks --
unlikely GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even though veterans make up less than 10 percent of South
Carolina's population, McCain is making a major effort to organize
them. And with good reason: Few Republicans here, McCain's
supporters included, think he can win unless his reformist message
pulls a significant number of new voters to the polls two weeks
from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While the state has no voter registration by party, its GOP
presidential primary has typically been a low-turnout affair
dominated by Republican activists. In 1996, for example, just
276,000 voters, out of 2 million registered voters, participated in
the primary, according to McMaster.
</P>
<P>
   This time, McMaster said, he expects well over 300,000 voters.
Just to be safe, he added, the party has printed one million
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, the former national party chairman, said McCain's messsage
might resonate with some potential new voters. The Arizona senator,
Bond said, ``has that outsider Ross Perot message without having
Perot's extra chromosomes.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure: Gov. Bush will have no excuse if he loses
here. The state seems tailor-made for him: He's the brand-name
Republican candidate. He's a fellow Southerner -- and unlike his
father, he even sounds like one. The state party establishment is
behind him. And South Carolina Republicans are noticeably more
conservative than their New Hampshire counterparts. They are also
much less likely to repudiate the establishment candidate. Indeed,
for evidence of South Carolina's comfort with the status quo, some
here point to the ages of the state's two US senators, Strom
Thurmond and Ernest Hollings -- 97 and 78, respectively, with a
combined 78 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But by most accounts Wednesday, Bush would be foolish to believe
that GOP voters here will reflexively reject McCain much as they
did upstart challengers to Ronald Reagan in 1980, Bush's father in
1988 and 1992 and Sen. Bob Dole in 1996. Reagan was enormously
popular in the South in 1980. The elder Bush arrived here in 1988
after a win, not the breathtaking loss his son has just sustained.
And the insurgent whose hopes were dashed on the political shoals
here in 1992 and 1996 was the idiosyncratic Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The axiom that South Carolina Republicans automatically sweep
aside insurgents ``has never truly been tested,'' said Donald J.
Devine, a long-time Republican activist who worked for Reagan in
1980 and Dole in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said McCain pollster McInturff, ``George W. Bush is
not Ronald Reagan, not his father and not even Bob Dole. No one in
America knows this guy, and voters who do are starting to conclude
that there's no there there.'' Republicans, McInturff said, are
most intent on picking a nominee who can win in November. In the
next two weeks, he added, McCain has a chance to convince them that
he is the party's best hope in November.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the state party apparatus that served Bush's father
so well in two primaries has lost some of its muscle. National
Committeeman Witherspoon, for one, says the organization ``is not
as effective as it once was.'' That's partly because the GOP lost
the governor's office in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supposed Republican machine has aged and atrophied.
Institutional support just doesn't matter the way it used to,''
asserted US Rep. Mark Sanford. Sanford, US Rep. Lindsay Graham and
a third of the party's state legislators have bucked the party
establishment to support McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Like other states, including New Hampshire until last week, few
voters here have paid close attention to the primary. Analysts like
political scientist Moore believe that what the candidates say in
the days ahead, including a televised debate on February 15, will
be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, like others, believes Bush remains the favorite. But
whether that continues may depend on what he does in the days
ahead. ``Right now, he seems like Humpty Dumpty. He's taken a great
fall. His campaign is going to try to put him together again, and
everyone here is going to be watching to see how they do that,''
Moore said.

 &HT;    Severance packages yet to be determined for Charter workers
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With 33 of its psychiatric hospitals closing this
week, Charter Behavioral Health Systems still is determining the
extent of separation packages for the more than 4,000 employees
affected by the closures.
</P>
<P>
   The financial uncertainty, though, has rattled some workers.
This week, 38 workers at Charter's Greensboro, N.C., hospital filed
a lawsuit demanding severance pay and accumulated vacation pay when
that facility closes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A Charter spokeswoman said the Alpharetta, Ga.-based company is
trying to decide what will be done for laid-off employees
nationwide. ``Employees are uneasy because they don't have anything
definitive,'' said Karen Jenkins. ``We want this resolved as soon
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins declined to comment on the lawsuit. She added that each
facility will close as soon as the last patient is discharged or
transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Charter announced it will close 33 hospitals,
including the Greensboro hospital, as part of its continuing
restructuring. Three Georgia facilities, in Athens, Macon and
Augusta, will be closed. Charter has said it is trying to place the
affected employees company facilities or help them find work.
</P>
<P>
   The company sent a notice, dated Jan. 28, to employees at the
Athens hospital about the closing, saying they could contact
Charter's human resources department for more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling back each employee, and we are telling them we
are working through these issues,'' Jenkins said. ``The employees
have been told the company will comply with the WARN Act.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act generally requires businesses with more than 100 full-time
employees to give them 60 days' notice before closing their
workplace. If that doesn't occur, employees can seek up to 60 days'
pay and benefits, said Norman Smith, a Greensboro attorney
representing the Charter employees in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions to those WARN provisions, including one for
companies seeking new capital or business in order to stay open,
and one for ''unforeseeable business circumstances,'' according to
the U.S. Department of Labor.

N.H. CAMPAIGN REFASHIONED GORE, MCCAIN MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ When Senator John McCain first came to New
Hampshire to campaign for the Republican nomination, he liked
nothing more than to talk about foreign policy and campaign
finance. But when he left here he was the self-declared candidate
of fiscal responsibility, focusing on the need to spend trillions
of dollars on Social Security and paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when Vice President Al Gore first started taking
about his health-care plan last summer, it almost seemed as if he
wanted to the proposal to be little-noticed, given the 1993
Clinton-Gore health care fiasco. But after Bill Bradley unveiled
his health-care plan, Gore suddenly rediscovered his own proposal
and made it a centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In striking ways, the winners of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary
remade themselves in crucible of the campaign. If McCain and Gore
become the nominees of their respective parties, they owe the
shaping of their message partly to their challengers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for example, ``became a much stronger candidate'' after
he responded last month to George W. Bush's tax plan by focusing on
Social Security and the national debt, according to McCain's
national co-chairman, former New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman.
``George Bush lost that tax debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the main question facing the Bush campaign is whether it
was wise for the Texas governor to be so rigid in his campaign
style. Instead of reacting to the changing shape of the campaign,
Bush for months has said he would repeat the same message until
Election Day this November in order to give himself a mandate.
</P>
<P>
   But the New Hampshire primary brought to light the hole in
Bush's campaign strategy. Bush's game plan was based on his concern
about the self-financed candidacy of Steve Forbes. The Bush brain
trust, seeking to counter Forbes's proposal for a 17-percent flat
tax, came up with an idea for a $483 billion tax cut. When Bush
announced the proposal, he focused almost entirely on giving money
back to taxpayers and put little emphasis on how he would shore up
Social Security. He included only one vague reference to reducing
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   That provided an enormous opening for McCain, who paid little
attention to tax cuts during the first months of his campaign.
McCain's tax-cut plan is more modest than Bush's proposal. But
McCain, prodded by Rudman, began to focus on the seemingly dry
topic of reducing the national debt. In addition, McCain talked
about the need to use some of the budget surplus to shore up Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   This, McCain often said, was the true ``conservative'' position.
As it turned out, he was right.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's focus on Social Security and the debt was more in tune
with the views of Republicans than the Bush tax-cut plan, according
to the polls. Over the course of the last several weeks, McCain
often sounded like another New Hampshire primary winner _ the late
Democratic Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, who co-founded
the Concord Coalition with Rudman to focus attention on the
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in the last days of the campaign that Bush
grudgingly reacted to McCain's focus on Social Security and the
national debt by including a graphic in his television
advertisements about the issues. But that may have served to remind
viewers that McCain had a much bigger plan to deal with those
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, hardly sounded like a candidate who would make
health care a top priority when he formally announced his campaign
last June. In a speech in his hometown of Carthage, Tenn., Gore
merely said that ``families deserve decent, affordable health
care,'' a vague goal that few could oppose. Gore was reluctant to
propose a major government-financed health care plan because of the
still-bitter memories of the way the Clinton health plan was killed
in 1993. When Gore did announce a health policy in September, it
focused mostly on providing children with health insurance and
provided no roadmap for universal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the experience of '93 really kind of led him to
downplay the notion of universal coverage more than he needed to,''
said Dean Spiliotes, a professor of government at Dartmouth
College. ``He was talking more about policy increments than
sweeping programs.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Bradley unveiled his plan for universal health care
coverage and began pulling even with Gore in the polls, the vice
president's campaign staff was forced to rethink their strategy.
After weeks of indecision, Gore began criticizing Bradley's plan as
an overreach and talked more about his own proposal for children's
health insurance. Throughout January, Gore sounded more like
Bradley, saying that he intended to eventually ensure health
insurance for all Americans _ a far cry from his original position.
</P>
<P>
   Gore now says the Bradley challenge has made him a better
candidate. It helped ``put wind in my sails, and put my keel deeper
in the water,'' Gore said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, by contrast, seemed determined for months not to change
his campaign strategy in response to the heightened Gore attacks.
It was only in the last week of the campaign that Bradley said
``I've had it'' and began attacking Gore more directly.

THOUSANDS PROTEST IN VIENNA AS OFFICIALS NEGOTIATE ON COALITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ As thousands marched here in protest against
the prospect of including a rightist party led by Joerg Haider in
the government, President Thomas Klestil met Wednesday with party
leaders but failed to announce whether he would accept such a
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The 20,000 or so marchers indicated that they were delighted
that the European Union had precipitated a diplomatic crisis this
week by threatening to isolate Austria diplomatically if the
president allowed Haider into government.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Brussels to Vienna: No Government with Racists,'' one
banner read. Another called Haider a ``pop fascist'' and
``pseudo-Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   The march, substantial for a country of only 8 million people,
was peaceful and even almost litter-free. A pot of blue paint _ the
color of Haider's Freedom Party _ was flung on the doorstep of the
People's Party, the prospective coalition partner. Some protesters
carried babies or marched under pictures of Che Guevara. Many more
carried the circle of yellow stars that is the symbol of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters who had kept an all-night vigil in scraggly sleeping
bags on the sidewalk in front of the People's Party headquarters
said the rally began there, not in Haider territory, because they
blamed the whole crisis on the lust for the chancellorship of
Wolfgang Schuessel, leader of the People's Party. He let talks with
the winning Social Democrats collapse and invited Haider to start
haggling, they said. ``We want him to pull back the deal or
resign,'' said Klaus Kastenhofer, 27, a medical student.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Hofburg Palace, the seat of government in Vienna for
centuries, Haider and Schuessel came and went after meeting with
Klestil for an hour each.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported here that the president asked Haider to drop two
people he proposed for the joint cabinet. The president was unable
to make a decision Wednesday in part because Schuessel needed to
meet with his own party to discuss some changes.
</P>
<P>
   Haider also said that Schuessel would be chancellor if the
coalition was approved, and that he himself would not be in the
cabinet. ``I will go back to Carinthia because my work here is
done,'' Haider said of the province where he currently serves as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian news service reported that it had learned that the
Freedom Party would appoint the vice chancellor and the ministers
of finance, justice, defense, infrastructure and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the People's Party would retain the Foreign
Ministry. But it would also get the Interior Ministry, which
controls immigration; Haider is accused of being a xenophobe and
favors a complete cut-off of immigration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The negotiations were complicated by news reports suggesting
that Klestil had long ago developed a prejudice against Haider and
the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to approve this government,'' the weekly magazine
News quoted him as saying in an interview published Wednesday, ``I
won't do so out of personal conviction, because I fear that Austria
will suffer internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also suggested the party go through some sort of
probation period. ``It would be better if the Freedom Party proved
for a while that they're a normal democratic party,'' he said. ``By
doing so, they will gain international acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   A Freedom Party leader pointed out Wednesday, with some
irritation, that the party already holds the governorship of
Carinthia and the mayoralty of many towns. ``We're not coming out
of the blue here,'' said Peter Schirovsky, a party member in the
European Parliament. ``We've been part of the political machinery
for 10 years. Why this big double standard?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, two Danish newspapers reported that Klestil
had gotten a message to Denmark's Social Democratic prime minister,
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, asking him to help whip up support in Europe
for diplomatically isolating Austria if Haider came into
government.
</P>
<P>
   Klestil denied that Wednesday. So did Rasmussen, but he used
careful language that indicated that he had not talked to Klestil
directly, not that he hadn't received a message.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Party has charged for days that the threat to
isolate Austria was not a spontaneous surge of European morality,
but was carefully orchestrated by left-leaning Social Democratic
parties across Europe who had seen one of their own forced out of
power.
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat of international condemnation continued, meanwhile.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Croatia to praise
its democracy, criticized the possibility of Haider's party
entering the government. While ``obviously the Austrian people have
the right to elect whom they want,'' she said, Washington has
expressed its concern that Austria ``maintain its good
international reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union ``has acted on this and we share their
concerns,'' she said. ``We are going to be watching everything very
closely and we will take the appropriate steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, concluded a
blistering condemnation of the Freedom Party by saying it would be
``immoral'' for Belgians to go skiing in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Van der Bellen, the leader of the Green Party, said
tonight that the Belgian's remark was unfair and greatly annoyed
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What on earth can Austrian hotel and restaurant owners do
about a Freedom Party boss gone mad?'' he asked.

 &HT;    Indiana candy maker forming a sweet reputation for his luxurious
work
 &HT;    By Ann Heller

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, Ind. _ Ghyslain Maurais was a young Canadian chef
working in embassies in New York and London when he developed a
love of working with chocolate. In his spare time he took classes
about chocolate in Paris and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   But chocolate-making remained an avocation until last fall, when
he decided to leave his job as chef at The Inn at Versailles and
start producing fine French chocolates in a rented house at the
edge of this Indiana town.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Valentine's Day approaching, he is creating such
specialties as an edible red chocolate box filled with hand-painted
chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   The small shop selling Ghyslain chocolates has been open just
four months, but already customers make the hour drive from Dayton
to buy his fanciful hand-colored creations that include not only
valentine boxes but an edible chocolate wine bottle _ or smaller
champagne bottle _ filled with chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   The small chocolates, made in imported molds, are works of art.
Little red hearts made in either dark or milk chocolate have
fillings ranging from dark chocolate mousse to raspberry cream. A
cherry cordial displays red cherries on a white chocolate
background. And other choices span the season _ a chocolate fan, a
caramel walnut horseshoe, a rum raisin barrel, a peach envelope and
milk chocolate turtles filled with caramel and a variety of nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The colors, which range from red and peach to blue for a
blueberry-filled diamond, are achieved by coloring cocoa butter for
the first thin layer in the molds. The cocoa butter adds shine.
Dark chocolate is brushed sparingly into the mold for contrasting
color.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Ghyslain chocolates apart is not just the artistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cream filling is a ganache made of half cream and half
chocolate,'' he says. It is a far cry from the sugar and water
fondant that fills many commercial chocolates. And, when he adds
raspberries to the filling, he uses pureed fresh raspberries, not
flavoring. Even the liqueurs used are the real thing, but boiled
down in the cream to evaporate the alcohol that's prohibited under
U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of his chocolates are made with milk chocolate, to
cater to the American taste. While dark chocolate is preferred in
Europe, about 70 percent of the chocolates consumed in this country
are milk chocolate, he says. But American taste is changing. Ten
years ago the figures were 80 percent milk chocolate to 20 percent
dark.
</P>
<P>
   The chocolate buttons that he melts to produce his colorful
specialties come from Paris. The dark chocolate ranges from 55
percent to 72 percent cacao _ the measure of the amount of cocoa
and cocoa butter in the product. The milk chocolate he uses has
only 38 percent cacao, with more sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate such as Hershey's, Maurais says, contains oil rather
than the more expensive cocoa butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil costs 50 cents a pound,'' he says. ``Cocoa butter costs
$10 a pound.''
</P>
<P>
   The 72 percent chocolate, he says, is ``too bitter'' for most
Americans, though it's his favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a few pieces every morning for breakfast,'' he says. To
acquaint customers with the taste, he gives away small squares at
the shop.
</P>
<P>
   So far Ghyslain chocolates are available only at the Union City
shop operated by him and his wife Susan, and by mail. They live
next door to the chocolate shop, and she continues to do marketing
for her family's business, the Frank Miller Lumber Company.
</P>
<P>
   However, Maurais is working with a distributor to sell to
upscale markets in the Ohio-Indiana area. A dedicated oenophile, he
believes the chocolates will be a natural partner for wine and
cheese shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in a wine shop, I always look at the other stuff.''
And, he says, ``We're really the only ones doing colored chocolate
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The edible wine bottle, filled with chocolate and complete with
edible label, retails for $40 and was designed for wine shops, as
was the smaller filled champagne bottle, $21. The creation was a
hit during the Christmas holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Maurais concedes that the wine bottle, which is made in two
pieces and nested in a wooden crate, has been difficult to ship.
But an elaborate Yule log, with chocolate decorations including a
tiny axe, were successfully shipped all over, including to Japan.
Half of his Christmas business was in corporate gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Word is spreading about the chocolates. Last week, a businessman
who tasted the chocolates at a Florida meeting was in the Union
City shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to take some back home the next time I was
here,'' said John Murgalsky of Workhorse Custom Chassis. He bought
two boxes to take home to his wife and daughter _ in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Ghyslain Chocolatier is at 655 N. Indiana 227, Union City, IN.

CAPITAL TRIES TO SHRUG OFF MCCAIN CHALLENGE TO WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the film ``Groundhog Day,'' Bill Murray portrays
a TV weatherman who wakes up every day to the same day, powerless
to change the course of events. Wednesday was Groundhog Day, and
though Washington woke up after the New Hampshire primary to a new
political landscape, few dared to acknowledge that anything here
had changed.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill expressed surprise at the size of
Arizona Senator John McCain's win over Texas Governor George W.
Bush in Tuesday's Republican primary. But most attributed it to New
Hampshire's eccentricities, or to McCain's endurance, not to the
senator's promise to shake up Washington and shake out its special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes on here,'' said Representative Thomas Davis, a
Virginia Republican, who heads the House committee that is raising
millions of dollars for GOP candidates. Davis dismissed as ``press
spin'' the notion that McCain's message of removing big money from
politics had resonated too much with Granite State voters.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Davis joined Jim Nicholson, chairman of the
Republican National Committee, at a news conference where Nicholson
announced the party's plan for a ``multimillion-dollar initiative''
to help elect GOP state legislators and influence congressional
redistricting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson denied the Republican Party establishment, which
overwhelmingly has endorsed Bush and has embraced him as the best
hope for winning the White House in November, was shaken by the
results in New Hamsphire, where McCain got 49 percent of the vote
to Bush's 30 percent. ``I haven't seen anybody shaking, and I am
not shaking,'' said Nicholson, who attributed McCain's success to
the fact that primary voters ``don't like or trust Al Gore'' and
are yearning for a candidate with integrity.
</P>
<P>
   In their Capitol cloakrooms, however, members of both parties
privately were expressing anxiety at how Bush's defeat was,
unexpectedly, a drubbing, and how thin Vice President Gore's win
was over former Senator Bill Bradley in the Democratic primary.
Bradley, like McCain, ran as an outsider, promising to practice a
``new politics'' and not abuse the campaign-finance laws, which he
accuses Gore of doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of holy cows got wounded last night, and these guys are
worried,'' said Tom Korologos, who came to the Senate as an aide in
1962, worked in the Nixon White House, and is now one of the
cardinals of Washington corporate lobbying. Wednesday it was still
business as usual: Korologos waited outside the chamber for a word
with senators who were voting on a bill, backed by the banking and
credit-card industry, to overhaul bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   At his victory rally in Nashua, N.H., Tuesday night, McCain
pledged to turn his New Hampshire campaign into ``a national
crusade'' to change the way Washington works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you to help me break the Washington iron triangle of big
money, lobbyists, and legislation that for too long has put special
interests above the national interest,'' McCain said. ``We have
sent a powerful message to Washington that change is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Korologos laughed. ``This place never changes. Being a special
interest myself, I can tell you that the First Amendment to the
Constitution says we have a right to petition the government, and
somebody has to repeal that before I start worrying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Wertheimer, who has been working on overhauling the
campaign-finance laws almost as long as Korologos has been
lobbying, said Wednesday that both McCain and Bradley sent a
powerful message to political leaders in Washington and punctured
their illusion that Americans don't care about the access money
buys in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington establishment is in a state of shock today.
McCain delivered the political equivalent of announcing that the
king has no clothes on,'' said Wertheimer, who is president of
Democracy 21, a public-policy group. ``Would I expect them to be
saying, `We've changed our minds about the way we do business?' No.
But they cannot ignore this message.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who
endorsed Bradley, agrees that a fundamental change is afoot,
although it may be hard for the current Congress to appreciate and
adapt to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message I got is that the standard positions of the
establishment parties on both sides are not working anymore,'' said
Moynihan, who is retiring at the end of the year. ``We have the
making of a new generation of politicians. This place, for good or
ill, must recognize it is no longer very representative of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty strong medicine to swallow, so Wednesday there was
denial, and excuses, and just plain puzzlement in the capital over
what New Hampshire's voters meant to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the earth moved in Washington, but I did hear
people say, many times, `What happened?' '' said Massachusetts
Governor Paul Cellucci, who was here Wednesday to testify before
the Senate Budget Committee on his opposition to taxing electronic
commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give Senator McCain credit; his strategy worked and his
message helped him in New Hampshire,'' said Cellucci, who has
endorsed Bush. ``But the problem with his message is that McCain
isn't an outsider; he's an insider. And the Democrats are going to
pick apart every issue he has voted on in the Senate and every
contribution he has received as the chairman of the Commerce
Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore can't campaign as anything but the consummate insider.
There he was Wednesday, in the Senate chamber, summoned from his
campaign by Democratic Senate leaders and the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights League, a special-interest group, to be on hand
to break what they thought might be a tie vote on an
abortion-related amendment to the bankruptcy bill. The amendment
passed without his help, but Gore enjoyed a few minutes of
backslapping and encouraging words from Senate supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley ran a strong campaign in New Hampshire, and
the campaign-finance issue had some resonance,'' said Senator Byron
Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who endorsed Gore. ``But it's all
personal politics in New Hampshire, and it's not that way around
the country. I believe Gore will be our party's nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who supports McCain,
wasn't prepared to say, either, that McCain's promise to turn off
the tap on political money was a winning issue. ``I don't think
voters go around saying, `Gee, if we just had campaign-finance
reform, the world would be a better place,'' Hagel said. ``What
resonates is McCain' story _ that he's an outsider, experienced,
trustworthy, the antithesis of Clinton, and can define himself
better than Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe McCain was even understood better in New Hampshire,
Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, mused.
</P>
<P>
   ``They speak a strange dialect up there _ you can't understand
them,'' Gramm said, straightfaced and with a deep Southern twang.
``I don't think they knew whether Bush was saying `Texas' or
`taxes,' and that created problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Things should improve for the Texas governor, Gramm said, now
that the campaign is moving to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from Texas have historically done poorly in contested
New Hampshire primaries,'' said Gramm, who made a brief run for the
presidency in 1996. ``It's a small state that tends to want to
force candidates to grovel. Texas politicians have plenty of
skills, but groveling is not one of them.''

 &HT;    Get the scoop on tuna for best value, flavor
 &HT;    By Karen Collins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: What are the differences among the various
types of tuna?
</P>
<P>
   A: Among canned tuna products, light tuna has a stronger flavor
than the delicately flavored white albacore tuna. Albacore is more
expensive than light tuna, but it is one of the fish that is high
in omega-three fatty acids. It contains more than three times the
amount found in light tuna.
</P>
<P>
   The oil in which some tuna is packed does not contain this
possibly beneficial fat, so choose water-packed tuna. Drain and
rinse briefly to reduce sodium content.
</P>
<P>
   Another price difference in canned tuna is based on the size of
the pieces. Save money by choosing pieces that are as small as
appropriate for the dish that you will be making. Among fresh tuna,
bluefin is a good source of omega-three fatty acids, substantially
higher than yellowfin tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can the right diet help to relieve the morning sickness of
pregnancy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Morning sickness, or nausea during pregnancy, can occur at
any time of day. Keeping your stomach either completely empty or
completely full can help reduce it. Often women with morning
sickness are more comfortable if they include only solid foods at
meals, and save fluids for between meals. Since getting enough
fluid is important, that means concentrated efforts to get it in.
</P>
<P>
   If your nausea is worst in the early morning, try keeping some
dry crackers or cereal by your bed so you can eat a little to
settle your stomach before you even get up. Also, try to get enough
rest and avoid any smells or greasy or spicy foods that bother you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that keeping dietary fat very low can help improve
a runner's performance?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Studies have shown that a high-carbohydrate diet is
important to maximize muscle stores of glycogen (the storage form
of carbohydrate) and improve athletic performance. However,
research now shows that eating enough fat is also important.
Several studies have demonstrated improvement in performance when
extremely low levels of dietary fat were increased to more moderate
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   A new study shows that athletes running 40 miles per week on a
very low-fat diet had decreases in immune function. Although the 17
percent of calories as fat they were eating is within the range of
15 percent to 30 percent that is recommended for good health by
authorities such as the American Institute for Cancer Research,
apparently this was too low for these advanced athletes.
</P>
<P>
   For good health and performance, endurance athletes should be
sure to get enough fat, but get most of that fat from plant-based
sources like nuts, seeds, and olive or canola oil, while avoiding
too much saturated fat from foods such as meat and high-fat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   These Ask a Dietitian questions were answered by Karen Collins,
M.S., R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer Research.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ In her piping soprano, 10-year-old Courtney
Dozetos told hundreds of Vermonters crammed into the state House
here late Tuesday night: ``It would make me feel special and good
if my Moms could get married. I don't and probably never will
understand why they can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pastelnick, representing the opposite side, quoted a verse
from Leviticus calling sex between men ``an abomination'' and
argued, ``God made Adam and Eve, he didn't make Adam and Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ilsley probably summed up the situation best: ``It seems
we're a state divided.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that gay couples
deserve the same rights and benefits as heterosexual spouses and
must be granted them, Vermont is indeed a state divided, even
polarized, as it takes its new position at the epicenter of the
country's long-running debate over gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It is grappling hard with the court ruling in its media, in its
lunch-counter talk and in its Legislature, where committee members
are hoping to come up with at least the beginnings of a bill on
same-sex couples this month. And as it grapples, it is finding that
what had seemed at first obvious middle ground _ a domestic
partnership system that would offer all the benefits of marriage,
from health insurance to inheritance rights, without the title _
has few backers, at least at this point.
</P>
<P>
   In its Dec. 20 ruling, the court left it up to the Legislature
to find a remedy for discrimination against gay and lesbian
couples. It set no deadline for the new law, but retained the right
to revisit the issue if the unconstitutional discrimination did not
end.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the ruling, Gov. Howard Dean and others
expressed their support for domestic partnership as a compromise.
California and Hawaii already have statewide domestic partnership
laws, albeit not nearly as extensive as the Vermont court's ruling
would require.
</P>
<P>
   But as people in Vermont speak out, almost no one can be heard
promoting domestic partnerships. Those who support traditional
marriage say domestic partnerships would undermine it. Those who
support gay marriage say the state should settle for nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   Dean attributes the sense of polarization to the current central
forum of the state's debate: two mass public hearings at the state
House, one last week and one Tuesday night, that have drawn well
over 1,000 people each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is self-selecting, of course,'' Dean said. ``Look out your
window. When it's snowing like this, you're not going to get up out
of your cozy armchair in the middle of the Vermont winter to take
the moderate path.''
</P>
<P>
   But a statewide poll _ conducted Jan. 18-21 and sponsored by The
Rutland Herald, The Barre-Montpelier Times Argus and WCAX Channel 3
News _ bore out the depth of the state's split. It found that 38
percent agreed with the Supreme Court's ruling, and 52 percent
disagreed, while 10 percent remained unsure. Asked if they favored
overturning the court's ruling with a constitutional amendment, 49
percent said they did, while 44 percent opposed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Catholic leaders, who have mobilized to oppose
same-sex marriage, oppose domestic partnerships as well. They
sponsored a rally outside the state House on Tuesday night that
drew nearly 1,000 people, some with yellow signs saying, ``Preserve
Marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of many other denominations, including Episcopal and
United Methodist bishops and several rabbis, have come out strongly
in favor of gay marriage as a way to strengthen the institution and
defend civil rights. They, for their part, back full-fledged
marriage, not partnership.
</P>
<P>
   At the state House hearings, virtually everyone wears either a
pink sticker supporting gay marriage or a white sticker saying
``God's plan _ one woman one man'' or ``Don't mock marriage.''
There are no domestic partnership stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the debate has been impeccably civil and both sides
well behaved, prompting expressions of state pride from Dean and
others. But many, like Thomas A. Little, chairman of the House
committee holding hearings on same-sex marriage, worry that the
peace will not last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest that while we're in stasis, or a holding
pattern, where we're not deciding anything yet, that it's possible
to sustain,'' he said of the political calm. ``And when we start to
move forward with drafting and marking up a particular bill, that
may change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no middle ground so far that's emerged,'' he
continued. ``And it probably was naive to think it might. The gay
and lesbian community advocates are saying the only thing that will
work is same-sex marriage, and the people who are vocally against
any of that sort of thing say the only thing that will satisfy them
is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member House Judiciary Committee will try to begin
drafting a bill this week, Little said, but it will be a slow
process. Committee members say there have been no preliminary votes
or other indications as to which way the committee is leaning, and
no one is making any predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Other bills are pending, one to ``clarify'' that marriage is
only between a man and a woman, one to do the opposite and make the
state's marriage laws ``gender neutral,'' and one to begin amending
the state constitution to specify that marriage is heterosexual.
The legislative session is expected to last through April.
</P>
<P>
   As the Legislature wrestles, thousands of Vermont voters will
also have a chance to weigh in on the same-sex marriage issue. Many
towns are planning to put the question to a nonbinding vote on
their Town Meeting day in March.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee has stressed that it wants to
discuss how to carry out the court's decision, not the merits of
the decision itself, which came after three gay couples sued when
their town clerks denied them marriage licenses. It has thus far
allowed only Vermonters to testify at public hearings, and
emphasizing that it wants the debate to be an internal Vermont
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The committee may be fighting a losing battle on those counts,
however. In testimony, speakers have repeatedly denounced the
court's decision and urged the Legislature to back a constitutional
amendment to overturn it. Some also called for impeaching the
court's justices.
</P>
<P>
   As for outsiders, Randall Terry, the militant abortion foe known
for creating disturbances at abortion clinics around the country
with his group Operation Rescue, has set up shop here and told The
Rutland Herald that he plans to stay ``for the duration'' of the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Vermont, the outsiders may lobby, but there is a sense
that no one is listening much. Sue Allen, spokeswoman for Dean,
said the office had received about 13,000 calls, faxes and letters,
an unheard-of number, but that the vast majority came from
out-of-staters, and so had no influence. Vermonters' opinions are
forwarded to the governor, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar attitude prevails at The Burlington Free Press, which
has carried several two-page spreads of letters on same-sex
marriage. A Kansas minister who came to town to preach against gays
upset many Vermonters, said Stephen Kiernan, the newspaper's
editorial page editor, and ``That has created an atmosphere within
Vermont that this is our issue and we will resolve it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And outsiders,'' Kiernan added, ``thank you very much, but why
don't you go skiing?''

STOP THE `SCREAM'-ING ALREADY!
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Feb. 4. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having evolved into the very kind of movie that it once so
inventively spoofed, the makers of the ``Scream'' franchise had two
choices as they prepared for the last film (it IS the last one,
right?) in their lucrative series. They could either roll the dice
and try something new, or they could play it safe and stick to the
formula.
</P>
<P>
   That director Wes Craven and screenwriter Ehren Kruger
(``Arlington Road'') took the easy way out isn't exactly a
surprise. Despite its big talk (and there is a lot of talk in these
movies), the ``Scream'' franchise is no different than, say, the
Bond films in its adherence to form. But coming as it does after a
parade of tired imitators and the arrival of smart, psychological
horror fare like ``The Sixth Sense'' and ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' ``Scream 3'' feels about as fresh as ``Friday the 13th:
Part 8.''
</P>
<P>
   It's yesterday's news. That's how fast trends move these days,
and you would think Craven and company would understand that, given
how deeply rooted the ``Scream'' movies are in pop culture.
Kruger's script bursts with pop-savvy humor and plenty of
self-referential wit. What's missing, however, is any sense of
terror and suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' simply isn't very scary, with the possible
exception of the scenes where we're forced to watch Jenny McCarthy
attempt to act. Then, you'll want to cover your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Kevin Williamson originally conceived ``Scream'' as
a trilogy. And even though Williamson is nowhere to be found here
(and, after watching ``The Faculty'' and TV's ``The Wasteland,''
maybe that's not such a bad thing), this third film certainly feels
like part of the whole, albeit with diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   The plot has the series masked marauder looking to find some
closure with Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell). In the meantime, he
(or she) carves some time into his (or her) schedule for the cast
members of ``Stab 3,'' the final sequel to the movie within a movie
from ``Scream 2.'' As the cast members begin to bleed for their
art, tabloid newscaster Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) and
dim-witted deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette) arrive on the scene,
ready to battle the killer and rekindle their love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' has great fun with the movie-within-a-movie
conceit, and Parker Posey is a hoot playing the Method actress cast
as the fictional Gale Weathers. There's also a great scene where
one of the series' dearly departed alums appears from the Great
Beyond to explain the rules of horror trilogies. (Anyone can die,
he explains. Even the main character. It could get to look like
``Reservoir Dogs'' out there.)
</P>
<P>
   If only the filmmakers had followed these rules a little more
creatively. Supposedly, all bets are off in the third film, but
there are no revelations here, only aggressively stupid mayhem. (It
doesn't help the scant suspense that the killer always calls his
victims on their cell phones.) Craven himself seems bored,
particularly given the number of times he tries to scare the
audience by having characters jump into the frame. (What? No
leaping house cat?)
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, like Sigourney Weaver's ``Alien'' heroine, bravely
soldiers on, suffering blow after blow and coming back for more. In
a way, she's emblematic of the ``Scream'' audience, which should
know better by now. As the Rules Guy explains, the past always
comes back to bite you. Or, to paraphrase ``Scream 2's'' more
succinct credo: Sequels stink. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The film: ``Scream 3'' (R; graphic violence and language). &QL;

Kruger. Released by Dimension Films. &QL;

 &HT;    Find new food favorites that span the globe
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jill Melton, senior food editor of Cooking Light
magazine, has a bag of flaxseed in her fridge, left over from a
terrific banana bread featured in the October issue. And Melton, a
registered dietitian, is so impressed with the nutritional values
of this seed and its crunchy flavor in every thing from breads to
pilafs that flaxseed made Cooking Light's list of hot trends for
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin last week to discuss these trends, Melton said that
when the seed is ground and mixed with water, it also becomes an
egg substitute. ``It's really weird,'' she says, ``because flaxseed
is not remotely similar to an egg.''
</P>
<P>
   So what else does the magazine think the au courant cook should
be serving in this new century? Check your pantry and see how you
measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Soy is huge, and you are crazy today if you don't eat it in some
way, shape or form, Melton says. Soy is a good protein source that
can help fight menopausal symptoms, heart disease and osteoporosis.
If you don't like tofu cubes, disguise it in dips. Use soy milk in
chocolate puddings. Nibble on soy nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Mom food is another big trend. Basically, this is old-fashioned
comfort food. But one note of caution: Mom food can be very rich.
Moderation is the key. You really don't have to eat the whole bowl
of mac-and-cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Mangoes are the numero uno consumer fruit in the world. They
have great flavor and are a super source of beta carotene. Melton
predicts that in five to 10 years they may be as common as apples
and oranges, if people can figure out how to cut them. With that
seed in the center, they are not as easy to eat as bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Regional food _ such as Appalachian, Low Country, New England _
has been hot for a number of years and will continue to be. Of
course, the Lone Star State could cite its own regional cuisines:
East Texas, South Texas, Central Texas ...
</P>
<P>
   Latin foods _ As restaurants use more Latin ingredients, the
flavors will be increasingly familiar to people all over the
country. ``I think chimichurri sauce will be as common as pesto
five years from now,'' Melton says.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry vinegar may never be as big as balsamic vinegar, but
watch for it to rise and be more affordable, like $10 a bottle
instead of $75. Try it mixed with a good olive oil and Good Seasons
Italian Dressing mix.
</P>
<P>
   Indian food is going to be the next big ethnic food. And it is
not all rich curries. Much is vegetarian, which is good for you.
This cuisine has a heavy reliance on spices that can add flavor
when fat is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Asian pantry _ From noodle bowls to wasabi-dabbed sushi, the
once-exotic flavors of Asia are hitting America's plate with
increasing frequency. Go ahead and buy that bottle of fish sauce
and be adventurous.

<P>
   Crossing a barrier that once seemed impassable, physicists in
recent years have used a delicate instrument called a scanning
tunneling microscope to reach down into the very substrate of
matter, feeling the bumps and grooves of atoms and even picking
them up and moving them around like so many grains of sand. In a
well-publicized tour de force, IBM researchers in 1990 carefully
arranged 35 atoms of the element xenon to spell out their company's
initials.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in another demonstration of subatomic nimbleness,
scientists have created a kind of quantum reflector, in which an
atom placed in one location appears as a ghostly presence in
another.
</P>
<P>
   Using several dozen cobalt atoms as building blocks, researchers
at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., erected the
elliptically shaped structure _ a so-called quantum corral, about
20 billionths of a meter long, on the surface of a copper crystal.
Then they used the walls of the enclosure as a tiny hall of
mirrors, projecting the properties of a single atom to another spot
on the crystal, creating what they call a ``quantum mirage.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The technique, reported in Thursday's issue of Nature, might
conceivably be used as a kind of remote sensing device, allowing
scientists to probe an atom's projected image without disturbing
the original. Or the method might someday be perfected into a means
of sending signals inside computer chips too small to make use of
conventional wires.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery may prove to be of at least as much interest
to philosophers as to Silicon Valley engineers. The creation of the
atomic doppelgaenger raises the question of whether the quantum
reflector is merely projecting an image of an atom or, as the
researchers suggest in their paper, recreating a full-fledged
``phantom atom'' in the other location.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the big questions,'' said Hari Manoharan, who
was joined in the experiment by Christopher P. Lutz and the IBM
Fellow Donald M. Eigler, a pioneer in quantum engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see a mirage in the desert, it can actually interact
with matter,'' Manoharan said. ``You can take a picture of it. The
film reacts to its photons. This quantum mirage is real in that
sense. It reacts with the tip of our scanning tunneling microscope.
So it is an image, but it has a certain reality to it as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The quantum corral was shaped to take advantage of an ellipse's
natural optical properties: it has two focal points. Thus the image
of an object _ a light bulb for example _ shining at the left-hand
focus of an ellipse-shaped mirror will also appear at the
right-hand focus. The IBM scientists placed a single cobalt atom at
one focus of their quantum mirror and then detected its presence at
the other focus some 10 billionths of a meter away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But was the second atom just an image or the real thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``In an elliptically mirrored room, we would see the light bulb
at the other focus,'' said Eric J. Heller, a professor of chemistry
and physics at Harvard University. ``So for many measurements, it
would appear there was a light bulb there. But measure it in a
different way _ by trying to touch it _ and it wouldn't be
there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scanning tunneling microscope, invented in 1981 by Gerd
Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer of the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory in
Switzerland, uses as its ``lens'' an exceedingly thin wire tip
whose end is the width of a single atom. Through a quantum
mechanical effect called tunneling, a tiny current of electricity
flows from the tip to the surface of the metal it is scanning. The
closer the probe is to the target, the more electricity flows. The
subtle changes in current are interpreted by a computer to make a
contour map of the hills and valleys of the atomic terrain.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, experimenters have learned to use the tips of the
microscopes as tweezers to pick up atoms and rearrange them. In the
newly reported IBM experiment, a sample of copper was placed in a
vacuum and cooled to 4 degrees Kelvin, near absolute zero,
dampening thermal vibrations. Then the surface of the metal was
sprinkled with cobalt atoms. After nudging several dozen cobalt
atoms to form the walls of the elliptical corral, the researchers
placed a single atom at the lefthand focus.
</P>
<P>
   At such low temperatures, a cobalt atom exhibits an exotic
effect called a ``Kondo resonance,'' named for the Japanese
scientist Jun Kondo. Acting like a little magnet, the atom causes
the surrounding electrons in the copper, which can also be thought
of as little magnets, to line up in the opposite direction. Probing
with the tip of the scanning tunneling microscope, the
experimenters registered the distinctive signature of the Kondo
effect. Surprisingly, when they put the tip at the unoccupied
focus, they found a weaker Kondo effect there too. It was as though
a ``phantom atom,'' as they called it, had been projected to that
spot and was influencing its surroundings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manoharan said many technical obstacles would have to be
overcome before the mirage effect could be used to send signals
between the components of superminiature computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, like experimental philosophers, he and his colleagues
are probing the phantom's ontological status, trying to get it to
interact with another atom. ``Then we'll see how real this mirage
is,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   And you thought the days of characters uttering the phrase ``let
your light shine'' outside Hallmark city limits were behind us. No
such luck.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the significant advice a mother gives her
9-year-old daughter, Belle, in ``Knockout,'' director Lorenzo
Doumani's clunky film about pursuing one's dreams. Belle the
impressionable daughter grows up to be Belle the beautiful boxer, a
``knockout'' who _ get it? _ knocks people out.
</P>
<P>
   A smarter, more insightful film explores what a woman goes
through when she penetrates a male-dominated sport. But
``Knockout,'' written by Mark Stevens and Doumani, is neither smart
nor deep. It's a watered-down ``Rocky'' with a predictable plot and
bone-crunchingly stupid dialogue that probably should have been a
cable TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing we really learn about Belle (played as an adult
by newcomer Sophia Adella Hernandez) is she (BEGIN ITAL)needs(END
ITAL) to fight. Why? Presumably because her father (Tony Plana)
used to box before giving up a career as a golden gloves champ to
become a cop. He made this sacrifice at the request of Belle's
mother (Maria Conchita Alonso, in a cameo) who, in addition to her
``let your light shine'' advice, also concludes ``we shouldn't have
to give up the thing we love to be with the one we love.'' Which
isn't Belle's problem: Her boyfriend Mario (Eduardo Yanez) is her
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's ring quest is also spurred by seeing her pugilistic best
friend Sandra (Gina La Plana) get seriously roughed up by Tanya
``The Terminator'' Tessaro (Fredia Gibbs). You don't need the
Psychic Friends Hotline to guess Belle and the Terminator are
destined for a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Plana has a couple of real moments, and the usually excellent
Paul Winfield sleepwalks through a role as a wheelchair-dependent
promoter. It's too early for a verdict on Hernandez's acting chops,
since, despite all her screen time, she's given surprisingly little
to work with. However, she certainly looks like she belongs in the
ring, and the fight scenes are convincing.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie feels false in so many other ways. Despite all the
talk about ``getting off the streets'' and away from gangs, East
L.A. isn't portrayed as dangerous. Our only indication that Belle,
her father and Mario have ``escaped'' a worse fate is a showdown
between the cops and a couple of kids carrying automatic weapons
that look like they're off the shelf of Toys R Us. And Belle?
Before plunging into the fight game, she's teaching aerobics at a
seniors center. How dangerous is that?
</P>
<P>
   The fault is primarily the script's, which can't deliver its
up-from-the-streets premise. Doumani may have envisioned his
heroine as ``Rocky.'' In ``Knockout,'' she comes across as little
more than a gimmick with a decent right hook. &QL;

HOSPITALS DIVIDED OVER HMO RESCUE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With the clock running down toward a Feb. 11 deadline
for a list of options to save Harvard Pilgrim Health Care,
Massachusetts hospital executives are sharply divided over a plan
to keep the health plan nonprofit by deferring much of its 1999
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said Wednesday they don't know yet if they
will even have a proposal to keep the region's dominant health
insurer nonprofit before the deadline expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure anybody can answer that question,'' said Dr.
Michael Collins, president and chief executive of Caritas Christi
Health Care System.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: There is considerable dissension and
distrust within hospitals' ranks about what their proposals would
look like. The conflicts may interfere with efforts to fashion a
hospital proposal to bail out the 1.1 million-member health plan,
which fell into state receivership on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, for one, said he was ``not interested'' in
participating in a plan being developed to defer a portion of
hospitals' Harvard Pilgrim debt to help the health plan get back on
its feet. ``No, thank you,'' he said firmly, saying that nothing
short of total health system reform would work.
</P>
<P>
   Other hospital officials said the debt deferral idea remains the
leading proposal in hospital councils. Still others called for the
Legislature and governor to come forward with public funds for a
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has jelled,'' said one Boston hospital executive, who
asked to remain unnamed. ``With such disparate interests in the
room, it's difficult to get focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual hospitals and hospital systems, such as Partners
Healthcare, have expressed formal interest in developing a Harvard
Pilgrim rescue plan, expanding the list of potential saviors beyond
the 13 announced earlier by attorney general Thomas F. Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than 13 but we can't say exactly how many right
now,'' said Steve Bilafer, a spokesman for Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any hospital representatives have begun to comb through
Harvard Pilgrim's financial figures to test the feasibility of any
hospital bail-out plan. The books are available in four locked
rooms at the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Once Partners Healthcare representatives begin to examine the
books, they will share the results with other hospitals, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said this week he expects to hew to a strict timetable,
winnowing down the Harvard Pilgrim options by Feb. 11. Asked if the
attorney general and state receiver, insurance commissioner Linda
Ruthardt, planned to release a single proposal or a short list of
possible options, Reilly's chief deputies said it was too soon to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   One hospital executive questioned Reilly's timetable. ``I've
gotta wonder about the time frame, whether that's doable,'' that
official said. ``I just can't imagine how any entity is going to be
able to nail down their position in that period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Considerable controversy is swirling around the idea of debt
deferral, by which some hospitals would sign ``surplus notes,''
also called ``subordinated notes,'' to defer Harvard Pilgrim
payment until some future date when the health plan was able to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   One community hospital president called the idea of surplus
notes ``stupid _ worse than junk bonds. The hospital industry is
going to bail out the HMO because it's the easiest solution to the
problem,'' he said. ``If I were the czar of hospitals, I'd say the
Legislature and governor have to use their creativity to fix this
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth, which is owed
about $4 million by Harvard Pilgrim would ``like to see Harvard
Pilgrim rehabilitated, but we'd like to see it done without our
money being used,'' said hospital spokesman Paul Taylor. ``We don't
have any plans right now (to sign surplus bonds) but that doesn't
mean we wouldn't consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other hospital executives minimized the disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's preliminary to talk about dissension in the ranks,'' said
Dr. James Reinertsen, head of CareGroup, the hospital system
centered on Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ``This is an
investment that each hospital is being asked to make. It's a large
amount of capital, and there needs to be a big pull'' to reach
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, there's a game of chicken going on here,'' said
Michael Miller of the consumer group Health Care for All. ``Three
things are on a collision course: a for-profit buy-out, debt
restructuring, and public rescue. Everybody is trying to get
someone else to blink.''
</P>
<P>
   One item of intense discussion among hospitals is what
concessions they would assert as a condition for their debt
restructuring. Some have suggested that hospitals would insist on
sitting at Harvard Pilgrim's governing board, but others say
they're more interested in guarantees of timely payment and other
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much time,'' Reinertsen said. ``We need to get
the ideas to jell together quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   A major item of uncertainty for hospitals is just how large
Harvard Pilgrim's 1999 debt actually is.
</P>
<P>
   First Assistant Attorney General Dean Richlin said Harvard
Pilgrim's operating losses for 1999 now stand at $197 million, up
from $177 million, but he said the change is not significant. The
change occurred as PricewaterhouseCoopers, the HMO's accounting
firm, reviewed final numbers for 1999 in the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the change stems from Harvard Pilgrim's payment of $10
million to Perot Systems for software. Accountants originally had
listed it as a capital expense. When applying more conservative
accounting principles to Harvard Pilgrim's books, it became an
operating expense, Richlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another adjustment was made when the accountants looked at the
value of bonds Harvard Pilgrim owns as investments. The bonds
decreased in value by $10 million, which was also added as an
operating loss.
</P>
<P>
   But accounting changes in the past couple of weeks also
increased Harvard's net worth from minus-$100 million to minus-$90
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were paper adjustments, the kind of adjustments
accountants make when they do end of the year reports,'' Richlin
said. ``From our point of view there is no significant change in
the financial condition of Harvard Pilgrim from the time the
receivership began until now. In no way do these adjustments affect
our plan or timetable.''

NEW WEB SITE TO OFFER KIDS CAREER HELP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it dot-com passion.
</P>
<P>
   First, Microsoft's Bill Gates pledges $1 billion to educate
20,000 minority scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Jim Barksdale, former chief executive of Netscape
Communications Corp. and a well-known venture capitalist, donates
$100 million to the University of Mississippi to develop an
institute to improve children's reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five-year-old Monster.com, an international on-line career
site, says it will spend $1 million to underwrite the launch of a
virtual job-shadowing Web site to help high school students learn
about careers. Through the program (www.jobshadow.org), students
can communicate with chefs, computer programmers, scientists, and
chief executives via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Maynard, Mass., Monster.com was also a sponsor of
Wednesday's national Job Shadow Day. The program is a year-long
endeavor that pairs high school students with working men and women
who act as advisers and mentors. This year, about a million
students are expected to participate.
</P>
<P>
   In greater Boston and New Hampshire, more than 50 companies
hosted 12,000 students from high schools and vocational technical
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Other national sponsors include Junior Achievement; America's
Promise, a nonprofit organization led by Colin Powell; the American
Society of Association Executives; and School-to-Work
Opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   With high-tech positions increasingly difficult to fill, both
Gates and Jeff Taylor, who is the chief executive of Monster.com,
are banking on philanthropy as a means of promoting education and,
if all goes well, preparing Echo boomers to fill future job
vacancies as the labor shortage deepens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Career development is a lifelong process that begins years
before young adults set out to find their first jobs,'' said
Taylor, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Added James B. Hayes, president and chief executive of Junior
Achievement, ``Job Shadow Day gives kids an opportunity to
experience, firsthand, the many career opportunities that are now
available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Take 17-year-old Charlene Wesley. She was among 25 students from
two neighboring high schools who spent the morning and early
afternoon shadowing employees at Monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley, a Maynard (Mass.) High School student who with a friend
co-founded a Web site called Candy Child Web Design
(www.come.to/candychildcq), plans to continue her studies in
college but wanted to see firsthand how Web developers and
designers do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Tucker, 18, a senior at Maynard High School, wants to be
an accountant and own her own firm. She shadowed Monster.com's
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to work in a place like this,'' Tucker said.
``The people are nice. It's more interesting than a regular office.
It doesn't look as boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was among more than two dozen youths who gathered in an
open area that serves as cafeteria, rec hall, and meeting room _ in
a building that has housed an old mill, Digital Equipment Corp.,
and now the digerati. The furniture is portable, the walls range
from exposed brick to deep purple, and the halls are wide, giving
the interior a spacious, open feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, whose parents own an auto parts store, spent the day
watching Taylor give interviews, talk to employees, and meet with
clients. She said he offered her a summer internship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me how he got started, and it seemed easy,'' she said.
``He just sat down at his dining room table and sketched out a
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the story is a bit more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Taylor created Monster Board, the first Internet job
site. The idea was simple enough: Job candidates could log on, post
their resumes for employers to view, and search a database for
jobs, free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Employers, by contrast, would pay a fee to tap into the resume
database and post job vacancies. By 1995, 20,000 people per day
were visiting the site. Last year, it was expected to take in well
over $100 million in revenue. It has 520 employees and plans to add
500 by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   The company was bought in 1995 by TMP Worldwide Inc., owner of
several executive search firms.

 &HT;    McCain takes momentum into S.C.
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, S.C. _ George W. Bush has the money and the
organization. John McCain has the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   They took their fight Wednesday from New Hampshire to South
Carolina, where a more conservative electorate and the South's
first primary, set for Feb. 19, await.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator was tired but ebullient after beating the
Texas governor by 19 points Tuesday in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cindy and I are feeling wonderfully refreshed after both hours
of sleep,'' McCain told a packed gymnasium at Presbyterian College
in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Loud music and cheering students, evocative of a rock concert,
greeted McCain at an airport hangar in Greenville in the middle of
the night and again at the college. He also made an appeal to an
audience heavy with veterans at a popular drive-in restaurant in
Spartanburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt we have some momentum out of New Hampshire.
My job now is to maintain that momentum. It's not clear I will be
able to,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, addressed a crowd of more than 5,000 in the
cavernous auditorium at Bob Jones University in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to publicly defending my conservative
philosophy, and I look forward to making it clear to the people of
this state and other states that our conservative philosophy will
lead to compassionate results,'' he said at the Christian college,
which lost its tax-exempt status in the 1970s for refusing to admit
black students. It now accepts black students but still bans
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Bush picked up the support of former Vice President Dan Quayle.
At a news conference with Bush, Quayle said: ``We know that we have
prosperity today, but let us be very clear that prosperity without
values is no prosperity at all. Governor Bush has the values to be
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain trailed Bush by 20 points in recent South Carolina polls,
and the Texas governor had $31 million in the bank at the start of
the year. But McCain and his aides suggested that the New Hampshire
results already had changed the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our victory last night gave me the megaphone. It gave me the
opportunity to talk to millions and millions of Americans,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign received nearly $450,000 in contributions on
the Internet in the 24 hours since 7 p.m. Tuesday, when CNN
declared McCain the winner in New Hampshire. By contrast, the
campaign had raised $1.5 million online through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would try to boost his campaign by doing a better
job of parrying McCain's reform message by casting him as a
Washington insider because of his 17 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also touted his superior organization and his
strategy of running campaigns in all 50 states. Asked for his
response, McCain said, ``My response, now he is running a 49-state
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also continued a theme he first sounded in New Hampshire,
that McCain's ideas on taxes and education are liberal and out of
touch with core Republican voters in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Charges that McCain is too moderate may find a receptive
audience among socially conservative voters who are numerous in the
Greenville-Spartanburg and Columbia areas. McCain is more popular
along the South Carolina coast, said U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, one of
McCain's best-known supporters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is counting on the formidable statewide organization of
former Gov. Carroll Campbell. McCain's Senate colleague from South
Carolina, Strom Thurmond, also is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain compared his campaign to the Flying Wallendas high-wire
act. ``Hand me the chair,'' he said aboard his bus.
</P>
<P>
   But he has the backing of Sanford and popular U.S. Rep. Lindsey
Graham, one of President Clinton's prosecutors in the Senate
impeachment trial. He introduced McCain at the airport rally and in
Spartanburg.
</P>
<P>
   McCain refers to Graham and Sanford as representatives of the
younger generation of Republican leaders who are challenging
Campbell for dominance in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he and Sanford would ``fend off attacks'' that
McCain ``is not real conservative, that he's not pro-life, that
he's a Democrat in Republican clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also met those charges head-on Wednesday. He called the
New Hampshire results an ``example of not only my electability, but
also my ability to attract people to my party's banner.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be an important ability in South Carolina. The
Democrats are not holding a primary here, and they, along with
independents, can vote in the open Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also hopes to find support among the state's many
military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people who attended McCain's events Wednesday said
they were drawn for the same reasons that worked so well for him in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Randall of Spartanburg said she was impressed by McCain's
military history and experience as a prisoner of war. ``My son's
full-time military and I like that when he was a prisoner he stayed
with the troops. That got me,'' Randall said.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Anderson of Woodruff pointed to his 2 1/2-year-old
daughter and 6-month-old son to explain his support. ``I like his
views on Social Security. There's two reasons right there why we
need to take care of that,'' Anderson said.

EXPLORING SPACE AND TIME, HERE AND NOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Others may care about parallel universes, black holes
or the possibility of punching through our local space-time
configuration into past or future states. What matters to me is the
challenge of punching into the present.
</P>
<P>
   This trick is harder to pull off than one might think. But
Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, the New York architects,
have been performing it, with increasing success, for nearly 20
years. Two recent projects, both realized in ephemeral forms, have
expanded the New York audience for the work of these gifted
space-timers.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, a play called ``Jet Lag,'' has already vanished
into memory, after a recent limited run at the Kitchen, the
performance space in Chelsea. The Brasserie, a restaurant in the
basement of the Seagram Building, has settled in for a longer run,
though management has already begun to fiddle with the Diller and
Scofidio design. Duration, as it happens, is a theme of both
projects. They are both space-times in which it becomes fleetingly
possible to project ourselves outside the grip of past and future,
into the immediate moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jet Lag'' was a collaboration between Diller and Scofidio and
the Builders Association, a performance group directed by Marianne
Weems. The work was originally commissioned by MASS MoCA, a
sprawling arts complex in North Adams, Mass., where it was staged
as one of the center's inaugural events.
</P>
<P>
   The play starts out with a line that some will recall as the
opening sentence from ``The Medium Is the Massage,'' Marshall
McLuhan's 1966 cult classic: ``Good Morning!'' In the performance
that follows, video, radio (broadcast and short-wave), in-flight
movies, telephone and other media are the major characters.
</P>
<P>
   The human actors speak a language that derives almost entirely
from media cliches. As in the recent film ``The Matrix,'' they are
playthings of the artificial intelligence that has evolved beyond
human control.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``The Matrix,'' ``Jet Lag'' is not set in some future
dystopia. The action takes place in the present time, and it
reveals the extent to which the world, thanks to the media, has
already fallen into what McLuhan called the ``narcosis of
Narcissus,'' an insentient, dreamlike state induced by our
infatuation with the images of ourselves that the media pump out.
</P>
<P>
   The character who speaks the opening line appears to be a sailor
setting out on a solo voyage around the world. Or his voyage might
be a hoax: he could be staging the event from a media center in a
basement or a garage. Or the play's entire action might be
unfolding within his head. The production suggests an overlapping
of all three possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In part two of the play, we watch an older woman and her
grandson as they fly endlessly back and forth across the Atlantic.
Perhaps the two are searching for the lost sailor (the woman's son,
the boy's father), or trying to escape from him.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the two are spellbound by the jet-age ethos of
travel, the ethereal anonymity of airports, the routine of flight
protocols, the pseudo-drama of in-flight movies. The grandmother
spouts platitudes of correct passenger behavior, as if she were a
walking handbook for human cattle in a jet-age stockyard. The
grandson's rebelliousness, equally programmed, could be piped in
from the channels on his complimentary headphones.
</P>
<P>
   The multimedia setting, which shifts from passenger compartments
to airport waiting lounges to escalators to people movers to video
surveillance images of them, puts a twist on the familiar
period-dating question, ``What time is this place?'' In airports,
we're more likely to wonder, what place is this time?
</P>
<P>
   Diller and Scofidio conceived the idea for the play, which was
inspired by two real but incredible stories, and also designed the
elaborate mediatheque that produces its mise en scene. The script,
by Jessica Chalmers, and the set could not exist without each
other. The set is rigorously architectural in the relationship of
its parts to the whole. But without the actors and the theatrical
format, the production would lack the immediacy of real-life time
and real-time life. And without the sets, the script would be
annoyingly schematic.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Miller initially thought the set of ``Death of a
Salesman'' should resemble a man's head because he envisioned the
action taking place in the mind of Willie Loman. I could see ``Jet
Lag'' rechristened ``Death of a Sailsman'': its central figure is a
man who may or may not be a sailor who perishes at sea.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jet Lag,'' the sea becomes a metaphor for what Manuel
Castels, the urban theorist, calls the electronic ``space of
flows,'' the communications network that keeps capital constantly
on the move. We're supposed to be in the age of cybernetics, a term
adopted from the Greek word for helmsman. The hope was that
computers and other electronic media would enable us to be captains
of our own ships. ``Jet Lag'' sends the dystopian message that we
are all captive passengers on a ship drifting rudderless across the
techno-environment we have made.
</P>
<P>
   New York has cultural bipolar disorder. Things are either very
lethargic and inert, or so speeded up that we cannot relax with
them for more than five minutes. But a good piece of architecture
can create a space between these extremes. One can linger there a
while without fear of being embalmed.
</P>
<P>
   The Seagram Building is such a place. For more than 40 years, it
has provided a seat of grace in Midtown Manhattan. The Four Seasons
restaurant, on the second floor, has offered an ideal perch from
which to savor the essential qualities of Mies van der Rohe's
architecture: transparency, void space, refined structural
expression. Without creating a theme restaurant on the motif of the
International Style, the new Brasserie restaurant, two floors
below, offers a set of contemporary variations on these Miesian
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As might have been predicted, the big news about the Brasserie
is not the restaurant's design, superior as it is, but the public
reception of it. This is a moment when journalists get to call
Diller and Scofidio trendy and downtown. That's journalese for
``I'm afraid of being made a fool of.'' Or, ``There may be more
going on here, or less, than I have time to figure out.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, reception is a major theme in the Brasserie and
other Diller and Scofidio projects. All architects operate in a
kind of time lag between the conception of an idea and its
realization in social space. Think of it as similar to the
six-second taped delay sometimes used on radio call-in shows.
Diller and Scofidio translate this gap into visual and spatial
terms.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The site is a basement, but not just any cellar. It is pierced
by the steel structure of a building that may well be the world's
foremost example of modern structural expression. As Diller and
Scofidio see it, the basement represents the Miesian subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Seagram Building's engineers concealed the
subterranean structural contortions it took to support the
rationalist structure that rises from the street. The building's
physical structure is not visually expressed within the new
Brasserie. Rather, the design plays with the conceptual framework
of the Miesian aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to rationality, Diller and Scofidio give Mies a
surreal twist. Transparency, for instance, has given way to
translucency. Table tops of molded pale green resin allow glimpses
of the legs and the cantilevered braces that support them. They are
structural ghosts, dimly visible through hazy planes. Above the
bar, rows of wine bottles float behind a translucent white resin
wall. The treads of an incomparably elegant staircase, also
fashioned from green plastic, create the sensation of wading into
water one short step at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Video technology extends the Miesian concept of the wall as a
membrane between inside and outside. A surveillance camera
photographs patrons as they come through the revolving door. The
halting time-lapse images are projected from monitors behind the
bar. Another monitor, focused on the street, feeds live coverage to
a large monitor by the front desk.
</P>
<P>
   These elements are a scaled-down version of the original
concept, which called for projecting surveillance images of the
street onto large screens on either side of the entrance stair.
This idea played upon the notion that the Seagram Building presents
a mediated view of the world. The tinted glass and the cagelike
structure filtered the city through the Miesian aesthetic. Glass,
in other words, was a medium, not just a material. Diller and
Scofidio substitute video for plate glass.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the scaled-down version dilutes the concept's
impact. But it remains strong enough to create the atmosphere of
life in a mediated world. At the reception desk, nice young women
greet guests. On the video monitors, reception is rendered into
perception: the cold eye of the surveillance camera jostles against
the hostess' accommodating smile.
</P>
<P>
   There's clear glass in the new Brasserie, too, but, in another
flip on Mies, here it is used structurally. In the smaller of the
restaurant's two dining rooms, tilted glass panels support a long
banquette.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has none of the luxurious amplitude of the Four
Seasons, the Brasserie is spatially richer. This is mainly because
of the visibility of the entrance stair from most of the tables.
The architects also enlarge the sense of open space by playing with
enclosure. This is most evident in the treatment of the
semi-enclosed booths, with tilted dividers that extend from floor
to ceiling, and in the counterpoint between the large and small
dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But it also extends to the restrooms. A single sink, of red
molded resin, runs through a slot in the wall dividing the men's
and women's rooms. Besides creating surprise aural effects, the
arrangement highlights the permeability of the membrane between
public and private space.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Danto coined the term ``the transformation of the
commonplace'' to describe how artists like Duchamp and Warhol gave
ordinary objects the aura of art. William Burroughs coined the
phrase ``the naked lunch'' to describe a Zenlike moment of
heightened awareness when a morsel of food on the end of a fork
comes into sharp mental focus. It holds oceanic meaning and no
meaning. The moment is one of possibility. We're not on autopilot.
We're not held in the grip of memory or of fantasy about the
future, not trapped between loss and desire.
</P>
<P>
   Diller and Scofidio's Brasserie is a place of heightened
awareness and social possibility. Can one transform lunch or dinner
into meaningful exchange? Is there space for listening as well as
talking, or just the polite drone of people assassinating each
other across tables set for two?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jet Lag'' and the Brasserie hark back to legendary ephemeral
projects from the early 20th century. I am thinking of the
``Triadic Ballet,'' staged at the Bauhaus by the painter Oskar
Schlemmer in 1922. And Cafe l'Aubette, a Strasbourg brasserie
designed in 1925 by the de Stijl architect Theo van Doesburg. Many
of us have tried to imagine what it was like to witness these
epochal works. But would we have recognized their importance if we
had been around at the time? Do we recognize their equivalents
today? Are we willing to show up for our own time?
</P>
<P>
   Being present is a moral as well as an artistic issue. We are
responsible for knowing our place in history. Schlemmer, van
Doesburg and Mies were not merely creating formal abstractions.
Their projects were manifestos. They invited the public, and
themselves, to sample the naked lunch of the early 20th century.
Diller and Scofidio are extending that invitation today. The food
is divine.

BIAS FOUND IN TRANSFERRING MINORITY YOUTHS TO ADULT COURTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minority youths are more than twice as likely as their white
counterparts to be transferred out of California's juvenile justice
system and tried as adults, according to a study made public
Wednesday by the Justice Policy Institute, a criminal-justice
research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The imbalances this study reveals are stark, vast and deeply
disturbing,'' said Dan Macallair, the associate director of the
institute who is a co-author of the study. ``Discrimination against
kids of color accumulates at every stage of the justice system and
skyrockets when juveniles are tried as adults. California has a
double standard: throw kids of color behind bars, but rehabilitate
white kids who commit comparable crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``The Color of Justice,'' is believed to be the first
to examine which youthful offenders are being transferred into the
adult court system under recent laws making it easier to try
juveniles as adults. Although the study is based entirely on
California data, criminal justice experts say the issue is a
national one.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have laws allowing juveniles to be tried as
adults. Over the last six years, as part of a move to get tougher
on youthful offenders, 43 states have passed laws making it easier
to transfer children charged with crimes to adult courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial bias anywhere in the legal system is not a surprise,''
said Jeffrey Fagan, director of Columbia University's Center for
Violence Research and Prevention. ``But we don't know much about
who is getting transferred under the new laws because most states
have multiple pathways to transfer kids, so it's very difficult to
study. California is among the few states that are relatively easy
to examine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan added that ``Juvenile transfers are particularly important
because the consequences of moving a kid to the adult system are so
severe, bringing greater exposure to violence and greater
probability of re-arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the new study found, about 12 percent of the
slightly more than 24,000 juveniles arrested for felonies in 1996
were white, 56 percent were Hispanic, 25 percent were black and 6
percent were Asian. But the proportion of those tried as adults was
quite different: Of the 561 cases transferred to adult court, only
5 percent were white, 6 percent were Asian, 30 percent were black
and 59 percent were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County, which accounts for 40 percent of the
juvenile court cases transferred to California's adult courts, is
the only county in the state that keeps detailed records on
transfers. In examining the arrest categories of the county's
youthful offenders, the study found no evidence that the racial
disparity in transfer rates could be explained by a pattern of more
violent or more heinous crimes by minority youths than by white
youths.
</P>
<P>
   Once a minority youth enters the adult court system, the study
found, the racial disparities widen. At each step of the process,
the proportion of white youths drops while the proportion of
minority youths rises. Once transferred to the adult system, young
African-American offenders were 18.4 times more likely to be jailed
than were young white offenders, Hispanic youths were 7.3 times
more likely to be imprisoned than whites, and Asian youths were 4.5
times more likely, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at a time of heightened public awareness of racism in the
criminal justice system, it's shocking to find such huge
discrepancies in the way Latino and African-American kids are
treated,'' Beatriz Lopez-Flores of the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Education Fund said in a statement prepared for a news
conference Wednesday to announce the study and to press Gov. Gray
Davis of California to address the racial disparities.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the governor's office said Wednesday afternoon
that Davis had just received a report on the study and had not yet
had time to review it.
</P>
<P>
   Research cited in the study suggest that minority youths are
overrepresented at every stage of the justice system. In Texas, for
example, one study found that minorities made up half the state's
youth population but 80 percent of its juveniles in correctional
institutions and 100 percent of the juveniles held in adult jails.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve raised two key interest rates
by a quarter of a percentage point each on Wednesday and signaled
that further rate increases would probably be needed to keep the
persistently strong economy from generating inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The move, the fourth rate increase since June, was in line with
what most economists and investors had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets took the announcement in stride. Stocks ended
mixed, while bond prices rose, in part because the Treasury
Department announced a plan to buy back some of the government's
long-term debt as part of an effort to deal with growing budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank allowed the economy to expand for the last
several years at rates well above what conventional wisdom once
thought could be sustained without igniting inflation, betting that
huge investments in technology would allow companies to absorb cost
increases without raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Fed discovered that the United States is
less susceptible to an upward spiral in wages and prices than
almost anyone previously believed, even with unemployment at its
current level of 4.1 percent, a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   But in raising rates Wednesday, the Fed and its chairman, Alan
Greenspan, made clear once more that the central bank's growth
experiment had its limits. Wednesday's message was that the Fed was
increasingly reverting to its traditional posture of stamping out
any inflationary pressures before they could endanger an expansion
that on Tuesday became the longest on record.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate took up Greenspan's nomination to a fourth term
Wednesday. Both parties said they expected an overwhelming vote in
his favor on Thursday, reflecting the broad consensus that he has
guided the economy skillfully for more than 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In increasing its benchmark federal funds target rate on
overnight loans among banks by a quarter point Wednesday, to 5.75
percent, the central bank pushed rates above where they had been in
mid-1998, when the Fed cut rates three times to help bring the
global financial crisis under control. The Fed also raised its
discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system by
a quarter point Wednesday, to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``By tightening, the Fed signaled carefully to the markets its
intention of keeping inflation from accelerating,'' said Mickey D.
Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York. ``It
recognizes that stable inflation is the key ingredient to economic
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   By raising its official short-term rates, the Fed puts upward
pressure on rates paid for everything from credit cards and
mortgages to business loans. Banks immediately said Wednesday that
they would raise their prime lending rates.

<P>
   Many longer term rates set directly or indirectly in the bond
market _ like those for mortgages and much of the borrowing done by
corporations _ have moved higher since the Fed began raising rates
last year. But analysts said the impact of long-term bond rates on
the economy could be clouded somewhat by the Treasury Department's
debt buyback plan.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee
sent a clear signal that Wednesday's increase was not likely to be
the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee remains concerned that over time increases in
demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even
after taking account of the pronounced rise in productivity
growth,'' the statement said, alluding to what Fed officials view
as the most basic of economic imbalances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would
undermine the economy's record economic expansion,'' the committee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the Fed was likely to raise rates by at least
another half a percentage point in coming months, hoping to temper
demand by making borrowing more expensive and taking some steam out
of the stock market. The Fed's next meeting is March 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more increase is probably in the bank, taking the funds
target to 6 percent,'' said Chris Varvares, an economist at
Macroeconomic Advisors, a consulting and forecasting firm in St.
Louis. ``From then on, it depends on a series of factors _ the
stock market, the underlying trend of demand and any inflation
surprises in either direction that might occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew in last year's fourth quarter by 5.8 percent,
well above anyone's estimate of its speed limit. And in a further
indication that last year's rate increases had not yet slowed the
economy much, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that new home
sales rose a healthy 4.5 percent in December despite higher
mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, inflationary pressures are no more than shadowy. By a
price measure included in calculation of the gross domestic
product, inflation rose at a 2 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, up from 1.1 percent in the prior three-month period. Yet
when volatile oil prices are excluded, the Consumer Price Index
rose 1.9 percent last year, down from 2.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong economy is not creating inflation,'' said Gary
Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``The
Fed, as it has been doing, is trying to stay ahead of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to keep inflation under control, the Fed is trying to
reduce demand for goods and services across the economy. There are
a variety of channels through which higher interest rates can make
that happen, from increasing unemployment to cooling off
interest-sensitive sectors like housing.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that one of the most important variables in
demand is the stock market, which is creating much of the wealth
that is allowing consumers to spend freely at auto dealers and
malls. If higher rates do not put a ceiling on stock prices, they
said, demand is likely to remain too strong for the Fed's tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a stock market correction doesn't happen, then consumer
spending remains very strong, to the point where a Fed funds target
of 6 percent would be insufficient to get the economy down to the
speed limit,'' Varvares said. ``If the stock market were to hold at
its recent peak, Fed funds would easily have to go to 7 percent to
elicit the slowing the Fed would need to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed might also need to push rates up more aggressively if
long-term bond rates continue their recent decline.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Fed officials are well aware that recessions
are often caused by the central bank raising interest rates a bit
too much in the pursuit of price stability, choking off growth.
Without firmer evidence that inflation is actually bubbling through
the economy, Greenspan is likely to stick to a cautious,
incremental approach to tightening policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they're not behind the curve and we don't have an
inflation problem outside of energy,'' Thayer said, ``I don't think
there's any urgency.''  &QL;

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Armed with a couple of practice rounds he
played with Tiger Woods over the weekend, baseball superstar Ken
Griffey Jr. felt he had enough data to make a qualified commentary
about his playing partner.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conclusion: The only person who can beat Woods these days is
Woods himself.
</P>
<P>
   So does the man feel that confident, too, as he tries to win his
sixth PGA Tour event in as many tries over the past two seasons?
</P>
<P>
   ``It (his confidence) is pretty high right now because,
obviously, I've had a lot of success lately,'' Woods said
Wednesday. ``More importantly, I know how to get it around when I'm
not playing that well. There are times when I didn't play that well
and I was able to score and get the round in under par somehow and
kind of hang in the tournament. And I was able to go on and win.''
</P>
<P>
   More distressing to the 179 other professionals who will take
part today in the first round of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am is
the fact that Woods is rested in addition to brimming with
confidence. He has had three weeks off after his season-opening win
in Maui, actually took a vacation and has been working on his game,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach is one of the tournaments that annually attracts a
marquee field, even though the weather usually is more suitable for
mud wrestling than for golf. So far this week, the Monterey
Peninsula has dried out from eight inches of rain last week. But
sunshine Tuesday and Wednesday is expected to give way to the fog,
gloom and showers typical of this time of year at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, other major stars of the PGA Tour, and other sports
celebrities and entertainment stars will tee up today at Poppy
Hills Golf Course, then switch to Spyglass Hill before playing
Saturday and Sunday at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, however, will have their eyes peeled for Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe what he's done,'' said Sergio Garcia, who
is making his first appearance at the Pebble Beach tournament.
``There are so many great players now, and he's done so well. I
don't know who will be the guy to step in front of him and stop
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different when Tiger is in the field. For me, it improves
my game. I know I have to play a little better, maybe, than in the
other tournaments if I'm going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, like many players, spent most of his practice time
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at Pebble Beach, hoping to bone up
not only for the weekend but for the U.S. Open, which will be
contested at Pebble Beach in June.
</P>
<P>
   That course, with thicker rough and faster greens, will be
different from the one the players will see this week. But in some
ways, the seaside links already are taking on the look of a U.S.
Open, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different than I have ever seen it with the rough on a
lot of holes,'' he said. ``And they have taken some of the landing
areas and moved them a little bit. Some of the holes that were
traditionally slight doglegs are now more of a dogleg. It's typical
U.S. Open holes that they are starting to prepare for already.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, it's all about Woods and the pursuit of his
sixth consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   To rehash, it started with the NEC Championship in Akron, Ohio,
on Aug. 29. Since then, every official PGA Tour event that Woods
has played, he has won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning at Pebble, that would mean a lot,'' he said.
``Especially since I've been close here before, in '97 (losing by a
stroke to Mark O'Meara). I have played good on the weekends. I just
need to get off to a better start than I have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods hasn't been far off the pace in any of the tournaments in
his winning streak. He's usually hovering around the lead after the
first round or two, then takes charge on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he'll try to become the first person to win six
events without a loss since Ben Hogan did it in 1948. Byron Nelson,
whose legendary streak of 11 in a row came in 1945, is the only
person to win more than six consecutive.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Woods doesn't necessarily see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't really consider it six, because it's over two
seasons,'' he said. ``And people forget that I played three
tournaments in between the two regular seasons (winning twice and
losing once). I guess that counts for something. But I don't know
if it's six or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just counting that I have won this year once and am trying
to win two in a row.''

 &HT;    Bush confident of win in S.C.
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Chin up in defeat, heading to the next
battle, Texas Gov. George W. Bush stood between rows of the Miami
Air charter about to head south and faced a question based on his
New Hampshire campaign slogan. Governor, what was the ``reason for
freezin'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Test of character,'' Bush said in Manchester, N.H., on the
morning after a crushing loss to Arizona Sen. John McCain in the
presidential primary there.
</P>
<P>
   Making the best of his first political loss since a 1978
congressional race, Bush is confident he is still on the road to
the White House. He sees nothing but good things in South Carolina,
where the Feb. 19 primary will be the next big battle with McCain,
who is skipping next Tuesday's Delaware contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also acknowledged that he needs to refine his message to
counter McCain's surprisingly strong victory in New Hampshire. The
slightly re-tooled Bush strategy will try to package McCain as the
rarest of political species _ a liberal Republican who advocates a
smaller tax cut than Bush _ and a senator who has not earned his
colleagues' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Also on tap is an effort to show that Bush, a president's son,
is the outsider, and McCain, a Senate committee chairman who has
built his message on anti-Washington sentiment, is the insider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clear that one of the things is he did a fine job
of making himself look like the outsider. He is the Washington,
D.C., person,'' Bush said. ``I've got to do a better job of
defining that. He is the man who is the head of the committee. He
is the person who interests come to and make their claim in his
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to lean heavily on the endorsements of 35 of McCain's
GOP colleagues in the Senate. Bush sees it as certification that he
is the better man for the job rather than counterproductive to his
effort to cast himself as the outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it says is these men and women have taken a look and
decided that I should be the president,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said the New Hampshire outcome won't affect
his plans to call on his famous mom and dad for an occasional
appearance. George and Barbara Bush joined their son at a Saturday
event when polls showed the race much tighter than it wound up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people expect me to distance myself from my family, they've
got the wrong candidate. My family is a part of me,'' Bush said.
Bush's optimism is based on polls that show him with a comfortable
lead (20 percentage points according to a Time-CNN poll last week),
an organization that makes him the candidate of the GOP machine and
with as much money as he needs. They are the same components he
counted on in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   So why will it add up to a different outcome?
</P>
<P>
   ``Different people, different part of the country,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore that, Bush touted his conservative
credentials Wednesday, picking up the endorsement of Dan Quayle, a
conservative who served as former President Bush's vice president;
appearing at a fundamentalist Christian college; and running ads
that tout his religious faith and opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle dropped his presidential bid last year after a dismal
showing at the Iowa straw poll, which Bush won. Back then, Quayle
criticized the GOP's apparent coronation of Bush and suggested that
the Texas governor was unqualified for the top job. But now, Quayle
says ``of all the candidates running, I can tell you that Governor
Bush is the most prepared to be president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bush attended a rally at Bob Jones University, where he
spoke to a crowd of 6,500, including students for whom attendance
was mandatory. The college is a popular stop for Republicans
seeking the support of South Carolina conservatives. The university
bans interracial dating and marriage, but now admits black students
after losing its tax-exempt status in the 1970s for refusing to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, at a news conference, Bush said he disagreed
with the school's opposition to interracial relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Former South Carolina Gov. David Beasley, a Bush backer, noted
that many candidates, including Democrats, have spoken at the
school. McCain and GOP candidates Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes also
are planning appearances at Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is running radio ads touting his signing of the Texas law
requiring parents to be notified before their minor daughters can
get an abortion. In another ad, Bush tells voters that ``Faith
changed my life.'' Neither ad ran in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight out of New Hampshire, Bush said he sees little
chance of a repeat of the New Hampshire race in which independents,
free to vote in either primary, did him in. He refused to credit
McCain's win to some kind of ``movement of independents'' that will
sweep the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a movement of New Hampshire independents. These folks
in New Hampshire, they've had a history of upsetting
</P>
<P>
   front-runners. I don't want to take anything away from John,''
Bush said. ``He ran a very good race. But New Hampshire
independents ... they may be a little different from Texas
independents or South Carolina independents.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   RUMTEK, India _ Deshin Shekpa was born during the year of the
male wood mouse (1384), and it is said he could be heard chanting a
mantra and reciting the alphabet while still inside his mother's
womb. At the moment of his birth, he boldly proclaimed himself to
be the fifth incarnation of the Karmapa, one of Tibetan Buddhism's
holiest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient texts describe the fifth Karmapa as a conjurer of
miracles, able to light the clouds with iridescent colors and
summon flowers to fall from the sky. But his many teachings, while
a source of soothing wisdom, also included a dark prophecy:
centuries in the distance, during the time of his own 16th and 17th
incarnations, the demonic power of ``perverse aspirations'' would
bring the entire Karmapa lineage close to destruction.
</P>
<P>
   This vision seems to have been eerily prescient, for now, as the
world enters the Tibetan year of the male iron dragon on Feb. 5 ,
there is not one claimant to the title of Karmapa but two, both of
them teen-aged boys whose mentors find the aspirations of the other
wickedly perverse.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, one of those boys, 14-year-old Ugyen Trinley Dorje,
fled Chinese-controlled Tibet, enduring an overland journey across
the snowbound Himalayas. On Jan. 5, he arrived in Dharamsala, the
picturesque Indian hill station that is home to the Tibetan
government-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
   His sudden presence, while a ticklish matter between India and
China, which have been working to overcome long-strained relations,
has been a cause for rejoicing among most Tibetans here. The
Karmapa is usually considered the third most revered figure in
Tibetan Buddhism, after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, and
the newly arrived boy had the unusual distinction of having been
endorsed as the 17th incarnation by both the Dalai Lama and the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been significantly less joy in New Delhi, home to
a rival faction that insists it is the one with the genuine
Karmapa. Shamar Rinpoche, a high lama also known as the Shamarpa,
has been championing this second contender since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is not only the leadership of one of the oldest orders
of Tibetan Buddhism but one of its richest monasteries as well. And
that has kept the Shamarpa desperately busy denouncing the newly
arrived teen-ager and his patrons as perpetrators of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddha would not be laughing right now,'' the Shamarpa said.
``This is all about politics. It's a story filled with many
traitors and betrayals.''
</P>
<P>
   Such intrigue is hardly uncommon to the Buddhism of Tibet,
which, before the Chinese occupation in the 1950s, was a theocratic
state where spiritual passions often bumped up against worldly
ambitions. The highest lamas are believed to be so spiritually
advanced that while their physical form may perish, their superior
consciousness lives on in other bodies and can be recognized. Rival
disciples sometimes disagree about which child has become the new
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a rare precaution against such discord, the Karmapa often
leaves a ``prediction letter'' with clues about where to find his
next incarnation. This guiding document, however, sometimes can be
hard to locate and stubbornly cryptic once found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Karmapa dispute is sort of a medieval tragicomedy,'' said
Tsering Shakya, a London-based scholar who has written a history of
modern Tibet. ``Who really knows who the Karmapa is? On one hand,
there are these arguments about dreams and prophecies. On the
other, there are the highly rational matters of controlling money
and property.''
</P>
<P>
   There is international politics as well. The 14-year-old's
escape from Tibet's historic Tsurphu Monastery is an embarrassment
for China. In 1992, government officials had permitted the boy's
enthronement as the 17th Karmapa, using him as a showpiece for a
purported revival of religious tolerance. Chinese officials
explained his departure by saying he was visiting India to fetch
belongings of the 16th Karmapa and warned India against granting
him political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Tibetan authorities in Dharamsala are prudently
keeping the teen-ager in seclusion as Indian and Chinese diplomats
attend to the fractious matter of his status.
</P>
<P>
   If he is allowed to stay, his eventual home is likely to be here
in the village of Rumtek, where the 16th Karmapa, who fled Tibet in
1959, built a lavish monastery in the Himalayan state of Sikkim,
which has since been annexed by India.
</P>
<P>
   The Rumtek monastery has been this conflict's main battlefield,
a place where religious gatherings have turned into brawls. The
buildings are multilayered, with tiers of white, yellow and
oxblood. The Karmapa's throne is centered in a grand assembly hall,
where ornate wooden casements hold 1,000 Buddha statuettes and
hundreds of ancient manuscripts. Stored in a locked room are other
treasured relics, most importantly the bejeweled black hat that has
been worn by every Karmapa for 600 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the monastery's monks were ecstatic. Some recently
had been to Dharamsala and seen the 14-year-old and were speaking
of his aura, his calm and the ways he reminded them of his previous
incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ugyen Jigme, 62, wept, overcome with wonderment. He had been
the 16th Karmapa's personal physician. And now he had met the boy.
``I could tell he knew everything about me,'' he said. ``He still
has the same gestures, the same laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, however, the mood was dour, the monks
disconsolate.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, dozens of them _ they put their number at 115 _
have been outcasts, followers of the less-acknowledged Karmapa.
Many of them live in shacks, tents and converted animal pens. Their
small prayer hall has walls of corrugated metal and a floor of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Lungtok Dawa had lived in the Rumtek monastery for most of his
life _ and claims to have been beaten up for his rebellious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will come a day when the rightful Karmapa will live in
the monastery and wear the black hat,'' he said mournfully. ``But I
don't know when this will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Karmapa left his physical shell in 1981, succumbing to
cancer in a hospital near Chicago. His dead body, many followers
believe, maintained its normal temperature for three days as if in
gentle meditation. He was cremated in Rumtek, and when a charred
part of the remains fell from the pyre, it was presumed to be the
Karmapa's heart and has been preserved in a golden shrine in the
monastery.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for locating the next incarnation fell to
four young regents, themselves incarnate lamas with titles that go
back hundreds of years. They had been the 16th Karmapa's chief
disciples, and two of them _ the 12th Tai Situpa and the 13th
Shamarpa _ were rivals for the position of second in the hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, the Tai Situpas had been emergent while the
Shamapas fell into disrepute. The 10th Shamarpa had been accused of
starting a war between Tibet and Nepal, and, as punishment, his
reincarnation as a high lama was forbidden. During the next 150
years, his embodiments lived in obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-LAMA-RIVALS-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; RUMTEK, India: in obscurity. &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Karmapa himself resurrected the position. He may have
had other reasons, but the boy identified as the 13th Shamarpa was
also his nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Tashi Delsapa, the secretary for culture in Sikkim, has known
both the current Tai Situpa and Samarpa since they were children
and describes something like a sibling rivalry. ``Jealousies crept
in, and they involved mundane, not religious things,'' he said.
``There was a lot of money to control. Shamar, being a nephew, may
have thought that control of money and the monastery was his
inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa is the best-known figure among the Kagyupas, one of
the four main orders in Tibetan Buddhism _ and one with a wide
following across Asia and the West. Wild speculation is often made
about the sums controlled by the Karmapa Charitable Trust and
associated legal entities, but these estimates are largely
guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, both Tai Situpa and the Shamarpa spent much of
their time abroad. No one had been able to find any memento with
the deceased Karmapa's cryptic clues, let alone his incarnation.
The faithful were frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at an extraordinary meeting of the regents in 1992, Tai
Situpa announced he had found the guiding missive. To the
astonishment of some, he said he had unwittingly worn the vital
document for 11 years. It was folded inside a talisman attached to
a string, a gift from the 16th Karmapa.
</P>
<P>
   One translation of the letter reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``From here to the north in the east of the land of snow
</P>
<P>
   Is a country where divine thunder spontaneously blazes
</P>
<P>
   In a beautiful nomad's place with the sign of a cow
</P>
<P>
   The method is Dondrup and the wisdom is Lolaga
</P>
<P>
   Born in the year of the one used for the earth
</P>
<P>
   With the miraculous, far-reaching sound of the white one
</P>
<P>
   This is the one known as Karmapa.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Tai Situpa reported that a search party in
Tibet had found the appropriate lad, the son of yak-tending nomads,
Karma Dondrup and his wife, Loga. Wondrous song birds had
celebrated the child's birth and rainbows had hovered above the
family's tent. The boy's greatness was apparent. He had entered a
monastery at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   The news was sent to the Dalai Lama, who, while a member of a
different religious order, is the temporal head of the government
in exile and generally considered the spiritual leader of Tibetan
Buddhism. He added his approval.
</P>
<P>
   After so much delay, the velocity of these blissful tidings was
both dizzying and dismaying for the Shamarpa. From the start, he
says, he considered the prediction letter an obvious forgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted forensic testing done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bewilderment afflicted many monks in Rumtek. One of the four
regents had died in a automobile accident, and of the three who
remained, two were telling them of a glorious discovery, while the
other warned of a venal conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, 1992, Tai Situpa addressed a crowd that had come to
the monastery to hear of the Karmapa's manifestation. Near the end
of the talk, the Shamarpa arrived unexpectedly with a small escort
of Indian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Amid so much tension, he said, the army had provided him
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of rifle-toting men angered many in the
courtyard. A group of women began to beat on the soldiers,
witnesses said. A man with an iron rod tried to hit the Shamarpa. A
microphone fell to the ground, sounding like a gunshot. People
scrambled. Several were injured in the shoving. There were
fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned monks fell to their knees and fingered their prayer
beads.
</P>
<P>
   During the following year, the monks of Rumtek were split, some
accepting the Karmapa, some not. Woefully, along the pathway to
human perfection was an active rumor mill. Dissenters were hearing
that thugs would be sent to evict them.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, 1993, a second brawl broke out, far worse than the
first. Versions of what occurred are as different as inner peace
and outer space. What is certain is that the split within the
monastery's walls had become irreparable. Dozens of monks slept in
the woods that night _ or in a hospital or in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Shamapa later provided them shelter. And, to their
jubilation, within months, he rewarded their loyalty by sharing a
stupendous revelation: a sagelike, clairvoyant boy born in 1983 was
newly arrived from Tibet _ the bona fide Karmapa.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Shamarpa would later say, he had secretly known of
this remarkable child for eight years _ and had been sending
discrete emissaries to observe him, weighing the evidence and
interpreting his own pertinent dreams to be absolutely sure.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1994, the alternative Karmapa _ Trinley Thaye Dorje _
was enthroned in New Delhi, where, predictably enough, yet another
scuffle broke out.
</P>
<P>
   The Shamarpa has since tried to assert his will through
lawsuits. Several times, he also proposed a compromise solution to
this overabundance of Karmapas. Some enlightened beings have
reincarnated into more than one body, and the Shamarpa has been
willing to allow that one Karmapa could reign within the strictures
of Communist China while the other held sway in India.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, that had been the Shamarpa's edge. His Karmapa
was fully mobile _ indeed, the youth is currently among disciples
in Europe _ while the other side's was not. But if India allows the
recently escaped 14-year-old to stay, that advantage is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now furiously on the attack, the Shamarpa has been alleging that
Tai Situpa and the Chinese are in league, and that the boy intends
to sneak back to Tibet with the treasures of the Rumtek monastery.
``The rumor in Katmandu is that when Karmapa leaves, they'll sell
the big ruby pin from the black hat in Hong Kong for $28 million,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called ``Trojan Horse theory'' is taken seriously in
India, where suspicions of China, which does not recognize India's
control of Sikkim, are always ample. Seclusion has not kept the
newly arrived Karmapa from being intensively questioned by Indian
intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tai Situpa, who has a monastery near Dharamsala,
has been unwilling _ or unable _ to respond to the Shamarpa's
attacks. He was once banned from India for unspecified
``anti-Indian activities,'' and his permission to return in 1998
was conditioned on avoiding ``the issue of succession of Karmapa.''
</P>
<P>
   Truly, the ``agitation and fighting'' forecast in Deshin
Shekpa's 600-year-old prophecy is at hand. He spoke of the Buddha's
teachings falling into decline as evilness ``comes into fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   But the karmic wheel keeps turning. Over time, the prophecy
said, the Dharma _ Buddha's teachings _ will triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Resilient wisdom will bring back the peace of ``swift
blessings.''
</P>

3-HOUR TALK WITH PUTIN LEAVES ALBRIGHT ENCOURAGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After a month of what she called ``psychobabble'' from
people trying to decipher Russia's new leader, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright met Acting President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday
on his turf and said she was taken with his ``can-do approach'' and
his lack of dogma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him a very well-informed person, a good interlocutor,
obviously a Russian patriot who seeks a normal position with the
West,'' she said of Putin, who also caught her attention by
abandoning note cards that his aides had prepared for him.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour meeting, in Putin's elegantly refurbished white
and green office in the Kremlin, was the first lengthy session that
a high-ranking Clinton administration official has had with the
acting president since he replaced Boris Yeltsin, who resigned on
New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   While it seemed that Albright found the contrast between the
erratic Yeltsin and the crisp Putin refreshing, the meeting, which
ran more than double the time expected, did not produce any
breakthroughs in the recently troubled relationship between
Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya remained an irritant between the two, with
Putin arguing that Russia had to take military action against the
``terrorists'' in the republic, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not mince words, either of us, on Chechnya,'' Albright
told reporters. ``I said to him what I said publicly _ that he's
riding a tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I do not think we are any closer to a political
solution in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she proposed that an international team of experts
be allowed to visit Chechnya to determine the needs of people who
have been displaced by the fighting and stranded with little heat
or shelter. ``He seemed receptive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Putin did not reject a proposal that foreign
journalists be given accreditation to cover the war, she said. ``He
seemed to take that on board,'' she said. ``We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   On arms control, Albright said she was encouraged that Putin
seemed open to the Clinton administration's push to modify the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In public, Russian officials have been defiant in rejecting any
changes to the treaty. Earlier this week, Putin alluded to
Washington's promoting the ``destruction'' of the treaty, the key
arms control agreement of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The administration contends that the threat of long range
missiles from nations like North Korea raises the need for a
limited national missile defense system, which could be deployed
only with changes to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Albright said Putin showed flexibility on the
subject. ``He seemed to have an understanding of the new threats
and how to deal with them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating a little on Albright's account, a senior
administration official said that Putin ``did not deny the new
threat.'' Putin suggested that the United States and Russia should
together develop a ``common assessment'' of the threat while at the
same time ``maintaining the fundamental principles of the ABM
treaty,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he agreed with us,'' the official said. ``But
his approach was, `Let's see if we can accomplish something here.'
It's encouraging when a Russian leader adopts flexibility on a
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin told Albright that the new makeup of the Russian
Parliament since the December elections made it more plausible that
the second strategic arms reduction treaty would be ratified. Start
II, which mandated a reduction in warheads deployed by each side,
was signed by the United States and Russia in 1993 but has
languished in Parliament since. One test of Putin's leadership,
administration officials have said, will be whether he follows
through on his pledge to see that the treaty is ratified.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in January, Albright said she believed, based on
Putin's activities as deputy mayor of St. Petersburg and then in
the Yeltsin administration, that the acting president was ``one of
the leading reformers'' in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on Russia have disputed this, but Albright appeared
to be confident of her view after Wednesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Aides who accompanied her said Putin had stressed the need for
strengthening the legal system so that the economy could function
properly. He understood the need for new bankruptcy laws and for
closing loopholes in the tax code, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Yeltsin, Putin was attentive to details, listened and
took notes, said aides of Albright who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And Albright said she also found Putin attentive and patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in lots of meetings where you could just exchange
your cards,'' she said of the note cards that diplomats often rely
on and read from during official meetings like the one Wednesday.
Instead, Putin made a joke by holding up the stack of cards that
had been given to him but that he did not need.
</P>
<P>
   But for the secretary, the real assessments were yet to come.
``What is important is to judge him by what he does,'' she said.

 &HT;    Congress to question CDC on diverted funds
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna and Julia Malone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A House committee will question officials from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a hearing next week
to determine whether the agency inappropriately redirected funds
earmarked by Congress for hantavirus research.
</P>
<P>
   In an article Wednesday, the Washington Post claimed that CDC
officials diverted $1 million of $7.5 million appropriated for
research into a previously unknown strain of hantavirus, an
organism that has caused 97 deaths since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In response, CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan said in an interview
Wednesday that the information on hantavirus funding was drawn from
the same inspector general's audit that revealed, in May 1999, that
funding intended for the study of chronic fatigue syndrome had been
spent partly on other disease research needs. The audit was
requested by CDC, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The misdirection of hantavirus funds was already disclosed by
CDC and is being corrected, Koplan said. ``As CDC's director, I
apologized to Congress for any errors in CDC's reporting of budget
line items and outlined actions that CDC is putting in place to
ensure appropriate disclosure regarding its use of funds,'' Koplan
said. ``CDC immediately set about to improve budget control
systems, and these changes are being made agencywide.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Porter (R-Ill.), chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee that funds CDC, countered that CDC has
not reformed its budget practices and said he would order Koplan
and other CDC employees to appear at a congressional hearing Feb.
9.
</P>
<P>
   Koplan said CDC faces ``potentially conflicting
responsibilities'' when significant public health problems
requiring immediate response arise after the year's budget has been
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this instance, we felt that all the needs for hantavirus
were being met, but we were being challenged by other public health
threats occurring around the world and potentially threatening the
United States _ Ebola virus, Lassa hemorrhagic fever, Nipah virus
in Malaysia _ that demanded our immediate attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always had very good support from Congress for public
health in general and CDC in particular. The error we have made is
in getting back to them quickly enough to say, `We have had this
particular problem with Ebola or Nipah, and this is how we have
supported our investigations,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After the federal audit was completed, CDC commissioned a
private-sector auditing firm to review its fiscal 1999 budgeting.
``They gave us a clean bill of health,'' said Koplan, who declined
to identify the firm. ``This should be further evidence that we are
sincerely intent on being open and communicative and putting our
budget control process in order.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Porter said CDC had ``lied to
Congress'' on the chronic fatigue syndrome research and had
``apparently'' done so again in the case of hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
   ``How extensive is this within this agency?'' he asked. ``We
need to get to the bottom of this. This is a serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Alwyn Cassil, spokeswoman for the inspector
general at the Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed
that the budgeting cited by the Post was uncovered in supporting
documents from last year's audit. ``Ultimately, the agency is
responsible for spending the money, within the parameters of the
law, according to their best management decisions,'' she said.
``They do have the the authority to redirect the funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have complained less about money going to other
programs than about misrepresentation of how it was spent.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, CDC has sent Congress its budget justifications,
which report spending on hantavirus research for the previous year.
Porter said the discrepancy could involve millions of dollars since
1993, when Congress first recommended that funds be spent on this
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is not so much that they spent the money elsewhere
but that they misled Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not in the least concerned if the money was spent on
other research, because that's at the discretion of the CDC. What I
am concerned about is that we have been told and, in fact,
repeatedly told that it was spent on hantavirus research, when
apparently it was not. That we consider to be lying to Congress, if
it's true. And that concerns us very deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter directed blame for the misrepresentations not at Koplan
but at officials conducting the research. ``Dr. Koplan made
extensive efforts and made changes so that it would not happen
again'' after the chronic fatigue syndrome controversy arose last
May, Porter said. But, he stressed, the problem has reappeared in
the most recent budget justification from CDC, ``apparently,
allegedly, telling us that they spent money in a way that they did
not'' on hantavirus.

PROBLEMS WITH STABILIZERS ARE RARE, BUT DO HAPPEN

<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ As he attempted to level off at a cruising
altitude of 37,000 feet on a flight from St. Louis to Seattle,
Capt. Dan Gellert's Boeing 727's stabilizer suddenly jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to use trim controls to adjust the flight surface on the
tail of the jet, the pilot had no control over whether the nose of
the jet pitched up or down.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of in-flight emergency that the crew of Alaska
Airlines Flight 261 apparently experienced minutes before their jet
crashed into the Pacific Ocean Monday, killing all 88 people
aboard, including nearly 50 from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska crew reported a jammed stabilizer on the MD-83
jetliner as they struggled to maintain control while trying to make
an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Eastern Airlines jet that Gellert was
piloting back in the early 1980s, the plane had been in climb
configuration when the stabilizer jammed, and Gellert was unable to
``trim'' the plane for level flight.
</P>
<P>
   So the jet continued to climb, despite Gellert's best effort to
level off. The 727 reached 39,200 feet, well above the maximum
altitude that pilots are supposed to fly the 727.
</P>
<P>
   With options running out, Gellert cut power to the 727's three
engines. The plane's attitude changed and it began a slow descent
to about 29,000 feet, where the stabilizer trim suddenly started
working again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the trim, we might have fallen out of the sky,''
Gellert said in an interview. ``We would have had a tough time.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems with stabilizers are rare, according to aviation safety
experts. But they do happen, and they have occurred before on the
MD-80, the kind of plane that crashed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   John Thom, Boeing's MD-80 spokesman in Long Beach, Calif., where
the last MD-80 series jet recently rolled off the assembly line,
said he is not aware of any stabilizer problems with the plane.
</P>
<P>
   But records show that in April 1991, both the primary and
alternate stabilizer motors jammed on an American Airlines MD-80
during a climb. Although the stabilizer started working again after
a few minutes, the plane made an emergency landing in Houston,
where part of the trim system was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer trim system of the MD-80 series jets is operated
by a pair of switches on the control columns for both the pilot and
first officer. These are sometimes called ``pickle switches.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot in command would push the switch one way to trim the
plane for the nose to go up, and the other way to trim the plane
for the nose to go down.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible the stabilizer on Flight 261 jammed in the down
trim position, Gellert said. The plane had been flying at 31,000
feet and suddenly dropped to 26,000 feet before the pilots notified
air traffic controllers they had a problem controlling the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left altitude without getting clearance, which means they
must have had a serious problem and descended about 5,000 feet out
of control,'' Gellert said. ``You would not descend without getting
clearance unless you have a serious emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two systems on the MD-80 to control the trim. One is
used manually by the pilots, the other is used by the autopilot.
The primary system is used by the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   If the pickle switch malfunctions, the MD-80's trim can also be
controlled by using what looks like a suitcase handle near the
right knee of the captain, said Gellert.
</P>
<P>
   There have been occasions when the stabilizer will move without
inputs from the pilot even though the plane is not on autopilot.
This is known as a ``runaway'' stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The primary trim system can be immediately shut off by pulling a
switch in the cockpit, Gellert said. If the plane is on autopilot
and the trim system maulfunctions, the autopilot shuts off and a
warning sounds in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   A plane is much more difficult to control when the stabilizer is
jammed and the trim system is not working. Gellert said pilots will
sometimes do what is called a ``controllability test'' to make sure
they will be able to land the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of Flight 261 may have been doing this when they
advised air traffic controllers that they wanted to change the
configuration of the plane and needed to get down to 10,000 feet.
NTSB investigators said changing the plane's configuration is pilot
talk for doing things you would need to do for landing, such as
reducing engine power and putting down the flaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get too close to the ground before you find
out how serious the controllability problems are prior to
landing,'' Gellert said.
</P>
<P>
   During such a test, it is possible that the nose of Flight 261
pitched sharply down and the crew was unable to recover using just
the elevators, Gellert said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one eyewitness reported seeing the plane in a steep
dive as it hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   If time allowed, one way the pilots of Flight 261 could have
changed the plane's balance would have been to order passengers in
the front of the plane to move to the rear, Gellert said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that happened won't be learned until the plane's two
black boxes are recovered. One of those boxes, the cockpit voice
recorder, would have captured sounds in the cockpit during the
final 30 minutes of flight, including any communication between the
pilot and first officer, or between the flight crew and the cabin
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Both black boxes on Flight 261 are on the bottom of the Pacific
in about 700 feet of water. Navy operations to recover those boxes
are under way.

   ALBANY, New York _ Acknowledging that Amadou Diallo was a victim
who did not deserve to die, a lawyer for one of the four police
officers on trial for firing 41 shots at him told the jury in
opening statements Wednesday that Diallo's own actions led to his
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that his parents miss him and have suffered
greatly,'' said Bennett M. Epstein, who represents Sean Carroll.
``I'm sure that to them, he was a saint. But he was a saint who
felt compelled, for reasons best known to him _ and we're going to
try to get into those reasons _ to avoid the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was acting suspiciously in the early hours of Feb. 4,
1999, the lawyer said, alternately peering out from the stoop of
his Bronx apartment building and retreating toward the door.
Approached by the plainclothes officers, Diallo turned and entered
the building, he said, and did not keep his hands in view.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had stopped, the whole thing would have ended
peacefully,'' Epstein said. Instead, he said, Diallo led the
officers ``into the no man's land that is every police officer's
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case about five good men,'' Epstein said, ``and one
of them is Amadou Diallo.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein's argument and those of the lawyers for the other
officers underscored the delicacy of the task they face in
justifying the officers' conduct while not going too far in trying
to vilify Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   An immigrant from West Africa, Diallo worked as a street peddler
in Lower Manhattan and was said to be an observant Muslim who had
never been in trouble with the law. He was unarmed the night of his
death, when he was hit by 19 of the 41 shots. The lawyers said the
officers thought he was reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief prosecutor, Eric Warner, said there was no
justification for the shooting. ``A human being should be able to
stand in the vestibule of his own home and not be shot to death,''
Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Diallo, 22, not a physically imposing man, worked 10 to
12 hours a day peddling videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of his life, Diallo took the subway home to the
Bronx about midnight and discussed a utility bill with one of his
roommates. ``Less than an hour later, he would be standing in the
cold clear night air in the vestibule of his home,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the four officers got out of their unmarked car, he said,
and, without giving any commands like ``Stop! Police! Don't move!''
fired at Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bullets hit Diallo as he was falling or ``actually
on the ground,'' Warner said. Carroll and Edward McMellon each
fired 16 shots, Kenneth Boss fired five times and Richard Murphy
fired four times, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the conscious decision to shoot at a man standing in
the confined space of the vestibule,'' Warner said. ``These four
defendants intended to kill him. They acted recklessly with a
depraved indifference to Amadou Diallo's life and the lives of the
people in the building.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense version differs on at least one major point. The
lawyers said the officers identified themselves, showed their
badges and gave Diallo an opportunity to stop.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Diallo doesn't listen to clear orders to stop,'' Epstein
said. Instead, he said, Diallo turned and ran for an inner door,
reached into his pocket and raised his hand holding a black object.
A wallet and a beeper were found near the body.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was moved to Albany after defense lawyers requested a
change of venue, asserting prejudicial pretrial publicity and that
in the Bronx, the potential jurors would be people with ``an
inherent distrust or even hatred of the police.''
</P>
<P>
   James Culleton, who represents Murphy, said the officers thought
Diallo was acting suspiciously when they happened to drive past his
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why he was acting that way I have no idea,'' Culleton said.
``A civilian witness will testify that he was acting suspicious,
peeking in and out of that vestibule.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brounstein, who represents Boss, said Diallo ``broke no
laws, he did nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy, not a crime,'' Brounstein added.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Worth, who represents McMellon, said the officers did
the only thing they could, based on their years of experience in
crime-ridden areas of New York. Even so, he said, ``There is no
doubt that Amadou Diallo did not deserve to die.''
</P>
<P>
   As the prosecution began presenting its case, the first witness
at the trial was Detective Joseph Flannino of the Police
Department's Crime Scene Unit. He said he arrived at the scene at
1:45 a.m, about an hour after the shooting. The lighting on the
street that night was adequate, he said, with two street lights
near Diallo's building. He said that from the curb, he had no
difficulty seeing Diallo's body lying in the vestibule of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   But on cross-examination by defense lawyers, Flannino conceded
that it would have been better if he had arrived at the scene
earlier so he could have helped to protect the crime scene, where
there were dozens of shell casings, sooner.

IN BEJING, HUMAN BILLBOARDS PEDAL BIKES TO PEDDLE ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ On a recent bitter-cold morning, the 15 teen-agers
suited up in neon-yellow warm-up jackets and matching baseball
caps, climbed on 15 identical mountain bikes and rode off in
formation onto the icy Beijing streets.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance they resembled a bicycle club or an athletic
team at practice as they wove deftly in and out of traffic for
hours. But this was neither leisure nor sport. It was work.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow jackets bore the name of the Ai Jia World Furniture
Center in bold red characters. And the 15 young men _ all migrants
from poor rural areas _ were employed as a sometimes walking and
sometimes talking, but mostly cycling, advertisement. The company
has about 100 people doing this kind of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many furniture stores in Beijing now and we had to
do something to distinguish ourselves,'' said Chen Cuili, the
company's stylish young advertising director, wearing an overcoat
indoors to protect against this winter's extraordinary cold. ``It's
been very effective,'' she continued. ``It's new and it's
interesting. A lot of customers say they've noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen said the decision to use human advertising was not prompted
by cost considerations. But the fact that it is feasible to use
teams of humans as moving billboards says a lot about the strange
inconsistencies in China's economy, where ordinary workers' wages
have often not changed that much from Communist-era rates, but
prices of goods and commodities _ including advertising _ are more
in line with Western capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   That is to say that in a country with 1.3 billion people and a
lackluster economy, people are cheap. But billboards and television
advertisements are fantastically expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Ai Jia World Furniture pays each bike rider the equivalent of
$80 a month, with no benefits, to work for seven hours a day, seven
days a week. So a team of 15 costs $1,200 a month, plus the cost of
the uniforms and bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a one-time 15-second advertisement during prime
time on the local television station, BTV-1, costs $2,800. And a
large billboard in a prominent location rents at $3,000 to $8,000 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Ai Jia started the bicycle ads six months ago, as part of a
larger advertising blitz that has also included roadside banners
and, at times, newspaper and television advertising as well.
</P>
<P>
   The one-year-old company is one of many huge furniture stores
that have sprung up recently to cater to China's new house-proud
urban middle class who, for the first time, can own their own homes
and have the money to decorate them. And the Chinese Ai Jia, which
means ``love home,'' must, of course, distinguish itself from the
powerful new import, Yi Jia (pleasant home), known in the West as
IKEA.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chen acknowledged that the cost of television
advertising was much higher than bike promotions, she said that the
company's main concern was the campaign's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to compare costs,'' she said. ``There are so many
people watching TV, but they may not notice you because there are
so many ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a few other companies tried bicycle advertising last
fall, none have continued it into this winter, the coldest in
Beijing's recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Any day it is not raining or snowing, the furniture store sends
out four or five bicycle advertising teams, each with 15 to 20 men,
on set routes. The men in the bright yellow jackets have become
part of this gray urban landscape, snaking along the roadside like
a giant neon caterpillar. At bus stops, team leaders sometimes
order the team to alight and mingle with the passengers, silently
cultivating Ai Jia brand recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they'll get off at a station and help people get on
buses, or at a crowded intersection where they might help the
police with traffic or maintain order,'' said Chen. ``But unless
they are asked they don't tell people what their purpose is or why
they are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   To the riders, all poor teen-agers from the countryside, the
days on the road are, quite simply, work, and better than many jobs
they might get here. They are hired from agencies that provide
security guards to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm satisfied with the work,'' said Guo Peng, a slight
boy with the first hint of a mustache, who said he was 18 and had
just graduated from middle school in rural Shanxi Province. ``It's
money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since they do not have urban residence permits, such young men
are excluded from most better-paying jobs in Beijing and live at
the fringes of the local economy. Their $80 monthly salary is about
average for migrant workers in Beijing, and the work is easier than
construction jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they look cold and somewhat forlorn as they ride down the
wintry streets, yellow jackets over threadbare sweaters and bare
hands chapped from the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're young and we don't mind the weather,'' said Yan Jinming,
20, one easygoing team leader who had previously worked in
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   He, for one, seemed to enjoy a job that lets rural migrants step
out of the penumbra of where they normally exist and places them in
the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started people would all come over saying,
`What's going on, what's this?''' he said. ``They think of it as
something strange and interesting.''

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moving to stem the trend of huge consolidation in
the oil industry, the federal government decided on Wednesday to
try to block BP Amoco's $30 billion proposed acquisition of
Atlantic Richfield Co.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 3-2, the Federal Trade Commission chose to seek a
preliminary injunction against the deal. Commission officials
asserted, and the companies denied, that the merger would be
strongly anticompetitive and could lead to significant rises in the
price of crude oil for refiners in California and other West Coast
states, where prices at the gas pump far exceed the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco and Arco together control about 70 percent of the
production of oil on Alaska's North Slope, much of which ends up in
the gas tanks of West Coast consumers. Last year, the companies
agreed with Alaska state officials to reduce their control to about
55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said that the FTC's vote made the proposed
merger the largest in American history both in terms of revenue _
$100 billion in the year ending Sept. 30 _ and purchase price to be
challenged by the government. It is the first in the oil industry
since the commission blocked the Mobil Corp.'s $6.5 billion bid to
buy Marathon Oil in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal will cement market power and harm competition by
creating a significant risk that crude oil prices would be higher
on the West Coast than they would without the deal,'' said Richard
G. Parker, the director of the bureau of competition at the
commission. ``What this case is about at a fundamental level is a
dominant firm that is already exercising market power buying the
one firm, Arco, that is the one threat to that market power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition in the past has caused these firms to claw each
other's eyes out to get oil in Alaska,'' Parker said at a news
conference here on Wednesday afternoon. ``Now that competition is
disappearing unless we are able to obtain relief in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the oil companies have said that prices on the
West Coast are not set by Alaska production, but by the world
market, and that the government was unfairly penalizing their deal
to make a broader statement about consolidation in an industry
which has seen Exxon swallow Mobil, BP purchase Amoco, and Texaco
enter into a joint marketing venture with Shell.
</P>
<P>
   The executives also said that the government had rejected what
they called reasonable offers to divest many assets _ including the
rough equivalent of all Arco's Alaskan production _ to eliminate
the problems raised by antitrust lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absurd to argue that the price of oil can be controlled
by any company, country or agency in today's market,'' said Youssef
M. Ibrahim, a vice president at BP Amoco USA. ``Alaska crude oil
represents about 28 percent of the oil refined on the West Coast.
What the government is suggesting is that we can push around an oil
market whose producers include Saudis, Venezualans, Mexicans and
California. Can we do that? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   But some officials at the commission and lawmakers such as Sen.
Ron Wyden, D-Ore., replied that the deal was flawed from the outset
and could not be remedied by divestitures.
</P>
<P>
   The case will now move to Federal District Court in San
Francisco, where lawyers for the commission, along with state
officials from Oregon and Washington, will file papers asserting
that the deal violates the Clayton Antitrust Act and seek a
preliminary injunction to prevent the deal from closing.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever side loses that fight may appeal the decision;
additionally, a second trial may begin at any time before an
administrative law judge over the merits of the corporate
combination.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Wednesday's decision will delay for many
months the closing of the deal. If the government ultimately
prevails, BP Amoco's acquisition would have to be scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the government sought the injunction for three
reasons. The merger, he said, would reduce competition by refiners
that use Alaskan crude oil; it would also substantially diminish
the quality of bidding among oil companies that want to lease and
develop Alaskan lands owned by the state and federal government.
Finally, he contended, the deal would enable BP Amoco and Arco to
manipulate the price of oil futures because the companies control a
major crude oil marketing hub in Cushing, Okla., that is used to
store West Texas Intermediate crude, the most actively traded
futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said, though, that they had already satisfied
Alaskan authorities of any anticompetitive effects from the deal by
agreeing to reduce their combined ownership of oil production.
</P>
<P>
   The executives also said they had proposed to sell major storage
and pipeline assets in Cushing to allay the concerns of federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   FTC challenges to corporate deals recently have usually forced
the companies involved to drop their plans to merge. But BP Amoco
has vowed to confront the agency in court and complete its
acquisition of Arco. In recent weeks, even as the two companies
proposed new concessions and divestitures in an effort to persuade
a majority of commissioners to approve the deal, executives said
they were confident that they have a strong legal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's argument comes from an era when government
agencies were trying to regulate how businesses do business,''
Ibrahim, the BP Amoco vice president, said. ``That's fine for the
1970s, but it does not make sense in an era of globalization.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials in Alaska, which had heavily lobbied the FTC to
approve the deal, also said they were dissatisfied by Wednesday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   `Most Alaskans are very disappointed that today's decision fails
to resolve the issue,' said Gov. Tony Knowles, a Republican.
``Alaska's interests and America's interests in developing North
Slope oil and gas are being put in the deep freeze and, once again,
Alaska's future is left to be decided in a distant court.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as lawyers for both sides began preparations for
court proceedings, Sir John Browne, BP Amoco's top executive, made
a final pitch to Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade
Commission, to accept the deal with conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitofsky, who in recent months has said that oil industry
mergers would receive heightened scrutiny because of the wave of
consolidation, apparently was not moved by Browne's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky, whom officials said has been the most skeptical of the
commissioners about the deal, was joined in his opposition to it by
two other Democratic appointees, Sheila F. Anthony and Mozell W.
Thompson. The commission's two Republican appointees, Orson Swindle
and Thomas B. Leary, dissented, saying they believed it was
premature to seek an injunction and suggesting they wanted to
pursue further settlement talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open
Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel,
after its decision Wednesday to raise short-term interest rates:
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its
target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 5}
percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a
25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 5\ percent.
</P>
<P>
   The committee remains concerned that over time increases in
demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even
after taking account of the pronounced rise in productivity growth.
Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would
undermine the economy's record economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability
and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently
available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly
toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures
in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board
approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the
Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland,
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San
Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository
institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from
their district Federal Reserve Banks.

COMMENTARY: `BUSH CAN'T WIN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Henry (The Great Compromiser) Clay was all set
to get the Whig nomination to challenge President Martin Van Buren.
Thurlow Weed, a New York political boss in 1840, came up with a
strategy to undermine Clay's wide support among Whigs. His
sorrowful message: ``Clay can't win.'' It worked, and the Whigs
went on to defeat the sitting president with Benjamin Harrison and
not Henry Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, practical politicians have used ``electability'' as
the touchstone. And throughout last year, George W. Bush's
nomination had the aura of inevitability because polls showed him
trouncing Al Gore, his likely opponent in November.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Sen. John McCain crushed Bush by a historic margin in
the Republican primary in New Hampshire, we see the end of the
inevitability of the former front-runner's nomination. A coronation
at the GOP Philadelphia convention has become both evitable and
exorable.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican primary on Feb. 19 in South Carolina,
independent voters will again be allowed to cast ballots for
McCain; that's the same system that made his landslide possible in
New Hampshire. This time, because Carolina Democrats won't have a
primary that day, McCain won't have to compete with Bill Bradley
for swing voters. He'll get the great majority of them.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the maverick McCain will also get enough
of South Carolina's regular Republicans to overcome Bush's 20-point
lead. The GOP leadership there, now panicking at voter interest in
campaign finance reform, is going all out to build another South
Carolina ``fire wall'' to rescue their establishment from the
horror of a McCain upset.
</P>
<P>
   How can McCain attract to his side those conservative Republican
voters who so dearly want a winner in the fall that they are
willing to swallow the springtime swing rightward of a natural
moderate like Bush? That's where Thurlow Weed's ``can't win''
strategy comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Focus not on the nomination, goes this argument to the GOP rank
and file, but on the general election. Who is more likely to defeat
the Democratic opposition, Bush or McCain?
</P>
<P>
   If the Democratic nominee is the underdog Bradley, the New
Hampshire results provide the answer: independents given a choice
between Bradley and McCain overwhelmingly preferred McCain.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats choose Al Gore to be their nominee, which
Republican is likeliest to defeat him? South Carolina's answer to
that question of presumed electability (no matter if the answer is
ultimately right or wrong) should determine who will be the
Republican standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's backers must make the case that only their man can
defeat Gore. Their job is to persuade primary voters that Bush _ no
matter how propped up by his beloved parents and blessed regularly
by the evangelist Pat Robertson _ ``can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Least important reason first: Bush's impossibly high poll
ratings of last year against the Clinton-tainted Gore (on which
much of his nomination inevitability was based) have eroded
radically. National polls no longer show Bush to be an easy winner
over Gore, and will narrow further in time.
</P>
<P>
   More important, nobody knows if Bush can coolly turn aside
vilification _ from charges of financial favoritism to smears about
drug and alcohol abuse _ sure to come at him from the Democratic
camp. Piously cluck-clucking about ``negative campaigning,'' as we
have recently seen with Bradley, is no effective defense. (McCain
can take whatever mud is heaved his way; there is no shortcoming to
which he has not already cheerfully confessed.)
</P>
<P>
   Third, Bush if nominated would have to hastily reinvent himself
as a moderate, after having moved tax-cuttingly right; but McCain
is solidly positioned to take the center, which would ensure his
victory in November while saving the House for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The most persuasive reason: a post-Bradley Gore would savage
Bush in debate, out-detailing and out-cornballing him at will;
whereas McCain's depth of experience and personality would put the
crusher on Gore's candidacy. Tacit admission of McCain's debating
superiority comes from Bush himself, who refuses to go one-on-one
with his Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCain cannot personally put forward a ``Bush can't
win'' argument. That calls for the likes of a modern Thurlow Weed.
</P>

COMMENTARY: WEBS OF INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore believes his role in streamlining the federal
bureaucracy was one of his major achievements as vice president.
The sale at auction of the huge, government-owned Elk Hills oil
field in Bakersfield, Calif., to the Occidental Petroleum Co. grew
out of that effort. The winning bid was $3.65 billion. It was the
largest sale of a government asset to private industry ever, and it
got the federal government out of the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   The Elk Hills transfer may or may not have been a good deal for
taxpayers, and there is no suggestion the vice president did
anything wrong. But the interests of democracy would have been
better served if it had been widely known that Occidental Petroleum
has for years been a major benefactor of Gore's family.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public
Integrity, a nonpartisan investigative organization in Washington,
notes in a new book, ``The Buying of the President 2000,'' that
Occidental has been a ``steady supplier'' of campaign funds to Gore
(who is known for his fund-raising excesses) and the Democrats.
Occidental has also given substantial sums to Republicans. But back
in 1970, when Gore's father, the late Sen. Albert Gore Sr., left
the Senate, he was given a $500,000-a-year job as chairman of an
Occidental subsidiary and a seat on Occidental's board of
directors. By 1992, said Lewis, the Gore family held Occidental
stock worth $680,000.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain campaigns on a bus known as the ``Straight Talk
Express'' and has made campaign finance reform a cornerstone of his
campaign. While his misadventures as a member of the notorious
``Keating Five'' are well known, it is not as well known that he
went to bat for Del Webb Corp., one of the nation's largest
developers of single-family homes, when it ran into trouble in its
effort to exchange some of its own land for a choice
government-owned parcel near Las Vegas. The deal that Del Webb
eventually made was criticized by the inspector general of the
Department of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is a big deal to Del Webb, which is headquartered in
Arizona and has been involved in a number of controversial land
swaps with the government. Del Webb executives and employees have
contributed more than $56,000 to McCain's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, politicians are anxious to portray themselves as
straight talkers. But most voters know that hypocrisy is part of
the essence of politics. What voters seldom know are the
disheartening details of the treacherous webs of influence that
often are woven by big money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lewis said, ``The media, frankly, need to get a
little bit away from the horse race, using the money as a litmus
test of how viable a candidate is, and get a little bit more into
those relationships that exist and that the voters don't know
about.''
</P>
<P>
   In his chapter on Bill Bradley, Lewis wrote that during one year
in the late 1980s, a period when corporate takeover artists were
flooding Congress with money, ``the top recipient was none other
than Bradley,'' who supported tax policies favorable to corporate
raiders.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that Bradley, who is now a fervent advocate of
campaign finance reform, was a champion recipient of other kinds of
largess. ``During his three terms in the Senate,'' wrote Lewis,
``he went on one junket after another _ more than 160 in all. In
1996 alone, he took more all-expense-paid trips than any U.S.
senator.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has been held aloft throughout his career by
favor-seeking special interests. Bush's experience as an oil
industry entrepreneur was, for the most part, a series of expensive
stumbles. But in the late 1980s he swung a sweet deal with Harken
Energy Corp., an oil exploration company near Dallas. Phil
Kendrick, Harken's founder, was quoted by Lewis as saying: ``His
name was George Bush. That was worth the money they paid him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised more than $100 million in his two runs for
governor of Texas and his current run for president, an astonishing
total. How much of that money was spent in expectation of special
access and special favors is a mystery to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The ``straight talk'' of the candidates dissolves into silence
when it comes to penetrating such mysteries.

 &HT;    CARE examines security overseas in wake of slayings
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CARE USA's top security official was scheduled to
leave Atlanta late Wednesday for East Africa to figure out how to
keep the organization's employees as safe as possible following a
month in which CARE workers have been killed in two different
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bob MacPherson, a former Marine colonel who works on security
issues for the Atlanta-based humanitarian organization, will visit
the violence-wracked countries of Burundi, Sudan and Somalia before
heading to South Africa to train CARE workers in disaster response.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century has not started safely for CARE workers:
</P>
<P>
   _ On Jan. 2, a Somali employee of CARE USA was shot to death
when the vehicle in which he was riding was ambushed north of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometime between Jan. 2 and Jan. 5, two local CARE USA
employees were slain in Sudan as they drove a truck from Bentiu,
about 450 miles south of Khartoum, to Mayoum, where they planned to
open a new health clinic. Two other men _ one a CARE staffer, the
other a private contractor _ are still missing and presumed
abducted.
</P>
<P>
   _ And just last weekend, in an incident that added impetus to
McPherson's trip _ which was already in the works _ 15 people were
killed when a CARE convoy carrying food to a famine-stricken area
of southern Somalia was first attacked by militia, and later ran
over a land mine. The dead included four militia members and 11
CARE contractors, but no employees of the agency, CARE said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As CARE works in an increasing number of societies that are
torn by communal conflict, our people are increasingly at risk,''
said CARE President Peter Bell. ``And we've had dramatic
demonstrations of this already in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   MacPherson will assess CARE's state of security in those
countries, look for ways to make CARE workers safer and hold a
training session in Nairobi, Kenya, for as many as 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the atmosphere for humanitarian workers around
the world has changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, that white vehicle with the CARE logo was respected
for its neutrality,'' he said. ``Now, often it's a target for
robbery, banditry. There's no respect in many places for that
neutrality anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence far outranks accidents as a cause of death among
international humanitarian workers, according to a study by Dr. Gil
Burnham of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. The study,
which analyzed the causes of death of 392 humanitarian workers over
13 years, found that two-thirds were caused by ``intentional
violence,'' 17 percent by motor vehicle accidents and 7.5 percent
by ``unintentional violence,'' such as plane crashes and volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   MacPherson said he will examine the various CARE offices,
looking at such issues as where they are located, how well they are
lit, and whether tree limbs might offer access by extending over
walls topped with concertina wire. And he will ask, for example,
whether keys have been given to cooks who might be intimidated by
criminals into handing them over.
</P>
<P>
   He will sit down in each country with the native staff members
to hear their suggestions on how to improve security. Often, people
familiar with the culture and mores of a country suggest solutions
that would elude an outsider, he said.
</P>
<P>
   None of those measures, however, would have saved the workers
killed this year in Somalia and Sudan, MacPherson said. In
dangerous places, sometimes things go wrong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, MacPherson is examining ways to keep CARE
workers safer on the road. Communications are the key to security,
he said. But the need for safety must be balanced against the
agency's resources, he said. To equip the thousands of CARE
vehicles around the world with the radios MacPherson took for
granted in the Marines would cost up to $5,000 per vehicle, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would do no humanitarian assistance,'' he said. ``We would
drive around in vehicles with radios.''
</P>
<P>
   So he is looking into less expensive radios _ which provide less
range _ and at the possibility of equipping CARE vehicles with $800
global positioning devices with a panic switch.
</P>
<P>
   In his training sessions in East Africa, MacPherson will stress
precautions that he said should be intuitive _ watching for land
mines, being careful about what you photograph and acting safely at
checkpoints. He will emphasize to local staff members, many of whom
are desperate to keep their jobs, that CARE will not fault them for
yielding agency property to bandits.
</P>
<P>
   MacPherson also has another safety rule: ``Don't do stupid
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one that rings particularly true for him. On his computer
screen at the CARE offices in Atlanta, he has a photo of the
steaming wreckage of a car. Over the picture are these words:
``Remember ... it's good to be alive ... today!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   MacPherson was a passenger in that car last year when it slid
off the road in Albania and tumbled 500 feet. The only reason he
survived, he said, was by not being stupid. He was wearing his seat
belt.

 &HT;    Kosovars determined to rebuild lives amid bitter winter
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The day he left for Kosovo, the power was off at Peter
Bell's house.
</P>
<P>
   Being at home with no heat during an ice storm was just a
preface for what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   The first night Bell spent in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, the
electricity went on and off. But the temperature was 30 to 40
degrees colder than at his Atlanta home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no hot water, very little heat if any, and it was
around zero degrees,'' said Bell, president of CARE USA. ``It was
pretty uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the course of a weeklong fact-finding mission, Bell was
to discover much worse as he made his way around the Serbian
province that is currently being administered by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   What he was enduring, he decided, was nothing compared to the
conditions faced by ``tens of thousands of Kosovars.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a bitterly cold winter, many families are
huddling in a single room of fire-bombed houses or sleeping in
tents. They heat their homes with wood. And they have no working
electricity or, at best, intermittent service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just unbelievably tough people,'' said Bell, on his
return to Atlanta this week. ``They are adamant about reclaiming
their homes and their villages.''
</P>
<P>
   When NATO air strikes began on Yugoslavia last March in an
attempt to halt Serbian repression of ethnic Albanians, hundreds of
thousands of refugees poured into Albania and Macedonia. The media
poured in, too, filing dramatic stories each day about the
heart-rending experiences of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Once the NATO bombing campaign ended, the world's attention
quickly subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bell said, today ``family by family, village by village,
people are living out dramas, nonetheless. They're living through
enormous difficulties and showing tremendous determination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was one single thing that impressed me,'' he added,
``it was the absolute determination of the Kosovar people to return
to their homes and their villages _ even if that means spending a
bitter cold winter living in tents.''
</P>
<P>
   CARE is one of the leading humanitarian organizations trying to
help the people of Kosovo rebuild their lives. But the task is
proving to be enormous, Bell acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The province's humanitarian crisis grabbed the spotlight last
year with reports of Serb attacks on Albanians, followed by NATO
air raids and the refugee crisis, followed by revenge murders and
arsons against the Serbs when ethnic Albanians returned at the end
of the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems of Kosovo actually go back much further than
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As terrible as the ethnic cleansing of 10 months ago was, it's
important to remember that Kosovo underwent a decade-long period of
repression prior to the ethnic cleansing,'' Bell said. ``Many of
the problems that Kosovars and the international community confront
today are really problems that accumulated over many years. There
was a decline in industry, in mining, in agriculture, education and
health care. And all of that decline went on for a decade before
the humanitarian emergency of last year. So it's not just a case of
getting things back to where they were a year ago. We're really
talking about getting things back, or ahead of, where they were
more than a decade ago.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the refugees returned from the camps, the CARE
official noted, more than a hundred thousand homes were heavily
damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Repairs began immediately, but _ even when money and resources
are adequate _ transporting materials to those in need through the
narrow mountain passes from Macedonia continues to create
logistical headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The onset of a snowy winter increased the urgency for the repair
of houses. At the same time, it has made the work much more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   CARE _ sometimes employing former Kosovo Liberation Army
combatants _ has been engaged in extensive activities to help the
former refugees: distributing food, supplying tractor parts and
seed, identifying land-mine fields, operating a mobile health
clinic and training workers in reproductive health and trauma
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   But one of its most urgently appreciated projects has been
helping families winterize homes still lacking roofs and windows
after last year's reign of terror. The agency has helped erect
rafters and plastic tarps for temporary roofing, supplied
industrial carpets for floors and provided wood-burning stoves for
heat.
</P>
<P>
   CARE's goal is seemingly modest: to make sure that each family
has at least one warm, dry room for every seven people. But, thanks
to that aid, Bell said, ``people are making a go of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about this effort has been cheap. Going back to the
humanitarian crisis starting last March, CARE alone has marshaled
approximately $40 million in resources for the effort _ about $28
million of it since the refugees began streaming back into Kosovo.
The agency now employs more than 400 staff members there, about 50
of them international staff from 27 different countries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scale of that work, CARE also must take on
responsibilities for helping people worldwide. And Bell admitted
that many staffers are wrestling with how to allocate resources
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the needs in Kosovo, but we also see the enormous
continuing needs in places like Sierra Leone, Angola, Sudan and
elsewhere,'' he said. Those situations, at least as grave, are
receiving nothing like the international response seen in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But governments from the United States, Canada, Japan and the
European community all see stabilizing the Balkans as a necessity
and, at least to this point, they have been willing to channel
resources to agencies willing to help. The work of those agencies
is now seen as vital to the future of the province.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency in Kosovo hasn't ended for many people Bell met as
he traveled through wrecked villages. But CARE's staff is already
trying to create a strategy for longer-term rehabilitation and
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said CARE is thinking of expanding involvement with
agricultural production, small-business development and health
care. It may also take on a role in helping rebuild the school
system.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond reconstruction are underlying questions about real
reconciliation in Kosovo and the Balkans, Bell acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The special struggles of Kosovo's people this icy winter came
about largely because of the unleashed passions of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica, a city where CARE has been active, is still tensely
divided between Albanian and Serbian sectors.
</P>
<P>
   CARE is helping with urban planning projects to rebuild the
city.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the realities of Kosovo _ and very regrettably,
in Bell's view _ CARE still must have separate staffs to work with
Serbs and Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Those staffs came together _ ``uneasily, but successfully,''
Bell said _ for a meeting during the CARE president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small victory, but a victory, nonetheless. And Bell
still hopes for more.
</P>
<P>
   During his trip, he met Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, the German
commander of the multinational peacekeepers. Reinhardt said his own
family had received CARE packages after World War II and that the
agency's work had inspired him to think about how former enemies
should treat one another.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Bell said, ``CARE is very much committed to providing
support to all ethnic groups ... without distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A component of the basic mission of CARE is to combat
prejudice in all its forms,'' he said. ``And we've seen the
exercise of prejudice in its most virulent form in Kosovo.''

BLACK OFFICERS SAY THEY BEAR SPECIAL BURDEN IN POLICE WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Among the thousands of grim-faced officers in
dress-blue uniforms who came to pay homage to a fallen comrade,
Malden, Mass. patrolman Trent J. Headley paused to try and imagine
the final, terrifying moments in the brief life of Sergeant Cornel
Young Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine him frantically trying to get the officers to
recognize who he was'' as they leveled their weapons and opened
fire, Headley said. ``Unfortunately, it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who was off-duty, out of uniform and trying to break up a
fight, was shot three times by officers in Providence because they
thought he was an armed suspect who would not drop his gun.
</P>
<P>
   But for Headley, an African-American with five years on the job,
the nightmarish scenario surrounding the ``friendly fire'' that
claimed Young's life is a bitter reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there,'' said Headley, the only black officer in his
110-member department. Without his navy-blue uniform or a silver
badge pinned to his chest, he said, ``there have been times when
police officers didn't believe that I was an officer because I am
black,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepared to march to Fourth Baptist Church, some black
officers reflected on the solidarity they feel with Young, and
other officers who have died in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, several said they cannot escape a frequent emotional
conflict: though they swear to uphold the law, in some
circumstances their colleagues might view them as criminals,
perhaps because of racial profiling _ the practice of assigning
more criminal suspicion to a person because of the color of their
skin.
</P>
<P>
   One New York City officer said he was searched for drugs by
white police officers from his own department _ even though he
showed them his badge. Another female officer suspects she was the
victim of racial profiling: she was pulled over on the highway in
Hartford, Conn., even as she was driving the legal speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who is black, died when he rushed outside Fidas
Restaurant to help patrolmen Carlos A. Saraiva and Michael Solitro
III break up a fight in the parking lot. One suspect put down a gun
when Saraiva and Solitro ordered him to.
</P>
<P>
   They ordered Young, who had his weapon drawn, to do the same,
officials said, but opened fire when Young did not comply.
Authorities have not identified the races of Saraiva and Solitro,
but others say they are white.
</P>
<P>
   Providence officials have downplayed the belief that Young's
race played a role in the shooting, and insist that Saraiva and
Solitro were unable to identify Young as one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But as they gathered at the city Convention Center before the
funeral Wednesday, most black officers interviewed expressed
outrage and frustration at the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that anyone really believes that these
officers knew that they were shooting at a police officer,'' said a
black Providence police officer who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, many of us believe that these two officers saw a black
man with a gun and at that moment they probably thought that
Sergeant Young was a criminal,'' the officer said. ``That's wrong
and should not be tolerated here in Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers are encouraged to uphold the law even when they
are not working _ breaking up fights, making arrests. But in recent
years, several African-American officers have been shot, wounded or
even killed while doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1882, according to statistics from the National Law
Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, there have been 140 accidental
shootings of officers by other officers. No one keeps statistics on
the number of black officers who have been shot by colleagues, but
several recent cases made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Desmond Robinson, a city transit officer, was shot
several times in the back in 1994 by a New York City Police
Department patrolman who thought he was a robber. Graham Sylvester
of the Baltimore police was wounded during a drug raid in 1994
while he was detaining a female suspect at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., three black officers were shot by white
comrades in three years: patrolman James M. McGee, killed off-duty
while holding a robbery suspect; Detective Lani Jackson-Pinckney,
wounded and paralyzed while trying to stop a carjacking; and Thomas
F. Hamlette Jr., an off-duty rookie patrolman who was killed while
breaking up a fight outside a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   And in Boston, Michael Cox _ a plainclothes patrol officer
chasing a shooting suspect _ was severely beaten and left bleeding
as he tried to scale a fence in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's funeral, Mayor Vincent A. Cianci pledged a full
inquiry that would deliver the facts and justice. Some speculated
that Young's father, Major Cornel Young Sr. _ the highest-ranking
black officer in the department _ would ensure a speedy
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the services Wednesday, Clifford Montiero,
president of the Providence chapter of the NAACP, planned to meet
with several minority officers from other states who were injured
by their fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   Providence patrolman Mike Marcoccio, president of the police
union, said he did not know if Solitro or Saraiva, who are on paid
administrative leave, would return to work. But he cautioned
against second-guessing their decision to shoot that night until
all the facts are in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough job,'' Marcoccio said. ``They have to make
split-second decisions and live with them for the rest of their
lives. It's so easy to criticize after the fact, but you only have
a split second.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one Boston officer wondered why the two officers used
deadly force against Young instead of shooting to wound him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless someone is likely to do something that's going to
endanger the lives of people around them, we're taught in the
academy to try to gain control of the situation by subduing the
suspect,'' she said. ``From what I know, it doesen't seem like
(Solitro and Salaiva) followed policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the officers interviewed believe that Young was
viewed as a threat because of his race, some said that the
investigation should run its course before individuals react.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to lose one of our own, but I think that the facts
will come out,'' said Frank Morrobel, a Rhode Island corrections
officer who has 10 years on the job. ``Sergeant Young gave his life
for a cause and hopefully we can all learn from that. I hope we can
unite and stay focused on healing our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hobbs and Art Akins, two police officers from Bridgewater,
N.J., made the four-hour trip by car to offer their condolences to
the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to feel bad for all those involved,'' Hobbs said.
``The two officers have to live with what they've done for the rest
of their lives. Everyone is a victim here.''

SENATE APPROVES MINIMUM WAGE HIKE, SETS STAGE FOR SHOWDOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved a Republican-backed
minimum-wage increase Wednesday, setting the stage for an
election-year fight with the White House over how quickly to boost
the lower end of the pay scale to $6.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The $1-an-hour pay increase was included in bankruptcy reform
legislation that includes tax breaks for small businesses and a
provision to stop abortion protesters from filing for bankruptcy
protection to escape paying fines.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved its own version of the bankruptcy reform bill
in May, but the measure included no mention of a minimum-wage
increase. The legislation will be sent to a conference committee to
resolve the differences.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which opposes both versions of the bankruptcy
bill saying they would be too hard on debtors, weighed-in Wednesday
against the Republican proposal to increase wages by $1-an-hour
over the next three years and to cut business taxes by $76 billion
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the kind of legislation the president can sign,''
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the actual rise in the minimum wage goes up
quickly enough,'' Lockhart said. ``And we find that the tax cuts
... in there are not paid for and are skewed to those who don't
necessarily need tax cuts at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and congressional Democrats have proposed a
minimum wage increase of $1-an-hour over a 13-month period, a
timetable opposed by Republican leaders in both the Senate and the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans _ mostly moderates and urban members _
are expected to support the Democrats' schedule in hopes of
avoiding attacks on the popular issue during their re-election
campaigns. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I hate it,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay said when asked
about the election-year timing of the proposal to increase the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican said House leaders want any pay-increase
legislation to include a tax break. ``Obviously, we don't have the
votes to stop minimum wage, so we ought to do something that
lessens the burden on people that pay the wages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wage increase was attached to legislation pushed by banks,
credit card companies and retailers to make it harder to use the
bankruptcy laws to erase personal debt. Both the House and Senate
versions would subject bankruptcy applicants to a ``means test'' to
determine how much debt relief they need.
</P>
<P>
   Debtors judged able to pay some of what they owe would be
disqualified from Chapter 7, the section of the bankruptcy law that
allows most unsecured debts, such as credit card bills, to be wiped
out. Those with sufficient income and assets would be put under
Chapter 13, which requires repayment of those debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill says that when someone can repay their debts,
they're not going to be able to take the easy way out,'' said Sen.
Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican who sponsored the legislation.
``This will end the free ride for deadbeats who walk away from
their debts and pass the bill on to the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   As passed by the Senate, the bill would end Texans' right to
shield their homes from creditors, a shortcoming that Texas Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison said could force her to try killing the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate put a $100,000 cap on homestead exemptions, a
provision aimed at keeping wealthy debtors from shielding their
assets in luxury homes in bankruptcy proceedings. The House version
sets the cap at $250,000 and would allow states to opt out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If states are not allowed to keep their right to set their own
exemptions, then I will have to try to kill the bill and filibuster
it,'' Hutchison, a Dallas Republican, said late Wednesday. ``A few
of us (in the Senate) ... feel strongly enough that it could
jeopardize the entire bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Florida allow unlimited homestead exemptions, which
debtors can use to keep their homes' value from being counted among
their assets in bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Senate approved the bill Wednesday, a provision was
added to stop abortion protesters from declaring bankruptcy to
escape paying fines or penalties when sued for harming abortion
clinics or personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment making it easier to punish protesters drew support
from several anti-abortion Republicans who wanted to deny Vice
President Al Gore the chance to polish his abortion-rights
credentials by casting a possible tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-abortion activists, including Operation Rescue leader
Randall Terry, have declared bankruptcy to avoid paying fines or
penalties awarded by the court when sued under the Freedom of
Access to Clinic Entrances Act passed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also added provisions to the bankruptcy bill to
tighten penalties for selling illegal drugs to minors, close the
gap in prison sentences for sales of powder and crack cocaine, and
increases penalties for makers of methamphetamine, a drug known as
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Before passing the bill, the Republican-led Senate rejected a
proposed amendment that would have barred gun makers and sellers
from using bankruptcy laws to erase debts that might be incurred if
they are on the losing end of lawsuits by cities or victims of gun
crimes.

2 KILLED AS ROCKET HITS U.N. BUS FOR SERBS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ A rocket attack on a bus filled with
Serbian civilians killed two elderly villagers and wounded three
more people Wednesday, just yards from their armed NATO escort.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs were using a weekly bus service organized by the
United Nations high commissioner for refugees to their village in
northern Kosovo and were ambushed, NATO peacekeepers said. A
spokesman for the high commissioner's office said it was the worst
such attack on a Serbian convoy here and will set back efforts to
encourage peace and tolerance between Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions rose in the divided city of Mitrovica, some 12 miles
from the scene, soon after the attack. French troops reported four
explosions in the Serb-dominated northern half of the city. They
quickly closed a bridge that connects the Serbian and Albanian
parts of the city, pulling across coils of barbed wire and planks
of wood studded with nails. Reinforcements arrived to take up
positions on the bridge as automatic gunfire sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the bus shook the office of the high commissioner,
which immediately suspended all similar bus services. Since
November, the office has introduced eight bus services in the
province to allow Serbs who are cut off and threatened by Albanians
to move freely. Until Wednesday, the bus trips had encountered no
problems beyond a few stones.
</P>
<P>
   In the attack Wednesday, an elderly man and woman were killed
instantly. French troops took two others to a hospital at the
French base in Mitrovica. A man in his 30s, with a severed leg and
hand, was being operated on in a Mitrovica hospital later in the
evening, said Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, a spokesman for the French
troops.
</P>
<P>
   An 80-year-old woman was also treated for a wound to her hand.
And a third woman was treated at the scene and taken home. The
remaining passengers, who numbered more than 40, were safely
escorted to their isolated village of Banja, about 18 miles from
Mitrovica. The driver, a Dutch worker, escaped unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   The assailant, who fired the antitank rocket from a spot off the
road, escaped with his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred about 4 p.m. as dusk was falling on a remote
foggy road. The bus was hit near the village of Vitak, in a
predominantly Albanian area.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chanliau said the attacker must have been waiting for the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say with certitude it was an ambush,'' he said. ``The
bus was expected, it was very visible, with the letters UNHCR
clearly marked.''
</P>
<P>
   French troops in light armored vehicles were driving ahead and
behind the bus, providing an escort. The rocket hit the side of the
bus, but neither of the escort vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths and injuries of the Serbs while under international
protection highlights a problem that has placed the high
commissioner's office at loggerheads with the commander of the
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt has been pushing to give Serbs more movement around
Kosovo and has sought to encourage Serbs who fled the province to
return. The high commissioner's office has insisted on moving
slowly on the bus services, however, and has repeatedly insisted
that conditions in Kosovo are, for now, too dangerous for Serbs to
be encouraged to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protection of minorities has been and remains a major
preoccupation, and this sort of incident sets us back enormously in
the whole area,'' said Dennis McNamara, head of the high
commissioner's office in Kosovo. ``UNHCR is certain in that we will
not encourage Serbs to return to Kosovo at this stage because of
the security situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the bus service had been reasonably successful
and popular with the Serbs, said Peter Kessler, a spokesman for the
high commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them access to doctors, dentists, and a chance to
sell their cheese or other produce,'' he said. ``Generally, the
people on them are elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamara said: ``We know from Bosnia that these operations are
not without risk. We took time and care to set them up. But if
someone is determined to attack, they can.''

 &HT;    Newspaper photo helps Kosovar ease pain
 &HT;    of loneliness
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Shkelzen Deshishku arrived in Atlanta from Kosovo
two months ago, he became convinced he must be the only Albanian in
the city. Lots of cultures and languages swirled around him, but
none was his.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Dec. 23, he spotted the familiar face of Donat Jusufi,
a fellow college student from Pristina, Kosovo's capital. Jusufi
appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's special six-page
report ``From Refugees to Residents,'' about Kosovar refugee
families adjusting to new situations. The photograph of Jusufi
showed him at work at Virginia-Highland's Murphy's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the photograph, but I could not believe it was him,''
said Deshishku, 23, who is living in Atlanta on a student visa
while attending Georgia State University. ``So I looked for his
name in the story, and it was Donat.''
</P>
<P>
   Their reunion took place three days later, when Deshishku showed
up at Murphy's.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see him I was very surprised,'' said Jusufi. ``I knew
him through a friend in Pristina, and now we spend lots of time
together and are good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Deshishku (pronounced day-she-SKU) is living in Decatur, Ga.,
with an American friend he met in Macedonia last summer while
looking for work with the NATO rebuilding effort.
</P>
<P>
   Since Deshishku traveled alone to the United States and was not
part of last summer's massive refugee resettlement program, he had
no idea that Georgia had become home to nearly 600 Albanian
Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt alone. I thought I was the only Albanian here,'' he
laughed during a recent dinner at Murphy's. ``Donat was the first
guy I met from Kosovo here, and now through him I have met many
more families.''
</P>
<P>
   Since May, 14,161 Kosovar-Albanians have received refugee status
in the United States. They face a May 1 deadline on returning to
their homeland if they want the federal government to pay for their
flight home. They can also stay and eventually become U.S.
citizens. Nationally, about 3,000 Kosovo refugees have returned,
including about 100 who lived in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The two young men the article reunited gathered over New Year's
weekend with many Kosovar families living in southeast Atlanta and
Stone Mountain. Jusufi and Deshishku continue getting together to
talk of the past and the future.
</P>
<P>
   Both are from Pristina. Their families chose different paths
when war erupted. Jusufi, his parents, younger brother and two
sisters fled the county, then signed up for resettlement in the
United States. They arrived in Atlanta in mid-August. Deshishku's
family hid and waited out the fighting by moving from basement to
basement of relatives' homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot understand war until you feel,'' Deshishku said.
``It's a terrible feeling. No one should experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a college student pursuing economics until threats,
killings and bombings changed lives forever. Villages surrounding
Pristina are destroyed, Deshishku said, but the core of the city
was spared by Serbians who lived in its best neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call Pristina almost every day and talk to my family. There
is still a huge electricity problem there, but many people are
being hired to rebuild,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Deshishku wants to stay in Atlanta and get a degree in business
management. But every year, he must reapply for a student visa. His
first year of study involves intense classes to learn English. He'd
learned basic English by watching ``many, many'' American movies in
Kosovo, and he's now running up an impressive bill at a video
store.
</P>
<P>
   Jusufi, 21, learned a little English in Kosovo that's improved
through volunteer teachers and on-the-job encounters. He's
interested in pursuing either veterinary studies, what he started
in Kosovo, or a culinary school, inspired by his friendship with
Tom Murphy, owner of Murphy's.
</P>
<P>
   While living in Atlanta, Deshishku said he's interested in
learning more about the history of the South and the civil rights
movement because he sees similarities between black Americans'
struggles and the ethnic cleansing of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all white, but people belong to distinctive ethnic
groups. You can recognize an Albanian guy and a Serb guy without
even talking to them,'' said Deshishku, whose new American friends
have shortened his difficult first name, Shkelzen (shu-kel-ZEN), to
Vinnie.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare days when Jusufi is not baking, cooking or waiting
tables, and Deshishku is not studying, the two get together, drive
around the city and choose a new coffeehouse to pass the time. ``We
talk about many things,'' Jusufi said with a laugh. ``You know,
life, women.''

 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Riding the wave of his decisive victory in New
Hampshire, Sen. John McCain tore across South Carolina on Wednesday
arguing that he is the candidate who can ``attract people to our
party who have been alienated and disenchanted'' and carry
Republicans to victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after McCain's double-digit victory in the New
Hampshire primary dramatically shifted the contours of the
Republican race, McCain and a humbled Gov. George W. Bush both
shifted their battle for the nomination to this conservative state,
whose primary is less than three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   And both wasted little time positioning themselves before the
voters. While McCain presented himself as a centrist Republican who
could attract new converts to the party, Bush planted himself
firmly on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning Bush spoke to than 5,000 students at Bob Jones
University, a bastion of Christian conservatism, where he promised
to keep ``our ideas, Republican ideas, conservative ideas, at the
top of the national agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent news conference, Bush rolled out his latest
prominent endorsement: that of former Vice President Dan Quayle,
who courted the votes of social conservatives in his own
presidential campaign before ending it in September.
</P>
<P>
   But the day clearly belonged to McCain, who emerged from New
Hampshire with not only an 18-percentage-point win over Bush but
also a surge of much needed campaign contributions. Every few
hours, McCain's aides ticked off new fund-raising totals from his
campaign Web site. By late in the day, they said, McCain had taken
in $415,000 online since the primary ended.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has been leading opinion polls in South Carolina
by as many 20 percentage points, McCain said Wednesday that the
record voter turnout in New Hampshire and the breadth of his
support there showed that he was the ``electable'' Republican whose
campaign against big monied special interests could broaden the
party base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of people went down and registered as Republicans so
they could vote for me,'' he said at a news conference Wednesday
morning in Greenville, his wife Cindy by his side. ``Electability
is all about getting the support of the center, the political
center. I'm a proud Republican conservative and maintain my base.
But through this message of reform we will attract to our banner
people all over the political spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain pointed to how Ronald Reagan had been able to attract
cross-over Democrats two decades ago. And he said that while he
opposes abortion, he thinks the Republican Party should be ``an
inclusionary party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very clear that Ronald Reagan was able to expand
the base of the party and continue to espouse the conservative
philosophy,'' he said. ``I have to do that as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign sought to diminish McCain's victory by
insisting that its superior organization and campaign war chest
would allow the Texas governor to last past the opening laps of the
Republican race and run a 50-state campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just has the luxury of picking and choosing and I'm a
national candidate,'' Bush said Wednesday on his campaign plane.
``I'm going to run in every primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bush's portrayal of himself as a 50-state candidate,
McCain said wryly Wednesday, ``My response is: Now he's running in
49 states. And after South Carolina it's going to be one less
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Long hoping that their insurgency would be ignited by victory in
New Hampshire, McCain's aides scrambled to take advantage of their
win, beginning a frenzy of fund-raising and hastily shifting
campaign workers from New Hampshire and Washington to South
Carolina for the push toward the Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's campaign also took on a new, more hip tone as the
candidate was welcomed with blaring disco and funk music at rallies
across the state. Just before 3 a.m. as McCain's plane touched down
from New Hampshire, hundreds of enthusiastic college students
awaited him in a hangar at the airport serving Spartanburg and
Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Purple and green strobe lights flashed, and an announcer
screamed, ``It's show time, baby. It's awesome,'' Then McCain's
``Straight Talk Express'' bus _ now a campaign icon _ rolled its
way into the hangar and the candidate and his supporters popped
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're crazy,'' Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., told the screaming,
dancing, pompom waving crowd. ``I used to think the people in New
Hampshire were kind of crazy,'' he laughed. ``That's until I met
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign also adopted a new tone, as the governor shifted
emphasis from some of the issues he concentrated on in New
Hampshire, like tax cuts and military spending, toward what he
called conservative values. And the shift suggested that for all of
Bush's assertions on Tuesday night and again Wednesday morning that
the results in New Hampshire had not rattled him, he and his
advisers were indeed a bit spooked.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the Bush camp was playing it safe in South
Carolina by sending signals to religious conservatives, who enjoy a
leading role in the state's Republican politics, that the governor
was a man with values just like theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle repeatedly used the word ``values'' in explaining his
support for the governor. And Bush chimed in, ``I'm going to
campaign on conservative values in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Bush cuddles too closely with social and religious
conservatives he could wind up with ideological associations that
will hurt him among independents and Democrats, who can also vote
in the primary, and, more important, in a general election, which
as McCain noted Wednesday is usually won in the political center.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not stake out any new positions Wednesday. Nor did he
utter buzz words like abortion or homosexuality, two divisive
issues he has labored to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But he, his surrogates and his supporters leaned more heavily on
morality than they had over the last few weeks, and Bush's usually
unchanging stump speech suddenly included new and unfamiliar lines.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these targeted the moral failings of the Clinton
administration more directly than Bush usually does. ``I will
return honor and dignity to the White House,'' Bush told the
students at Bob Jones University, to a round of robust applause
that lasted nearly half a minute. ``The current president pledged
the most ethical administration in American history. As it turned
out, he fell 41 presidents short.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of Clinton's sexual behavior in office is a potent
rallying cry for religious and social conservatives, and Bush
latched onto it by poking fun at the testimony that Clinton gave to
the grand jury investigating his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will return the highest standards of honor to the highest
office in the land,'' Bush said. ``This is my pledge. And it does
not depend on what the meaning of the word `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain too offered fierce criticism of both Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore on Wednesday, but focused instead on the campaign
finance abuses of 1996, particularly Gore's participation in a
fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's call for tax cuts, which was the centerpiece of his New
Hampshire campaign, did not come until near the end of his speech,
and it was not mentioned at all by former Gov. David Beasley of
South Carolina, who introduced Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Beasley vouched that Bush ``deeply loves the Lord'' and
recited a litany of legislation in Texas that proved Bush's
anti-abortion mettle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the size of his loss in New Hampshire, Bush presented a
happy, unworried face to reporters on the plane. And he predicted
that in South Carolina, he would be rewarded for his efforts to
``solidify the base,'' a phrase that he used again in his news
conference here late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world down here,'' Bush said as he put his
arm tightly around his wife, Laura. ``It's a state that embraces
conservative values.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain planned to spend 14 of the next 18 days in the battle for
South Carolina. But his campaign was also ramping up to contest
Arizona and Michigan on Feb. 22 and then to compete in the
coast-to-coast primaries on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said the campaign, which has been run on a comparative
shoestring, planned to hire additional staff quickly for
Washington, Virginia, California and New York and grow to about 90
employees from 65 employees in the next few weeks. Rick Davis, the
campaign manager, said the drive was on to bring in enough money to
end the primary season with $31 million raised or matched. Bush by
contrast had raised $67 million by the end of last year, more than
twice the total budget of the McCain campign.

 &HT;    McCain, Bradley showings buoy Ohio backers
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The results from New Hampshire echoed through
Ohio on Wednesday as backers of John McCain and Bill Bradley
pledged to keep their candidates' momentum going into Ohio's March
7 presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamics of the race have fundamentally changed,''
declared Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), a McCain national co-chairman.
``If McCain does as well as I think he will in South Carolina, I
think by the time this thing hits Ohio you're into a national
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Dixie Allen (D-Dayton), a Bradley backer, is just
waiting for a phone call to do anything she can to help the former
New Jersey senator defeat Vice President Al Gore in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly ready and willing. I want to get out buttons and
literature,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine, Allen and other supporters of McCain and Bradley said
they realize their candidates still face uphill battles in Ohio,
where Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner, and
Gore are better organized and have more big-name backers than their
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's 18-point drubbing of Bush and Bradley's strong
second-place finish to Gore in New Hampshire gave them
encouragement that the nominations won't be locked up before
Ohioans vote. Ohio's March 7 primary falls on the same day as
primaries in New York, California and eight other states. Three
other states have caucuses March 7.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Charles Horn (R-Centerville) picked McCain on
principle and found himself pleasantly surprised that his candidate
now actually has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a longshot,'' Horn said. ``I didn't think he
could be elected.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain still is a longshot, money-wise. Federal Election
Commission reports show that he finished 1999 with $1,531,202 in
his campaign treasury, compared with $32,730,769 for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Staci Rhine said the New Hampshire victory
will help McCain raise money, but that his lack of an organization
in Ohio will hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need people to get people to the polls. Bush had
organization,'' said Rhine, an associate professor at Wittenberg
University.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not totally lacking in Ohio political operatives,
DeWine said. Curt Steiner, who served as chief of staff to former
Gov. George Voinovich and Ohio House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson, back
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to overstate my involvement,'' Steiner said. ``I
have been an informal adviser to the (McCain) campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley finished 1999 with more campaign money than Gore _
$8,334,412 to $7,839,758 _ but lacks Gore's backing from state and
county party leaders and organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of a Bradley Ohio organization is just shaping up,
with Alan Melamed, chairman of Democrat Lee Fisher's 1998
gubernatorial campaign, serving as press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly respect the party leadership and the labor
leadership and what they can bring,'' Melamed said. ``It's not
insurmountable. We live in an age where none of the traditional
organizational support (alone) can carry an election.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, was at Ohio State University in Columbus on
Wednesday and will be back next Wednesday for a Regional Labor
Council awards dinner in Moraine along with John Sweeney, national
president of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   While nothing is definite, Bradley backers hope for an Ohio
visit next week as well.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor McCain is expected in Ohio until after Feb. 19
_ date of the South Carolina Republican primary _ and probably not
until after Feb. 22 when Michigan and Arizona hold Republican
primaries, Bush and McCain backers said.

BRADLEY FOCUSES `SUPER TUESDAY' STRATEGY ON A FEW CRUCIAL STATES

 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Since the beginning of the presidential
campaign, former Sen. Bill Bradley has asserted that his entire
strategy was founded on building toward ``Super Tuesday,'' March 7,
when 11 states, including New York and California, will select
nearly 30 percent of the Democratic Party's presidential delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having lost to Vice President Al Gore in the Iowa caucuses
last week and the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, those upcoming
elections will be a test of whether his insurgent candidacy will
survive.
</P>
<P>
   As he jetted from Connecticut to Manhattan to San Francisco on
Wednesday, Bradley faced numerous questions about his ability not
only to communicate his message, but also to field organizations
that can compete with Gore in a coast-to-coast match over the next
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With as much money as Gore, about $20 million, Bradley's aides
say they can keep pace with Gore in television advertising, a
critical factor in big states like New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   But they acknowledge they will have trouble matching the size
and experience of Gore's field operations, which are run in large
part by the labor unions and elected officials who have endorsed
him.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Bradley campaign, while working feverishly
to establish beachheads in every primary and caucus state, will
focus its resources, and the candidate's precious time, on certain
states where they think Bradley can seriously contest Gore, aides
to Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley provided an indication of what those states will be in
the itinerary for a three-day trip he began Wednesday: Connecticut,
New York, California, Maryland and Florida. All of those states
vote on March 7 except Florida, which holds its primary on March
14. Next week he will stump in New York and California again, as
well as two other Super Tuesday states, Ohio, and Missouri, where
he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, his campaign will be dispatching paid field
organizers to most of those states, as well as to Massachusetts,
Oklahoma and Illinois, campaign officials said. But in most other
states, his campaign will be run largely by volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, the Bradley workers, many of whom are working in
their first presidential campaign, will be pitted against seasoned
organizers from the AFL-CIO or local Democratic organizations.
While Bradley has won the support of elected officials, much of his
support is coming from political novices or former officials who no
longer lead the kinds of political operations that can call voters,
distribute literature and organize media events.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent Wednesday when Bradley addressed a large and
enthusiastic crowd in a Greenwich Village church, where the
best-known politicians on stage had left politics years ago,
including former Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's aides assert that they will be able to place
experienced field operatives in every important state. More
important, they argued, the compressed primary schedule this year
in which over half of the delegates will be chosen in March, has
created a new dynamic where traditional get-out-the-vote operations
will be less important than television commercials and news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the aides said, they will not be counting on
their state organizations to do the kind of painstaking political
work that went on in Iowa and New Hampshire, namely identifying
swing voters and getting them to the polls. Instead, their
organizations will be dispatched mainly to amplify Bradley's
message through phone calls, literature and media events.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides also acknowledge that he will try to sharpen his
message and enliven his stump style in the coming weeks to win over
more traditional Democratic voters. Exit polls of voters in New
Hampshire showed that Bradley showed strong support among young
people, men, well-educated and affluent voters. But Gore won
handily among lower-income voters and women, the core of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   To win over those loyal party members, Bradley will work harder
at animating his daily stump speeches as well as drawing clearer
contrasts with Gore, including by continuing his attacks on the
vice president's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, for instance, Bradley sought to put Gore on the
defensive by demanding that he apologize for an incident on Sunday
when, according to Bradley's aides, a crowd of Gore campaign
workers shouted insults and threw mud at Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.,
who is supporting Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said those workers called Kerrey, who lost his foot in
Vietnam, a cripple. Gore has denied that anyone from his campaign
used that word.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem with the campaign that has an attitude that
allows these kinds of things to happen and then not to take
responsibility for them,'' Bradley said at a news conference
outside his speech in Manhattan. ``I think the American people
deserve somebody who's going to take responsibility for the actions
of those he's leading.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said, ``the Gore campaign is
not aware of anyone using that kind of language. Any such language
would not be condoned.''
</P>
<P>
   In television interviews Wednesday morning, Bradley also
acknowledged that his campaign would try to respond faster to
criticisms from the Gore campaign against his record and campaign
agenda, saying he felt that his campaign would be ``smarter and
better'' after its two losses.

 &HT;    Jackets reap, Dogs weep during signing day
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The contrast in emotions was sharp at Georgia Tech and
Georgia at the end of national signing day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the talk at Georgia Tech centered on the 22 players that
signed with the Jackets, including highly touted linebacker Hobie
Holiday and quarterbacks Brandon Sumner and Mark Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Georgia signed 18 players, including All-America
running back Albert Hollis, most of the talk from Athens focused on
who didn't sign with the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia lost three potential signees to Florida, including
Lithonia High receiver Kelvin Kight; two to Alabama and one to
Florida State. But receiver Reggie Brown and running back Musa
Smith are atop Georgia's signing class.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that we did not do nearly as well
in-state as we have been doing the last two years,'' Georgia coach
Jim Donnan said. ``But we do feel like we have some guys who can
really help our squad next year, which has a good returning nucleus
of players, and that is what you look at.''
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia Tech, coach George O'Leary's latest recruiting effort
yielded several offensive and defensive linemen and standout
running back Jimmy Dixon of Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the class we brought in, because it's
a class that will help us in all areas on the football field,''
O'Leary said. ``The last few classes we've signed have been good
classes, but this class is special because of the strength of the
players at every position.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tennessee, Florida, Florida State, Alabama, Penn
State and Arizona State are among the other schools that signed
strong recruiting classes on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers, by consensus, nailed down the No. 1 spot in the
recruiting game, edging Penn State, which had led going into the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions didn't fall far, to No. 2, and Florida had a
rush of talent and saw its class rated third as the day came to a
close.

 &HT;    Finances hurt English clubs
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lower-division clubs Gillingham and Tranmere Rovers
are basking in the glow of reaching the quarterfinals of England's
F.A. Cup. But the truth for many of their compatriots is that
financial disaster always lurks around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Second Division Gillingham shocked Sheffield Wednesday of the
Premier League with a 3-2 victory Saturday in a fifth-round match
to reach the last eight for the first time in its history.
Tranmere, of the First Division, stayed within its own league in
eliminating Fulham and already has ousted two Premier League
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the club at the bottom of the First Division, Swindon Town,
said two days later it is going into receivership because of more
than $2 million in debts, even after firing 15 front-office
workers. Tuesday, Scottish First Division side Airdrieonians went
into voluntary liquidation with mounting obligations.

   Swindon Town surely isn't the first of England's 92 professional
teams _ from the Premier League down through the Third Division _
to get in a financial bind. Only 10 clubs turned a profit last
season, none of them outside the top flight. Chairman Cliff Puffett
admitted in a Reuters interview over the weekend that taking a
gamble and going after the lucrative TV dollars of the newly formed
Premier League in 1992 has exacted a huge cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I believe that we are just one of the many
clubs who will be forced to take this decision,'' Puffett said.
``We tried to chase the dream of returning to the Premiership, and
it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wiltshire club, known as the ``Robins,'' played only one
year in the Premier League and whose only major title is the 1969
Football League Cup. Its best F.A. Cup finishes were the semis in
1910 and 1912. Even so, the club is known for gritty, if
unattractive, play.
</P>
<P>
   In an F.A. Cup match in December, I saw the Robins push Charlton
Athletic, probably a Premier League team next year, late into the
second half before falling. They weren't exceptionally skilled, but
their tiny band of traveling supporters, as most English clubs
boast, clearly inspired their task. To an American trained to view
sports as mostly entertainment, seeing a deep, abiding passion for
a club without flair or resume was a notable impression.
</P>
<P>
   The real tragedy is that Swindon Town no doubt will be ordered
to cut back salaries and sell its better players to get back in
financial good graces. That would virtually ensure its relegation
to the Second Division, where television revenues are nonexistent,
and probably render the dream of returning to the Premier League
almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's always the F.A. Cup, as Gillingham and
Tranmere can attest.

   AFRICA: NIGERIANS FINED
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian federation has been fined $20,000 by the
Confederation of African Football after fans of the Super Eagles
tossed plastic water bottles on the pitch after a 0-0 draw with
Congo. Despite that result, Nigeria qualified for the quarterfinal
round, no matter how it fares today against Morocco. All Morocco
needs is a draw to advance over Congo, whose coach Memy David, said
he is praying for a win by Nigeria. The Super Eagles, meanwhile,
have dropped starting striker Victor Ikpeba without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: NECAXA ROLLS Necaxa remained unbeaten after thrashing
Pachuca 4-0 on Sunday. Sergio Vazquez had two goals for the Mexico
City club, which has won its first three games in the Torneo Verano
season.... Cruz Azul earned its first victory in a 5-1 trouncing of
UAG, as Juan Palencia scored twice.... Club America, which scored
nine goals in its first two matches, was surprised 3-1 by Atletico
Celaya on goals from Jose Soto, Gustavo Napoles and Armando
Gonzales.... Atlas had been drubbed in its first two outings, but
it turned the tables with a 6-1 rout of Toros Neza. Miguel Zepeda
registered a hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: MADRID BOUNCES BACK
</P>
<P>
   Victories against Real Betis and Athletic Bilbao last week
vaulted once-struggling Real Madrid from 12th to fifth place in the
Primera Division. In the latter contest, it took goals from
Fernando Morientes and Raul Gonzalez in the second half to secure a
3-1 victory Sunday.... Real Betis has fired coach Carlos Griguol
and replaced him with former Valencia, Real Madrid and Dutch
national team coach Guus Hiddink, who was signed to a five-month
contract. The Seville side is mired in the relegation zone.
</P>
<P>
   S. AMERICA: COLOMBIA FIRING The humiliation of losing to Brazil
9-0 in an Under-23 Olympic qualifier didn't seem to dawn on coach
Javier Alvarez, who was fired by the Colombian federation Tuesday,
less than a month before Brazil arrives to open 2002 World Cup
qualifying. ``Life is full of blunders,'' Alvarez said in parting.

SENATE APPROVES OVERHAUL OF BANKRUPTCY LAWS AND AN INCREASE IN
MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved a sweeping overhaul of the
nation's bankruptcy laws on Wednesday, decisively passing a measure
that would make it harder for people to seek legal protection from
payment of their debts.
</P>
<P>
   But in a move that could complicate final enactment of the
legislation, it also included in the measure a $1 increase over
three years in the minimum wage to $6.15 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Major differences still exist in the details of the bankruptcy
overhaul passed on Wednesday and a rival House version approved
last year. But lawmakers from both parties and Clinton
administration officials expressed confidence on Wednesday that
Congress can produce a compromise bankruptcy bill that Clinton can
sign into law this year.
</P>
<P>
   Less certain is how Democrats and Republicans will resolve their
differences over the minimum wage. Democrats had preferred that the
$1 increase be phased in over two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote on Wednesday passing the Bankruptcy Reform Act
came after Democrats summoned Vice President Al Gore from the
campaign trail in New York City to break a possible tie vote on a
contentious abortion rights amendment also included in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who had vigorously opposed the amendment, which
would bar people convicted of crimes against abortion clinics from
using bankruptcy protection to avoid paying civil judgments,
abandoned their opposition once Gore took his seat as president of
the Senate. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
passed handily, 80-17.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted 83-14 to approve the overarching legislation that
was proposed by the nation's largest banks and credit card
companies, but opposed by consumer and civil rights groups. One
reason the outcome was so lopsided is the campaign contributions
and lobbying muscle come mainly from the politically powerful
financial community, concentrated in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry has grown increasingly concerned that too
many people with money are taking advantage of the bankruptcy laws
and skipping out on mountains of debt. ``Despite their ability to
pay, wealthier filers walk away from an estimated $3 billion per
year in debt,'' said Edward L. Yingling, chief lobbyist for the
American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The measure imposes new income requirements on people seeking a
fresh start by using the nation's debt-forgiveness laws. It limited
a loophole exploited by the wealthy to shield their homes. And the
bill requires credit-card companies to disclose interest rates and
fees more prominently on monthly statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time for Congress to close the loopholes that let big
spenders walk away from debts and update the code to achieve a
healthier balance between consumers and creditors,'' said Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who sponsored the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from the Senate will now meet with their
counterparts from the House to reconcile competing bills. Last
year, the House approved, 313- 108, a bill with even stricter
provisions on debtors. The White House said both versions are
unacceptable, calling the House version too harsh and inflexible
and the tax breaks attached to the minimum-wage provision in the
Senate measure unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who in her campaign
for the Senate in New York has criticized the legislation for being
unfair to women and children, declined to comment today on the
Senate's action.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate bill, the minimum wage would increase to $6.15
from $5.15 over three years, instead of over two years as Democrats
want. Senate Democrats also object to $76 billion in tax breaks
over 10 years that Republicans say would help small businesses
adjust to the rising minimum wage. Democrats had proposed $29
billion package over 10 years. The House bill does not have a
minimum wage provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amendment in the bill includes a poorly targeted tax
package with tax breaks that are skewed disproportionately to upper
income people,'' said a letter signed by all 45 Senate Democrats to
the lawmakers who will negotiate the House-Senate compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of both House and Senate bills is to make it more
difficult for people to discharge their debts. Both measures try to
make debtors accept more responsibility by making it more difficult
to file Chapter 7 bankruptcies, which allows consumers to discharge
unsecured debts that remain after assets are liquidated. Lawmakers
aim to make Chapter 13, which requires reorganization of debt under
a repayment plan, the bankruptcy of choice.
</P>
<P>
   With Americans filing a record 1.4 million bankruptcies in 1998,
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said the bill ``closes loopholes and
ends unfairness in provisions that are totally being abused and
making a mockery out of legitimate bankruptcy law.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the measure, like Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., said on Wednesday that ``the industry's cure is worse than
the disease.'' Bankruptcy filings dropped by 112,000 in 1999 from
1998, Kennedy said, and the bill's provisions make it more
difficult for thousands of debtors who file for bankruptcy because
of corporate layoffs and downsizing because of mergers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At issue in several days of floor debate and outside Capitol
Hill today, was whether it is the banks or their customers who are
responsible for the growth in bankruptcy filings.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Consumer Federation of America, Howard M.
Metzenbaum, a former Democratic senator from Ohio, said the Senate
bill ``will deny many families in financial crisis a fresh start
while spurring more reckless and irresponsible lending by credit
card issuers.''
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators have a tough road ahead. There are
several key differences between the two bills.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures impose a new income requirement. The Senate bill
generally says that anyone with the ability to make at least
$15,000 in payments over five years would not be able to have their
debts forgiven. Under the House bill, the threshold is $6,000 over
5 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is more generous than the House in shielding, or
creating ``safe harbors'' for debtors who make less than the median
income in their state or regions.
</P>
<P>
   For Chapter 7 bankruptcy filers, the Senate puts a $100,000 cap
on housing equity they can exempt from creditors' motions. The
House bill has a cap of $250,000, but allows states to opt out, an
important distinction for wealthy bankruptcy filers in Texas and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Senate bill provides new consumer protections, such
as the disclosures on credit cards. The House protection is more
limited and more generic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proverbial small type that hides fees and interest costs
will be converted to large font so that consumers can make informed
purchases, determine the best repayment schedule and manage family
expenses,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   While adopting Schumer's amendment, Senators rejected several
others, including one offered by Sen. Carl Levin, Democrat of
Michigan, that would have prohibited gun makers and dealers from
using bankruptcy to escape debts incurred in civil lawsuits.

FRIENDS SHARE PAIN OF A MOTHER WHO OUTLIVED HER CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Claire Barnett was returning to Seattle Tuesday from a
vacation weekend out of town, anticipating a reunion with her two
little girls, Coriander and Blake.
</P>
<P>
   She expected to hear about their trip to Mexico on the weekend,
the one they took with their dad, Claire's ex-husband, their
stepmother and two little stepbrothers.
</P>
<P>
   But when her plane stopped over in San Francisco at 11 a.m.
Tuesday, Barnett, a Seattle physician, was surprised to find her
mother and sister and a friend there to intercept her, flown in by
Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   She had not heard that Alaska Airlines Flight 261 had crashed
into the Pacific Ocean near Los Angeles the day before.
</P>
<P>
   She did not know that her ex-husband, physician David Clemetson,
his wife, Carolyn, and all the children were among the 88 people
missing.
</P>
<P>
   She did not know she was the lone survivor of the Clemetson
family.
</P>
<P>
   She did not know she had lost those she loved most in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Barnett's family and many friends closed ranks around
her. A former nanny was expected to fly in from England to help.
Her sister, Emily, said Barnett remained in seclusion, shattered.
</P>
<P>
   But while they protected her, they didn't want her to be lost in
the tragedy, forgotten as a mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a profound level of suffering because those
girls were her reason for being, and now she needs a new reason for
being,'' said a close family friend, Brian Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the mom who bore Cori and Blake, who had her own
special joy with them,'' added Marcy Bloom.``She's probably the
most devoted parent I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, 39, in family practice, worked for several years at
Magnolia Family Medicine before moving on last year to specialize
in women's health. She met David Clemetson at Brown University, in
Rhode Island, when he was serving his residency.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett shared custody and responsibility for the children with
her ex-husband. Last weekend was his weekend to take the children,
so he planned the trip to Mexico. The girls, Coriander, 8, and
Blake, 6, went with their dad, stepmother Carolyn and stepbrothers
Miles, 6, and Spencer, 6 months.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett and Clemetson were devoted to ensuring their daughters
were enveloped in two individual family circles full of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both committed to making it work with the girls,
making huge personal sacrifices to make it work,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two girls had a nice stepmom and an incredibly loving dad.
They all adored those girls,'' Bloom said. ``Cori and Blake clung
to their mom like there was no tomorrow. They always wanted to be
around her.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett's many friends, who joined her parents and siblings at
her house yesterday, said she radiates an energy and exuberance for
life that attracts others.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and his wife, Claudia Benbow, saw Barnett's joy when she
was a birthing partner at the birth of one of their children.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes it so hard now to see her endure the pain of a
mother who outlives her children, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a family doctor, she has delivered many a child into
this world, and enjoyed it very much,'' Benbow said. ``Now hers are
taken away. We don't know how she's going to move through this.
They were her life, her core and her anchor.''

 &HT;    Love tops in money, but Woods closing in
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Quick. Name the career money-winner on the PGA Tour?
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not Greg Norman. Or Tom Kite. Or Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As of last weekend, it's Sea Island's Davis Love III, who didn't
even win a tournament last year.
</P>
<P>
   With a tie for 18th at the Phoenix Open, Love earned $41,728 and
moved past Norman ($12,507,322) on the career money list, reaching
$12,548,297 in his 15th season.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised, however, if Love, with 13 PGA Tour
victories, maintains a low-key approach to the distinction. Woods,
who made $6.6 million last year and has 16 tour victories, probably
will be passing him soon. Fortunate to be dominating golf when
purses hit their peak, Woods is No. 3 on the career money list in
his fourth year, with $11,837,128.
</P>
<P>
   LEHMAN'S LATEST LESSON
</P>
<P>
   So far, the good guys are winning.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is the best in the world. Jesper Parnevik is one of
Europe's most popular players. Paul Azinger and Tom Lehman are two
of the most likable players on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's victory at the Phoenix Open was special because he is a
Scottsdale, Ga., resident who frequently plays the tournament
course. It also was his first official event on the PGA Tour since
the 1996 Tour Championship. However, he also won in the 1997 Loch
Lomond Invitational in Scotland and the Williams World Challenge
last month, a $1 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman attributes some of his recent mental edge to a stable
personal and family life. He also has gained from watching those
rare times when Woods must manage his game when it isn't at its
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when Tiger is not playing well, he manages to keep his
game together and not throw shots away,'' said Lehman, who seems to
own more than his five official PGA Tour victories. ``That's not
what I've been doing. I've been beating myself the last three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   CAMPBELL'S ALMOST AS HOT
</P>
<P>
   Woods is the biggest story in golf as he attempts to secure a
sixth PGA Tour victory in a row, at this week's AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am. But don't forget about Michael Campbell. Known for
his near-miss at the 1995 British Open after leading through 54
holes, the New Zealander has three victories in his past seven
events, including two in a row. Campbell, 30, who was bothered by a
wrist injury until the past four months, managed to win by six
shots in Sunday's Heineken Classic in Perth, Australia. ... Spain's
Miguel Angel Jimenez (No. 21 in the world) and South Africa's
Retief Goosen (No. 32) have received sponsor exemptions to the
BellSouth Classic on March 30-April 2 at the TPC at Sugarloaf.
EQUIPMENT DEAL FOR DALY?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, John Daly's popularity remains strong enough to
offset his personal baggage. Tommy Armour is reported to be
announcing an irons deal with Daly at this weekend's PGA
Merchandise Show in Orlando. He has been without an equipment
contract since he was dropped by Callaway Golf six months ago after
declining to undergo treatment for alcohol and gambling addiction.
Interestingly, Daly has partnered with the non-alcoholic drink
firm, Sobe. ``There are a bunch of different flavors, and they
taste good with vodka,'' Daly said.... At one time there was talk
of Woods playing with Michael Jordan at Pebble Beach, but that was
before Jordan became a part owner of the NBA Washington Wizards.
Woods' partner will beformer Stanford teammate Jerry Chang. They
could be playing with Mark O'Meara and amateur partner Ken
Griffey.... Kite, a former Ryder Cup captain who is about to join
the Senior Tour, on the raging player-compensation issue from last
year's matches: ``It came up when I was captain _ and I truthfully
thought the PGA would do something about it after the '97 Ryder Cup
matches, and they didn't.''

<P>
   After being trounced in Iowa and surviving a five-point loss in
New Hampshire on Tuesday, Bill Bradley managed to make it to the
next phase of his campaign Wednesday, flying into New York in
preparation for a primary that his advisers say is critical to any
hope he has of being the Democratic candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   And who was there to greet him, but the very face of Democratic
politics in New York, Edward Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Koch endorsed Bradley's rival, Al Gore, during the vice
president's first presidential campaign in 1988, and proceeded to
escort his candidate to a third place defeat that Gore has never
forgotten. But Wednesday, at a rally with New York University
students near Washington Square Park, the former mayor invoked the
``crusade for Robert Kennedy' of 1968 in urging Democrats to
support Bradley in the primary, as Bradley applauded in approval of
his new supporter.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democratic and Republican candidates for president,
Wednesday marked a new period in the primary campaign, as the
compact stages of Iowa and New Hampshire gave way to a sprawling
contest that will stretch from coast to coast over the next five
weeks. It will culminate on March 7, with a battery of Republican
and Democratic primaries in 16 states including California, Ohio,
Missouri, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York that the candidates
are viewing as so important they virtually constitute a national
primary.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them may prove to be as important, certainly to
Bradley, or as interesting, as the one he began campaigning for
Wednesday, with the slightly odd if revealing image of Koch sharing
the stage with him. The New York primary has become a rite of
passage for Democratic candidates who want to be president.
Although 16 Democratic primaries and caucuses will take place
between now and March 7, if history is any guide, none will test
and torture these candidates as much as New York's.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, New York primaries have taken on legendary proportions
among candidates and consultants, including both those who have
survived them and those who have not, for its peculiarly intense
mix of ethnic politics, warring constituency groups, and a media
market that was round-the-clock and personal well before that
became the standard in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game of politics is played with a sort of speed and
toughness in New York that makes it tougher than anyplace else in
the country,'' said Susan Erich, who was the campaign manager for
Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor who won the 1988
Democratic primary in the state. ``It's fun to watch. It's fun to
talk about. And it's decidedly not fun to be at the center of.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Friedman, a longtime political consultant, said: ``The New
York primary is always an explosion waiting to happen. New York is
a state where you have to be wary of your friends, as well as your
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York experience, as a generation of political
consultants and candidates have come to remember it, will be at
once intensified and diluted this year by the shape of the
political calendar. For the Democrats, there are five weeks until
the New York primary, or nearly five times the time span as between
Iowa and New Hampshire. That allows candidates plenty of time to
get entangled by some New York issue, or stumble into some ethnic
minefield.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fact that New York is one of many states this time
means that Bradley and Gore will, their aides say, most likely be
coming in here a day at a time, avoiding the sort of prolonged
visit that Paul Begala, who advised President Clinton during his
1992 primary battle in the state, likened to ``riding over Niagara
Falls in a barrel.'' Begala said he had always thought it was apt
that this was the state where Clinton, in an interview with Marcia
Kramer on WCBS-TV, made the remark about inhaling that became a
symbol of Clinton's way with words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique political culture,'' Begala said. ``It's
arguably the most vibrant and exciting. You've just got to ride
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are in a slightly different situation.
Nationally, there is a primary in South Carolina on Feb. 15. In
addition, John McCain, the Arizona senator who won the New
Hampshire Republican primary, has been knocked off the ballot in 12
of the state's 31 congressional districts because of challenges by
the state's Republican establishment. McCain is challenging his
disqualifications in court.
</P>
<P>
   Gore got a small preview of what lies ahead early Wednesday
morning as the vice president, after a half-hour of sleep following
his flight from New Hampshire, headed to Grand Central Terminal,
where he shook hands with commuters while a battery of television
cameras marked what was the effective start of his own second
primary campaign in New York. Gore had just finished what had been
a picture-perfect campaign event and was heading back to his
motorcade when a shout pierced the morning stillness.
</P>
<P>
   ``GO BRADLEY!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore paused for a moment as Bradley's name echoed through the
quiet terminal. And than, his smile still fixed and steady, he
continued toward the door.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The basic outlines of the Democratic contest in New York are
fairly clear. Gore, having learned from his loss in 1988, has
collected the support of most of the party's Democratic structure:
Nearly all of the state's major elected Democrats, leaders of key
constituency groups and, perhaps most significant in a primary,
unions. Thus, Gore was accompanied on his walk through Grand
Central Terminal by, among other people, Sheldon Silver, the
speaker of the state Assembly, and Carl McCall, the state
comptroller and likely candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   There is a history of attractive insurgents winning Democratic
primary campaigns, and Bradley is trying to put himself in that
mold. In contrast to the group that accompanied Gore to Grand
Central, Bradley filled his stage Wednesday with a more eclectic
one, including lower-level elected officials, basketball players,
the singer Patti Smith, political operatives and, of course, Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Against that known backdrop, New York advisers to Gore and
Bradley are trying to prepare for the unknown that has come to
distinguish contests in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Will the candidates be asked, for example, to offer an opinion
on the trial of four police officers in the shooting of Amadou
Diallo? (If history is any indication, they should count on it.)
</P>
<P>
   Will Gore ask the Rev. Jesse Jackson to come to New York and
campaign for him? Some of his supporters are pushing the move as a
way of ensuring a heavy black turn-out; others worry that Jackson
remains a problematic figure among Jewish voters, who remain a
sizable factor in Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has already complained about
Gore's refusal thus far to hold a public meeting with him, seek to
influence the outcome of this contest?
</P>
<P>
   But the most intriguing question might well end up being the
interplay with a statewide contest in New York that has so far
overshadowed the presidential race: The battle between Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Clinton has said she
will formally announce her Senate candidacy on Sunday, and will
then begin a week of campaigning across the state. She has endorsed
Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Bradley share the same senior New York Democrat _
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the retiring senator _ as perhaps their
most prominent supporter. Clinton has so far avoided offering any
critical words about Bradley. But she could find herself under
pressure to do precisely that if Gore feels that he is in danger of
losing New York.

NEW AIDS MYSTERY: PROSTITUTES WHO HAVE REMAINED IMMUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the mysteries of the AIDS epidemic is
that a small number of female prostitutes in Africa seem resistant
to the virus that causes the disease even though they often have
sex with infected men.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an intensive search for an immunologic explanation, none
have been found.
</P>
<P>
   Now an even more baffling finding has turned up in a study of
1,900 prostitutes in Nairobi, Kenya. Four of them became infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, but only after they stopped
working as prostitutes or took breaks of two months or more,
leaders of the study reported at the Seventh Conference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, which ended here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists cannot explain this seeming paradox but say the
answer could affect development of an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The prostitutes work in a Nairobi slum. In 1984, researchers
from the University of Nairobi and the University of Manitoba in
Winnipeg, Canada, began to study and treat the women's sexually
transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   When the women enrolled in the study, two-thirds of them were
infected with HIV. The prostitutes said they had five clients a day
on average and used condoms with about four of them. The
researchers estimated that each prostitute had unprotected sex with
60 to 70 infected clients a year.
</P>
<P>
   A small percentage of the prostitutes remained free of infection
for at least three years. No link has been found between the women
who became infected after stopping commercial sex and their condom
use or sex practices.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Wolinsky, an AIDS researcher at Northwestern
University, called the findings provocative and said he had
confidence in them because they came from a scientific team known
for meticulous work.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been stymied in identifying what immunologic
factor specifically correlates with protection against HIV
infection. Findings from the Nairobi study may provide another way
of seeking the factors that are known as correlates of immunity,
Wolinsky said in an interview at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Such information is needed to help create a vaccine. But the
findings could be bad news for vaccine development if they meant
that booster doses would be needed every few weeks to maintain
protection, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who directs the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci offered two possible explanations for the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   It could be, he said, that to maintain protection, people need
nearly continual exposure to HIV so that antigens in the virus can
constantly boost the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he said, perhaps sperm or semen somehow stimulate a
relatively short-lived immunologic reaction in the women that
protects them.
</P>
<P>
   If either explanation is correct, an effective HIV vaccine may
need to be given frequently, Fauci said.

MOST WOMEN APPLICANTS FAIL PHYSICAL TEST FOR NYC FIRE DEPT. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite an expanded effort to recruit hundreds of
athletic women for careers as firefighters, city officials say that
only 11 scored high enough on a battery of exams, including a
physically demanding test, to have a chance at being hired for the
overwhelmingly male force.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the 850 women who registered to take the Fire
Department tests dropped out before the written exam last
September, the officials said. Only a third of the 354 women who
passed the written exam then showed up for the physical test in
December. Of that number, only 11 female candidates did well enough
on the physical exam to have a hope of being hired, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,000-member department has only 36 women, and its failure
to hire female recruits has made it a target of lawsuits in the
past and leaves it confronting the delicate issue of how to draw
more women to a force known for its male bravado. Besides seeking
out women with athletic backgrounds, it has also set up a training
program to prepare women for the rigorous physical test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a great frustration and disappointment,'' said Deputy
Fire Commissioner Lynn Tierney, who led what she called the
department's biggest recruiting campaign for women. ``I had thought
we would put many more women in a position to be hired.''
</P>
<P>
   When the women were given the physical part of the test, 10 of
105 candidates recorded a perfect score of 100, which is generally
the score needed to be hired. (Another woman who scored lower is in
a position to be hired because she is part of a promotional program
for emergency medical technicians who already work for the
department.)
</P>
<P>
   The number of high-performing women represents clear progress.
But the percentage of women with perfect scores was only 9.5
percent, while nearly 57 percent of the 1,016 men posted perfect
scores.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the department did not plan to relax the
standards. That, they said, would jeopardize public safety.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I've got 11,000 firefighters and 10 million people I have to
think about every day,'' said Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen,
``so we have to have the most physically capable people. But I
believe we must continue to reach out and find women who are
capable and then prepare them for a difficult physical test.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Brenda Berkman, president of the United Women Firefighters,
said that even more resources should be devoted to recruiting,
noting that only a tiny share of the 17,000 candidates who took the
written test, 450 or 2.6 percent, were women.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 36 female firefighters, 31 were hired based on a 1982
physical exam administered for female candidates after a federal
judge ruled that the previous test was discriminatory and not
sufficiently job-related. The test was later changed to better
simulate actual firefighting tasks and the scoring system was
revised. But in the ensuing 18 years, only five women have been
hired, primarily because women seldom scored as high as men on the
physical exam. During many of those years, female firefighters also
often complained of harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tierney said, the department reached out to sports
leagues, coaches' associations and military posts to recruit
athletic women. Berkman, however, said the number of women who
registered for this test, 850, was not markedly higher than in
earlier exams, which are given every four or five years.
</P>
<P>
   The city also helped arrange private financing for a four-month
training program for female candidates. All the women who had
passed the written test were invited to work out three times a week
with exercise professionals, assisted by nine of the current female
firefighters. About three dozen women routinely attended the
training sessions, said Nick McNickle, the director of the program,
including 9 of the 10 women who posted perfect scores.
</P>
<P>
   The physical test, which carries equal weight with the written
exam, consists of eight events intended to simulate the sort of
activities that firefighters perform in the field, like raising a
20-foot ladder. Since thousands of men usually pass all eight
events, only those women who do just as well have any chance of
being hired.
</P>
<P>
   McNickle said that certain parts of the test, like the hose
feed, were particularly hard for women. The hose feed is designed
to simulate feeding 50 feet of one-and-three-quarter-inch
water-filled hose to firefighters in less than 19 seconds as they
advance toward a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without extensive training,'' he said, ``the average woman's
forearm strength is below what is required on this test.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials are evaluating a different physical examination
that was prepared by national firefighter groups and closely
resembles the current test, except that it is scored differently.
Officials said no decision had been made on whether to adopt it.
</P>
<P>
   McNickle said that during the training sessions, including many
held outdoors in bad weather, he was struck by the dedication of
the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in the bitter cold, the wind and the rain,'' he
said, ``and they brought lots of energy because they wanted other
women to have a chance to follow in their footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the trainees, Michele Fitzsimmons, a 30-year-old Queens
woman who scored 100 on the physical exam, said she thought the
test was fair. She said she had not heard any complaints from other
women, including those who failed a section or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them said they gave it their best shot and they did
what they could,'' she said. ``And the women who are young enough
to do it said they were coming back to do it again, because they
believe they can.''

ISRAELI SAYS U.S. FEARS ENDANGER MAJOR PURCHASE OF APACHE COPTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMON AIR FORCE BASE, Israel _ U.S. reluctance to share secret
military software with Israel threatens a possible $800 million
Israeli purchase of Boeing combat helicopters, the air force
commander said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The air force had decided to place an initial $415 million order
for 12 Apache Longbow helicopters, with an option for another
dozen, the commander, Maj. Gen. Eitan Ben-Eliahu, told foreign
journalists on a visit to this southern desert base.
</P>
<P>
   But Ben-Eliahu said Pentagon officials did not want to give
Israel classified codes to operate programs on the on-board
computers, information that Israel considers essential to maintain
and modify its complex weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot maintain an aircraft for the short term or the long
term if you don't have access to the systems,'' he said in an
unusual on-the-record group interview. ``We are talking about the
very basic and elementary software code.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman for the Pentagon, P.J. Crowley, said
Washington was discussing the sale ``to help Israel maintain its
security and qualitative edge.'' But Crowley pointed out that the
helicopters for Israel were ``not identical'' to the Apache
Longbows that the United States flies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One concern for Defense Department officials is that they
suspect that Israel has shared sensitive U.S. military technology
with India and China, customers of its own small but vibrant arms
industry. The Israeli government insists that it has safeguarded
U.S. military secrets and exported only its own technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and believe that this will be resolved,'' Ben-Eliahu
said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's decade-old fleet of 42 Apaches is in almost daily
combat use, flying three-hour round-trip sorties to southern
Lebanon from carefully camouflaged hangars here. Air Force officers
say their bombing raids against Hezbollah guerrilla targets would
be more effective and pose less risk to crews if they could use the
newer Longbow Apaches.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The air force ultimately wants to buy 48 Longbows, a $1.6
billion order, local press reports say. The new Apaches would be
bought with money from the $2 billion annual U.S. military aid
appropriation, most of which has to be spent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Eliahu said the copters were not included in a $17 billion
shopping list of military hardware and base construction that
Israel seeks from the United States as part of a possible peace
accord with Syria, along with negotiated withdrawals from Lebanon
and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of peace with Syria and Lebanon has not caused the
air force to scale back its quest for more aerial firepower. With
an eye toward possible ballistic missile threats from Iran and
Iraq, Israel is seeking cruise missiles from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force commander acknowledged that deploying the cruise
missiles would require continual access to raw U.S. military
satellite information, another expected point of contention with
the Pentagon.

 &HT;    Weak finish has Donnan disappointed
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's recruiting class was more than adequate
in addressing the needs of the football program.
</P>
<P>
   But as for addressing wants, it left much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Donnan admitted as much Wednesday about his fifth
recruiting class at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Although he pointed out the positives about the Bulldogs' latest
group of recruits, Donnan made no attempt to hide his
disappointment in this year's weak finish. He had held out hope
that several top recruits would sign with them on national signing
day. However, none came their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say our recruiting class was about like our team last
year; it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be,'' he said. ``We got
beaten up some in the state and that worries me. ... But I also
know we got some good players that are going to help our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who return 18 of 22 starters from last season's
8-4 team, came into the recruiting season with three pressing needs
_ running backs, quarterbacks and defensive backs _ and they appear
to have shored up those areas. In all, Georgia signed 18 players,
seven on offense and 11 on defense.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the talk Wednesday was about the ones that got away.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs signed only two of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's Super 11 selections. They let several of the
top players slip across the state line and lost head-to-head
battles with Georgia Tech on others.
</P>
<P>
   But the pain of such losses was eased with such out-of-state
talent as running backs Albert Hollis II of Sacramento, Calif., and
Musa Smith of Elliottsburg, Pa. Both are high school All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running-back-wise, we felt like the two backs we got are among
the better ones we've signed since we've been here,'' Donnan said.
``Musa Smith is a big, strong back and Albert Hollis is one of the
fastest guys in the country and probably the most highly recruited
guy we signed this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Donnan said he thinks that Georgia's group of
quarterbacks has been underrated by national recruiting experts.
Three quarterbacks were signed _ David Greene of Lithonia, Sean
Jones of Atlanta and Matt Redding of Madison, Fla. _ and they will
contend for playing time behind junior Quincy Carter next fall.
</P>
<P>
   The big disappointment of the day was the reversal of linebacker
Brooks Daniels. A 6-4, 195-pounder from Jasper, Fla., he committed
on Sunday and had confirmed as late as Tuesday night that he
planned to sign with the Bulldogs. But he signed with Alabama on
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan had scheduled his news conference for 1:20 p.m. but
delayed it an hour and 40 minutes while they waited for word on
Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we had to wait, too,'' Donnan quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Other signing-day losses for Georgia included Orangeburg, S.C.,
lineman Alex Barron to Florida State; Lake City, Fla., defensive
back Tre Orr, Lithonia wide receiver Kelvin Kight and Orlando
lineman Max Starks to Florida; and Memphis defensive lineman Albert
Means to Alabama. Georgia was also a finalist for Opelousas, La.,
running back Devery Henderson, who committed to and then signed
with LSU.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moving to stem the trend of huge consolidation in
the oil industry, the federal government decided on Wednesday to
try to block BP Amoco's $30 billion proposed acquisition of
Atlantic Richfield Co.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 3-2, the Federal Trade Commission chose to seek a
preliminary injunction against the deal. Commission officials
asserted, and the companies denied, that the merger would be
strongly anticompetitive and could lead to significant rises in the
price of crude oil for refiners in California and other West Coast
states, where prices at the gas pump far exceed the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco and Arco together control about 70 percent of the
production of oil on Alaska's North Slope, much of which ends up in
the gas tanks of West Coast consumers. Last year, the companies
agreed with Alaska state officials to reduce their control to about
55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said that the FTC's vote made the proposed
merger the largest in American history both in terms of revenue _
$100 billion in the year ending Sept. 30 _ and purchase price to be
challenged by the government. It is the first in the oil industry
since the commission blocked the Mobil Corp.'s $6.5 billion bid to
buy Marathon Oil in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal will cement market power and harm competition by
creating a significant risk that crude oil prices would be higher
on the West Coast than they would without the deal,'' said Richard
G. Parker, the director of the bureau of competition at the
commission. ``What this case is about at a fundamental level is a
dominant firm that is already exercising market power buying the
one firm, Arco, that is the one threat to that market power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition in the past has caused these firms to claw each
other's eyes out to get oil in Alaska,'' Parker said at a news
conference here on Wednesday afternoon. ``Now that competition is
disappearing unless we are able to obtain relief in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the oil companies have said that prices on the
West Coast are not set by Alaska production, but by the world
market, and that the government was unfairly penalizing their deal
to make a broader statement about consolidation in an industry
which has seen Exxon swallow Mobil, BP purchase Amoco, and Texaco
enter into a joint marketing venture with Shell.
</P>
<P>
   The executives also said that the government had rejected what
they called reasonable offers to divest many assets _ including the
rough equivalent of all Arco's Alaskan production _ to eliminate
the problems raised by antitrust lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absurd to argue that the price of oil can be controlled
by any company, country or agency in today's market,'' said Youssef
M. Ibrahim, a vice president at BP Amoco USA. ``Alaska crude oil
represents about 28 percent of the oil refined on the West Coast.
What the government is suggesting is that we can push around an oil
market whose producers include Saudis, Venezuelans, Mexicans and
California. Can we do that? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   But some officials at the commission and lawmakers such as Sen.
Ron Wyden, D-Ore., replied that the deal was flawed from the outset
and could not be remedied by divestitures.
</P>
<P>
   The case will now move to Federal District Court in San
Francisco, where lawyers for the commission, along with state
officials from Oregon and Washington, will file papers asserting
that the deal violates the Clayton Antitrust Act and seek a
preliminary injunction to prevent the deal from closing.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever side loses that fight may appeal the decision;
additionally, a second trial may begin at any time before an
administrative law judge over the merits of the corporate
combination.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Wednesday's decision will delay for many
months the closing of the deal. If the government ultimately
prevails, BP Amoco's acquisition would have to be scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the government sought the injunction for three
reasons. The merger, he said, would reduce competition by refiners
that use Alaskan crude oil; it would also substantially diminish
the quality of bidding among oil companies that want to lease and
develop Alaskan lands owned by the state and federal government.
Finally, he contended, the deal would enable BP Amoco and Arco to
manipulate the price of oil futures because the companies control a
major crude oil marketing hub in Cushing, Okla., that is used to
store West Texas Intermediate crude, the most actively traded
futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said, though, that they had already satisfied
Alaskan authorities of any anticompetitive effects from the deal by
agreeing to reduce their combined ownership of oil production.
</P>
<P>
   The executives also said they had proposed to sell major storage
and pipeline assets in Cushing to allay the concerns of federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   FTC challenges to corporate deals recently have usually forced
the companies involved to drop their plans to merge. But BP Amoco
has vowed to confront the agency in court and complete its
acquisition of Arco. In recent weeks, even as the two companies
proposed new concessions and divestitures in an effort to persuade
a majority of commissioners to approve the deal, executives said
they were confident that they have a strong legal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's argument comes from an era when government
agencies were trying to regulate how businesses do business,''
Ibrahim, the BP Amoco vice president, said. ``That's fine for the
1970s, but it does not make sense in an era of globalization.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials in Alaska, which had heavily lobbied the FTC to
approve the deal, also said they were dissatisfied by Wednesday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   `Most Alaskans are very disappointed that today's decision fails
to resolve the issue,' said Gov. Tony Knowles, a Republican.
``Alaska's interests and America's interests in developing North
Slope oil and gas are being put in the deep freeze and, once again,
Alaska's future is left to be decided in a distant court.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as lawyers for both sides began preparations for
court proceedings, Sir John Browne, BP Amoco's top executive, made
a final pitch to Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade
Commission, to accept the deal with conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitofsky, who in recent months has said that oil industry
mergers would receive heightened scrutiny because of the wave of
consolidation, apparently was not moved by Browne's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky, whom officials said has been the most skeptical of the
commissioners about the deal, was joined in his opposition to it by
two other Democratic appointees, Sheila F. Anthony and Mozell W.
Thompson. The commission's two Republican appointees, Orson Swindle
and Thomas B. Leary, dissented, saying they believed it was
premature to seek an injunction and suggesting they wanted to
pursue further settlement talks.

FRIENDS SHARE PAIN OF A MOTHER WHO OUTLIVED HER CHILDREN

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Claire Barnett was returning to Seattle Tuesday from a
vacation weekend out of town, anticipating a reunion with her two
little girls, Coriander and Blake.
</P>
<P>
   She expected to hear about their trip to Mexico on the weekend,
the one they took with their dad, Claire's ex-husband, their
stepmother and two little stepbrothers.
</P>
<P>
   But when her plane stopped over in San Francisco at 11 a.m.
Tuesday, Barnett, a Seattle physician, was surprised to find her
mother and sister and a friend there to intercept her, flown in by
Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   She had not heard that Alaska Airlines Flight 261 had crashed
into the Pacific Ocean near Los Angeles the day before.
</P>
<P>
   She did not know that her ex-husband, physician David Clemetson,
his wife, Carolyn, and all the children were among the 88 people
missing.
</P>
<P>
   She did not know she was the lone survivor of the Clemetson
family.
</P>
<P>
   She did not know she had lost those she loved most in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Barnett's family and many friends closed ranks around
her. A former nanny was expected to fly in from England to help.
Her sister, Emily, said Barnett remained in seclusion, shattered.
</P>
<P>
   But while they protected her, they didn't want her to be lost in
the tragedy, forgotten as a mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a profound level of suffering because those
girls were her reason for being, and now she needs a new reason for
being,'' said a close family friend, Brian Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the mom who bore Cori and Blake, who had her own
special joy with them,'' added Marcy Bloom.``She's probably the
most devoted parent I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, 39, in family practice, worked for several years at
Magnolia Family Medicine before moving on last year to specialize
in women's health. She met David Clemetson at Brown University, in
Rhode Island, when he was serving his residency.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett shared custody and responsibility for the children with
her ex-husband. Last weekend was his weekend to take the children,
so he planned the trip to Mexico. The girls, Coriander, 8, and
Blake, 6, went with their dad, stepmother Carolyn and stepbrothers
Miles, 6, and Spencer, 6 months.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett and Clemetson were devoted to ensuring their daughters
were enveloped in two individual family circles full of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both committed to making it work with the girls,
making huge personal sacrifices to make it work,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two girls had a nice stepmom and an incredibly loving dad.
They all adored those girls,'' Bloom said. ``Cori and Blake clung
to their mom like there was no tomorrow. They always wanted to be
around her.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett's many friends, who joined her parents and siblings at
her house yesterday, said she radiates an energy and exuberance for
life that attracts others.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and his wife, Claudia Benbow, saw Barnett's joy when she
was a birthing partner at the birth of one of their children.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes it so hard now to see her endure the pain of a
mother who outlives her children, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a family doctor, she has delivered many a child into
this world, and enjoyed it very much,'' Benbow said. ``Now hers are
taken away. We don't know how she's going to move through this.
They were her life, her core and her anchor.''

 &HT;    'Impact players' restock defense for Georgia Tech
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary could hardly contain
his glee Wednesday over the signing of 22 high school recruits for
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The class, which includes 10 players chosen to All-America
teams, could be among the 10 best in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a class that will help us in all areas on the football
field,'' O'Leary said. ``The last few classes we've signed have
been good classes, but this class is special because of the
strength of the players at every position.
</P>
<P>
   ``All positions were helped with impact-type players,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the list is Parade All-America linebacker Hobie Holiday
from Houston County High in Warner Robins. Holiday is joined by two
other highly regarded linebackers, Daryl Smith of Albany's
Dougherty County High and Keyaron Fox of Westlake-Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my coaching days, that's probably the most talented group
of linebackers I've seen coming in,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach's enthusiasm was dampened by finding out that veteran
linebacker Matt Uremovich has been informed by doctors that his
playing days are over. Uremovich missed the last part of the season
because of a compressed vertebra in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the doctors' call,'' O'Leary said. ``I'm going to keep
him involved with the program and make sure he gets his degree.
It's more important to have your health than football.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech, whose 8-4 season was hampered by defensive lapses, signed
five other defensive players _ defensive backs Jonathan Cox
(Chicago) and Tony Hollings (Twiggs County) and linemen Reggie Koon
(Miramar, Fla.), Alfred Malone (Frisco City, Fla.) and Chirod
Williams (Jacksonville).
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think we filled some voids with the defensive front
people and defensive backs that we signed,'' O'Leary said. ``We've
brought in some very talented youngsters to help us on defense, but
as I said, I think we've helped all the positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech signed two All-America quarterbacks, Brandon Sumner
(Daytona Beach, Fla.) and Mark Logan (Greenwood, S.C.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Both can do the things that we need a quarterback to do; they
are mobile and can throw the ball,'' O'Leary said. ``We (already)
have three quarterbacks on campus, and we'd like to leave the
spring with a No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we're not happy leaving the spring, both quarterbacks
coming in will have an opportunity to show what they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary also said that sophomore Jermaine Crenshaw, who was
moved to wide receiver during the season, has asked for another
shot at quarterback this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do that for the first week of spring practice and make
a decision,'' O'Leary said, ``because we can't get four
quarterbacks ready for the preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone tailback is Jimmy Dixon of Arlington, Texas, who is
rated among the top five backs in the nation.

SPORTS COLUMN: TENNIS TRIES TO TAKE ROOT IN UNLIKELY SOIL

 (ATTN: Fla.)  (rk)

<P>
   CHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe _ There were four tennis courts and a wall
to hit against, all surrounded by acres upon acres of poverty. On
this oasis of athleticism, there were kids with big smiles hitting
forehands, and a few of them had bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bare truth of tennis is that it takes money,'' said Levar
Harper-Griffith, though he stood on these sun-baked hard courts
Wednesday as something of a counter to that point.
</P>
<P>
   He is 18 years old, a black kid from Fort Greene, Brooklyn,
whose mother worked two jobs so she could shepherd him to junior
tournaments to play against kids of more affluent means.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, against the odds and his mother's better judgment, her
efforts and his talent landed Harper-Griffith here this week, as a
practice partner for John McEnroe's U.S. Davis Cup team as it
prepares for the first-round competition against Zimbabwe on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The host country has approximately 80,000 whites in a population
of nearly 13 million, but its three competing players this weekend
are white. Wayne and Byron Black, Zimbabwe's pro tour veterans, are
national heroes for their surprising share of Davis Cup success.
The Black brothers are also a reminder of the imbalance of wealth
distribution here that remains from the colonial years prior to
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Economic power may not require a big forehand, but Paul Chingoka
said that a black tennis star in Zimbabwe would, symbolically, be
huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the pressure I am getting every day, for us to develop
a top black player,'' said Chingoka, the president of Tennis
Zimbabwe. ``This is going to happen. In all age groups now, the top
players are black children. Tennis is still seen as elitist, but
there has been pressure to desegregate.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Tennis Zimbabwe embarked on its plan to
privately finance the tennis courts here, in one of the country's
highest poverty and population density areas, about 30 minutes'
drive from Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Chingoka said that 400 to 500 children use the facility, free of
charge, every week. Coca-Cola helps underwrite the costs for the
right to cover much of the facility with its promotional graffiti.
Three years ago, the U.S. government kicked in for one of the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. paid for one court _ big deal,'' huffed McEnroe, ever
the ambassador, after a one-hour clinic in which he was the star
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Gently prodded, he soon went on an anti-corporate rant that was
overheard by a Tennis Zimbabwe official, who rushed over to say
that the soft drink company's largess was more than the ``thousand
Cokes'' that McEnroe surmised.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Nike pitchman that he is, this probably isn't a
potential platform for the political future McEnroe keeps talking
about. Yet in his wonderfully roundabout way, he was making an
excellent point about tennis and the excessive grandstanding that
goes on when officials of the sport in any country get going on the
subject of introducing the sport to people who don't traditionally
play it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Tennis Zimbabwe coaches said that many of the local
juniors live too far from these courts, or any courts, and must
travel for hours to play. The Black brothers, conversely, grew up
on a farm outside Harare that had four grass courts installed by
their father, Don, a former pro.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe has always wondered how good he would have been had
Harry Hopman, the Australian legend, not dropped out of the sky,
onto Long Island. Venus and Serena Williams had a most unusual
father in Richard. Andre Agassi, for all his hard work to become
tennis' irresistible force, was trained by daddy from the age of 3.
Another bare tennis truth is that it takes a willing parent or
guiding angel to raise a child who may one day compete in the
global village.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Grenada, Bernice Griffith used to carry young Levar
along with her racket to neighborhood parks to save money on a
sitter. She would play for 55 minutes, then hit with her only child
for five.
</P>
<P>
   She never cared much for the wealthier and pushier tennis
parents she later spent afternoons with. It was never her intention
for Levar to become a real player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved it, though, and it kept him into his studies because
those were the rules,'' she said from her home in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   When her son grew into a world-ranked junior, she hoped tennis
would carry him to a Stanford scholarship. He recently turned pro
instead. His mother, not wishing to dwell on a sore point, just
keeps reminding him to take pictures, to bring something home, when
he calls every night to report from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he said he would tell his mother about those
kids he'd hit with on a hard court that was a long way from home.
Brooklyn was never as forbidding as Chitungwiza. Levar
Harper-Griffith understood that the odds for those kids were much
greater than his own. He said he would wish them an angel, even if
it could be for only five minutes an hour.

 &HT;    Georgia Southern gets 23 of 24 prospects
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Southern rode the school's fifth I-AA national
championship to a successful signing day Wednesday. Coach Paul
Johnson and his staff got almost every recruit they had targeted in
the preceding weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went after 24 and ended up with 23. That's a pretty good
day,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In his third year as head coach, Johnson guided the Eagles to a
13-2 record and avictory over Youngstown State in the national
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern signed six defensive linemen, five
quarterbacks, three offensive linemen, four linebackers, two
running backs, two defensive backs and one receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've hit on some of our real needs, especially in the
defensive line and at the quarterback position,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Two key defensive signees are from Atlanta _ Therrell High
School star linebacker DeShawn Jude and lineman Carlton Oglesby of
Douglass High School.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who gained more than 440 yards a game, lose
quarterback Greg Hill, the triggerman in that explosive option
offense. Other key losses include defensive linemen Eugene Phillips
and Voncellies Allen, a consensus I-AA American, and All-Southern
Conference defensive backs Earthwind Moreland and Kiwaukee Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The group of quarterbacks who committed include Apopka, Fla.,
native Chaz Williams, a 5-10, 175-pound speedster who rushed for
750 yards operating his high school's option offense attack, and
Lee County High School star Johnathan Woodham. A four-year starter,
Woodham, a 6-0, 185-pounder, was selected to the Class AAA
All-State team after rushing for 1,158 yards and 17 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The three other quarterback prospects, Effingham County High
School star Trey Hunter, Kevin Davis of Charlton County, and
Calhoun County High's Verge Williams, have logged time in the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school a lot of the time, the best athlete on the team
is the quarterback,'' Johnson said. ``Maybe a few of the
(quarterback signees) will be capable of playing another
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players on last year's roster came to Georgia Southern
as quarterbacks but were contributing at other positions. Among
them were junior wide receiver Chris Johnson, sophomore slotback
Andre Weathers, junior safety Ryan Hadden and sophomore safety Kick
Kearns.
</P>
<P>
   With sophomore All-American fullback Adrian Peterson returning,
the Eagles signed only two running backs _ South Gwinnett High
School's T. J. Anderson and Riverdale High School standout Hakim
Ford. Rockdale High School's P.J. Cantrell was the lone receiver
signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This class is extremely athletic, and we're extremely excited
by its future,'' Johnson said.

 AOL Faces Lawsuits Over Software  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Legal eagles on both coasts are taking aim at America Online, after
scores of frustrated customers complained that AOL's latest
software blocked them from accessing the Web through rival Internet
service providers.
<P>
   First, attorneys sued AOL this week in federal court in
Alexandria, Va., near AOL's Dulles, Va., headquarters, claiming the
company violated both state and federal laws and seeking as much as
$8 billion in damages on behalf of customers everywhere. AOL is the
largest Internet service provider with 21 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the problem occurs if users select AOL 5.0 as their
``default`` Internet program during installation. Then, some users
complain, they no longer can use their other Internet access
programs.
</P>
<P>
   AOL estimates 8 million users have installed the latest version
of its software, Version 5.0, which was released in the fall. By
some estimates, one in 12 AOL users also has another Internet
account, and could potentially be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an attempt to monopolize access to the Internet,''
charged Lloyd Gathings, a Birmingham, Ala., lawyer involved in the
suit. ``It causes tremendous technical problems (for AOL users).''
</P>
<P>
   Now a San Francisco law firm, Girard &AMP; Green, is considering
filing a similar lawsuit in a California state court as early as
today on behalf of a Berkeley resident, who had to reformat his
hard drive to use another Internet service provider after
installing the AOL program.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Dan Girard said the Berkeley resident is checking his
system to make sure the AOL software was responsible for the
problem. But even if it wasn't, Girard said his firm might sue AOL
on behalf of other Californians who've complained the program
crippled their alternate Internet accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Girard could then ask a judge to deem the suit a class-action
case, representing everyone affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is likely there will be multiple cases,'' Girard said,
noting that consumer laws vary from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online spokesman Rich D'Amato said such lawsuits
have ``no basis in merit or fact.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said America Online's latest software explicitly asks
customers if they want to make AOL their default Internet software
when they install the program. And he said it's easy for customers
to change the settings back. (See box.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had only an infinitesimal amount of claims,'' D'Amato
said, insisting that users should still be able to use their other
Net accounts after installing AOL 5.0.
</P>
<P>
   But dozens of angry users have complained about the program on
online message boards, including those on AOL's own service, said
David Cassel, an Oakland resident who publishes the AOL Watch
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Magazine's Web site even posed the question: ``AOL 5.0:
The Upgrade of Death?''
</P>
<P>
   And Internet service providers, like Earthlink and Prodigy, have
publicly criticized AOL. Earthlink spokesman Kurt Rahn said his
company's customer support workers have fielded hundreds, if not
thousands, of calls from users who had trouble after installing the
AOL software. ``It's a fairly wide variety of stuff,'' Rahn said,
``not one thing you can point to.''
</P>
<P>
   As for AOL's claims that users can still access their other
Internet accounts without any trouble? ``You can say the sky is
red, but it's pretty easy to look up and see that it is blue,''
Rahn said.

 CEO Helping Minorities Enter Tech World  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Growing up the seventh of 13 children in a poor African American
family in the Midwest, Bob Knowling Jr. said he was surrounded by
people telling him he would never amount to much.
<P>
   Except for one _ his mother, Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   She made him stay in school and keep his mind focused beyond
several painful incidents that could have embittered anybody else
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom always told me, `Channel your aggression, channel your
frustration into positives,''' Knowling said. ``She always had a
positive outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Knowling is not only the successful chief executive of a
rising Silicon Valley technology company, Covad Communications
Group Inc., but he won praise from President Clinton last week as
an ``American hero'' for leading an effort to bring more minorities
into the technology workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Knowling is heading a task force that is developing a nationwide
internship program, to start this summer, designed to steer more
African American, Hispanic and Native American students into
careers in information technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got to do is level the playing field around the
country so that all kids are getting access to the great, wide
wonderful technological revolution,'' Knowling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with gray matter. How do you determine if
people are going to make it or not, is it genetics or environment?
It's all environment. I'm living proof of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowling, 44, stepped into the national spotlight when he was
one of 10 Americans invited to sit in the House of Representative's
gallery next to Hillary Clinton to watch the president' State of
the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Knowling became CEO of Covad, the Santa Clara company
that is one of the top providers of high-speed DSL Internet service
in the country. Covad posted a net loss of $195.4 million on
revenues of $66.5 million in 1999, but analysts believe the company
is well positioned to take advantage of a projected explosive
growth of high-speed DSL, or digital subscriber lines. Under
Knowling's leadership, the firm, which went public a year ago, has
almost tripled in value to $7.54 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Knowling became chair of the Digital Opportunity
Initiative, sponsored by the trade group Information Technology
Association of America. That group is launching the internship
program this summer; details are still being firmed up.
</P>
<P>
   The ITAA and the White House asked Knowling to spearhead the
initiative to help bridge a Digital Divide in the U.S. technology
workforce.
</P>
<P>
   According to an ITAA task force report, African Americans
account for about 10 percent of the overall U.S. workforce, but
only 5 percent of all computer programmers. Hispanics account
accounted  &LR; for about 9 percent of the general workforce, but only 4
percent of computer programmers. Native Americans account for less
than 1 percent in both the general and programmer workforces.
</P>
<P>
   Knowling is against forcing affirmative action quotas. But, he
said, the Digital Opportunity Initiative's goal is to encourage
more minorities to strive for technology jobs. That starts with
getting the top executives in technology to replace talk with
action to diversify their workforces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like there's some great plan out there to keep folks
out of the profession,'' said Knowling, who was an executive at US
U.S.  &LR; West and Ameritech before joining Covad in 1998. ``It's an
issue of emphasis, focus and commitment, and it comes at all
different levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowling's committee has at least 10 companies committed to
create new  &LR; paid internships _ both summer and yearlong _ for
minority college students, said ITAA President Harris Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The program would start small, but even if it initially adds
just 50 to 100 minority workers to the ranks, that would encourage
more students and more companies to join, and eventually snowball
into tens of thousands of internships, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   And Knowling wants more than just an ``amateur hour'' internship
that teaches basic mail room skills, but a ``robust'' program with
hands-on experience in all aspects of the business _ technical,
financial, sales, marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Knowling believes a positive internship gives a company a
competitive recruiting advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (big) high-tech firms are getting the cream-of-the-crop
kids,'' he said. ``If I give you three wonderful experiences with
me, three summers in a row, and you've contributed to the bottom
line, I've got a real good chance of winning you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of advantage Knowling himself wasn't afforded as a
member of a poor family in Kokomo, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in first grade, he went with his mother to the local
welfare office to pick up food. He saw the hurt in her face when
she was denied more peanut butter by an a  &LR; office worker who
remarked, ``You should have thought about that when you were having
13 kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that day we were going to get out of social
assistance, and my mom went to work two jobs,'' Knowling said. ``A
life imprint was planted on me that day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth grade, while living on his grandparents' farm in
Missouri, he brought a fishing lure his mother had given him as a
Christmas gift to school for show-and-tell.
</P>
<P>
   When the lure accidentally stuck on a white classmate's sweater,
his teacher dragged Knowling out of his seat by his ear and started
beating him severely with a paddle.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher said, ``That's why we don't like you black kids in
this school, you're always doing stuff that doesn't make any
sense,' &LR; '' Knowling said. ``He beat me for probably 20 minutes.
When I sat down, I couldn't feel anything and my butt was just
numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowling, who managed to keep a smile on his face as he related
the painful experience, said the optimistic attitude his mother
instilled in him helped him turn the incident into ``a positive
catalyst'' to disprove all the people who said ``you can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The articulate Knowling, who bears a resemblance to San
Francisco Giants Manager Dusty Baker, eventually earned a degree in
theology from Indiana's Wabash College, where he was a four-sport
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he went to work for Indiana Bell, which later became
Ameritech, and eventually became vice president of network
operations for both Ameritech and US West, which he joined in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights activist the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is also
pushing for more diversity in Silicon Valley, said Knowling
possesses ``a powerful presence and a selfless spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had stayed in Kokomo, he never would have had the
opportunity to be head of a major business,'' said Jackson. ``This
again shows how much productivity we lose when we waste talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowling said he was honored to be acknowledged by Clinton, but
``didn't think it was such a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He also says no one has anointed him to change all of Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my legacy in life is I only get one kid to take the right
road instead of the wrong road, then it was worth it. Along the
way, if we establish ourselves as a benchmark for a best practice
company that is doing things to bridge the Digital Divide, so be
it.''

TOP PLAYERS LEFT AWESTRUCK BY WOODS' STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Tom Lehman, perhaps the PGA Tour's
sharpest player entering today's AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am,
painted a lighthearted picture of Tiger Woods' assault on history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say that if he gets to about eight or nine ...
he'll wear his cap backward. He'll do everything the exact same way
for about the next three tournaments,'' Lehman said regarding
Woods' streak of five consecutive PGA Tour victories.
</P>
<P>
   Woods can match Ben Hogan's 1948 string of six consecutive
victories _ the second-longest streak in tour history _ by winning
this weekend, although Lehman suggested confidently that ``all good
things must come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, though, in this 180-member field will challenge the
planet's best player? Who will derail the Tiger Express before
Woods threatens Byron Nelson's 55-year-old record of 11 consecutive
victories?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take someone to stuff it in his face a couple of
times coming down the stretch to knock him off that,'' Davis Love
III said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who won the Phoenix Open on Sunday, could emerge as the
one who terminates the streak, an accomplishment Woods continued to
downplay yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I still don't really consider it
\Rfive\S because it's over two seasons,'' said Woods, who won the
final four PGA Tour events he entered to close 1999 and the
Mercedes Championships on Jan. 9 in his only Tour appearance this
season. ``People forget that I played three tournaments in between
the two regular seasons. I've won two out of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that counts for something, but I don't know if it's
\Rfive\S or not. I'm counting that I've won this year once and
trying to win two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, a five-time winner at Pebble Beach and Woods'
neighbor, suggests that maybe he should crack his friend's ``ankle
or something with one of my practice swings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that may be the only way you can stop Tiger Woods,''
O'Meara said. ``I think he's going to continue on this little ride.
I wouldn't be surprised come Sunday afternoon if Tiger Woods is in
contention here at Pebble Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   But being in contention does not satisfy Woods' thirst for
victory, and second place holds no appeal for the world's No.
1-ranked player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never liked it,'' Woods said. ``I don't understand why
people are satisfied with that because that's not the ultimate goal
_ at least that's not mine. My ultimate goal is to win, and
anything short of that I'm always going to be disappointed with
because I didn't accomplish my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal, though, one that has been forced upon him by
the media and by his fans, is to catch and pass Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Woods views Nelson's signature achievement as ``incredible'' and
recognizes the legend's stellar play during ``The Streak.''
Nelson's 68.14 scoring average for the nine medal-play events
during his streak betters Woods' 68.20 average through his five
consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He beat some great players, but more importantly, if you look
at his stroke average, he really did play well,'' Woods said. ``It
wasn't like he was just getting tournaments handed to him. He was
going out there and beating players.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods also hasn't had any tournaments ``handed'' to him. He,
too, has shown mettle in tough victories, including a playoff win
against Ernie Els in the Mercedes Championships. The world's top
players are taking notice.
</P>
<P>
   Love views Woods' recent success as the ``modern-day
equivalent'' of Nelson's streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the competition now is just so hard,'' Love said.
``Winning that many in a row is ... kind of inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods enters this tournament with the confidence to match the
waves from Monterey Bay that crash Pebble Beach's shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty high now because I've had a lot of success
lately,'' Woods said. ``More importantly, I know how to get it
around when I'm not playing that well. There were times when I
didn't play that well and was able to score and get the round in
under par somehow and just kind of hang in the tournament and go on
to win despite not playing that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, recall, fired a third-round 66 at the National Car Rental
Golf Classic at Walt Disney World Resort despite hitting only nine
greens in regulation en route to his second consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just never seen anyone with more talent that what he
has,'' said O'Meara, who joined the PGA Tour in 1981. ``Plus, he
has a tremendous desire to win. He wants to win, and it's not just
about the money. He just wants to win golf tournaments.''

 &HT;    Gators have everything go their way
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Year after year in football recruiting, the rich seem
to get richer.
</P>
<P>
   When the national signing period opened Wednesday, Florida
already had one of the top five classes in the nation. As the day
began, Florida also was awaiting word from four other top recruits.
</P>
<P>
   When the day ended, the Gators had all four.
</P>
<P>
   Tre Orr, a wideout/defensive back from Lake City, Fla., and the
No. 7-rated safety in the nation, chose the Gators over Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Kight, the No. 11 wide receiver in the nation, picked
Florida over FSU, Notre Dame, Arkansas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Two offensive linemen, Max Starks from Orlando and Miami's
Jonathan Colon also chose Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators won't admit it, but they were more than a little
relieved to get a signed grant-in-aid back from Warner Robins
defensive tackle Kenny Parker. The 6-4, 285-pounder had favored
Florida, but the Gators were worried there might be some negative
feelings created last weekend when a teammate, offensive lineman
Jason Respert, was arrested during his official visit to
Gainesville on charges of attempted sexual battery. The Gators got
another bonus when Thomas Pittman announced he would walk on at
Florida. Two seasons ago, the 6-4, 284-pound defensive lineman
signed with Auburn, but then decided to sign a baseball contract
with the Montreal Expos and forgo college football. He changed his
mind and will pay his own way with his baseball earnings to play
for Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR
</P>
<P>
   Duke's recuiting class received no better than a ranking of 52,
but the Blue Devils might have gotten one of the more famous names.
Jeremy Battier, rated the 31st-best wide receiver in the nation,
will attend Duke next season. And yes, he's the younger brother of
the Blue Devils' basketball star Shane Battier.
</P>
<P>
   AND THEN THERE WERE 3
</P>
<P>
   Only three players rated as elite prospects are uncommitted. One
is Respert, ranked as a five-star performer, although he's expected
to sign with Tennessee if his off-field trouble is cleared up.
Harold James, a five-star linebacker performer from Osceola, Ark.,
hasn't commited but is expected to sign with Alabama today. D.J.
Williams, perhaps the country's top running back prospect, backed
out of his commitment to Miami, and it is uncertain where he might
land.
</P>
<P>
   TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE
</P>
<P>
   If both associate head coach Ronnie Cottrell and defensive line
coach Lance Thompson stay in Tuscaloosa, the Tide should do fine.
Both are among the top 10 college recruiters in the nation. Alabama
is the only school with more than one top-class recruiter.
</P>
<P>
   VOL COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee might be the only team in the nation that could start
three freshman All-Americans on its offensive line next season. If
Respert ends up in Knoxville, he could start alongside offensive
line standouts Michael Munoz and Sean Young.

   Fed Raises Interest Rates and Hints at Further Action
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point and signaled that further rate increases will
probably be needed to keep the persistently strong economy from
generating inflation. The move, the fourth rate increase since
June, was in line with what economists and investors had expected.
Financial markets took the announcement in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks struggled to a mixed finish. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 37.85 points, to 11,003.20, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's

   The Senate voted decisively to make it harder for people to
erase their debts, a measure that would overhaul the nation's

   30-Year Bond to Be Phased Out
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury announced plans for a reduction in new issuance of
30-year bonds and the buying back of other long-term Treasury debt

 _ SF CHRON   Company Makes High-Profile Hires for Its New Economy Magazine 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Do we really need another ``new economy'' magazine?
<P>
   Some experienced journalists seem to think so.
</P>
<P>
   ECompany Now, the forthcoming monthly being spun out of Time
Warner's Fortune group, today will trumpet its first 11 hires, and
they come not only from Fortune magazine but also from Forbes, the
Wall Street Journal, Outside and Red Herring.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be entering a crowded field, as the Industry Standard,
Red Herring, Business 2.0, Upside and Fast Company all cover
similar stories already. Add to that Wired's increasing emphasis on
the tech economy, PC Computing's reinventing itself as Smart
Business, and a new title from Cahners called E-Commerce Business _
as well as newspapers, regular business magazines, and the millions
of words posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder how the wired business executive will have
time to actually conduct business, if he or she is reading all
these magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Nee, one of eCompany's high-profile hires, fires the first
shot. After all, he once edited Upside, was Silicon Valley bureau
chief for Forbes, and joined Fortune in 1998. Now he'll be
executive editor of eCompany, which he thinks will move to the top
of the new economy heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do it qualitatively better,'' Nee says. ``Right off the
bat, we have a stronger group of writers and editors. A lot of the
other magazines, I won't say they're amateurish, but they could be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nee will be joined by Greg Hill, who yesterday marked his 30th
anniversary at the Wall Street Journal by leaving the paper. He'll
be eCompany's features editor.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who enjoyed an unusually long run _ 15 years _ as the
Journal's bureau chief in San Francisco, became a senior editor for
the paper six months ago and found himself frustrated. He wanted to
be the paper's ``page one editor for technology,'' but that
position doesn't exist. Now he'll be filling that role for
eCompany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about telling almost every story from the
perspective of the business user, rather than the technology
companies,'' Hill says.
</P>
<P>
   Nee said he started working on the eCompany plan almost as soon
as he joined Fortune. Now that the magazine is getting off the
ground _ the first issue, dated June 2000, will be on newsstands in
May with a planned paid circulation of 200,000 _ Nee is moving
over, although he'll still contribute the occasional feature to
Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Other notables include Jim Aley from Fortune, who will be
managing editor; Amy Johns from Wired, who will be assistant
managing editor; senior editor Tim Carvell, moving over from
Fortune; Forbes writers Josh McHugh and Caroline Waxler; and Owen
Thomas from Red Herring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, eCompany signed up three women from Outside
magazine to oversee the design and look of the new book: Susan
Casey, who will be an editor-at-large at Time Inc.; photography
director Susan Smith; and deputy art director Susan Scandrett.
(Memo to artists seeking work at eCompany: first change your name
to Susan, and get a job at Outside.)
</P>
<P>
   In assembling its staff, eCompany couldn't offer prospective
stock options like the Industry Standard and Red Herring do, with
their IPOs possibly reaching the marketplace sometime this year.
But eCompany has a few other things going for it: the prospect of
building something from the ground up, and the assurance of doing
so for the largest magazine publisher in the country, Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The view, from the 29th floor of the AirTouch building at 1
California Street, doesn't hurt, either. It's so spectacular that
Ned Desmond, the veteran of Time and Infoseek who is president and
editor of the new venture, says it's embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ECompany acquired the www.ecompany.com domain name from a
Southern California company, and plans to roll out a
service-oriented Web site in May.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; CONFLICT CATCHER &QL;  &LR; 
Of course, working for eCompany could have a drawback, since the
magazine will be under the aegis of the biggest e-company around:
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Editor Ned Desmond doesn't anticipate any trouble covering the
Internet industry, even once the AOL-Time Warner merger is final.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church and state wall is so profound at Time Inc.,''
Desmond says. He points no further than Carol Loomis' piece in the
latest Fortune, questioning the financials of the AOL-Time Warner
merger.

 &UR; WIRE SERVICE GETS WIRED &LR;  &QL; 
San Francisco's Cnet scored a major coup this week with the
announcement that the venerable Associated Press will deliver Cnet
News.com technology stories to its member newspapers. ``This
validates our credibility,'' crows News.com executive editor Jeff
Pelline.
</P>
<P>
   It also marks the melding of two different cultures: a youthful
Internet upstart that caters to a tech-savvy audience, and a
150-year-old wire service that writes for the broadest readership
possible. The two organizations have given the arrangement a trial
run for the past few months _ in tech parlance, a ``beta test.''
</P>
<P>
   News.com will send AP a story budget each day, and AP editors
decide what they want. News.com editors will then rework the story
into something closer to AP style, and AP editors can also give the
story a makeover if it still needs it.
</P>
<P>
   In a story this week about the Linux operating system, for
instance, the lead paragraph in the online version spoke of
``skinny servers,'' but the phrase was excised entirely from the AP
version.
</P>
<P>
   That's still pretty geeky, but AP thinks that's what its members
want. Many newspapers now have tech supplements that need filling.
``If we didn't have Cnet, that story wouldn't have gotten done,''
said AP business editor Randy Picht.
</P>
<P>
   AP only has about seven people across the country devoted to
tech coverage _ and that's triple the coverage of two years ago,
Picht says. News.com has a staff of 45. But many of those News.com
reporters wouldn't meet the AP's criteria of hiring people with at
least two years newspaper experience.
</P>
<P>
   That's all right, Picht says, since those reporters have tech
expertise that AP lacks. And News.com editor Jai Singh says his
staff has the same high standards as any offline media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were trigger-happy cowgirls and cowboys who got our
jollies by scooping the competition by 10 to 15 minutes ... AP
wouldn't be dealing with us,'' Singh says.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Schwab Courting Traders  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a two-pronged play for the active-investor market, discount
brokerage giant Charles Schwab Corp. said yesterday it is slashing
commissions for heavy traders and buying a fast-growing securities
firm that caters to hyperactive online clients.
<P>
   Effective February 1, Schwab, the nation's largest online
broker, lowered its commission on Internet transactions from $29.95
to $19.95 when customers exceed 30 trades per quarter and to $14.95
when they pass 60 trades. Only customers whose households keep at
least $50,000 in assets in Schwab accounts qualify for the
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Schwab said it had agreed to buy CyBerCorp, a
5-year-old Austin, Texas, firm that recently cracked the top 10 ten
 &LR; in online brokerage market share, for about $487 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   CyBerCorp has only 2,500 accounts, compared with to  &LR; Schwab's
6.6 million. But its clients are full-time speculators who buy and
sell several stocks in a matter of hours, generating a phenomenal
19,000 trades per day, compared with to  &LR; 177,000 a day at Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are aimed at shoring up Schwab's business with one of
the most profitable segments of the investment market - active
investors whose frequent trades produce a flood of commission
revenue. Schwab has been losing such customers to cheaper brokers
that charge as little as $5 to trade stock, such as Menlo Park's
E-Trade Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schwab's lead over E-Trade is shrinking each quarter,`` said
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst Stephen Franco. ``They can't
compete at $29.95.``
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Schwab has considered buying a
brokerage that caters to active traders. Last year, the firm
contacted New Jersey's Datek Online Holdings, the nation's No. 5
online broker, about a possible takeover but was rebuffed,
according to people familiar with the matter. Both firms declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   As online stock trading has boomed, San Francisco's Schwab has
emerged as the dominant force in electronic brokerage, boasting the
best-known brand name and a marketing machine that sucks in tens of
billions of dollars in deposits every quarter. With market activity
at all-time highs, the company's profits and stock have soared.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schwab isn't the market leader among the wealthiest
investors who hire specialists to manage their assets for a fee.
And rival online brokers offer cheaper commissions, cooler images
and cutting-edge technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Schwab addressed the first issue by agreeing to buy
U.S. Trust, an elite bank that manages money for wealthy clients,
potentially boosting the brokerage's fee income. And the CyBerCorp
purchase combined with commission discounts should make it easier
for Schwab to attract and keep clients who trade frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're such a great mass-market brand,`` said Susanne Lyons,
Schwab's chief of retail client services. ``Now we're trying to
stretch the brand'' to draw in ``the very active and very
affluent.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has long promoted a sober-minded, long-term approach to
investing. Ownership of a brokerage whose day-trading customers
keep stocks not for years, but for minutes, is an about-face that
could dilute Schwab's message and its image.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such confusion, Schwab will operate CyBerCorp as a
separate subsidiary. ``The brand of mainstream Schwab is not about
full-time trading,'' said Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab officials said a key reason for buying CyBerCorp was to
get their hands on the firm's computer trading technology, which
scans stock market participants to instantly locate the best buy
and sell prices available. Schwab may add elements of that trading
system, such as news and market data that stream directly into
clients' computers, to its main Internet offering.
</P>
<P>
   CyBerCorp took in $24 million in revenue last year. The price
Schwab is paying is a steep 20 times that figure. ``We bought the
best of breed, and the best of breed never comes cheap,'' said
Schwab co-chief executive David Pottruck.

ALBRIGHT VISITS POST-TUDJMAN CROATIA AND HAILS THE NEW LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright came
here Wednesday to praise the government that was recently fomed
from the democratic oposition.
</P>
<P>
   She also encouraged the two candidates for the presidency and
promised that the United States would support the rapid integration
of a ``new Croatia'' into NATO, the European Union and the West.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and her aides expressed hope that the ``Croatian
example'' would affect neighboring Serbia, where Washington wants
to see the end of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
Washington also hopes that ``Croatia's rapid move into Europe'' and
Western institutions like NATO's Partnership for Peace will ``make
the Serbs think hard,'' a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   On her last visit here, in August 1998, Albright had a bitter
meeting with President Franjo Tudjman, whose government resisted
full cooperation with the international tribunal on war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia and worked to undermine the 1995 Dayton
agreement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But with the death of Tudjman in December and the electoral
victory of a six-party opposition coalition led by Prime Minister
Ivica Racan that Washington encouraged, ``I think everyone is ready
to embrace the new Croatia,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference a year and a half makes,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   She said Washington would increase economic aid, from $12
million to $20 million. She also delivered a letter from President
Clinton to Racan that promised support for Croatian democracy if
the new government lived up to its promises to cooperate with the
tribunal and abide by the Dayton agreement, including allowing
Serbian refugees to return to their homes. Washington would like
Croatia to stop spending up to $3 million a day to support a
separate Bosnian Croat administration and military, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Racan, leader of the reformed Communist Party, now called the
Social Democrats, said Croatia would live up to its
responsibilities toward Bosnia, Serbia and Europe. ``Judge us by
our deeds, not by our promises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually, Albright arrived in the middle of an election
campaign for the presidency, a period that ends on Monday in a
runoff between the front-runner, Stipe Mesic, and an ally of Racan,
Drazen Budisa. U.S. officials said they would be happy if either
won, and Albright had private meetings with each Wednesday after
she arrived from Moscow.

 _ SF CHRON  
 MAC Q&AMP;A/HENRY NORR  &HT;     Don't Turn Your Nose Up at IDE Drives _ They're Fast, Cheaper 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One of the advantages of Macs, I was always told, was that they
came with SCSI hard disks, which were faster and smarter than the
IDE drives in Windows PCs. But now I'm looking into replacing the
Power Mac 8500 I use with Photoshop, and I discovered that the G4s
have IDE drives.
<P>
   Is this a case of Apple lowering itself to the level of the PC
hordes? Will I be giving up a lot of drive performance in exchange
for a faster CPU? Is there any way to go to a G4 and still have
SCSI?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Yes, Apple has all but abandoned SCSI, but don't shed any tears
over it. While both IDE and SCSI drives have improved tremendously
in recent years _ in speed as well as capacity _ the progress has
been especially dramatic on the IDE side. The fastest desktop
drives money can buy are still SCSI, but today's IDE disks are very
competitive in performance _ and still a whole lot cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   To most users, I'd say that's all you need to know _ especially
because SCSI isn't an option anyway in most modern Macs. But for
Photoshop users, who often deal with files tens or even hundreds of
megabytes in size, drive performance is a critical issue and since
the G4 gives you some options, it pays to consider them.
</P>
<P>
   Just one warning: There's no way to weigh the choices without
wading through a lot of jargon usually spoken only by hard-core
bitheads. That's partly because both IDE and SCSI have by now
spawned a slew of new, improved variants, each with its own
confusing name (or names) and performance claims
</P>
<P>
   On the IDE side, the state of the art is what Apple calls Ultra
ATA, but many other companies call it Ultra DMA or Ultra IDE. It
comes in two speed grades, known as Ultra ATA/33 and Ultra ATA/66,
for the maximum rate _ measured in megabytes per second _ that data
can move between the drive and the rest of the computer. (In
practice, most drives fall far short of these limits most of the
time, though they come closer in occasional short bursts.)
</P>
<P>
   Even after you sort these labels out, there are still other
technical variables that determine the speed of any particular
drive, whether IDE or SCSI. One of them is ``spindle speed'' _ how
fast the drive spins its internal platters, measured in revolutions
per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look specifically at the Power Mac G4, since that's the
series you're considering. Even Apple's online store doesn't give
all the details, but here's the skinny, according to the friendly
sales person I talked to: The higher-end configurations _ with 400-
and 450-megahertz G4 chips _ come with Ultra ATA/66 drives that
spin at 7,200 rpm, while the 350-megahertz G4 model ships with a
5,400-rpm Ultra ATA/66 drive.
</P>
<P>
   The 7,200-rpm drive in my G4/ 450 delivers around 20 megabytes
per second on a sustained basis. That's almost as much as the
fastest single SCSI drive, and probably three, four or five times
more than you get from the SCSI drive that came with your 8500.
While I haven't tried the 5,400-rpm drive, benchmark numbers I've
seen suggest that it's about 25 percent slower, which is still very
good by most standards.
</P>
<P>
   In short, IDE is nothing to be ashamed of, especially in its
Ultra ATA incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, you need every bit of performance you can
get _ and you can afford to pay a premium for it _ SCSI is still
the way to go. Not just any flavor of SCSI, though. To beat Ultra
ATA/ 66, you'll need one of the latest variants: Ultra2, which can
theoretically handle up to 80 megabytes per second, or Ultra160,
which doubles the limit to 160 megabytes per second. (Remember my
warning about the geek-speak? Some companies add an M to Ultra160M
_ and no, it's not for Macintosh _ while others call it Ultra3,
even though it's actually just a subset of the full Ultra3
standard.)
</P>
<P>
   If you buy your G4 from Apple's online store, you can have it
built to order with Ultra2 SCSI pre-installed. An Ultra2 card plus
one 18-gigabyte, 7,200-rpm Ultra2 hard drive will cost you between
$200 and $630 extra, depending on which Ultra ATA drive you'd be
replacing.
</P>
<P>
   I don't recommend that deal by itself, though, because I've
found that a single Ultra2 drive is not appreciably faster than the
standard-issue Ultra ATA/66 drives in the higher-end G4
configurations.
</P>
<P>
   The real value of SCSI materializes only when you take two or
more drives and use special software to combine them into a single
``logical volume.'' That way, whenever you read or write data, all
the drives you've combined work in parallel, reading or writing
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, this kind of load-sharing is called ``striping'' or
a ``Level 0 RAID.'' In plain English, it means a substantial speed
boost.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, though, multiple drives increase the price premium
relative to Ultra ATA. At the Apple online store, an Ultra2 card, a
pair of 18-gigabyte drives and SoftRAID, a superb third-party
striping program, cost between $980 and $1,410 more than the
standard configurations.
</P>
<P>
   If you get your G4 from a local dealer, you can't get SCSI
preinstalled, but you or the dealer can recreate something
equivalent with third-party gear. In fact, you can buy yourself
even more performance, because third-party vendors have started
moving to Ultra160, while the Apple store still offers only Ultra2.
</P>
<P>
   In my G4, for example, I've recently been testing Adaptec's new
Ultra160 card, called the PowerDomain 29160N, with a pair of
Ultra160 drives (9.1-gigabyte, 10,000-rpm Quantum Atlas 10Ks)
striped together with SoftRAID. The whole get-up would cost about
$1,150 _ around $300 (street price) for the card, $350 for each
drive (mail order), and $149 for SoftRAID (from wwww.softraid.com).
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of money, but in exchange, you'll get electrifying
performance. Disk-intensive tasks like launching applications and
opening, saving and copying large files are nearly twice as fast on
the striped Ultra160 SCSI drive as on the factory-installed Ultra
ATA drive, which as noted is hardly a slouch. I can copy a
50-megabyte Photoshop file in a mind-boggling 3 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Considering the improvements in IDE technology and
the extra cost of SCSI, the latter simply doesn't make sense for
most users today. But if you work regularly with big files such as
Photoshop images, the seconds SCSI will save you will add up pretty
quickly, and if you charge for your time, it won't be long until
the investment pays for itself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free-Mail Followup
</P>
<P>
   Last month's request for suggestions for a reader who wants
e-mail access from a pre-PowerPC Mac _ without paying for Internet
service _ elicited many responses. Several pointed to the ``Totally
Free Email'' page at www.emailaddresses.com/emailfree.htm, but the
only services listed there are for folks in Hungary, Houston,
Australia and Bangalore, India _ or for PC owners.
</P>
<P>
   A few readers pointed out that some public libraries run free
dial-in bulletin board services that include Internet e-mail, but I
checked the San Francisco and Oakland libraries and found that
they've dropped such services.
</P>
<P>
   Other messages, however, proved more fruitful. Several readers
reported that they'd been able to use Freei.net, which offers free
access to the Internet, including e-mail, from their old Macs, even
though the service says it supports only PowerPC-based models. The
trick is simply to borrow a modern Mac to sign up, copy down the
configuration information, and enter it into FreePPP (a free,
Apple-endorsed utility for dial-up Internet access, available at
www.rockstar.com/ppp.shtml) on the old Mac.
</P>
<P>
   An even easier solution is apparently to use FreeWWWeb, another
free Internet service provider I mentioned last month. It too
claims to support only PowerPC Macs, but several readers said its
software worked fine on their old Macs with 680x0-family
processors. The only catch is that you have to get online somehow
(www.freewwweb.com) to get the software in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, other readers noted, America Online offers a
``light usage'' plan for $4.95 per month. That includes only three
hours per month of online time, but that should be plenty just for
e-mail, especially if you compose your outgoing messages offline.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK &QC;
</P>
<P>
   After I mentioned the benefits, especially for novices, of
participation in a Mac users group, several readers wrote to ask
how they could find one in their area. The best bet is to go to the
Apple User Group Web page (www.apple.com/usergroups/), choose your
country from the popup menu, then enter your area code or city and
you'll get a list of groups in your area. Some of the information
seems to be out-of-date, but it's a place to start.

SENATORS PRESS FOR ANSWERS ON GENE THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Tenn.)   (bl)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under pressure from Congress to explain lapses in
oversight of gene therapy, federal health officials acknowledged
Wednesday that they could not be certain whether experiments had
hastened, or possibly caused, the deaths of patients other than the
18-year-old man who died at the University of Pennsylvania last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most gene therapy trials are done in people with
life-threatening or terminal illnesses,'' Dr. Jay P. Siegel, an
official of the Food and Drug Administration, told a Senate
subcommittee. ``Patients in those trials die. It is usually not
possible to make a definitive determination'' about what role gene
therapy played in the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel made his remarks at a packed three-and-a-half-hour
hearing before the subcommittee on public health that covered a
variety of topics, including whether scientists had been truthful
in informing patients about the risks of gene therapy why why the
FDA and the National Institutes of Health had not shared
information with each other. The two agencies monitor the research.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who is chairman of
the subcommittee, declared that the system for protecting patients
was broken. ``It's a multisystem failure,'' Frist said, adding, ``
we may have just touched the tip of the iceberg on.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those testifying Wednesday was Paul Gelsinger, the father
of Jesse Gelsinger, 18, whose death on Sept. 17 has been the only
one, as far as government officials know, directly attributable to
gene therapy. In an impassioned, at times tearful, speech,
Gelsinger, who not long ago defended the Pennsylvania researchers
as ``ethical men,'' said he now feels he had been naive to have
trusted them.
</P>
<P>
   He called for an independent patients' advocate to be present at
discussions when risks are explained to patients considering taking
part in medical experiments, known as informed-consent sessions. He
also attacked the influence of money from biotech companies in the
race to making gene therapy work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gelsinger described the death of his son as ``an avoidable
tragedy from which I will never recover.''

   On Jan. 21, the FDA shut down all gene therapy experiments at
the University of Pennsylvania, citing ``numerous deficiencies'' in
the way the clinical trial was run, including serious lapses in
informed consent. The Pennsylvania scientists did not testify
today, but the university's president, Dr. Judith Rodin, sent a
letter saying the university takes the agency's charges ``extremely
seriously'' and will respond as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In gene therapy experiments, scientists are trying to use DNA to
correct a wide variety of inherited disorders, as well as cancer
and heart diseases. Despite the technology's promise, the the
10-year-old field has had relatively few successes, and now
Gelsinger's death may well slow the pace of research.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation
said that in December they took the precautionary step of
suspending two experiments in gene therapy that used adenovirus, a
deactivated cold virus that was used in the study that killed
Gelsinger. One of those experiments was being conducted at
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   One cystic fibrosis patient, Eric Kast, of Norman, Okla., told
senators he worried that if the science slowed down too much, a
cure would come too late for him. At 33, Kast said, he has lived
one year longer than the average life expectancy for someone with
his disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``My battle with CF is a race,'' he said. ``Don't let me lose
that race when the finish line might be just around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discussion Wednesday focused on why scientists have
been routinely ignoring federal guidelines to report experiment
side effects in patients to the National Institutes of Health. In
examining all 93 experiments that used adenovirus, officials from
the institutes recently discovered that of 691 side effects, only
39 had been reported immediately to the institutes, as federal
rules require.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. LeRoy Walters, a bioethics professor at Georgetown
University who testified Wednesday, offered one explanation: In
1996, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the institutes' panel
that oversees gene therapy, lost its authority to approve all
research protocols.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Walters said, is that scientists no longer take the
committee seriously. He argued that the committee needed to be
strengthened and suggested that a special safety board be created
to keep track of all side effects experienced by gene therapy
patients, so that problems might be identified before someone else
is seriously injured or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's death, he said, ``should be a wake-up call to us
all.''

 SF CHRON  
 Printing Tickets Via the Internet  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Cirque du Soleil is in town, offering ordinary citizens the
opportunity to take a daring leap to the very limits of
ticket-buying logic: You can print your ticket to the event on your
home printer.
<P>
   The circus from Montreal, set up in the parking lot of Pacific
Bell Park, will accept such tickets starting February 24. They can
be purchased over the Internet and printed from the Montreal's
Admission Network, www.admission.com, which is premiering  &LR; debuting
 &LR; its print-at-home ticketing technology with this show. All the
circus' performances in San Jose, April 6-30, will accept
home-printed tickets. In fact, 60 percent of tickets purchased via
the Web for the San Jose show so far have been printed at home.
</P>
<P>
   Like vendors such as TicketMaster or BASS, the Admission Network
charges a fee _ in this case $4.70 _ for each ticket it sells
online. The fee is the same whether you pick up your ticket at the
circus' will call window or print it at home. Having tickets mailed
costs an extra $4.
</P>
<P>
   The Admission Network is the first of several companies,
including giant TicketMaster, that plan to sell tickets to all
kinds of events this way, utilizing technology similar to that used
already to sell postage online. Each ticket is assigned a unique
bar code, which guards against counterfeit or fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits to consumers are obvious: No more waiting in line
or on hold. But the e-ticket companies must overcome two barriers
before home ticket printing becomes widespread: They have to
convince venues, from stadiums to museums and movie theaters, that
counterfeiting won't run rampant; and they must get the venues to
invest in scanners and software to read ticket bar codes.
</P>
<P>
   For events with high admission prices and assigned seats, like
Cirque du Soleil, the setup cost is relatively high, because ticket
takers need to check the bar code against a database of names and
credit card numbers to assure that the person with the ticket has
indeed purchased that seat.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``e-ticket'' companies would also like to offer their
technology for less expensive, general admission venues such as
movie theaters or museums, where security could be lower and the
system more affordable. At a museum, it's not as vital to compare
tickets to a credit card database as it is for a $100-a-seat
concert.
</P>
<P>
   The technology will allow ticket sellers to gather valuable
marketing data, the e-ticket companies say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're buying tickets at a ticket counter now, the seller
has no idea who you are or when you bought the ticket,'' said
Nicole Eagan, head of marketing and sales at E-Stamp, a San Mateo
company that, since August, has been selling online postage that
people print with their home or office printers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the International Ticketing Association conference
in Albuquerque, N.M., E-Stamp demonstrated that its secure postage
technology could be used to print tickets and gift certificates as
well. The company is working on making partnership deals with
venues, and hopes to roll out a test version of home ticket
printing by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   E-Stamp's Santa Monica competitor Stamps.com formed a subsidiary
called EncrypTix to focus on Net-based printing of tickets, gift
certificates and other valuable documents. EncrypTix hopes to
partner with an established ticket vendor and start selling this
year.
</P>
<P>
   And TicketMaster, the most well-known ticket vendor in the
United States, plans to add the ability to print tickets to its
sales Web site, www.ticketmaster.com, by April.
</P>
<P>
   The Admission Network was inspired to offer home ticket printing
after conducting a 1998 study of the ticket purchasing process. It
found 87 percent of respondents put top priority on getting their
ticket in hand as soon as possible. Because the Admission Network _
and other ticket sellers _ have been printing bar codes on tickets
for years, the technology was not much of a leap.
</P>
<P>
   To print tickets at home, you need a personal computer, an
Internet connection and a color or black-and-white printer that
displays at least 300 dots per inch _ basically anything but the
old dot-matrix printers sold in the early 1980s. Printing an
Admission Network ticket requires a copy of Adobe Acrobat, which is
available for free download at the site.
</P>
<P>
   On the venue side of the equation, stadiums, concert halls,
museums and movie theaters have to agree to accept tickets that
look like funny money, and they have to buy equipment to read the
tickets' bar codes. Scanner prices range from around $100 for a
handheld machine to more than $1,000. Before venues will invest in
all that, they need to be assured that the tickets won't be an open
invitation to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through the same process with the Postal Service,''
Eagan said. ``Once the different venues and consumers realize how
strong the security is, they'll see that this is actually much more
secure'' than traditional ticketing.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for abuse seems obvious: Anyone can make unlimited
photocopies of a ticket printed from a home printer, and no one
would know the difference between the copies and the original.
After buying one ticket, someone could distribute it to a dozen
friends or even sell hundreds of copies.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens when two people try to get into Cirque du Soleil
holding identical tickets? The first person gets in without any
trouble, and the second is asked to show identification and maybe a
credit card. The ticket taker uses the bar code information to pull
up the buyer's name and credit card number on a screen. If the
information doesn't match up, the counterfeit-ticket holder won't
get in _ and might get arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kelly, general manager of Admission Network USA, said that
Cirque du Soleil has pledged that no legitimate ticket holders will
be turned away.
</P>
<P>
   But EncrypTix executive Mike Zeile proposes another scenario for
fraud: ``Imagine a person who prints their ticket at the office.
Before they go to the printer, somebody takes it off and makes a
couple of Xeroxes.'' By the time the rightful ticket buyer arrives
at the stadium, a pretender may have already slipped in using a
copied ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case _ since the tickets are for assigned seats _
ushers could track down and remove the scofflaw.
</P>
<P>
   Even after viewing several displays of home ticket printing at
the convention in Albuquerque, Cow Palace box office manager Bruce
Ede still has reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the counterfeit point of view, it's a little scary,'' Ede
said. ``I'd like to see it in action in another building before I'd
do it here.''
</P>
<P>
   TicketWeb, a Berkeley company that sells tickets on the Internet
to events, is not ready to jump on the print-your-own ticket
bandwagon yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology that the venues need to have is not in place,''
said Ruth Carlton, marketing director. ``It's kind of putting the
cart before the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, very few places in the United States, even major
stadiums, are equipped to read bar codes on tickets. TicketMaster
is trying to overcome that problem by giving stadiums financial
assistance in becoming bar-code ready. TicketMaster helped outfit
Los Angeles' Staples Center with bar code readers. It also has set
up the Cleveland Indians' Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're broadly committed to helping all 3,700 of our venue
clients get this installed where it's appropriate,'' said Tom
Stockham, executive vice president of TicketMaster
Online/CitySearch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, merchants will accept this new technology,'' said
Melissa Shore, an analyst who has been tracking online ticketing
for Jupiter Communications, an e-commerce research firm in New
York. Shore agreed with assertions from TicketMaster and the other
companies that the new kind of ticketing would be more secure than
traditional ticketing.

AMAZON SAYS LOSS SOARED 543 PERCENT AS TOTAL SALES SURGED IN
QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the leading proponent of losing money on the
Internet to fuel rapid growth, said Wednesday that it lost $323
million in the fourth quarter of last year, more than expected and
543 percent more than it lost in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, investors who seem charmed by the online retail
giant's money-losing strategy appeared to celebrate the loss.
Though the company announced its results after the close of trading
on the Nasdaq exchange, where its shares finished the day at
$69.4375, the price rose as high as $79 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said it had made good on its prediction of a profit in
its book business, and it described the fourth quarter as the
``high-water mark'' for its losses, both in absolute dollars and as
a percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a busy Christmas season and an expansion into areas
like toys and tools, Amazon's sales in the quarter increased 167
percent, to $676 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company lost 96 cents a share in the quarter. It prefers
that investors look at a ``pro forma'' calculation of earnings that
excludes the cost of mergers, stock options and some noncash
accounting charges. Even on this basis, however, Amazon lost 55
cents a share _ 14.5 percent worse than the 48-cent loss Wall
Street analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which has until now been stingy in providing financial
details of its operations, offered a range of new disclosures that
impressed analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the company said it had cost $19 in marketing to
acquire each of its 3.8 million new customers in the quarter, far
less than other online businesses. At the same time, the company
said its 14 million active customers spent an average of $116 for
the year, up from $106 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Amazon's wide-ranging expansion into a variety of
retail categories appeared to be paying off, as customers bought
more products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that their customer acquisition cost is as low as it
is while their revenue per customer has trended upward over time
shows that they have a business that can become quite profitable,''
said Jamie Kiggen, of Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also forgave much of the loss as a dispensation for
rapid expansion. Amazon spent $108 million on distribution and
fulfillment of orders; that represented 16 percent of sales, up
from 10 percent of sales a year earlier. And it now has $221
million in inventory, up more than sevenfold from a year ago. That
was after writing off $39 million in excess inventory for the
quarter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We knew that the fourth quarter would be a defining moment for
e-commerce and that Amazon had to compete at the same level as
other less mature, more desperate players,'' said Anthony Noto of
Goldman Sachs. ``The price to pay was the inventory, but at the end
of the holiday season they came away with customers who are still
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon executives said the company had started a major
initiative to make sure its fulfillment and inventory costs fall as
a percentage of sales. To that end, Amazon said last week that it
would lay off 150 people, 2 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   In its quarterly release yesterday, Amazon entered new territory
by breaking out its sales by category.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of books, the company's original product category, reached
$319 million, just under half of total sales, an increase of 66
percent from a year earlier. Though it said its book business in
the United States was profitable in the fourth quarter, it did not
disclose the net margin or say how it achieved the profit.
</P>
<P>
   Music sales were $78 million, up 136 percent. Video sales were
$64 million, up 500 percent. And sales of children's products _
mainly toys but also children's books and videos _ were $95
million. Amazon did not break out sales for consumer electronics or
for home improvement items, its newest area.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon continues to surge far ahead of its rivals in books and
music. Barnesandnoble.com is posting fourth-quarter sales of $70
million. And CDNow, the largest independent online music store, is
expected to have quarterly sales of $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   The one category in which Amazon has not been able to achieve
leadership has been children's products. Its biggest rival in this
category, eToys, last week reported fourth-quarter sales of $107
million.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said that its gross profit margin _ sales minus cost of
products sold _ fell to 13 percent from 21 percent a year ago. That
was largely because of some extra shipping costs and the cost of
discount coupons meant to get book customers to try other products.
The company predicted that its margin would return to about 20
percent in the first quarter of 2000 and would increase throughout
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that its cash and marketable securities totaled
$705 million at the end of the year, just shy of its $719 million
loss for the year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Amazon has announced deals with half a dozen
other online stores _ including Greenlight.com, drugstore.com,
Audible and living.com _ that are giving Amazon cash and stock in
return for promotions on Amazon's Web site. Amazon executives said
that the revenue from those deals would supplement the company's
earnings but that the underlying retail businesses would eventually
be profitable on their own.

 &HT;    Rocker issue hangs in air
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As ``Camp Leo'' opened Tuesday, the Braves started
preparing to begin a new season without John Rocker. At the same
time, the players' union filed a grievance aimed at getting Rocker
back with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Mazzone's pitching camp began at Turner Field about the time
word came of the grievance filed on Rocker's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discipline is without just cause,'' the union said in a
letter to the commissioner's office. Commissioner Bud Selig
suspended Rocker from spring training and the first 28 days of the
season and fined him $20,000. The appeal will be heard by
arbitrator Shyam Das within a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves front office, meanwhile, hopes the furor over
Rocker's remarks in Sports Illustrated disparaging a variety of
people will die down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' Braves general manager John Schuerholz said
Tuesday. ``The decision has been made. How much longer can you talk
about it?... It's a resolved issue. We've got to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the players anticipate having to face Rocker
questions, whether now or two months from now _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole offseason, I tried to kind of distance myself from
it and not really think about it,'' pitcher Kevin Millwood said.
Millwood joined Mike Remlinger, Kevin McGlinchy, Derrin Ebert,
Damian Moss, Everett Stull, Jason Marquis and Scott Sobkowiak at
Camp Leo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really say you're just going to throw it away and
not ever worry about it,'' Millwood said. ``Obviously, it's put our
whole team in a situation where everybody here is going to have to
answer questions. It's not really what you want to do coming into
spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger said he thinks the Braves will be the ones paying the
price if Rocker is not allowed to come to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allow him to come to spring training, whether it is or
isn't a distraction, it's in a setting where it has minimal
effects,'' Remlinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say it turns out to be the worst-case scenario you could
imagine as far as being a distraction; it's still only spring
training, and you've got however many weeks to get over that,'' he
said. ``Now if you have him come back and join us during the
season, if it's a distraction now, it can take away from winning
ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox said he has spoken with Rocker over the
pitcher's remarks in SI about teammates and his claim that Cox
never talked to him about tempering his behavior toward the fans in
Shea Stadium during the National League Championship Series. Rocker
blamed Ozzie Guillen for costing him a save, referred to a teammate
as a ``fat monkey'' _ Randall Simon has said Rocker was talking
about him _ and criticized the Braves' clubhouse atmosphere and the
veterans who set it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told John he has to live with some of the things he did say
about the people, but when you start talking about the ballclub,
that's kind of my territory,'' Cox said. ``I told John then, 'I'd
(ream) a lot of players out for a lot less than you did. If this
had happened during the season, you'd have been in a lot of
trouble.' He knows how I feel about that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cox would obviously like to have Rocker in spring
training, he didn't criticize Selig's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Remlinger did. ``It's a little extreme,'' he said. ``That's
not to say he doesn't deserve some type (of) discipline. But that
length, I don't know if that's right.... It's like (Selig) wanted
to wield the almighty sword (owners) gave him a week or two ago''
to act in baseball's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's nothing really good that can come out of it,''
Remlinger said, ``because the union's got to fight it, whether they
think it's the right fight or not. They have to because that's what
they do _ they represent our side... ''
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young
questioned the commissioner's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hypocritical because Major League Baseball is still the
organization that drove off its top two black executives
recently,'' Young said. ``They had to pick on Rocker because they
couldn't face their own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John gets back with us, it's going to be a little
tough,'' Millwood said. ``Obviously, there are people all over the
country that have seen (the article), all over the world that have
seen it. Nobody's really going to forget about it just because he's
gone for a month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be something he's going to have to deal with
more than anybody else,'' Millwood said, ``but I think with this
team, we're a pretty close-knit group. I think if any team can go
through it, this would be the team.''

WOUNDED, BUSH CAMP RETHINKS STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
   (With MCCAIN-NY-BALLOT, SC-MCCAIN-BUSH, NH-MCCAIN) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Hours after his stinging defeat in the New
Hampshire primary, Gov. George W. Bush and his advisers began
moving Wednesday to contain the damage, imploring supporters and
donors to remain on their side and trying to tamp down a
controversy in New York state over whether Sen. John McCain will be
on the primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers say they now must win the next big primary in South
Carolina on Feb. 19. And while polls there have shown Bush with a
healthy lead over McCain, they began moving Wednesday to avoid a
repeat of the jolt they suffered in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   As a start, Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, talked Wednesday
morning with New York Republican leaders, who have been searching
for ways to quell the publicity over the party's efforts to remove
McCain from the ballot in many congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Some party members in the state have begun to fear that the
effort, led by Gov. George Pataki and other Bush supporters, was
backfiring, and Republican leaders said Wednesday they were
considering abandoning a court fight with McCain over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, acknowledged that Rove
signaled to the New York GOP leadership that if McCain wins his
ballot fight in federal court, the Bush campaign would be content
to see the issue dropped. ``If they decided not to appeal,'' she
said said, ``we welcome the opportunity to defeat Mr. McCain in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Bush advisers said the issue has been playing in McCain's
favor because it fuels his image as a reformer. ``We're giving him
an issue to beat us over the head with,'' said one aide.
</P>
<P>
   In another move to contain repercussions from the outcome on
Tuesday, Bush campaign officials began calling and e-mailing major
donors and supporters on Capitol Hill, insisting that they were
pressing ahead and that Bush was not in grave trouble. One senior
adviser called it ``a massive campaign of reassurance of everyone
on the finance side and inside the Beltway.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the drive to stop McCain, Bush advisers said they
also were planning to get tougher on the senator on the stump and
in television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were weighing such moves as pounding away at
McCain's tax proposal and, as the campaign heads to the
conservative south, they would harden the tone of his appeal and
question McCain's credentials on abortion and other social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking to reporters in South Carolina on Wednesday,
said, ``I think I can defend myself without being harsh on him.''
</P>
<P>
   But, reflecting concerns by advisers who have cringed at
McCain's suggestion that the Texas governor was not ready to be
president, Bush added, ``I will point up differences.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would respond to suggestions by the McCain campaign
that the senator's experience makes him ``the only person in the
race who can be the commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers, under attack from people within their own
campaign for mounting an operation that critics said was far too
insular in New Hampshire, also said they hoped to broaden their
organization and seek more help from governors as part of an effort
to underscore their view that Bush _ unlike McCain _ is a genuine
Washington outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Given the financial and organizational advantages of the Bush
campaign, aides said they were still confident that he would win
the nomination. But the aides said they were pouring money into
South Carolina because a victory in that contest is now imperative.
</P>
<P>
   And several of Bush's top fund-raisers said they were worried
that the Texas governor's financial supporters _ and the elected
officials who endorsed him early on _ would now begin to hedge
their bets and quickly send checks to the McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every congressman is sitting there now saying, `Holy Cow! Did
I do the right thing? Am I too out front with this guy?''' said a
leading fund-raiser for Bush. ``The process of reassuring people on
the hill is very important _ you stop the buzz from going way off
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top Bush fund-raiser said of McCain's victory in New
Hampshire of more than 18 percentage points: ``The margin floored
us _ when I came in I had 75 phone calls this morning. There's a
lot of pressure on us for next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns about Bush's institutional support eroding were
very real. Several established Republicans said they were watching
for signs that the governor has lost control of the image he
enjoyed for months as the unconquerable front-runner. They also
said they were worried that Bush may no longer be viewed as a
daunting rival for Vice President Al Gore in a general election _
and that the criticism of Bush as unprepared for the White House
may be sinking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's a very experienced guy and McCain's argument that he's
got to be better prepared for the debates has some resonance,''
said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who has stayed neutral in the
nomination battle. ``People still see Governor Bush as the dominant
force. But there's a danger signal there. If New Hampshire shows
McCain's catching on as a populist, it could be real trouble for
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush operatives plot how to limit political damage,
recriminations began over how the campaign in New Hampshire was
waged. Several Bush supporters also said McCain was helped in
portraying Bush as a product of the establishment when the governor
appeared here in the closing days with Jack Kemp, former Gov. John
H. Sununu of New Hampshire and his father, former President Bush.
``They trotted out the icons of the Republican past,'' said a
prominent backer of Bush. ``I was waiting for them to bring out Bob
Taft from the dead. Not the current governor but his grandfather,''
referring to Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio and his grandfather, William
Howard Taft, the former president and chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Bush said he did not regret the
panoply of endorsements _ or the support from his family. ''If
people expect me to distance myself from my family,'' he said,
``they've got the wrong candidate. My family is part of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he expected to win in South Carolina, Bush added, ``I'm a
competitor _ and I'm prepared to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers to Bush said they winced when, in his concession
speech on Tuesday, the governor declared, ``South Carolina is Bush
country!'' They said that sounded like, again, the governor was
relying on his father's old network to boost his prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush's backers in South Carolina warned him that he had
better straighten out his campaign _ and fast. ``He's got too many
hired guns,'' H.B. Limehouse, a county chairman for Bush in the
state and one of his earliest supporters, said Wednesday. ``Mr.
Bush almost acted like he was an incumbent president. The problem
they missed is that they're so afraid he'll say something dumb,
it's stupid. He was controlled.''

about what would happen to my company,'' he says. ``But it's a
family business. We have plans for it to continue.'' (Laura

stem consolidation in the oil industry, the federal government
decided Wednesday to try to block BP Amoco's $30 billion

market power and harm competition by creating a significant risk
that crude oil prices would be higher on the West Coast than they
would without the deal,'' says Richard G. Parker, the director of

Sachs lives with chairs by Frank Gehry for Knoll and a Saarinen
table. ``You can have the best concept in the world, but if it
doesn't look good, what's the point?'' asks Sachs. For years,
design has wanted to be art, quoting every art source it can think
of, appealing to collectors and showing up, a self-conscious guest,
in galleries and museums. Now, a generation of artists is
rediscovering design as a means of expression. (Fred R. Conrad/The

weed, the sicklepod plant, kills kudzu 100 percent of the time.

 &HT;    Glavine: Message has been sen
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Rocker's case is an interesting one for many
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was clear Wednesday morning when Tom Glavine offered
his perspective after his first throwing session at ``Camp Leo'' at
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Players usually defend a teammate as the case goes though the
process of punishment and appeal. So this one is delicate,
particularly for a team's representative with the players' union _
which filed a grievance on Rocker's behalf Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said he has been in regular contact with the players'
union. In an unusual move, he asked the union to be careful how
much of a reduction it would seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I didn't want them to (file a grievance),'' he
said. ``I just asked them to be mindful of how much (of a
reduction) they were trying to get, because I think it was
important, especially to our guys, to see that some sort of
punishment was paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on what already has happened, Glavine said, he thinks the
team can live with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think from guys' standpoint now, the message has been sent
that a stiff price has been handed down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said he had mixed feelings on whether a grievance should
have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's part of me that thinks it would have gone a long way
toward showing remorse if John would have just said, `OK, forget
it. That's the price I'm going to pay, and I'll pay it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, I understand (the filing),'' he said.
``Nobody's ever been suspended this long for saying something
stupid.''
</P>

   Arbitrator Shyam Das is scheduled to hear the case within the
next two weeks. Das will uphold commissioner Bud Selig's decision
to suspend Rocker for a month and fine him $20,000, overrule it or
offer a reduced penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine has turned his attention to getting prepared for
Rocker's return, whether it's May 1 or sooner. Glavine, who was
among the seven Braves to meet with general manager John Schuerholz
and club president Stan Kasten on the subject two weeks ago, said
he anticipates that Braves players will sit down with Rocker,
listen to his side and air their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're going to have a situation where, the
first time John Rocker walks in the clubhouse, somebody's going to
want to beat him up,'' Glavine said. ``There are too many classy
guys in here for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said he hopes to meet with Rocker in the next several
days, offer his help in the reconciliation process, and reiterate
his thoughts on the standard of behavior Braves players should
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's issued his apologies like he's supposed to, like he
needed to,'' Glavine said. ``Now, in my mind, it's going to be more
about how does John Rocker act from this day forward, day in and
day out, to show me that he's sorry and that things have changed.''

design has wanted to be art, quoting every art source it can think

in galleries and museums. Now, a generation of artists is
rediscovering design as a means of expression. (Fred R. Conrad/The

the snowbound Himalayas before arriving Jan. 5 in Dharamsala, home
to the Tibetan government-in-exile. (The New York Times)

   (NYT42) WASHINGTON -- Feb. 2, 2000 -- OIL-MERGER -- Moving to
stem consolidation in the oil industry, the federal government
decided Wednesday to try to block BP Amoco's $30 billion
acquisition of the Atlantic Richfield Co. ``This deal will cement
market power and harm competition by creating a significant risk
that crude oil prices would be higher on the West Coast than they
would without the deal,'' says Richard G. Parker, the director of
the bureau of competition at the Federal Trade commission. (Shana

year of the male iron dragon Feb. 5 , there is not one claimant to
the title of Karmapa - one of Tibetan Buddhism's holiest figures -

average door is carefully constructed of a number of pieces
fabricated to help the door move properly while withstanding a
variety of stresses. Entry doors, for example, are made to
withstand the vicissitudes of nature. They must remain
dimensionally stable during the temperature extremes of winter and
summer. In addition to being functional, doors must be attractive
enough for the surrounding decor of the house. (Edward R.

   (NYT38) NEW YORK -- Feb. 2, 2000 -- ARTIST-DESIGNERS-2 -- Tom
Sachs lives with chairs by Frank Gehry for Knoll and a Saarinen
table. ``You can have the best concept in the world, but if it
doesn't look good, what's the point?'' asks Sachs. For years,
design has wanted to be art, quoting every art source it can think
of, appealing to collectors and showing up, a self-conscious guest,
in galleries and museums. Now, a generation of artists is
rediscovering design as a means of expression. (Fred R. Conrad/The
New York Times)

   (NYT37) NEW YORK -- Feb. 2, 2000 -- ARTIST-DESIGNERS-1 -- Tom
Sachs translated Rietveld's 1918 painted wood chair in colored duct
tape. While design has been worrying about its artfulness, a
generation of artists working now and exhibiting widely is
investigating design, from residential architecture to interior and
furniture design to home renovation, envying its ability to reach
the public and be relevant. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times)

tears into kudzu with his rubber tire loader on a vacant lot in
Atlanta. Federal weed experts think they may have finally found a
match for kudzu, the vigorous vine that crawls over trees,
telephone poles, barns and all else in its path. Agricultural
Research Service scientists say a fungus found on another southern
weed, the sicklepod plant, kills kudzu 100 percent of the time.

One protester uses his pet to voice his feelings about same sex
marriage at a rally in Montpelier on Wednesday. Six weeks after the
Vermont Supreme Court ruled that gay couples deserve the same

These days, there are two claimants to the tit of Karmapa - one of
Tibetan Buddhism's holiest figures - both of them teen-aged boys.
On Dec. 28, one of them, 14-year-old Ugyen Trinley Dorje, fled
Chinese-controlled Tibet, enduring an overland journey across the
snowbound Himalayas before arriving Jan. 5 in Dharamsala, home to
the Tibetan government-in-exile. (The New York Times)

   (NYT42) WASHINGTON -- Feb. 2, 2000 -- OIL-MERGER -- Moving to
stem consolidation in the oil industry, the federal government
decided Wednesday to try to block BP Amoco's $30 billion
acquisition of the Atlantic Richfield Co. ``This deal will cement
market power and harm competition by creating a significant risk
that crude oil prices would be higher on the West Coast than they
would without the deal,'' says Richard G. Parker, the director of
the bureau of competition at the Federal Trade commission. (Shana

   (NYT41) RUMTEK, India -- Feb. 2, 2000 -- LAMA-RIVALS-2 -- The
Rumtek Monastery in India. For now, as the world enters the Tibetan
year of the male iron dragon Feb. 5 , there is not one claimant to
the title of Karmapa - one of Tibetan Buddhism's holiest figures -
but two, both of them teen-aged boys whose mentors find the
aspirations of the other wickedly perverse. The rival incarnations
have strained relations between India and China. (Barry Bearak/The

   (NYT39) UNDATED -- Feb. 2, 2000 -- HOME-IMPROVEMENT-B&AMP;W -- The
average door is carefully constructed of a number of pieces
fabricated to help the door move properly while withstanding a
variety of stresses. Entry doors, for example, are made to
withstand the vicissitudes of nature. They must remain
dimensionally stable during the temperature extremes of winter and
summer. In addition to being functional, doors must be attractive
enough for the surrounding decor of the house. (Edward R.

   (NYT38) NEW YORK -- Feb. 2, 2000 -- ARTIST-DESIGNERS-2 -- Tom
Sachs lives with chairs by Frank Gehry for Knoll and a Saarinen
table. ``You can have the best concept in the world, but if it
doesn't look good, what's the point?'' asks Sachs. For years,
design has wanted to be art, quoting every art source it can think
of, appealing to collectors and showing up, a self-conscious guest,
in galleries and museums. Now, a generation of artists is
rediscovering design as a means of expression. (Fred R. Conrad/The
New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT37) NEW YORK -- Feb. 2, 2000 -- ARTIST-DESIGNERS-1 -- Tom
Sachs translated Rietveld's 1918 painted wood chair in colored duct
tape. While design has been worrying about its artfulness, a
generation of artists working now and exhibiting widely is
investigating design, from residential architecture to interior and
furniture design to home renovation, envying its ability to reach
the public and be relevant. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times)

   (NYT33) ATLANTA -- Feb. 2, 2000 -- KUDZU-COX -- Danny Henderson
tears into kudzu with his rubber tire loader on a vacant lot in
Atlanta. Federal weed experts think they may have finally found a
match for kudzu, the vigorous vine that crawls over trees,
telephone poles, barns and all else in its path. Agricultural
Research Service scientists say a fungus found on another southern
weed, the sicklepod plant, kills kudzu 100 percent of the time.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lest anyone question Vice President Al Gore's
commitment to abortion rights, he demonstrated that commitment
Wednesday, diverting his campaign from New York to race back to
Washington for a possible tie vote in the Senate, jumping on a
commercial flight (with an aide ferrying the nation's nuclear
codes) to get here.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, his vote was not needed. But that was only
because Republicans realized that the Democrats had outfoxed them,
and they gave up rather than allow Gore to showcase himself on a
matter that has tripped him up in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver whipped up a whirlwind detour in Gore's already
overloaded campaign schedule, producing one of the more bizarre
24-hour periods in this primary season.
</P>
<P>
   After winning in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, Gore flew at
midnight from Manchester to New York. He held a 30-second rally on
the frigid tarmac at La Guardia Airport at 1 a.m. Wednesday,
motorcaded into Manhattan for two hours of sleep, hit a round of
morning television shows at 6 a.m., rushed to Grand Central
Terminal to greet commuters, received a cell-phone call from
Washington that the Senate could be deadlocked, sped back to
LaGuardia to take the 9 a.m. USAirways shuttle, presided over the
Senate at 10:30 a.m., motorcaded to Andrews Air Force Base two
hours later, flew to an afternoon rally in Columbus, Ohio, then
flew to Los Angeles Wednesday night for a town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The question arose: Was this necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, said Democrats. A cheap stunt, said Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was on an amendment to a bankruptcy bill that would bar
people convicted of crimes against abortion clinics from bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday morning, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic leader, alerted Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chairman,
that they would need Gore to break the tie.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had arrived in New York on Air Force 2 but could not take
it back because the crew, expecting to leave later for Ohio, was
still at a Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   By 11:45 a.m., Gore was holding a news conference/pep rally in
the Capitol, flanked by more than a dozen Senate Democrats and
female representatives, as well as Kate Michelman, an
abortion-rights advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his decision to come to Washington reflected a
need to shore up his credentials on an issue on which former Sen.
Bill Bradley had challenged him, Gore answered curtly, ``It did
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Gore took his place in the president's chair in
the Senate chamber _ and Republicans, fully aware of how Gore has
exploited his tiebreaking vote in favor of a gun-control measure
last year, decided to deny him another opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the morning, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, had led the
charge against the amendment. But after Gore's theatrical arrival,
Hatch said: ``It's clear from today's debate that nobody in the
Congress supports violence at abortion clinics.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Hatch announced that he, Sen. Trent Lott, the
majority leader, and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who was the
bill's main sponsor, were recommending that Republicans vote for
the amendment. The amendment then passed lopsidedly, 80-17,
rendering Gore useless.

156 MEXICANS ARE JAILED AFTER UNIVERSITY MELEE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's federal authorities jailed 156 strikers
from the national university Wednesday, including 86 adults and 70
minors, who took part in violent clashes on Tuesday with a faction
opposed to the strike. They face charges ranging from disturbing
the peace to terrorism, which is a federal felony.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the administration and the strikers, which were
scheduled to resume Wednesday after a six-week lapse, were canceled
by both sides. Only a week after the university president, Juan
Ramon de la Fuente, called on students and faculty to negotiate the
reopening of their departments directly with the strikers, he was
forced to abandon that strategy. He pleaded with students opposing
the strike not to try to enter any university buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day top government and justice officials,
journalists, strike leaders and the authorities from the National
Autonomous University of Mexico vied to prevail with their version
of the confusing and fierce fighting at Preparatory School 3.
Officials said that 37 people were injured in the worst violence in
the nine-month strike.
</P>
<P>
   Television news videotape and witnesses from both rival factions
disclosed that the midday takeover of the school by a group opposed
to the strike had not been peaceful, as Mexican television
originally reported. The anti-strike faction forced its way through
the front gates, rousted a handful of strikers off the school
grounds and then hurled stones at strikers who began to gather in
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Of 200 people in the anti-strike faction, only a small number
were students or administrators from the preparatory school. Jose
Serrano Migallon, the university's general counsel, said the
administration dispatched a group of unarmed civilian custodians,
usually assigned to direct traffic and keep order on campus, to
stand watch at the school after the strikers were evicted. The
injured were all from this group.

CLINTON ENLISTS HELP FOR PLAN TO INCREASE COMPUTER USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday sought to build
support for his $2.3 billion initiative to bridge what he calls the
digital divide by convening computer executives, including Stephen
M. Case of America Online, at an inner-city high school struggling
to wire all its computers to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the budget proposal he would unveil next week,
which requires congressional approval, will include tax incentives
of $2 billion over 10 years as well as expanded grants to encourage
the private sector to donate computers, sponsor technology centers
in poor neighborhoods and train those not yet connected to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Government studies have shown significant differences in
Internet access of rich and poor. Households with incomes above
$75,000 in urban areas are 20 times more likely to have access to
the Web than the poorest households. Racial disparities also exist,
with black and Hispanic families 40 percent as likely as whites to
have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be tragic if this instrument, that has done more to
break down barriers between people than anything in all of human
history, built a new wall because not everybody had access to it,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   With the declared goal of making Internet access as common as
telephone usage, Clinton would set aside $150 million to help train
new teachers to better use technology.
</P>
<P>
   His budget also calls for the creation of 1,000 community
technology centers in low-income neighborhoods, at a cost of $100
million, and the launch of a $50 million pilot project to encourage
private industry to provide home computers for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Another $10 million would go to a special program to help
American Indians prepare for careers in information technology.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the president's digital divide proposal,
which he described Jan. 27 in the State of the Union address as ``a
national crusade'' to create ``opportunity for all,'' would be $2
billion in tax incentives over the next decade to encourage
companies to donate computers, sponsor schools, libraries and
community centers, and support technology training for workers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under current law, computer makers get a tax deduction for
computers they donate to schools. The president's proposal would
extend that benefit, which expires this year, until 2004 and
broaden it to include donations to libraries and other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have shown support for Clinton's goal
of hooking up more Americans to the Internet. But the specifics of
a federal response are still being developed on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little nervous about having the federal government
dictate what gets done in school districts,'' said Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, who heads the Senate High Tech Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his budget announcement at Ballou Senior High
School in a struggling neighborhood in Washington. The school,
which offers computer courses ranging from basic keyboarding to
computer repair, was selected as an example of how schools in poor
neighborhoods can keep up in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   The school's 140 computer terminals are now partially linked to
the Internet. But several private companies and labor unions are
working with officials there to begin technical training programs,
upgrade the computer skills of teachers and wire the rest of the
campus.

SEARCHERS FIND `BLACK BOX' IN ALASKA AIRLINES JET CRASH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ Searchers on Wednesday recovered one of
the ``black boxes,'' the cockpit voice recorder, from the Alaska
Airlines jet that crashed on Monday and found a place where the
other might be, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety
Board said Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder will be shipped by government aircraft Wednesday
night said the spokesman, Ted Lopatkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was
looking into a news report of trouble on a flight earlier in the
day on the same type of plane as the one that crashed, killing 88
people. And another plane of the same model, an MD-83, made an
emergency return to Phoenix Wednesday after the crew said it had
problems with the stabilizer trim, the same system that the crew of
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 told air traffic controllers in Los
Angeles that they had problems with shortly before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not disclose anything that made the cause of
the crash clear, but they did mount an intense effort to recover
parts of the plane. The searchers, who covered 4,400 miles with 38
vessels and nine aircraft, crossing back and forth over an area
about the size of Rhode Island, found more floating debris from the
MD-83 but no additional human remains. Four bodies were found on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard ended its search for survivors Wednesday. ``We
have far exceeded our estimates of survivability,'' Vice Adm. Tom
Collins of the Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
   The second MD-83 that reported a problem with its horizontal
control system was American Airlines flight 1538, which took off
from Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix at 8:20 a.m. with 59 passengers
and crew members. The cockpit crew reported an intermittent problem
with the stabilizer trim while the plane was climbing to 13,000
feet, people involved in the incident said. The crew was able to
return the trim to a position appropriate for landing, and the
plane returned safely to Phoenix at 9:03 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   After major airline crashes, reports of similar problems from
other crews are common. After the pilots of Swissair Flight 111, an
MD-11, reported smoke in the cockpit before crashing into the
Atlantic Ocean off Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Sept. 2, 1998, killing
all 229 people aboard, several planes made emergency landings
because of smoke. But reports of trouble from other planes have
also helped investigators solve crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board took the Phoenix
plane's flight data recorder, and mechanics began looking at the
electric motor that drives the stabilizer trim, people involved in
the incident said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The suspect part on the MD-83 comprises the forward two-thirds
of the horizontal stabilizer, the wing-like section of the tail. It
is driven by an electric motor and a jack-screw, similar to the
kind that raise and lower garage doors. Pilots use the stabilizer
to enable the plane to climb, cruise or descend; for quick changes,
they use moveable parts, called elevators, that make up the rear
third of the horizontal stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of Alaska Flight 261, bound from the Mexican resort of
Puerto Vallarta to San Francisco and then to Seattle, had reported
that its horizontal stabilizer had jammed, the safety board said.
Pilots who fly the MD-80 series said Wednesday that the stabilizer
could have jammed soon after takeoff, but the autopilot might have
masked the problem for a time by using the elevators.
</P>
<P>
   But the pitch of the plane _ the nose-up or nose-down attitude _
changes with the plane's speed and with its center of gavity,
which changes as the plane burns fuel. Pilots said that if the
Alaska Airlines plane gained speed and burned fuel, thus reaching
the point where the autopilot could no longer compensate, the
autopilot would switch off, leaving the crew to determine what had
happened by looking at their instruments or out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``In flight simulators, when we train for this, this is one of
the more deceptive onsets of a problem,'' one MD-80 captain said.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of threat posed by a jammed stabilizer may depend on
the position in which the stabilizer is jammed, pilots say. Many
planes have recovered from such jams. The first line of defense
would be the elevators, which on the MD-80 series are operated by
cables that run back to the pilots' yokes in the cockpit, and also
have hydraulic boost pumps.
</P>
<P>
   If the device jammed in a nose-up position, a crew could
compensate by banking and putting the plane into a turn, which
would turn the lifting force of the wings somewhat to the side,
making the nose fall.
</P>
<P>
   John Hammerschmidt, the safety board member assigned to the
accident here, said investigators were checking into a news report
that the crew that flew the plane to Puerto Vallarta had reported
``some mechanical discrepancies.'' He said investigators wanted to
interview the crew as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   After planning an emergency approach to Los Angeles, the pilots
of Alaska Flight 261 radioed that they were going to
``reconfigure'' the airplane. It was their last transmission.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators will not know what happened until they can
analyze the cockpit voice recorder and recover the flight data
recorder, pilots noted that lowering the flaps on the wings would
tend to raise the nose and lower the plane's speed, which could
make a plane ``stall,'' with too little airflow over the wings to
keep it flying.

<P>
   RUMTEK, India _ Deshin Shekpa was born during the year of the
male wood mouse (1384), and it is said he could be heard chanting a
mantra and reciting the alphabet while still inside his mother's
womb. At the moment of his birth, he boldly proclaimed himself to
be the fifth incarnation of the Karmapa, one of Tibetan Buddhism's
holiest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient texts describe the fifth Karmapa as a conjurer of
miracles, able to light the clouds with iridescent colors and
summon flowers to fall from the sky. But his many teachings, while
a source of soothing wisdom, also included a dark prophecy:
centuries in the distance, during the time of his own 16th and 17th
incarnations, the demonic power of ``perverse aspirations'' would
bring the entire Karmapa lineage close to destruction.
</P>
<P>
   This vision seems to have been eerily prescient, for now, as the
world enters the Tibetan year of the male iron dragon on Feb. 5 ,
there is not one claimant to the title of Karmapa but two, both of
them teen-aged boys whose mentors find the aspirations of the other
wickedly perverse.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, one of those boys, 14-year-old Ugyen Trinley Dorje,
fled Chinese-controlled Tibet, enduring an overland journey across
the snowbound Himalayas. On Jan. 5, he arrived in Dharamsala, the
picturesque Indian hill station that is home to the Tibetan
government-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
   His sudden presence, while a ticklish matter between India and
China, which have been working to overcome long-strained relations,
has been a cause for rejoicing among most Tibetans here. The
Karmapa is usually considered the third most revered figure in
Tibetan Buddhism, after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, and
the newly arrived boy had the unusual distinction of having been
endorsed as the 17th incarnation by both the Dalai Lama and the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been significantly less joy in New Delhi, home to
a rival faction that insists it is the one with the genuine
Karmapa. Shamar Rinpoche, a high lama also known as the Shamarpa,
has been championing this second contender since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is not only the leadership of one of the oldest
branches of Tibetan Buddhism but one of its richest monasteries as
well. And that has kept the Shamarpa desperately busy denouncing
the newly arrived teen-ager and his patrons as perpetrators of
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddha would not be laughing right now,'' the Shamarpa said.
``This is all about politics. It's a story filled with many
traitors and betrayals.''
</P>
<P>
   Such intrigue is hardly uncommon to the Buddhism of Tibet,
which, before the Chinese occupation in the 1950s, was a theocratic
state where spiritual passions often bumped up against worldly
ambitions. The highest lamas are believed to be so spiritually
advanced that while their physical form may perish, their superior
consciousness lives on in other bodies and can be recognized. Rival
disciples sometimes disagree about which child has become the new
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a rare precaution against such discord, the Karmapa often
leaves a ``prediction letter'' with clues about where to find his
next incarnation. This guiding document, however, sometimes can be
hard to locate and stubbornly cryptic once found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Karmapa dispute is sort of a medieval tragicomedy,'' said
Tsering Shakya, a London-based scholar who has written a history of
modern Tibet. ``Who really knows who the Karmapa is? On one hand,
there are these arguments about dreams and prophecies. On the
other, there are the highly rational matters of controlling money
and property.''
</P>
<P>
   There is international politics as well. The 14-year-old's
escape from Tibet's historic Tsurphu Monastery is an embarrassment
for China. In 1992, government officials had permitted the boy's
enthronement as the 17th Karmapa, using him as a showpiece for a
purported revival of religious tolerance. Chinese officials
explained his departure by saying he was visiting India to fetch
belongings of the 16th Karmapa and warned India against granting
him political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Tibetan authorities in Dharamsala are prudently
keeping the teen-ager in seclusion as Indian and Chinese diplomats
attend to the fractious matter of his status.
</P>
<P>
   If he is allowed to stay, his eventual home is likely to be here
in the village of Rumtek, where the 16th Karmapa, who fled Tibet in
1959, built a lavish monastery in the Himalayan state of Sikkim,
which has since been annexed by India.
</P>
<P>
   The Rumtek monastery has been this conflict's main battlefield,
a place where religious gatherings have turned into brawls. The
buildings are multilayered, with tiers of white, yellow and
oxblood. The Karmapa's throne is centered in a grand assembly hall,
where ornate wooden casements hold 1,000 Buddha statuettes and
hundreds of ancient manuscripts. Stored in a locked room are other
treasured relics, most importantly the bejeweled black hat that has
been worn by every Karmapa for 600 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the monastery's monks were ecstatic. Some recently
had been to Dharamsala and seen the 14-year-old and were speaking
of his aura, his calm and the ways he reminded them of his previous
incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ugyen Jigme, 62, wept, overcome with wonderment. He had been
the 16th Karmapa's personal physician. And now he had met the boy.
``I could tell he knew everything about me,'' he said. ``He still
has the same gestures, the same laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, however, the mood was dour, the monks
disconsolate.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, dozens of them _ they put their number at 115 _
have been outcasts, followers of the less-acknowledged Karmapa.
Many of them live in shacks, tents and converted animal pens. Their
small prayer hall has walls of corrugated metal and a floor of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Lungtok Dawa had lived in the Rumtek monastery for most of his
life _ and claims to have been beaten up for his rebellious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will come a day when the rightful Karmapa will live in
the monastery and wear the black hat,'' he said mournfully. ``But I
don't know when this will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Karmapa left his physical shell in 1981, succumbing to
cancer in a hospital near Chicago. His dead body, many followers
believe, maintained its normal temperature for three days as if in
gentle meditation. He was cremated in Rumtek, and when a charred
part of the remains fell from the pyre, it was presumed to be the
Karmapa's heart and has been preserved in a golden shrine in the
monastery.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for locating the next incarnation fell to
four young regents, themselves incarnate lamas with titles that go
back hundreds of years. They had been the 16th Karmapa's chief
disciples, and two of them _ the 12th Tai Situpa and the 13th
Shamarpa _ were rivals for the position of second in the hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, the Tai Situpas had been emergent while the
Shamapas fell into disrepute. The 10th Shamarpa had been accused of
starting a war between Tibet and Nepal, and, as punishment, his
reincarnation as a high lama was forbidden. During the next 150
years, his embodiments lived in obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Karmapa himself resurrected the position. He may have
had other reasons, but the boy identified as the 13th Shamarpa was
also his nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Tashi Delsapa, the secretary for culture in Sikkim, has known
both the current Tai Situpa and Shamarpa since they were children
and describes something like a sibling rivalry. ``Jealousies crept
in, and they involved mundane, not religious things,'' he said.
``There was a lot of money to control. Shamar, being a nephew, may
have thought that control of money and the monastery was his
inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa is the best-known figure among the Kagyupas, one of
the four main orders in Tibetan Buddhism _ and one with a wide
following across Asia and the West. Wild speculation is often made
about the sums controlled by the Karmapa Charitable Trust and
associated legal entities, but these estimates are largely
guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, both Tai Situpa and the Shamarpa spent much of
their time abroad. No one had been able to find any memento with
the deceased Karmapa's cryptic clues, let alone his incarnation.
The faithful were frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at an extraordinary meeting of the regents in 1992, Tai
Situpa announced he had found the guiding missive. To the
astonishment of some, he said he had unwittingly worn the vital
document for years. It was folded inside a talisman attached to a
string, a gift from the 16th Karmapa.
</P>
<P>
   One translation of the letter reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``From here to the north in the east of the land of snow
</P>
<P>
   Is a country where divine thunder spontaneously blazes
</P>
<P>
   In a beautiful nomad's place with the sign of a cow
</P>
<P>
   The method is Dondrup and the wisdom is Lolaga
</P>
<P>
   Born in the year of the one used for the earth
</P>
<P>
   With the miraculous, far-reaching sound of the white one
</P>
<P>
   This is the one known as Karmapa.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Tai Situpa reported that a search party in
Tibet had found the appropriate lad, the son of yak-tending nomads,
Karma Dondrup and his wife, Loga. Wondrous song birds had
celebrated the child's birth and rainbows had hovered above the
family's tent. The boy's greatness was apparent. He had entered a
monastery at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   The news was sent to the Dalai Lama, who, while a member of a
different religious order, is the temporal head of the government
in exile and generally considered the spiritual leader of Tibetan
Buddhism. He added his approval.
</P>
<P>
   After so much delay, the velocity of these blissful tidings was
both dizzying and dismaying for the Shamarpa. From the start, he
says, he considered the prediction letter an obvious forgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted forensic testing done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bewilderment afflicted many monks in Rumtek. One of the four
regents had died in a automobile accident, and of the three who
remained, two were telling them of a glorious discovery, while the
other warned of a venal conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, 1992, Tai Situpa addressed a crowd that had come to
the monastery to hear of the Karmapa's manifestation. Near the end
of the talk, the Shamarpa arrived unexpectedly with a small escort
of Indian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Amid so much tension, he said, the army had provided him
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of rifle-toting men angered many in the
courtyard. A group of women began to beat on the soldiers,
witnesses said. A man with an iron rod tried to hit the Shamarpa. A
microphone fell to the ground, sounding like a gunshot. People
scrambled. Several were injured in the shoving. There were
fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned monks fell to their knees and fingered their prayer
beads.
</P>
<P>
   During the following year, the monks of Rumtek were split, some
accepting the Karmapa, some not. Woefully, along the pathway to
human perfection was an active rumor mill. Dissenters were hearing
that thugs would be sent to evict them.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, 1993, a second brawl broke out, far worse than the
first. Versions of what occurred are as different as inner peace
and outer space. What is certain is that the split within the
monastery's walls had become irreparable. Dozens of monks slept in
the woods that night _ or in a hospital or in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Shamapa later provided them shelter. And, to their
jubilation, within months, he rewarded their loyalty by sharing a
stupendous revelation: a sagelike, clairvoyant boy born in 1983 was
newly arrived from Tibet _ the bona fide Karmapa.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Shamarpa would later say, he had secretly known of
this remarkable child for eight years _ and had been sending
discrete emissaries to observe him, weighing the evidence and
interpreting his own pertinent dreams to be absolutely sure.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1994, the alternative Karmapa _ Trinley Thaye Dorje _
was enthroned in New Delhi, where, predictably enough, yet another
scuffle broke out.
</P>
<P>
   The Shamarpa has since tried to assert control over the
properties of the Karmapa through lawsuits filed against the state
of Sikkim and the other regents.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, he also proposed a compromise solution to this
overabundance of Karmapas. Some enlightened beings have
reincarnated into more than one body, and the Shamarpa has been
willing to allow that one Karmapa could reign within the strictures
of Communist China while the other held sway in India.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, that had been the Shamarpa's edge. His Karmapa
was fully mobile _ indeed, the youth is currently among disciples
in Europe _ while the other side's was not. But if India allows the
recently escaped 14-year-old to stay, that advantage is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now furiously on the attack, the Shamarpa has been alleging that
Tai Situpa and the Chinese are in league, and that the boy intends
to sneak back to Tibet with the treasures of the Rumtek monastery.
``The rumor in Katmandu is that when Karmapa leaves, they'll sell
the big ruby pin from the black hat in Hong Kong for $28 million,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called ``Trojan Horse theory'' is taken seriously in
India, where suspicions of China, which does not recognize India's
control of Sikkim, are always ample. Seclusion has not kept the
newly arrived Karmapa from being intensively questioned by Indian
intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tai Situpa, who has a monastery near Dharamsala,
has been unwilling _ or unable _ to respond to the Shamarpa's
attacks. He was once banned from India for unspecified
``anti-Indian activities,'' and his permission to return in 1998
was conditioned on avoiding ``the issue of succession of Karmapa.''
</P>
<P>
   Truly, the ``agitation and fighting'' forecast in Deshin
Shekpa's 600-year-old prophecy is at hand. He spoke of the Buddha's
teachings falling into decline as evilness ``comes into fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   But the karmic wheel keeps turning. Over time, the prophecy
said, the Dharma _ Buddha's teachings _ will triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Resilient wisdom will bring back the peace of ``swift
blessings.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Today is a red-letter day for Clyde Drexler and the Rockets
franchise.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Or, to be more exact, a red-number day.
</P>
<P>
   Before their game against the Philadelphia 76ers tonight, the
Rockets will raise Drexler's jersey No. 22 to the Compaq Center
ceiling, where it will hang alongside the franchise's other retired
numbers _ Rudy Tomjanovich's No. 45, Moses Malone's No. 24 and
Calvin Murphy's No. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Among those present will be Hall of Famer Julius Erving,
Drexler's longtime idol; Jack Ramsay, Drexler's first NBA coach in
Portland; Buck Williams and Kiki Vandeweghe, two former Trail
Blazers teammates; and Guy V. Lewis, Drexler's coach at the
University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rockets in attendance will be Mike Newlin, Rodney McCray,
Sleepy Floyd, Kenny Smith, Terry Teagle, Allen Leavell, Dwight
Jones, Otto Moore, Terry Teagle, McCoy McLemore, Alonzo Bradley,
Major Jones and Jacky Dorsey.
</P>
<P>
   And while the day will certainly be special for Drexler, perhaps
no one in the building will be wearing a bigger smile than his
former UH and Rockets teammate, Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, it will be a very special moment for me, too,''
Olajuwon said. ``I will be very happy for him. I will be happy that
it happened here, with the Houston Rockets. God willing, one day my
jersey will be alongside of his (among the retired numbers).
</P>
<P>
   ``So that will continue that thread, that combination, of us
being together _ from college to the Rockets and all the way into
retirement. Our entire careers. I'm very happy for him. I really
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as happy as he was in 1995, when Olajuwon and Drexler
finally realized their longtime dream of playing together on an NBA
championship team.
</P>
<P>
   It was something they often discussed but never really thought
would become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we didn't,'' Olajuwon said. ``That was just conversation.
It was something for us to talk about and think about. We would get
together, and it would be like, `Man, can you imagine if we ever
got back together? I'll bet you we could win it all if we did.' But
it was just talk, not really knowing that one day it would all come
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``There we were, talking about playing together and winning it
all, and we really didn't know (that it would happen). To us, just
sitting there and imagining that was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Making that dream a reality would take quite some doing.
</P>
<P>
   Selected by Portland with the 14th pick in the 1983 draft,
Drexler had blossomed into an All-Star during his 11-plus seasons
with the Trail Blazers. He twice led Portland to the NBA Finals,
losing to Detroit in 1990 and to Chicago in 1992, and was a member
of the original Dream Team that won the gold medal in the 1992
Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Drexler was the Trail Blazers, so Olajuwon never
thought he would be coming home.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets, who had just won their first NBA title the year
before, were struggling and were looking to shake things up. What
better way than to bring the native son home?
</P>
<P>
   So on Valentine's Day in 1995, the improbable happened, and the
Rockets acquired Drexler in a trade. Now, it was up to Olajuwon to
supply the welcome-home gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so happy,'' Olajuwon said. ``I was like, `Wow. I can't
believe this.' But also knowing how bad Clyde wanted to come home,
I was so happy that I was going to be playing with him, and at the
same time I was happy for him knowing that he was getting exactly
what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, there was a new sense of responsibility for me, like,
`Wow. Now we have to win a championship (for Drexler).' That was
the big responsibility I felt inside.''
</P>
<P>
   And on June 14, 1995, Olajuwon and Drexler finally realized the
dream they had shared for much of their careers _ to win a
championship together. Denied an NCAA title by North Carolina State
in 1983, Drexler and Olajuwon watched the final seconds tick down
on the Rockets' 113-101 victory over Orlando in Game 4 of the NBA
Finals, completing a sweep of the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon sought out his friend and teammate, and the two
embraced, having finally reached their ultimate goal together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so happy,'' Olajuwon said. ``We didn't do it (win a
championship together) in college, so we had been talking about it
for so many years. And Clyde had been there (in the NBA Finals) a
couple of times and didn't finish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we did it together, and I felt so happy that I had
fulfilled that obligation, that responsibility we put on our
shoulders. That sense of accomplishment was one of the greatest
moments of my career.''

 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Riding the wave of his decisive victory in New
Hampshire, Sen. John McCain tore across South Carolina on Wednesday
arguing that he is the candidate who can ``attract people to our
party who have been alienated and disenchanted'' and carry
Republicans to victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after McCain's double-digit victory in the New
Hampshire primary dramatically shifted the contours of the
Republican race, McCain and a humbled Gov. George W. Bush both
shifted their battle for the nomination to this conservative state,
whose primary is less than three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   And both wasted little time positioning themselves before the
voters. While McCain presented himself as a centrist Republican who
could attract new converts to the party, Bush planted himself
firmly on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning Bush spoke to more than 5,000 students at Bob
Jones University, a bastion of Christian conservatism, where he
promised to keep ``our ideas, Republican ideas, conservative ideas,
at the top of the national agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent news conference, Bush rolled out his latest
prominent endorsement: that of former Vice President Dan Quayle,
who courted the votes of social conservatives in his own
presidential campaign before ending it in September.
</P>
<P>
   But the day clearly belonged to McCain, who emerged from New
Hampshire with not only an 18-percentage-point win over Bush but
also a surge of much needed campaign contributions. Every few
hours, McCain's aides ticked off new fund-raising totals from his
campaign Web site. By late in the day, they said, McCain had taken
in $500,000 online since the primary ended.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has been leading opinion polls in South Carolina
by as many 20 percentage points, McCain said Wednesday that the
record voter turnout in New Hampshire and the breadth of his
support there showed that he was the ``electable'' Republican whose
campaign against big monied special interests could broaden the
party base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of people went down and registered as Republicans so
they could vote for me,'' he said at a news conference Wednesday
morning in Greenville, his wife Cindy by his side. ``Electability
is all about getting the support of the center, the political
center. I'm a proud Republican conservative and maintain my base.
But through this message of reform we will attract to our banner
people all over the political spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain pointed to how Ronald Reagan had been able to attract
cross-over Democrats two decades ago. And he said that while he
opposes abortion, he thinks the Republican Party should be ``an
inclusionary party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very clear that Ronald Reagan was able to expand
the base of the party and continue to espouse the conservative
philosophy,'' he said. ``I have to do that as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign sought to diminish McCain's victory by
insisting that its superior organization and campaign war chest
would allow the Texas governor to last past the opening laps of the
Republican race and run a 50-state campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just has the luxury of picking and choosing and I'm a
national candidate,'' Bush said Wednesday on his campaign plane.
``I'm going to run in every primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bush's portrayal of himself as a 50-state candidate,
McCain said wryly Wednesday, ``My response is: Now he's running in
49 states. And after South Carolina it's going to be one less
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Long hoping that their insurgency would be ignited by victory in
New Hampshire, McCain's aides scrambled to take advantage of their
win, beginning a frenzy of fund-raising and hastily shifting
campaign workers from New Hampshire and Washington to South
Carolina for the push toward the Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's campaign also took on a new, more hip tone as the
candidate was welcomed with blaring disco and funk music at rallies
across the state. Just before 3 a.m. as McCain's plane touched down
from New Hampshire, hundreds of enthusiastic college students
awaited him in a hangar at the airport serving Spartanburg and
Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Purple and green strobe lights flashed, and an announcer
screamed, ``It's show time, baby. It's awesome,'' Then McCain's
``Straight Talk Express'' bus _ now a campaign icon _ rolled its
way into the hangar and the candidate and his supporters popped
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're crazy,'' Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., told the screaming,
dancing, pompom waving crowd. ``I used to think the people in New
Hampshire were kind of crazy,'' he laughed. ``That's until I met
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign also adopted a new tone, as the governor shifted
emphasis from some of the issues he concentrated on in New
Hampshire, like tax cuts and military spending, toward what he
called conservative values. And the shift suggested that for all of
Bush's assertions on Tuesday night and again Wednesday morning that
the results in New Hampshire had not rattled him, he and his
advisers were indeed a bit spooked.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the Bush camp was playing it safe in South
Carolina by sending signals to religious conservatives, who enjoy a
leading role in the state's Republican politics, that the governor
was a man with values just like theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle repeatedly used the word ``values'' in explaining his
support for the governor. And Bush chimed in, ``I'm going to
campaign on conservative values in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Bush cuddles too closely with social and religious
conservatives he could wind up with ideological associations that
will hurt him among independents and Democrats, who can also vote
in the primary, and, more important, in a general election, which
as McCain noted Wednesday is usually won in the political center.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not stake out any new positions Wednesday. Nor did he
utter buzz words like abortion or homosexuality, two divisive
issues he has labored to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But he, his surrogates and his supporters leaned more heavily on
morality than they had over the last few weeks, and Bush's usually
unchanging stump speech suddenly included new and unfamiliar lines.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these targeted the moral failings of the Clinton
administration more directly than Bush usually does. ``I will
return honor and dignity to the White House,'' Bush told the
students at Bob Jones University, to a round of robust applause
that lasted nearly half a minute. ``The current president pledged
the most ethical administration in American history. As it turned
out, he fell 41 presidents short.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of Clinton's sexual behavior in office is a potent
rallying cry for religious and social conservatives, and Bush
latched onto it by poking fun at the testimony that Clinton gave to
the grand jury investigating his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will return the highest standards of honor to the highest
office in the land,'' Bush said. ``This is my pledge. And it does
not depend on what the meaning of the word `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain too offered fierce criticism of both Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore on Wednesday, but focused instead on the campaign
finance abuses of 1996, particularly Gore's participation in a
fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's call for tax cuts, which was the centerpiece of his New
Hampshire campaign, did not come until near the end of his speech,
and it was not mentioned at all by former Gov. David Beasley of
South Carolina, who introduced Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Beasley vouched that Bush ``deeply loves the Lord'' and
recited a litany of legislation in Texas that proved Bush's
anti-abortion mettle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the size of his loss in New Hampshire, Bush presented a
happy, unworried face to reporters on the plane. And he predicted
that in South Carolina, he would be rewarded for his efforts to
``solidify the base,'' a phrase that he used again in his news
conference here late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world down here,'' Bush said as he put his
arm tightly around his wife, Laura. ``It's a state that embraces
conservative values.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain planned to spend 14 of the next 18 days in the battle for
South Carolina. But his campaign was also ramping up to contest
Arizona and Michigan on Feb. 22 and then to compete in the
coast-to-coast primaries on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said the campaign, which has been run on a comparative
shoestring, planned to hire additional staff quickly for
Washington, Virginia, California and New York and grow to about 90
employees from 65 employees in the next few weeks. Rick Davis, the
campaign manager, said the drive was on to bring in enough money to
end the primary season with $31 million raised or matched. Bush by
contrast had raised $67 million by the end of last year, more than
twice the total budget of the McCain campign.

   An 80-year-old law intended to protect the wives and children of
seamen may come into play in litigation over the crash of Alaska
Airlines Flight 261, limiting monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Two leading aviation lawyers in New York pointed Wednesday to
the Death on the High Seas Act, a law enacted in 1920 to cover
deaths on boats but used in recent airline accidents, including the
1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 in Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a hell of a big difference whether it applies or
not,'' said Lee Kreindler, an attorney involved in airline
litigation for decades. He also is involved in the TWA lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Kreindler and Frank H. Granito Jr., another New York attorney
involved in the TWA crash, said the law excludes all but so-called
``pecuniary'' damages. That's the monetary loss, such as lost
income, to dependents of the people killed.
</P>
<P>
   The law is supposed to protect the families of sailors who
perish at sea. But in modern air crashes, it means widows and
children may not get damages for pain and suffering, or punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Other family members may get nothing at all, or as is more
common, just a small amount from an insurance underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where families are wiped out or where the death involves an
elderly couple who have adult children, the settlement amount would
be nominal,'' Granito said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those instances apply to some of the 88 victims on
Flight 261. The victims also include small children and single
adults _ other people whose deaths could result in little in the
way of monetary awards if the Death on the High Seas Act applies.
</P>
<P>
   The law has been used successfully to deny damages, including
lawsuits stemming from the August 1983 crash of Korean Airlines
Flight 007. A Russian fighter shot the plane down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our families were deprived of damages,'' said Hans
Ephraimson-Abt, chairman of the American Association for Families
of KAL 007 Victims. He lost a daughter on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   TWA and Boeing wanted to invoke the law in the lawsuits over TWA
Flight 800. That crashed occurred eight miles off Long Island. The
Death on the High Seas Act was intended to apply three miles off
the U.S. coast.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal trial court judge ruled in July 1998 that the law
should apply to 12 miles. The judge cited a proclamation by
President Reagan to extend the U.S. territorial limit to 12 miles
off-shore.
</P>
<P>
   That decision has been appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska Airlines crash was 7.8 miles off-shore. Still,
lawsuits filed in Washington and California would be under the
jurisdiction of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in San
Francisco, not the 2nd Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Whitter, an Alaska Airlines spokesman, said he was unaware
of the Death on the High Seas Act. He said he knows of no lawsuits
that have been filed in the Alaska crash.
</P>
<P>
   There are moves in Congress to change the Death on the High Seas
Act, lawyers said. One proposal would prohibit the law from
applying to plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Jim Hammond has been a champion of changes to the
law. The Brier resident, until recently a city of Seattle employee,
lost his parents, Paul and Joan Hammond of Edmonds, in the
September 1998 Swiss Air crash off Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond was stunned to learn that the Death on the High Seas Act
reduces the loss of his parents to their pure earnings potential.
Paul Hammond, 75, and Joan Hammond, 65, were traveling to Geneva
for a rare vacation when their plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   Their son fears that not too long from now, relatives of those
who perished on Flight 261 might face the same agonizing message
about the worth of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money can't replace them, but it's an awful message that every
family member receives: Your parent or child has no value, legally
speaking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits over the Flight 261 tragedy are inevitable. But
advocates for crash victims urged the families not to be in too big
of a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that people should wait at least a
year before contacting an attorney,'' said Gail Dunham, president
of the National Air Disaster Alliance, an air-safety group whose
members include family members of victims from more than 60
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not need to have an attorney right now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few attorneys specialize in air crashes. Family members
could end up hiring an attorney who doesn't specialize in crashes
who may end up referring the case to someone who does, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bring a lawsuit today, the attorney will bring a
far-ranging complaint that might not be germane to the accident at
all,'' said Ephraimson-Abt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said getting advice from a trusted lawyer might be a
good idea. For one thing, it may be days, weeks or even months
before bodies are identified, causing problems with estates as well
as insurance and Social Security benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Families of victims should be careful who they talk to and what
they say, Dunham said. Insurance underwriters have been known to
send out private investigators to dig into the backgrounds of those
who may sue, she said. A statement made in a moment of grief could
be used later at a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Family members also should be careful about signing anything. In
some recent accidents, airlines have offered initial payments to
family members of $20,000 or $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   But family members should be careful not to sign any release
that would protect the airline from future lawsuits, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation, Dunham said, will not be pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the families have to look forward to is hell,'' she said.
``Alaska Airlines is going to be doing everything to limit their
liability. Boeing is very experienced at doing everything to keep
the families out of court.''

 &HT;    Focus on witnesses in stabbings points to Florida
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta police want to question two of NFL star Ray
Lewis' friends in connection with the stabbing deaths of two men
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with the Atlanta Police Department's Criminal
Investigations Division told a reporter Wednesday they are looking
for A.J. Johnson, who had a tryout with the Miami Dolphins, and
Kwame King, who grew up in Lewis' home town.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said King and Johnson were among the people inside
the black stretch limousine that was seen speeding away from the
intersection where Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar were stabbed to
death early Monday, hours after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   No arrest warrants had been drawn up for either King or Johnson
by Wednesday evening, detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Lewis, an All-Pro middle linebacker with the
Baltimore Ravens, has been charged in the killings. Lewis, 24,
maintains his innocence. He is being held without bail on two
murder charges in the Atlanta City Jail. A hearing is scheduled for
Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley would not comment on
Johnson and King, but said, ``There are other persons involved.
Whether suspects or witnesses, we are interested in speaking to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   King, 26, was an education major at Florida A&AMP;M University. He
also taught dance and singing at the school, according to the
Tallahassee Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   King's sister, Ameera Brewer, lives on the same street in
Lakeland, Fla., as Lewis' grandmother. ``He didn't do it,'' Brewer
said of Lewis, before it was known that her brother was wanted for
questioning. ``He's innocent. We're on his side.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 25, spent three weeks in the Miami Dolphins' training
camp in 1997, according to Harvey Greene, the team's vice president
for public relations. Johnson's stepfather, Ronald William Taylor
of Pahokee, Fla., said Wednesday night that he now lives in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Parker, a forensic pathologist with the Fulton County
Medical Examiner's Office, said Wednesday that police had retrieved
knives from the Lincoln Navigator limousine, but had not yet
released the weapons to the medical examiner's office for testing.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said Baker, 21, and Lollar, 24, both of Decatur, Ga.,
were each stabbed three times in the heart and chest. He is trying
to determine if they were stabbed with the same knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're looking at several photographs that show the
stab wounds,'' Parker said Wednesday. ``That will help us to
determine that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker had wounds to both his liver and heart, while Lollar's
wounds were around his heart, Parker said. The two men ``died
rapidly,'' and probably bled to death from their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical pocket knife could do this,'' Parker said. ``Whoever
did this knew exactly where to hit and do the damage _ you could
say they knew something about anatomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Police also are looking at a .45 caliber handgun found early
Wednesday in the front yard of a hairdresser whose shop is two
blocks the corner where the killings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Azar said he was about to walk into his business
Wednesday, when one of his clients called his attention to
something shiny partially buried in the ivy that carpets his front
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big gun in my front yard,'' Azar said as he styled
a client's hair. ``One of my customers spotted it and just said,
'Hey, there's a gun here.' I just said, 'Don't touch it,' and I
called 911.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, officers from the police department's Buckhead
precinct were at Azar's upscale shop. Atlanta homicide
investigators soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   Though Baker and Lollar were stabbed, police have said shots
were fired during the melee. Shell casings were found near the
bodies, but investigators could not confirm Wednesday whether the
casings belong to a .45 caliber gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The detective told me it was likely the gun was used in this
incident,'' Azar said.
</P>
<P>
   Max Richardson, Lewis' attoney, said his client is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the wrong place at the wrong time and had nothing to
do with this,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Fassett, the limousine driver, who is now under police
protection in Maryland where he lives, has said through friends
that Lewis did not stab Baker and Lollar.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia law allows prosecutors to charge people who contributed
to a crime even if they didn't actually carry out the act, whether
it is a murder, a drug sale or a burglary. Wednesday afternoon, the
grandmother of one of the victims received a call from Atlanta
Mayor Bill Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me they'll do all they can,'' Joyce Lollar said. ``I
appreciate that. We still haven't been able to accept it. It's
going to take awhile.''
</P>

   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writers Mark Schlabach, Janet
Frankston, Don Fernandez and Rhonda Cook contributed to this

<P>
   After being trounced in Iowa and surviving a four-point loss in
New Hampshire on Tuesday, Bill Bradley managed to make it to the
next phase of his campaign Wednesday, flying into New York in
preparation for a primary that his advisers say is critical to any
hope he has of being the Democratic candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   And who was there to greet him, but the very face of Democratic
politics in New York, Edward Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Koch endorsed Bradley's rival, Al Gore, during the vice
president's first presidential campaign in 1988, and proceeded to
escort his candidate to a third place defeat that Gore has never
forgotten. But Wednesday, at a rally with New York University
students near Washington Square Park, the former mayor invoked the
``crusade for Robert Kennedy'' of 1968 in urging Democrats to
support Bradley in the primary, as Bradley applauded in approval of
his new supporter.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democratic and Republican candidates for president,
Wednesday marked a new period in the primary campaign, as the
compact stages of Iowa and New Hampshire gave way to a sprawling
contest that will stretch from coast to coast over the next five
weeks. It will culminate on March 7, with a battery of Republican
and Democratic primaries in 16 states including California, Ohio,
Missouri, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York that the candidates
are viewing as so important they virtually constitute a national
primary.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them may prove to be as important, certainly to
Bradley, or as interesting, as the one he began campaigning for
Wednesday, with the slightly odd if revealing image of Koch sharing
the stage with him. The New York primary has become a rite of
passage for Democratic candidates who want to be president.
Although 16 Democratic primaries and caucuses will take place
between now and March 7, if history is any guide, none will test
and torture these candidates as much as New York's.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, New York primaries have taken on legendary proportions
among candidates and consultants, including both those who have
survived them and those who have not, for its peculiarly intense
mix of ethnic politics, warring constituency groups, and a media
market that was round-the-clock and personal well before that
became the standard in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game of politics is played with a sort of speed and
toughness in New York that makes it tougher than anyplace else in
the country,'' said Susan Erich, who was the campaign manager for
Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor who won the 1988
Democratic primary in the state. ``It's fun to watch. It's fun to
talk about. And it's decidedly not fun to be at the center of.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Friedman, a longtime political consultant, said: ``The New
York primary is always an explosion waiting to happen. New York is
a state where you have to be wary of your friends, as well as your
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York experience, as a generation of political
consultants and candidates have come to remember it, will be at
once intensified and diluted this year by the shape of the
political calendar. For the Democrats, there are five weeks until
the New York primary, or nearly five times the time span as between
Iowa and New Hampshire. That allows candidates plenty of time to
get entangled by some New York issue, or stumble into some ethnic
minefield.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fact that New York is one of many states this time
means that Bradley and Gore will, their aides say, most likely be
coming in here a day at a time, avoiding the sort of prolonged
visit that Paul Begala, who advised President Clinton during his
1992 primary battle in the state, likened to ``riding over Niagara
Falls in a barrel.'' Begala said he had always thought it was apt
that this was the state where Clinton, in an interview with Marcia
Kramer on WCBS-TV, made the remark about inhaling that became a
symbol of Clinton's way with words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique political culture,'' Begala said. ``It's
arguably the most vibrant and exciting. You've just got to ride
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are in a slightly different situation.
Nationally, there is a primary in South Carolina on Feb. 15. In
addition, John McCain, the Arizona senator who won the New
Hampshire Republican primary, has been knocked off the ballot in 12
of the state's 31 congressional districts because of challenges by
the state's Republican establishment. McCain is challenging his
disqualifications in court.
</P>
<P>
   Gore got a small preview of what lies ahead early Wednesday
morning as the vice president, after a half-hour of sleep following
his flight from New Hampshire, headed to Grand Central Terminal,
where he shook hands with commuters while a battery of television
cameras marked what was the effective start of his own second
primary campaign in New York. Gore had just finished what had been
a picture-perfect campaign event and was heading back to his
motorcade when a shout pierced the morning stillness.
</P>
<P>
   ``GO BRADLEY!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore paused for a moment as Bradley's name echoed through the
quiet terminal. And than, his smile still fixed and steady, he
continued toward the door.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The basic outlines of the Democratic contest in New York are
fairly clear. Gore, having learned from his loss in 1988, has
collected the support of most of the party's Democratic structure:
Nearly all of the state's major elected Democrats, leaders of key
constituency groups and, perhaps most significant in a primary,
unions. Thus, Gore was accompanied on his walk through Grand
Central Terminal by, among other people, Sheldon Silver, the
speaker of the state Assembly, and Carl McCall, the state
comptroller and likely candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   There is a history of attractive insurgents winning Democratic
primary campaigns, and Bradley is trying to put himself in that
mold. In contrast to the group that accompanied Gore to Grand
Central, Bradley filled his stage Wednesday with a more eclectic
one, including lower-level elected officials, basketball players,
the singer Patti Smith, political operatives and, of course, Koch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the underdog in this campaign, given the fact that the
vice president has tremendous resources in New York,'' said Michael
J. Del Giudice, who is serving as Bradley's New York campaign
chairman. ``He's been vice president and he's been working very
hard at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers sought to rebut this view _ which is, in fact,
widely held among Democrats and political professionals _ by noting
Bradley's geographic advantage. He as a U.S. senator from New
Jersey and played basketball for the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is essentially Bill Bradley's home state,'' said
Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary. ``It's his Madison Square
Garden. This is a state that should be his strongest.''
</P>
<P>
   Against that known backdrop, New York advisers to Gore and
Bradley are trying to prepare for the unknown that has come to
distinguish contests in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Will the candidates be asked, for example, to offer an opinion
on the trial of four police officers in the shooting of Amadou
Diallo? (If history is any indication, they should count on it.)
</P>
<P>
   Will Gore ask the Rev. Jesse Jackson to come to New York and
campaign for him? Some of his supporters are pushing the move as a
way of ensuring a heavy black turn-out; others worry that Jackson
remains a problematic figure among Jewish voters, who remain a
sizable factor in Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has already complained about
Gore's refusal thus far to hold a public meeting with him, seek to
influence the outcome of this contest?
</P>
<P>
   But the most intriguing question might well end up being the
interplay with a statewide contest in New York that has so far
overshadowed the presidential race: The battle between Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Clinton has said she
will formally announce her Senate candidacy on Sunday, and will
then begin a week of campaigning across the state. She has endorsed
Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Bradley share the same senior New York Democrat _
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the retiring senator _ as perhaps their
most prominent supporter. Clinton has so far avoided offering any
critical words about Bradley. But she could find herself under
pressure to do precisely that if Gore feels that he is in danger of
losing New York.

CIA ADMITS SLOW MOVE IN SECURITY SLIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the CIA, George J. Tenet, acknowledged
Wednesday that the agency had been too slow in notifying the
Justice Department and Congress about evidence that his
predecessor, John M. Deutch, had improperly placed large amounts of
classified material on unclassified computers in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no excuse for that,'' Tenet said at a hearing before
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Notification of both
the Justice Department and the Congressional Oversight Committees
``should have been done promptly, certainly by the spring of
1997,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet's comments came a day after he had issued a statement
defending his actions in the Deutch matter. But at the Senate
hearing, he came under sharp questioning from lawmakers about the
Deutch case. The committee chairman, Sen. Richard C. Shelby,
R-Ala., said the Deutch case was one of ``grave concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have a keen interest in the performance of
senior officials charged with upholding our laws and policies with
respect to the protection of classified information, '' Shelby
said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was prompted by an article in The New York Times on
Tuesday concerning a classified report from the CIA's inspector
general that was critical of the way the agency's internal
investigation into the Deutch case had been handled.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the actions of some senior agency officials
had the effect of delaying a ``prompt and thorough'' investigation
by CIA security officials. It also says they failed to inform the
Justice Department that Deutch may have broken the law until 1998,
more than a year after the discovery of classified material on
Deutch's computers in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That delay had the effect of avoiding ``the potential
application of the independent counsel statute,'' according to the
inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   The report remains classified, but its contents have been
described to The New York Times by several intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites the agency's former executive director, Nora
Slatkin, and its former general counsel, Michael O'Neill, as saying
the actions ``had the effect of delaying a prompt and thorough
investigation of this matter.'' It also cites Tenet as saying he
``should have involved himself more forcefully to ensure a proper
resolution of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutch served as the agency's director from May 1995 until he
resigned in December 1996. After security officials discovered
classified material on Deutch's computers as he was leaving the
agency in December 1996, an internal investigation was begun. But
within weeks of the discovery, CIA security officers came to
believe that senior agency officials seeking to protect Deutch were
blocking their efforts to conduct a thorough inquiry, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Deutch refused to be questioned by security
officials, and the senior officials allowed him not to be
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill kept four computer cards containing files from Deutch's
computers in his safe for about three weeks, rebuffing efforts from
the security staff to gain access to the material, the report adds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the security staff ultimately wrote a report on the
Deutch matter in the summer of 1997, the report was shelved and a
security official later complained that it had been an
investigation ``in name only.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutch has expressed regret for his action.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Wednesday, Tenet also said that the CIA could not
exclude the possibility that other countries had gained access to
the classified material on Deutch's computers. Although there is no
evidence that the classified documents had been taken by anyone,
``I can't give you a statement that it absolutely didn't happen,''
Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch was accessing the Internet via unsecure services with the
same computers on which he had classified material, according to
the inspector general report. Others in Deutch's home also had
access to the computers, which had been issued by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that someone using the computers accessed what
it describes as ``high-risk'' Web sites. It also says that e-mail
from a former Russian scientist was found on one of Deutch's
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The report describes the vulnerabilities faced by information
placed on computers that are connected to the Internet. It also
describes how Deutch was aware of such risks and of how American
intelligence can gather material remotely out of computers tied to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet noted Wednesday that Deutch ``was sloppy in what he did.''
But he added that Deutch ``worked around the clock,'' whih he said
helped explain why he had so much classified material on his home
computers.
</P>
<P>
   While the material was highly sensitive, most were documents
written by Deutch himself, Tenet added.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, aftdr receiving the inspector general's report on
the Deutch case, Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearances
indefinitely. Tenet also created a special panel inside the CIA to
review how the case was handled by agency officials.
</P>
<P>
   That panel completed its report on Tuesday, and its findings
will soon be presented to Tenet, he said.

 &HT;    Reconstructing Lewis' stay in Atlanta

<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Tuesday last week, football superstar Ray Lewis was
living large and party-bound. Whisked away from his suburban
Baltimore home in a black limousine, he was taking off into a dream
trip _ seeing the Super Bowl in Atlanta and then playing in the
NFL's All-Star game in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But by Monday morning, one of the highest-paid linebackers in
football was standing in shackles and a red prison uniform before
an Atlanta judge with two counts of murder hanging over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had run the gamut from the high life of a big-name
athlete, attending autograph signings and celebrity-stocked
parties, to the low life of an accused killer.
</P>
<P>
   The trip began in plush luxury. The 24-year-old stepped from his
Owings Mill home into a custom-built limousine designed to be the
height of road-trip extravagance. Inside the 40-foot-long Lincoln
220 Navigator, he was surrounded by four televisions, a VCR, a CD
player, a champagne sink with two ice units, and a mirrored
ceiling. Limo driver Duane Fassett drove to Charlotte, N.C., where
they stayed overnight. They picked up some friends and headed to
Atlanta, said limo owner Tony Toscov.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lewis attended a fund-raising party hosted by
Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal Anderson at Cobalt Lounge, a
trendy hot spot in Buckhead known for its star-studded clientele.
</P>
<P>
   A host of elites were there. Inside the club's bright blue and
purple facade were such luminaries as Michael Jordan, Wayne
Gretzky, Leonardo DiCaprio and John Elway. It was so crowded,
Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was turned away at
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson recalled of Lewis, ``From talking to him, he was very
focused on what he was going to do after football. He was using it
as a stepping-stone.'' The 6-foot-1, 245-pound Lewis couldn't
decide whether he would be an actor or a businessman. Anderson said
his party came off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Lewis checked into the historic Georgian Terrace
hotel in Atlanta. Limousines lined the street, and Muhammad Ali and
Deion Sanders could be seen getting into a couple of them. Atlanta
was buzzing with Super Bowl fever.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was a good tipper, said one bellhop who helped him with
his bags. He could afford to be. He had become one of the NFL's
highest-paid linebackers in 1998 when he signed a four-year, $26
million contract with the Baltimore Ravens. The contract included a
$7 million signing bonus. In his four-year career, he had played in
two Pro Bowls _ the All-Star game of football _ and was headed in a
few days to his third.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities were not the only ones caught up in the Super Bowl
buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away in Decatur, two young men who later would be
stabbed to death were looking forward to the big game ahead.
Richard Lollar and Jacinth ``Shorty'' Baker had been friends since
childhood. They moved to Atlanta together from Akron, Ohio, a few
years ago looking for new opportunities. Lollar, 24, cut hair for a
living, and Baker, who wanted to be an automotive designer, was a
frequent customer at the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lollar was working long 12-hour shifts, as he often
did. Business was booming thanks to the Super Bowl, according to
John ``Silk'' Wilkerson, who co-owns the Decatur Barber and Braid
Shop.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson had spoken to Lollar about possibly watching the game
together, but that didn't work out. As he often did these days,
Lollar was upbeat because his fiancee, Kellye Smith, was expecting
the couple's first child. Late in the week, Baker, 21, stopped in
for his regular weekly haircut, and they all talked about the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the fates of the pro football player and the two
young men would collide.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Lewis was signing autographs at a Sports Authority.
He was slated to start signing at 5 p.m. He arrived at 7 p.m. and
stayed for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the big day. After one of the most exciting Super
Bowls in history, Lewis slipped into Cobalt Lounge with an
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens football team had reportedly become concerned about
Lewis hanging with a tough crowd, and they were going to discuss
the matter with him after the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis left the club and the $100-a-head party about 3:30 a.m.
About 400 people were coming out, and barricades had to be removed
so the huge Navigator limousine could pull up to the curb. Lewis'
entourage came out without him; one member went back inside to get
him.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 4 a.m., Atlanta homicide detective Ken Allen received
a call that there were two men down at the corner of East Paces
Ferry Road and Grandview Avenue, about a half block from Cobalt.
Grady Hospital EMTs were transporting one victim to the hospital,
and the other had been declared dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   When Allen arrived, he saw that Baker was already covered with a
sheet. Witnesses told police they saw a black limo fleeing from the
scene. Police say an argument that started in the Cobalt was
carried on outside. Both Baker and Lollar were repeatedly stabbed.
Lollar died soon in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As barkeepers were mopping up floors, police began checking into
reports that Lewis was inside the black limousine that sped away
from the scene as bullets flew. An hour after the killings, police
found the limousine parked behind a Holiday Inn. The chauffeur was
changing a tire that had been flattened by a bullet. Someone told
police that a man with bloodstained clothing had gotten out of the
limousine and entered a hotel lobby bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lewis was scheduled to fly to Hawaii to participate
in the Pro Bowl. It was to be the culmination of a season that had
many people calling him the best linebacker in the game. Instead,
he was arrested. He telephoned police Monday afternoon upon
learning a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He was staying
at the home of a friend just outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, he was charged with murder in connection with the
double slaying.
</P>
<P>
   At about 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, Lewis, hands cuffed in front of him,
stood silently before Judge Elaine L. Carlisle. She set no bond for
the player, whose next court date is Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Atlanta detectives said they were gathering
information for murder warrants on at least two more men who were
with Lewis in the limousine. Late Tuesday, the owner of the
Baltimore limousine company, Toscov, was driving the vehicle back
to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has maintained his innocence, and many of his friends and
neighbors have backed him. Fassett, the limo driver, told Toscov
that Lewis did not kill the men.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the black luxury limousine was sitting in a garage
just outside of Baltimore, wrapped in blue plastic. Police
announced that they found knives inside the limousine and a block
and a half from Cobalt. Also Wednesday, police were looking to
question two people they believe were in the limousine: A.J.
Johnson and Kwame King.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar's funeral will be 10 a.m. Saturday; Baker's will be at 1
p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Jermaine Baker, a brother of one of the victims, has
written a letter to Lewis. Lewis had been one of his favorite
football players, he says, but that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all this is true and Ray Lewis was involved in the murder
of my brother,'' he should never be allowed to return to the NFL,
says the 17-year-old Akron youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killing my brother murdered part of my strength and soul,'' he
wrote. He adds that he wants to see his brother's killer face to
face, to ask him why.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could he have angered you so much,'' he wrote, ``to take
his life away from me and my family.''

WAGONER TO TAKE GENERAL MOTORS HELM FROM SMITH

appointment and reaction to it; adds more about Pearce's health;

 By ROBYN MEREDITH   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive of
General Motors, announced Wednesday that he would hand his chief
executive title and day-to-day responsibility for running the
company, the world's largest automaker, to G. Richard Wagoner Jr.,
46, the president and chief operating officer, starting in June.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 61, will serve as the executive chairman. Harry J.
Pearce, 57, who is recovering from leukemia, will stay on as GM's
vice chairman and may later be tapped to replace Smith as chairman,
people close to the board's deliberations said.
</P>
<P>
   While the titles change, the same triumvirate will lead General
Motors. Wagoner will run the day-to-day business. Smith will spend
more time working on the company's alliances with companies like
Fuji and Toyota and with repairing GM's frosty relations with car
dealers. Pearce, who will report to Smith, will continue to oversee
GM's nonauto businesses plus its efforts on safety, the environment
and public policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three of us make a great team,'' Smith said. ``We've
worked together since 1992 and share a common vision for General
Motors.'' Indeed, Smith has presided over kaleidoscopic change at
General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was installed in a board coup in November 1992, when the
company teetered near bankruptcy. It lost $2 billion in 1990, $4.5
billion in 1991 and $23.5 billion - more than $20 billion from an
accounting change _ the year Smith was handed the reins.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, working closely with Pearce and Wagoner, turned the red
ink to black. Last year, with the economy and auto sales booming,
GM earned a record $6 billion. GM has also improved nearly all
aspects of its business, other auto executives and industry experts
acknowledge. But many question whether GM has done enough to keep
up with competitors. GM's market share in the United States dipped
to 29.5 percent last year, down from 34.3 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Stempel, the chairman and chief executive whom GM's
board ousted in 1992, acknowledged that GM has been partly turned
around on Smith's watch. ``It is obvious they've got their
financial house in order,'' he said in an inte2view in January,
adding, ``To be a good, successful corporation you also have to
have that market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street praised the management changes, and said that the
drop in GM's stock price Wednesday _ it was down $3.875, to $81.375
_ was driven by investors who took profits after GM announced
Tuesday that it would distribute about half the value of its Hughes
Electronics stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good to have younger people moving into positions of
importance at organizations like that,'' said Wendy Beale Needham,
an auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry veterans echoed that sentiment. ``In an
organization as traditional and hidebound as General Motors, having
a person who doesn't know all the reasons that things can't be
done'' can be a benefit, said Robert A. Lutz, former president and
vice chairman of Chrysler and now the chief executive of the Exide
Corp., the battery maker.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce has enormous credibility on Wall Street and within the
auto industry, and praised the board's move Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I been an outside director I would've selected Rick
Wagoner as CEO of this company,'' Pearce said. ``His track record
speaks for itself _ it is extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner has been a star at GM for more than a decade. Just like
many past chief executives, he began his career in GM's powerful
treasurer's office in New York. He later became treasurer of GM's
Brazil operations, then was moved to the finance jobs in Canada and
Europe. He was then sent back to lead the Brazil operations, which
he turned around. When Smith was named chief executive, he tapped
Wagoner as chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick will have responsibility for the strategic, operational
leadership of General Motors,'' Smith said. ``He is in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wagoner could end up reporting to Pearce some day. Pearce
said Wednesday that his health was not a concern, noting that his
bone marrow transplant was 17 months ago. ``The possibility of a
relapse is very remote,'' said Pearce, who noted that while ``I may
not look quite right to you yet,'' he will be weaned from drugs
suppressing his immune system by midsummer, when Wagoner is
scheduled to take over. Those drugs cause swelling and redness in
his face.
</P>
<P>
   James L.M. Ferrara, director of the Bone Marrow Transplant
program at the University of Michigan, said that generally
speaking, ``the majority of relapses occur within 12 to 18 months
after transplants,'' and that someone like Pearce is in the
recovery phase, but ``is not home free.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes announced Wednesday are not the only shifts in store
at the top of GM. John G. Smale, GM's lead director and leader of
the 1992 board coup, announced in November that he would retire
from GM's board in May. Wagoner said Wednesday that he had no plans
to change course for GM.

   ALBANY, New York _ Acknowledging that Amadou Diallo was a victim
who did not deserve to die, a lawyer for one of the four police
officers on trial for firing 41 shots at him told the jury in
opening statements Wednesday that Diallo's own actions led to his
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that his parents miss him and have suffered
greatly,'' said Bennett M. Epstein, who represents Sean Carroll.
``I'm sure that to them, he was a saint. But he was a saint who
felt compelled, for reasons best known to him _ and we're going to
try to get into those reasons _ to avoid the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was acting suspiciously in the early hours of Feb. 4,
1999, the lawyer said, alternately peering out from the stoop of
his Bronx apartment building and retreating toward the door.
Approached by the plainclothes officers, Diallo turned and entered
the building, he said, and did not keep his hands in view.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had stopped, the whole thing would have ended
peacefully,'' Epstein said. Instead, he said, Diallo led the
officers ``into the no man's land that is every police officer's
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case about five good men,'' Epstein said, ``and one
of them is Amadou Diallo.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein's argument and those of the lawyers for the other
officers underscored the delicacy of the task they face in
justifying the officers' conduct while not going too far in trying
to vilify Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   An immigrant from West Africa, Diallo worked as a street peddler
in Lower Manhattan and was said to be an observant Muslim who had
never been in trouble with the law. He was unarmed the night of his
death, when he was hit by 19 of the 41 shots. The lawyers said the
officers thought he was reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief prosecutor, Eric Warner, said there was no
justification for the shooting. ``A human being should be able to
stand in the vestibule of his own home and not be shot to death,''
Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Diallo, 22, not a physically imposing man, worked 10 to
12 hours a day peddling videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of his life, Diallo took the subway home to the
Bronx about midnight and discussed a utility bill with one of his
roommates. ``Less than an hour later, he would be standing in the
cold clear night air in the vestibule of his home,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the four officers got out of their unmarked car, he said,
and, without giving any commands like ``Stop! Police! Don't move!''
fired at Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bullets hit Diallo as he was falling or ``actually
on the ground,'' Warner said. Carroll and Edward McMellon each
fired 16 shots, Kenneth Boss fired five times and Richard Murphy
fired four times, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the conscious decision to shoot at a man standing in
the confined space of the vestibule,'' Warner said. ``These four
defendants intended to kill him. They acted recklessly with a
depraved indifference to Amadou Diallo's life and the lives of the
people in the building.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense version differs on at least one major point. The
lawyers said the officers identified themselves, showed their
badges and gave Diallo an opportunity to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Diallo doesn't listen to clear orders to stop,'' Epstein
said. Instead, he said, Diallo turned and ran for an inner door,
reached into his pocket and raised his hand holding a black object.
A wallet and a beeper were found near the body.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was moved to Albany after defense lawyers requested a
change of venue, asserting prejudicial pretrial publicity and that
in the Bronx, the potential jurors would be people with ``an
inherent distrust or even hatred of the police.'' The officers are
charged with second-degree murder and reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   James Culleton, who represents Murphy, said the officers thought
Diallo was acting suspiciously when they happened to drive past his
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why he was acting that way I have no idea,'' Culleton said.
``A civilian witness will testify that he was acting suspicious,
peeking in and out of that vestibule.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brounstein, who represents Boss, said Diallo ``broke no
laws, he did nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy, not a crime,'' Brounstein added.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Worth, who represents McMellon, said the officers did
the only thing they could, based on their years of experience in
crime-ridden areas of New York. Even so, he said, ``There is no
doubt that Amadou Diallo did not deserve to die.''
</P>
<P>
   As the prosecution began presenting its case, the first witness
at the trial was Detective Joseph Flannino of the Police
Department's Crime Scene Unit. He said he arrived at the scene at
1:45 a.m, about an hour after the shooting. The lighting on the
street that night was adequate, he said, with two street lights
near Diallo's building. He said that from the curb, he had no
difficulty seeing Diallo's body lying in the vestibule of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   But on cross-examination by defense lawyers, Flannino conceded
that it would have been better if he had arrived at the scene
earlier so he could have helped to protect the crime scene, where
there were dozens of shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to discredit some of the evidence, defense lawyers also
focused on two bullets that were recovered 11 days after the
shooting when Flannino returned to the crime scene. One bullet, he
said, hit the wall above the door to Diallo's apartment and lodged
in a closet. Lawyers were particularly interested in that the hole
above the door was bigger when he returned on Feb. 15 and retrieved
the bullet.

LEADERS TRY TO PRESERVE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES ``guerrilla'' to ``paramilitary'' in lede) 
 (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British and Irish leaders and Ulster politicians worked
feverishly in three capitals Wednesday in a desperate effort to
save the new Northern Ireland government from being shut down by a
dispute over paramilitary disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt at all there is a serious problem,'' Prime
Minister Tony Blair told Parliament in London, ``and unless there
is substantial progress, then we have a serious difficulty and a
serious crisis on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast, the leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionists,
David Trimble, said he expected to be out of his job as first
minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly shortly. He expects the
imminent suspension of the eight-week-old legislature by Britain
and the reimposition of direct rule from London.
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin, the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, held talks
with Gerry Adams, president of the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, who forecast ``a disaster'' if the fledging
power-sharing administration was mothballed for even a brief
period.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, who is
expected to announce what Britain will do in an address to the
House of Commons on Thursday, spent Wednesday in meetings with the
heads of the Protestant and Catholic political parties that
produced the peace agreement of April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is thought to be leaning toward suspension as the best
way to save the new political institutions in Belfast from total
collapse and keep them in a state that would permit their revival
this spring. In the meantime, a formal review would begin to see if
the weapons dispute that has continually menaced the peace accord
can be settled.
</P>
<P>
   What has given rise to the new crisis is a confidential report
by Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, head of a weapons monitoring
panel, that offered no evidence that the Irish Republican Army has
made any move to start disarming. The report, delivered to the
British and Irish governments just before a midnight deadline
Monday, remains unpublished, but Blair confirmed in Parliament that
it reports no yielding of paramilitary arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be decommissioning,'' Blair said, using the term
for disarmament in the peace accord. ``There has not been
decommissioning. Under the agreement, it is quite clear that
decommissioning is supposed to be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement put him at odds with the political wing of the
IRA, Sinn Fein, which argues that the only commitment it made was
to try to bring about disarmament by the May 2000 date in the
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble argues that Adams left it clear during the review
conducted by George Mitchell, the former senator, last fall that
there would be movement on arms by now if he agreed to take his
Ulster Unionist Party into the assembly alongside Sinn Fein.
Trimble took that step in November, permitting the power-sharing
home rule government to start up in early December.

MCCAIN'S SUCCESS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BRINGS AN OVERNIGHT INFUSION OF
CYBERCASH
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moving quickly to capitalize on his startlingly
lopsided defeat of Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire, Sen. John
McCain raised more than $500,000 over the Internet in less than 24
hours after the polls there closed, the McCain organization said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign, which raised less than $14 million all of
last year, followed up on the New Hampshire triumph by immediately
opening a fund-raising blitz by telephone, e-mail and
overnight-delivery letter. The goal of that nationwide drive was to
raise $5 million that the senator will need to compete against the
well-financed, richly endorsed and painstakingly organized Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, McCain aides also scheduled a flurry of
fund-raising events over the next several weeks from California to
New York. They are preparing to produce the first online
fund-raiser, a live interactive event on the Internet, with a $100
admission charge, on Feb. 10: McCain will appear at a dinner in
Washington that will be beamed to South Carolina, Michigan, Arizona
and California.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, the McCain campaign's communications director, said
the candidate had developed a simple spending plan for dealing with
the compressed primary schedule this year: spend everything he had
in order to compete in New Hampshire's primary this week and South
Carolina's on Feb. 19, and then rob a bank.
</P>
<P>
   But after his thrashing of Bush in New Hampshire, it appears the
bank is coming to him, affirming one of the oldest rules in
politics: money chases success. The question for McCain now is
whether the money materializes in sums large enough to keep his
campaign on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next five weeks will be the ultimate test of message and
momentum vs. organization and endorsements,'' Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides hope a rush of donations will make it possible
for him to mount a credible challenge to Bush in the rapid-fire
succession of Republican primaries over the next several weeks, in
what now appears to be a two-man race. He will need every penny he
can raise to compete in the 30 primaries between now and the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very confident we would do well in New Hampshire, and
have tried to put ourselves in position to take advantage of
that,'' said Carla Eudy, the McCain campaign's finance director.
``We know we can't match George Bush dollar for dollar. Obviously
not. But we don't need to, and New Hampshire is a prime example.''
</P>
<P>
   Other insurgent presidential candidates who have won New
Hampshire, like Pat Buchanan, who triumphed in the Republican
primary in 1996, and Paul Tsongas, who took the Democratic primary
in 1992, were not able to convert their victories into cash
windfalls rapidly enough to remain competitive in later contests.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of those campaigns illustrates that time is of the
essence for the McCain finance team. Eudy said the organization
mailed 40,000 overnight packets soliciting donations on Tuesday
night and in addition was preparing 200,000 fund-raising letters.
The campaign also sent 100,000 e-mail messages Wednesday morning to
past donors and to those who had contacted the candidate's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   But victory over Bush will take more than a quick infusion of
cash from donors who suddenly smell a winner and are willing to
click a mouse button and give their MasterCard number over the
Internet. The McCain campaign must quickly assemble a ground
operation in Michigan, Virginia and Washington, three of the states
that hold primaries before the end of the month, and in the big
states that follow in early March, including New York, California,
Florida, Ohio, Georgia and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   McCain confronts the Bush juggernaut, which opened offices and
hired staff in most of those states months ago. Bush raised nearly
$69 million last year and spent more than $37 million on
advertising and infrastructure; he began the year with more than
$31 million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   McCain raised $13.6 million in 1999 and spent virtually all of
it, beginning the year with only $1.5 million. But he qualified for
more than $6 million in federal matching funds on Jan. 1, which
kept his campaign afloat. (Bush is not accepting federal dollars
and does not have to comply with the spending limits that accompany
them.)
</P>
<P>
   The next test is little more than two weeks away, in South
Carolina, where McCain has been building a network of retired
military officers as the backbone of his operation but still trails
Bush in some polls by 20 points. South Carolina is a bigger state
than New Hampshire, and less idiosyncratic, and may not respond as
favorably to McCain's straight talk and town meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three days after South Carolina comes Michigan, where
McCain has virtually no field operation and where advertising in
the state's four major media markets could easily consume $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Republican power structure, from Gov. John Engler
down, enlisted early in the Bush camp, leaving McCain to scrounge
for volunteers, veterans and independent voters. Bush leads in all
major polls in Michigan and, Bush aides say, can count on Engler's
statewide operation to turn out the vote on primary day.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has done a good job of living off the land up until
now,'' said Robert M. Teeter, a Republican pollster based in
Michigan who supports Bush. ``But he will not win Michigan. This is
a good state for Bush. Remember, Bush's father beat Ronald Reagan
in the primary here in 1980.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressures for more money only grow from there, with the need
for advertisements in hugely expensive television markets in
California and New York.

 &HT;    Late flurry boosts national champs
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As players began making oral
commitments, Florida State's recruiting class surprisingly was not
among the top 10 or even the top 20 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   That changed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles landed two Parade All-Americas in Pahokee
linebacker Eric Moore and defensive lineman Travis Johnson of
Sherman Oaks, Calif., pushing the Seminoles into the top 10. The
two were among one of the largest classes (23) in school history,
which could grow in the next day or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're recruiting, you hope to get your share and we've
definitely done that,'' coach Bobby Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles class, ranked 21st a week ago by one service,
moved up to 16th early Wednesday and was No. 7 by the end of the
day, with the possibility of moving up in the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State is waiting on two blue-chip players, linebacker
D.J. Williams of Concord, Calif., and defensive lineman Justin
Hinds of Piscataway, N.J. Both are rated among the best players in
the nation and both also are considering Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Williams orally committed to the Hurricanes, but changed his
mind and now has FSU, Miami and California on his list. Hinds did
the same with Boston College and now says it's between FSU, Miami
and BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of this class is very comparable to other
classes,'' Bowden said. ``We were willing to sign 25 and it ain't
over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The class, though, had just nine players from Florida _
including Moore and offensive lineman David Castillo of Palm Beach
Gardens. The Seminoles did not sign a player from Miami, the area
that was recruited by assistant head coach Chuck Amato, who left in
early January to become the head coach at North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you recruit here, you get competition from Miami and
Florida,'' Bowden said. ``When we go outside the state, it was us
and somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State landed five players from Texas and three each from
Georgia and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found today one of the biggest barriers is people telling
the kids, 'You can't play at Florida State, they have too many good
players,' '' Bowden said. ``A lot of times that happens after a
national championship. We had the same problem in '94.'' Moore was
a huge catch, waiting until the last day to chose Florida State
over Tennessee. He is the best of a very good crop of linebackers
headed to Tallahassee. Yohance Buchanan of Atlanta and Bryant
McFadden of Hollywood are two of the top four defensive backs in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State missed out on four players Wednesday high on its
list: safety O.J. Owens (Tennessee) from New London, N.C.; tailback
Shyrone Carey (Tennessee) from Marrero, La.; running back Marcus
Houston (Colorado) of Denver; and defensive lineman Marcus White
(Auburn) of Theodore, Ala., the player Bowden visited the morning
after winning the national title.

A VOTE FOR MCCAIN IS A VOTE FOR ME

 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - The good people of New Hampshire reaffirmed what I
and every other thoughtful journalist who has gotten to know Sen.
John Mc Cain has said for a long time:
</P>
<P>
   The man should be president.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, McCain was able to articulate for the voters of one
quirky and obstinate state why a politician from an equally quirky
and obstinate state is just quirky and obstinate enough to lead the
Free World.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pointed to his lengthy service in the U.S. Senate (as
well as his lengthy confinement as prisoner of war in Vietnam).
</P>
<P>
   He articulated his unyielding commitment to campaign fi nance
reform (a stubbornness forged during his POW days).
</P>
<P>
   He reinforced his determina tion to rebuild America's mili tary
strength (which he should know about because he happens to have
been a POW), and laid out his plans to lower taxes (for everyone,
including former POWs), to rescue Social Secu rity and Medicare
(now that our veterans, including one-time POWs, are getting
older), and to pay down the national debt (while reminding us of
the debt of gratitude we owe people, in cluding former POWs).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, McCain said he hopes to restore our faith in the presi
dency, which he believes the American people could best ac complish
by electing a man who has served his country honor ably in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Like, for instance, a one-time prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   Whomever that may be.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, voters in the other 49 states will fall for the
same baloney and McCain will become president.
</P>
<P>
   I say this not because (as a long-time Arizona journalist) I
know McCain, but because (as a long-time Arizona politician) McCain
knows me.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, he considers me an annoying pipsqueak.
</P>
<P>
   I picture a scene years from now in which my yet-unborn
grandchildren are slumped in the chairs of a high school his tory
class, counting the minutes to the recess bell, when, off in the
distance, they hear the teacher say, ``President John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   And they perk up, raise their hands and say, ``Hey, that's the
dude who hated Grandpa.''
</P>
<P>
   Would that be cool or what?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be deceived, however. This is not simply the selfish
yearning of some small-time egotistical hack working for a rag in
the middle of the North American Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it is.
</P>
<P>
   But you shouldn't hold that against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   If the people of Arizona don't mind a U.S. senator conducting
114 town meetings in a state he doesn't represent, while spend ing
weeks and months away from the job he was elected to perform, why
should you?
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, we're getting along fine in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are the people of Texas, who no longer have a governor.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Americans spend an awful lot of time and money
trying to determine who would be the best person to run the
country, only to find out no such person is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It's the perfect system, man aging to roll along on its own
while keeping politicians and guys like me off the street.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past two decades, we've had eight years of Clinton
and eight years of Reagan, and under each of these ideological
opposites, Americans over whelmingly claimed they're lives got
better.
</P>
<P>
   The same would hold true no matter whom we elected.
</P>
<P>
   But this may be the only chance I get to have a guy in the White
House who has per sonally called my boss trying to get me fired.
So, I beseech you:
</P>
<P>
   Think of the country. Think of the future. Think of my
grandkids. &QL;

 &HT;    Gators rack up recruits
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Steve Spurrier found a way to soften the
sting of the worst finish by a Florida Gators' football team during
his 10-year stay.
</P>
<P>
   Have his best recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Wednesday's final developments on national signing
day, the Gators were assured of having one of the nation's best
recruiting hauls. Then it just got better when the Gators
unexpectedly landed six more top prospects: receiver Kelvin Kight,
offensive linemen Jonathan Colon and Max Starks, defensive linemen
Kevin Deaton and Thomas Pittman and cornerback Tre Orr.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators finished with 30 signees, including five Parade
All-Americans, which should go a long way toward easing the
frustration of the season-ending three-game losing streak and a 9-4
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could potentially be the best group we've signed,''
Spurrier said. ``We did get almost all of the guys we went after
this year. A few weeks ago, I didn't think we were recruiting
(well) enough to get 21. But it seemed like they all wanted to come
play for the Gators this year
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe sometimes losing your last few games helps recruiting.
Maybe some of those guys say, ``I want to play for those guys
because they need help.'' ``
</P>
<P>
   The Gators started recruiting well when they landed star
quarterback Brock Berlin, whose early commitment Spurrier said
helped entice other top players to choose UF. The Gators then
closed recruiting with a bang, getting all those last-minute
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we felt if we got one of those guys, it would be a
very successful recruiting class,'' Spurrier said. ``Lo and behold,
we got them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting of Pittman exemplifies the Gators' strong
recruiting effort. Pittman originally signed with Auburn in 1997,
but didn't enroll after he was a high draft pick by the Montreal
Expos. Spurrier said assistant coach Buddy Teevens learned that
Pittman wanted to give college football a try, so the Gators
quietly lured him to sign with Florida. Pittman, who is considered
a walk-on, will play professional baseball this summer before
enrolling at UF in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators got the most help in two key areas: offensive line
(six signees) and wide receiver (five). This was much-needed after
Florida lost four starters on the offensive line and star receivers
Travis Taylor and Darrell Jackson both opted to leave early for the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier said the receiving class of Kight, Reggie Vickers of
Glades Central, Carlos Perez, Matt Jackson and O.J. Small has the
potential to be as good as the set of wideouts in the 1994
recruiting class. That included Ike Hilliard, Reidel Anthony,
Jacquez Green and Travis McGriff _ all top NFL draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying they're going to be that good, but they're
going to have a chance to play right away,'' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier has always downplayed what happens in recruiting, so he
said he wouldn't ``overplay'' what happened Wednesday. But it was
enough to make Gator fans _ and one of the recruits _ a little
giddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to see how many guys we ended up getting, it's amazing,''
Berlin said. ``It was hard to believe at first, but this has ended
up being a great class. I can't wait to play with these guys.''

COLOMBIA REBEL LEADERS ON TOUR OF SCANDINAVIA 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Marxist guerrilla leaders have temporarily
abandoned their jungle hideout for a guided tour of Norway and
Sweden designed to showcase the virtues of democracy, Colombian
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise move, authorities whisked top commanders of
Colombia's largest rebel organization through Bogota's
international airport Tuesday night and put them on a plane to
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The six delegates of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, were met in Madrid by Colombian officials. The delegation
was scheduled to fly on to Oslo and Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   The tour comes as year-old negotiations between the government
and FARC to end Colombia's long-running civil war turns to economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day trip will give FARC leaders a first-hand look at how
Scandinavian nations manage capitalist economies while giving their
people a wide array of social benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will learn about the social security and infrastructure
of these countries,'' Colombian Interior Minister Nestor Humberto
Martinez said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although FARC leaders have visited Europe before, this is the
first time the Colombian government has promoted such a trip.
European governments and businesses are paying for the visit,
according to Colombian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The South American nation's vast gap between rich and poor is
the main reason that the FARC took up arms in 1964 with demands for
a Marxist state. Government officials are anxious to show the
rebels that well-run democracies can provide prosperity and social
justice.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Foreign Minister Guillermo
Fernandez de Soto said Norway and Sweden have ``a very high
component of socialism in the best sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Scandinavia, observers say, may also have a
psychological impact on the rebels, who have spent most of their
time in remote mountains and jungles, by exposing them to the
modern world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can only be helpful in terms of expanding the horizons of
a very insular and politically isolated guerrilla group,'' said
Cynthia Arnson, of the Woodrow Wilson Latin American Study Center
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Arnson noted, Marxist guerrillas in El
Salvador and Guatemala traveled abroad and became convinced that
international support for their armed struggles was waning. Rebel
movements in both countries signed peace treaties in the 1990s. The
Norwegian government was a key broker in those negotiations. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Jan Egeland, Norway's former deputy foreign minister, was named
as the U.N. secretary-general's special adviser to Colombia in
December and may take part in government-rebel talks in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that international exposure will put more
pressure on the FARC to agree to a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the real world, you see new formulas and paths,''
said Carlos Franco, a former Colombian guerrilla. ``The experience
of the social democratic parties in Europe could help the FARC find
ways to transform its military power into political power.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be other motives for the trip. Even as they talk
peace, both the guerrillas and the Colombian government are
preparing for the possibility of a more intense phase in the war.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Clinton administration has proposed sending
$1.6 billion in military aid to Colombia over the next two years.
The aid package, which must be approved by the U.S. Congress, is
officially designated to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   But the FARC, which has 17,000 fighters, is heavily involved in
the narcotics trade and has been blacklisted by the State
Department as a ``terrorist'' group. Much of the aid would be used
to attack the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Watson, associate dean of the National War College in
Washington, said the FARC will try to drum up opposition to U.S.
military aid among European governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a morale booster,'' she said of the FARC leaders' tour. &UR;

PARTY OFFICIALS MAY ABANDON MCCAIN BALLOT FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (With SC-MCCAIN-BUSH, NH-MCAIN, NH-BUSH)

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Worrying that the state Republican Party's
attempts to knock Sen. John McCain off the presidential primary
ballot have backfired, Republican and Bush campaign officials said
Wednesday that they might abandon their court fight with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Arizona senator routed Gov. George W. Bush in
the New Hampshire primary, Bush campaign officials spoke with New
York Republicans who have fought tenaciously so far to block McCain
from appearing on the ballot statewide in New York's primary on
March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and New York officials now say that if U.S. District Court
Judge Edward R. Korman, who is hearing McCain's lawsuit to get on
the ballot statewide, rules in his favor, they might not appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Korman has made clear his distaste for the system, saying last
week: ``What is going on here is an effort to turn this on its head
and hold a meaningless primary.'' His decision is expected this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot battle in New York has played more broadly to
McCain's advantage, some of these officials conceded, by helping
him portray himself as the insurgent or the campaign finance
reformer fighting an establishment much like the state party
machinery that is contesting his nominating petitions in nearly
half of New York's 31 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   While surveys of New York Republicans in December and January
showed McCain a distant second to Bush, who has the backing of the
party machinery and nearly all of the state's prominent
Republicans, including Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York City, many political analysts expect the
senator to gain ground here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy says, `The powers that be fear me,''' said a
prominent Republican office-holder who supports Bush and who did
not want his name used for fear of angering Pataki and the state
party chairman, Bill Powers. ``Well, if the powers that be are
trying to keep him off that ballot, that plays right into his
hands. He gets publicity. He gets sympathy. And Bush looks like the
bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican political consultant who is close to the party
leaders said: ``The awful thing for the Bush people is McCain's
probably going to get on the ballot anyway. You've got all of the
pain and none of the gain. It's like exercising six hours a day and
putting on weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have not taken sides in the nomination fight
agreed. ``McCain's been able to stoke his outsider image,'' said
Nelson Warfield, a political consultant who worked for Bob Dole in
1996. ``If Pataki and company were smart, they'd throw the door
wide open right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, the governor's communications director and chief
political adviser, argued that there would be no anti-Bush,
pro-McCain backlash from the ballot fight. ``New Yorkers will be
able to see through the hypocrisy of a senator in his third term
calling himself an outsider,'' she said. ``What the Republican
voters are going to look at are the issues _ taxes, education _ and
on that, they will see that Bush has a stronger record.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In New York, candidates must gain access to the ballot by
collecting thousands of signatures on petitions. The number needed
is determined by a formula that is applied in each congressional
district. The rules are considered the most difficult in the nation
and are filled with detailed requirements that allow challenges to
a candidate's petitions.
</P>
<P>
   The process greatly favors candidates like Bush, who have in
their camp the party foot soldiers to collect the signatures and
the party lawyers to examine them, or like the publisher Steve
Forbes, who have the money to hire people to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were relaxed after the party was criticized for trying
to keep Forbes off the 1996 primary ballot, but they remain far
more onerous than those in most states, where well-known candidates
are automatically on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise concession Wednesday, the state Republican
Committee admitted that its workers forged scores of signatures on
petitions for Bush in a congressional district in the South Bronx.
Among the forged signatures were those of a man stationed overseas
in the Army and an 85-year-old blind woman.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a state judge removed Bush from the primary ballot
in that district.
</P>
<P>
   Each district in the state selects three delegates for the
Republican National Convention, so, with Bush off the ballot in one
district, he can compete for only 90 of the 93 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the state Republican party had charged that the
McCain and Forbes campaigns had gathered signatures of people who
were not Republicans or did not live in the district. Those
challenges knocked McCain off the ballot in 12 of the 31 districts.
Forbes withstood challenges in three districts and is on the ballot
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether McCain can carry New York is another matter. The most
recent public opinion surveys, conducted weeks before the New
Hampshire primary, showed him trailing Bush by 20 or more points in
New York, and until the next round of polls is published next week,
no one will know how much of a bounce he got from his victory.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire clearly is not New York. McCain had months to
cultivate New Hampshire, but he will have only weeks to work New
York, with primaries in South Carolina, Arizona and Michigan in
between.
</P>
<P>
   Still, political analysts say McCain's chances have improved
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's within striking distance in New York,'' said
Douglas Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac College Poll. ``It's a
state of moderate Republicans, and he's appealing to moderates.''

ONE OF TWO ALASKA AIRLINES BLACK BOXES RECOVERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ Using a remote-controlled submarine, the Navy
late Wednesday recovered one of the two black boxes from Flight 261
in some 700 feet of water off the California Coast here.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder, which would have conversations
between the pilot and the first officer about the nature of the
problem on their doomed plane, was being flown to Washington, D.C.,
where it will be examined at the laboratories of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   If the recorder is in good condition, it should yield vital
clues to what happened aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 261 on its way
from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to Seattle with a scheduled stop in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   All 88 people in the plane died, including about 50 from
Seattle, when it crashed into the ocean while attempting to make an
emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the black boxes recovered, the hunt continued
Wednesday night for the second. The flight data recorder, once it
is found and the data analyzed, will tell investigators what
systems on Flight 261 may have malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the one black box in hand, investigators
Wednesday had another important piece of information that will help
them understand what happened to the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, the safety board chairman, disclosed that the pilots
of the MD-83 jet, as they fought to control their plane for some 11
minutes before it crashed, were in radio contact with the Alaska
Airlines maintenance base in Seattle. Hall made the disclosure in
comments on a morning talk show and in a later interview with CNN
from his hometown in Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   He said the audio tape has significant background noise, but
should yield a good understanding of what the pilots were
encountering and what they were trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes before the plane disappeared from radar, the
pilots told air traffic controllers that the plane's stabilizer _
the wing-like structure on the tail _ had jammed. John
Hammerschmidt, a member of the safety board who has been holding
the press briefings here, also said Wednesday that investigators
are going to interview the Alaska crew that flew the plane that
crashed on the leg of the flight down to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators want to know if the pilots had reported a
stabilizer problem as a report published in The Seattle Times said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if that's true,'' he said at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Stabilizer problems are rare, but not unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday, an American Airlines MD-80 made an emergency
landing in Arizona after its pilots reported problems with a
stabilizer. The MD-80 is an earlier version of the MD-83 that
crashed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Luber, a spokeswoman for Phoenix Sky Harbor
International Airport, said the American pilot reported a possible
stabilizer problem about 20 minutes after the flight departed for
Dallas, and safely returned to Phoenix, according to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   American operates 259 of the MD-80 series planes, more than any
other airline.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators continue to look for clues to the crash, the
Coast Guard called off its search for survivors Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to give every chance for success in finding
survivors. I think we have reached that point,'' Coast Guard
Admiral Thomas Collins said at a news conference at Port Hueneme,
near Oxnard, where the Navy, Coast Guard and crash investigators
from the safety board have set up a joint command center.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of ships, planes and helicopters were used to search an
area about 1,100 square miles without success, Collins said. Search
conditions at sea were good, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Only four bodies have been found so far.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 family members are being kept in a hotel near Los
Angeles awaiting word of their loved ones. More are expected to
arrive Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines said it would take relatives to the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he spoke with family members in person Wednesday
and told them of his difficult decision to end the search for
survivors after more than 41 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Some wanted the search to continue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very candid with them. I was very frank,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   He said no one could have survived for so long in the chilly
57-degree waters where the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have far exceeded our estimate of survivability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and Coast Guard will now concentrate on recovering
remains and aircraft wreckage, as well as the planes other black
box.
</P>
<P>
   One group of investigators is already examining the bits of
wreckage recovered from the surface. The safety board 's
investigators have broken into several groups, each assigned to a
specific area of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The board's maintenance group is supposed to be in Seattle
Thursday to review the maintenance records of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   An operations group has been talking with pilots of four planes
that were in the area of Flight 261 and may have seen something.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft control group has been meeting with controllers at
the Los Angeles control center in Palmdale. Hammerschmidt said
investigators have very good radar data about the last minutes of
flight 261. The pilots first reported a problem after the plane
plunged from its cruising altitude of 31,000 feet to about 26,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The witness group, meanwhile, has been interviewing people on
the ground or in boats who may have seen the MD-83 has it plunged
into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   And a structures group has been inspecting wreckage as it is
recovered from the ocean and brought to a pier at Port Hueneme.
</P>
<P>
   As it always does when one of its planes is involved. Boeing is
assisting the safety board in the investigation. Dick Anderson, a
Boeing engineer who heads the company's crash team, is here. A
Boeing structures engineer was expected to arrive shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Other Boeing engineers will be involved as the investigation
unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt noted that a major crash investigation such as
flight 261 can take a year or longer before the safety board is
ready to rule on a probable cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are far from pointing to a particular cause for this
accident,'' he said.

ROCKER SUSPENSION ECHOES 1938 CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Rocker is not the first baseball player to be suspended for
speech. At least one player previously was suspended for something
he said, and he was a teammate of the Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig,
Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey, Red Ruffing and Lefty Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 62 years before Commissioner Bud Selig suspended Rocker
for all of spring training and the first four weeks of the season,
Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended Jake Powell, a
Yankee outfielder, for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, in Selig's words, ``offended practically every element
of society''; Powell limited his remark to blacks. Rocker uttered
his offensive remarks in a magazine interview; Powell's
transgression occurred in a live radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   When Selig announced his action Monday against Rocker, the
Atlanta Braves' closer, no one in Major League Baseball or the
players association was aware of any precedent. The incident
involving Powell came to light Wednesday when it was recalled by
Marty Appel, a former Yankee public relations director and expert
on Yankee history. Research by the commissioner's office uncovered
the Powell suspension, too.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was a 30-year-old backup outfielder for the Yankees in
1938 when Landis disciplined him. He had already gained a
reputation for being less than a class performer on the field. As
recounted in David Pietrusza's book ``Judge and Jury: The Life and
Times of Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis'' (Diamond Communications,
1998), Powell engaged in fistfights with Joe Kuhel of the
Washington Senators and Joe Cronin of the Boston Red Sox. Worse, he
had collided with Hank Greenberg of the Detroit Tigers at first
base and broke his wrist. Pietrusza noted that the Greenberg
incident prompted suspicion of anti-Semitism on Powell's part.
</P>
<P>
   The fight with Cronin occurred during a Memorial Day
doubleheader at Yankee Stadium in 1938. In front of 81,841 fans,
the largest crowd in Stadium history, Powell and Cronin brawled,
and then continued the fight in the runway after being ejected.
Each drew 10-day suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, the Yankees were playing the White Sox at Comiskey
Park, and Powell agreed to do a radio interview with Bob Elson, a
White Sox radio announcer, who asked a seemingly innocuous
question: What do you do in the off-season?
</P>
<P>
   As quoted in Pietrusza's book, Powell replied that he was ``a
cop in southern Illinois'' who got ``a lot of pleasure beating up''
blacks _ Powell used an epithet _ and ``throwing them in jail.''
With that, the interview ended.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks in an area near Comiskey who heard the interview
protested to Landis' office. Landis certainly was not a champion of
black players in his 24-year tenure as commissioner, but he reacted
swiftly, summoning Powell and Joe McCarthy, the Yankees' manager,
to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, Pietrusza writes, denied having made that comment,
telling reporters later, ``I don't remember saying anything like
that at all, and I certainly would never mean to say anything
offensive to the Negroes of Dayton, Chicago or anything else. I
have some very good friends among the Negroes in Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   Landis did not accept Powell's denial. He suspended him for 10
days, saying, ``Player Powell made an uncomplimentary reference to
a portion of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell played for the Senators before and after the Yankees and
finished his career with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1945, having
played in all or part of 11 seasons. He died three years later at
the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has not denied making the comments that brought him his
suspension and, in fact, has apologized for them. However, the
players association is challenging Selig's action through
baseball's grievance procedure. No such procedure existed in
Landis' time, so Powell served his suspension. &QR;

 &HT;    Only time and schedule will tell us if this will lead to
Something Big
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Another national signing day has come and gone,
and the University of Texas football class is ranked so high in the
recruiting gurus' lists that Mack Brown got nosebleed Wednesday
just talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown signed every good player within a radius of 300 miles who
can run a 4.3-second 40-yard dash and chew gum at the same time,
including the best three wide receivers in the state, the best
quarterback in the state, the best tight end in the state, the best
defensive lineman in the state, etc., etc. If he was the best,
Brown got him.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' haul is ranked anywhere from first to fifth in the
nation. That, of course, means three consecutive bountiful
recruiting classes and counting. And you know what that means.
Texas is now poised, if it can get by a 2000 schedule just tougher
than the Globetrotters', to win _ drum roll, please _ something
big. Or Something Big.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Can't go there. The laptop rejects the very words, and
you know what words those are. There are two of them, and we're not
talking Cotton Bowl. Think big. No, bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Brown does, which is why Texas is much, much closer to, uh,
winning Something Big than it has been since a near-miss in 1983.
That's the last time the Longhorns were a serious contender for,
well, you know.
</P>
<P>
   I can't bring myself to write it. I know you want it, I know you
need it worse than Bush needs another primary, I know you can't go
on without it.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll have to until, at least, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Something Big, in all likelihood, won't happen before then even
with a schedule that omits Nebraska and Kansas State and includes
both an island team (Hawaii) and mainland teams (Stanford,
Louisiana-Lafayette and Houston) that will not pose the threat that
the Cornhuskers and Wildcats annually do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 2 1/2 years into what we've brought to Texas,'' Brown
said. ``We need more depth, more speed. We need to do a better job
of playing bump-and-run. We have to get more rush out of our front
four. And we need depth in the offensive line desperately.''
</P>
<P>
   Help is on the way. This Longhorns class ranks fifth nationally
behind front-runner Florida, Tennessee, Penn State and Ohio State,
according to Bobby Burton of the National Recruiting Advisor. On
the heels of the country's top-rated haul last February, Texas now
joins only six other schools that have had consecutive top-10
classes. It can boast three consensus top-15 groups in a row that
include 10 Parade All-Americans, 23 USA Today All-Americans and 49
all-state players in 67 players. Plus, 59 of that total are Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Phil the groundhog saw his shadow Tuesday, but Texas is
casting one as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best back-to-back classes of any school in this state
in the last nine years,'' Burton said. ``The player suspensions
didn't hurt whatsoever. The three losses (to end last season)? Who
knows whom they might have signed if they'd won those games? It was
a coup just getting in on kids like (linebacker) D.J. Williams or
(running back) Marcus Houston. Texas has continued to upgrade its
overall talent level.''
</P>
<P>
   And gradually that talent, Brown's talent, is finding its way on
the field. Only eight of the players he signed started in the
Cotton Bowl game, seven of those on a solid defense all year. Guard
Antwan Kirk-Hughes was Brown's lone offensive recruit to start
against Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   By our projections, the most likely 22 starters on Sept. 2 will
still include only 12 Brown recruits. The rest are John Mackovic
holdovers, which isn't bad when you consider All-America-caliber
defensive tackles Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers, All-Big 12
tailback Hodges Mitchell and middle linebacker De'Andre Lewis are
among them.
</P>
<P>
   But other Brownies could crack the starting lineup against the
Rainbows. You can almost pencil in some combination of receivers
B.J. Johnson, Roy Williams and Sloan Thomas on the field. Then
there are cornerbacks such as Rod Babers, Dakarai Pearson, Kendrick
Turner and Monti Collier, and defensive ends Marcus Tubbs and Adam
McConathy. Other Brown recruits such as defensive tackle Ryan
Haywood, offensive guard Tillman Holloway and offensive tackle
Robbie Doane will be applying for steady work soon.
</P>
<P>
   And don't discount the rookies, although Brown said, ``It'll be
midseason or next spring before most of these players make an
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may work on a quicker timetable. Freshmen such as center
Jason Glynn and defensive ends Kalen Thornton and Adam Doiron might
push for immediate playing time. Phillip Geiggar or Nathan Vasher
or any of those freshman wideouts could nail down a spot as kick
returner. Incoming punter Justin Smith could wrest the job away
from incumbent Ryan Long. Place-kicker Matt McFadden could spell
Kris Stockton on kickoff duty.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little doubt that Texas is well on its way to if not
winning, at least competing soon for, ahem, Something Big.

 &HT;    Brown has second straight top-notch
 &HT;    recruiting class at UT
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The first sign that Texas football coach Mack
Brown would put together another star-studded recruiting class came
on a balmy June afternoon last summer. That's when a high school
quarterback, who was such a die-hard fan of Texas A&AMP;M that he kept
an Aggies screensaver on his computer, made a fact-finding trip to
Austin to check out the Longhorns football camp.
</P>
<P>
   Chance Mock, the top-rated quarterback in the state and one of
the best in the country, told friends before he drove to Austin
that Texas would have to ''wow'' him to change his mind about the
Aggies, his lifelong favorite college football team.
</P>
<P>
   After he returned to his home in The Woodlands, Mock's family
sent out a brief press release saying that the quarterback would
sign with the Longhorns. Mock was so wowed by Brown and his staff
that he took two trips to Austin during the official recruiting
process in December and January. One was an official trip, paid for
by the UT athletic department. He paid for the other, which he took
two weeks ago, so he could mix with the prospects and entice any of
the undecided the Longhorns' way.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mock was one of 23 high school seniors who signed
binding national letters of intent with the Longhorns. UT coaches
were holding a scholarship open for Las Vegas defensive lineman
Lynn McGruder, who initially had committed to Tennessee but changed
his mind at the last minute. McGruder, formerly of Palestine, could
not be reached for comment late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Experts rated UT's class as tops in the Big 12 Conference and
among the elite in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even Aggies Coach R.C. Slocum, who lost several top-name
recruits, including Mock, to Texas, was complimentary of the
Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe how well (Texas) has done,'' Slocum said. ``It
looks to me like they just had a tremendous year. Last year they
supposedly had the top recruiting class in the nation, and this is
supposed to be a top-five class. Anytime a Texas team has that kind
of talent, it presents you with a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one praising Brown's class which, star-wise,
falls just short of last year's group, which was the consensus
choice as tops in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Gimino, college football editor of CBS sportsline.com,
said: ``This we do know: Texas indisputably had the No. 1 class in
the nation last year, and there's everything to like about the 2000
Longhorns freshmen, whether the group finishes first or second ...
or anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said, ``As we look at this class, we feel like this class
has the makings of being as good as last year's class but it will
take us a year or so to really determine. We feel like even though
we will have to wait and see on this class, everything that we were
looking for coming into this recruiting class, to some extent we
were able to bring home today.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Texas brought in 30 recruits on official visits. It
offered 27 of them scholarships, and 23 accepted. McGruder would be
the 24th.
</P>
<P>
   What about this class looks so good, at least on paper?
</P>
<P>
   _ It includes 13 members of the Austin American-Statesman's
Fabulous 55. Of the 13, six were members of the top 10, including
three of the top four in wide receivers B.J. Johnson (No. 1); Roy
Williams (No. 2) and Sloan Thomas (No. 4). The other top 10 members
were Lanier defensive lineman Sonny Davis (No. 7) tight end Brock
Edwards (No. 8) and Mock (No. 9).
</P>
<P>
   _ Four of the signees _ Johnson, Mock, Davis and running back
Sneezy Beltran _ made the prestigious Parade magazine All-America
team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six of the prospects were included in SuperPrep's list of the
top 50 prospects in the country, while seven earned spots on
Rivals100 national 100 rankings. Nine of the prospects were
included in some publication's national 100 list.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six of the group earned All-America honors from USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's group had four Parade and 10 USA Today All-Americans
and 16 members of the Fab 55, including 10 members of the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be the top class in the country, but it's definitely
comparable to last year's,'' said Bobby Burton, editor of
Rivals100.com.
</P>
<P>
   Burton ranked Texas fifth nationally. His top 10, subject to
change pending late signees, was Florida, Tennessee, Penn State,
Ohio State, Texas, Alabama, Florida State, Michigan State, Nebraska
and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Wallace, editor of SuperPrep, ranked the Longhorns second
to Florida. Rounding out spots three through 10th were Florida
State, Penn State, Tennessee, Alabama, Ohio State, Southern
California, Miami and Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's third group of signees is heavy on receiving talent with
Johnson, Williams and Thomas. In addition, Texarkana's Nathan
Vasher and Tony Jeffery of Klein Forest likely will be tried at
receiver and defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   The class also is loaded with defensive line talent with Davis,
Texas City's Marcel Moses (No. 23 on the Fab 55) and Dallas St.
Mark's Kalen Thornton (No. 31). Stevie Lee, a defensive lineman
from Shreveport, La., already is enrolled at Texas. Lee was
considered the top defensive prospect in his home state and was a
consensus national 100 selection.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he thinks recruiting rankings probably are an
accurate prediction of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we win the recruiting wars, we don't win on the
field,'' Brown said. ``I've tried it both ways. I tried it with bad
players, and I've tried it with good players. I've found out you
win a lot more games with good players.''

BUSINESS HEROES ARE SOMETIMES UNHERALDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star In mid-January, information technology
workers who spent last year preventing computer-related meltdowns
began forwarding an e-mail.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The punch line:
</P>
<P>
   ``We did our jobs so damned well that the only question
remaining was whether there had been any need to do the job at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail is titled ``The Heroes of Y2K'' and credited to Judy
Backhouse. A publisher in South Africa has a copyright on the piece
and I haven't been able to reach Backhouse personally, so I won't
reprint her full lament here.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of it is that all the computer code checking,
rewriting, upgrading and testing, along with a crush of form
writing, was done well and on time.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``The clocks ticked over to the year 2000 with nothing more than
minor hitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``And were they grateful? Did the world thank us and laud us as
the heroes we quite clearly were?
</P>
<P>
   ``No!
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned around and called it `all hype.' They questioned
the money spent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heroes of Y2K'' is much longer than what's quoted here,
but the drift is clear. Legions of IT workers feel unheralded for
their work.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some companies threw Y2K parties at midnight on New Year's
Eve. Some IT people earned bonuses in recognition of their missed
vacations and late nights on the job. Some in-house newsletters
published kudos for those who kept operations running seamlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tale of IT workers who feel unappreciated provides
lessons for the workplace as whole.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson one: Pat yourself on the back for a job well done.
Thanking yourself may be the only reward you get. It's still
worthwhile. Allow yourself permission to luxuriate, ``I did it!''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson two: Understand there is curious danger in doing your job
so easily or so well that others have a diminished perception of
how hard you work. Workers who can ``handle it'' often do, day in
and day out, to little acclaim, simply because it's expected of
them. Believe it or not, that's a compliment. Take it as such.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson three: Public opinion about your profession or your work
can be misinformed. Derogatory labels pinned on whole batches of
workers _ postal employees, lawyers, government employees,
journalists, to name a few that quickly come to mind _ may be
faulty stereotypes that don't apply to you. Brush them off.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson four: Sometimes you do have to walk in the other guy's
shoes to understand what he or she does. The co-worker who
constantly flutters about in a panic may be a poor time manager,
not a vital, overworked cog in the corporate machine; conversely,
the one who appears to be idly staring at a computer screen may be
keeping the company afloat. Don't judge others' contributions
without the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson five: Congratulations can come from anyone. When you see
someone save the day _ or the hour _ say thanks. Let others know
you notice and appreciate them. Don't wait for the boss's praise.
Share it with one another. It has a nice effect.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the IT folk who tacked ``The Heroes of Y2K'' on their
bulletin boards.

ASSOCIATED WHOLESALE GROCERS PLAN COULD ELIMINATE AT LEAST 450
JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star A plan by Associated Wholesale Grocers
Inc. to outsource its warehouse and trucking operations could
eliminate at least 450 area jobs at the Kansas City, Kan.-based
food supplier.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Teamsters union has vowed to strike the food wholesaler and
boycott the grocery stores it supplies if the plan goes through.
</P>
<P>
   Associated is a cooperative owned by more than 350 retail
grocers that supplies about 850 stores _ such as Apple Market,
Thriftway, Sun Fresh, Hen House and Price Chopper _ in 10 states.
</P>
<P>
   The company informed the Teamsters of its outsourcing decision
Tuesday to comply with a 60-day notice requirement stipulated by
federal law in cases of mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Associated said it had reached tentative agreements with two
companies, CS Integrated LLC and Perryman Refrigerated Lines, to
provide services to its Kansas City, Kan., division. CS Integrated
would handle warehousing operations, and Perryman would provide
trucking services. Those agreements are to take effect April 2 if a
new contract with the Teamsters is not reached, the food supplier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Davidson, president of Teamsters Local 955, said
Associated had 494 area Teamster employees. The current contract
will expire April 1, after which Associated would be free to
outsource the warehouse and transportation departments.
</P>
<P>
   Associated estimates that its area Teamster work force is about
450.
</P>
<P>
   The company has made similar outsourcing plans with other
companies for its Springfield division, which employs nearly 800
Teamsters. A division in Oklahoma City with 250 bargaining unit
workers has not been affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing but pure corporate greed,'' Davidson said.
``This company is one of the healthiest in the country. It's not
that they're not making a profit. They just want to increase the
rebates to their stores.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Associated said that warehouse employees
could apply for jobs with CS Integrated and that drivers would have
a chance to become owner-operators with Perryman.
</P>
<P>
   Associated said outsourcing would give it ``the opportunity to
expand beyond its current geographic area, improve its operations,
free up capital and generate cost savings.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reducing its transportation and warehousing
costs, Associated said, the changes would free up about $10 million
in capital through the sale of warehouse equipment, trucks and
trailers.
</P>
<P>
   The deals would allow Associated ``to focus our resources on
other facets of our business to provide better service to our
members,'' the company said in response to a faxed question.
</P>
<P>
   Associated, which posted 1998 sales of $3.2 billion, is the
second-biggest retailer-owned grocery wholesaler in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would meet with union officials about the
outsourcing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said the union had been meeting with the food supplier
for six months regarding a contract renewal. But the talks had
stalled, Davidson said, because of provisions the company was
seeking that would have allowed it to outsource its operations at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that the union was willing to consider other
types of concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were willing to work with them if they had problems and
needed relief in the contract,'' he said. ``The union's willing to
bend over backward, but this is a one-way street.''
</P>
<P>
   Associated said it had nine negotiating sessions with the
Teamsters in 1999, ``and we were open to more.''
</P>
<P>
   If a new Teamsters contract is not reached, the union most
likely will strike, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dispute arose in 1998 between Dillon Stores Inc. of
Hutchinson, Kan., and its drivers, also represented by the
Teamsters. After a battle that lasted months, 110 drivers accepted
buyout packages from Dillon after it outsourced its transportation
division.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon's union warehouse workers, however, in 1998 reached a new
seven-year contract.

HEALTH AGENCY ADMITS SHIFTING FUNDS FROM STUDY OF DEADLY VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.M.)  (af) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
acknowledged Wednesday that several million dollars designated by
Congress to be spent for research on the deadly hantavirus was
actually spent on other work, and the General Accounting Office was
called in to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The diversion of money was first reported Tuesday in The
Washington Post. It is the second time in less than a year that the
agency has been forced to acknowledge shifting money that Congress
gave to the agency to carry out specific research.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sen. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania
Republican who heads the appropriations committee, said he was
disturbed by the diversion and said he would have the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress, review the centers' finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they may have an epidemic over there,'' Specter said.
The panel is responsible for the final approval of the financing
for government spending, including agencies like the
disease-control centers.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the centers' director, Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan,
publicly apologized for diverting some of the $13 million intended
for research on chronic fatigue syndrome to work on other diseases.
He said corrective measures would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   But with the acknowledgment that hantavirus money was also
diverted, Specter said: ``It is very disconcerting, to say the
least, if the CDC is not following the Congress' directions. And it
is worse if, in fact, they have been lying about it.''
</P>
<P>
   About $7 million had been set aside by Congress for research on
hantavirus, a virus that was discovered in 1993 in the Southwest
and killed at least 26 people. As the number of deaths fell, Koplan
said Wednesday in an interview, some of the money began to be used
for other purposes, including work on virulent pathogens like the
Ebola virus and for global monitoring new viral outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   Koplan, who became head of the agency only last summer, said he
did not yet know exactly how much had been diverted.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed the shifting of money was legal, but he
acknowledged that it was a mistake not to let Congress know about
the shift, and he said it would not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement Wednesday, he said the ``CDC has taken
these lessons to heart and is working to set things straight. As
CDC's director, I apologized to Congress in CDC's reporting of
budget line items and outlined actions that CDC is putting in place
to ensure appropriate disclosure regarding its use of funds.'' He
said the agency was well on its way ``to correcting budget mistakes
of the past.'' For example, he said, the budget staff was being
retrained.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said his committee would ask the centers' director to
travel to Washington to meet with him when the secretary of Health
and Human Services was scheduled to meet him on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, a Republican whose state of New Mexico was
among the places where the deadly hantavirus outbreak took place,
was somewhat more forgiving. Domenici said Wednesday that he had
the greatest respect for the centers, ``and I want to be careful
not to prejudge them,'' adding, ``I think they probably have a good
explanation for this.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty, Koplan said, has been that the sophistication of
budgeting at the centers had not kept up with the agency's growth.
He said a major problem was that the agency must make unexpected
expenditures in emergency outbreaks, and there was no way of
foreseeing what would be needed or when. Thus, he explained, some
flexibility is needed.

GIULIANI DEFENDS HIMSELF ON ANTICOMPROMISE ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani presented a vigorous defense
Wednesday against the suggestion that he is not compromising enough
to serve in the U.S. Senate, directly rebuffing one of Hillary
Rodham Clinton's principal criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, at a news conference after a speech at a trade
association luncheon, told reporters that his two terms as a
Republican mayor in an overwhelmingly Democratic city with an
overwhelmingly Democratic City Council had demonstrated his ability
to govern cooperatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider the fact that I have been mayor of American's most
Democratic city, a Republican mayor,'' Giuliani said, a tight smile
fixed on his face. ``I'm still a Republican mayor, still standing,
and the City Council in New York City has 44 Democrats and seven
Republicans and I have to pass the fourth-largest budget in the
country every year through that City Council.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, looking jaunty as he fielded a half-hour of questions
from the group of Washington reporters, then boasted, ``I have also
gotten more legislation passed than probably any mayor in the
history of the city,'' and he recited a litany of bills: safe
access to abortion clinics, domestic-partner benefits, re-zoning to
limit sex shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done things that you can't categorize as liberal or
conservative,'' he said. ``Some would be characterized as liberal,
some as very conservative. I had to do all of that by getting a
Democratic City Council to agree with me, at least a majority of
that City Council to agree with me. So I must know something about
reasonable and sensible compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly referred to Giuliani's temperament,
particularly what she describes as his anger and his
confrontational style, as she tries to emphasize that her demeanor
may be more suited to the courteous ways of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Her advisers reacted scornfully to the mayor's remarks
Wednesday. ``It may be the first time that Rudy Giuliani and the
word compromise were used in the same sentence,'' said her
spokesman, Howard Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is Harold Levy called him and he wouldn't
even take the call from the chancellor,'' Wolfson said, referring
to the new head of New York City's school system, who was not
Giuliani's choice. ``When other senators call him, will he refuse
to take their calls if he disagrees with them?''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic legislators also reacted incredulously to the mayor's
remarks and suggested that the relationship between the mayor and
the council had been marked more by disagreement than by
deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``He once held my community hostage simply because he didn't
agree with me on homeless legislation,'' said Councilman Stephen
DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat. He also recalled that in 1998
Giuliani had failed to reach a budget agreement with the Council.
``When we showed independent thinking about Yankee Stadium,
something close to his heart, he refused to negotiate with us and
we had to pass our own budget,'' DiBrienza said.

   Giuliani's campaign aides announced Wednesday that they had
begun purchasing air time for a new round of television ads to be
broadcast throughout upstate New York. The new ads are timed in
part to coincide with Clinton's official announcement of her
candidacy this weekend, which will include a series of house
parties and an appearance by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has not scheduled a formal announcement, laughed
when a reporter asked him if the president would be an advantage or
disadvantage to Clinton.

NETS TAKE CONTROL, THEN LOSE TO HAWKS IN THE STRETCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This one did not seem headed for a
last-second finish. Shooting well and defending strongly, the New
Jersey Nets held a 14-point lead over the Atlanta Hawks early in
the third period Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hawks began to charge, eating away at the Nets'
advantage like rock salt on ice. By the middle of the fourth
quarter, the Hawks were leading and by the last minute, they were
on their way to a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Overpowering the Nets down the stretch, the Hawks won for only
the fourth time on the road in 21 games by defeating the Nets,
97-89, at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Nets' fifth straight loss and the ninth game in their
last 10 that was decided in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, losers of eight of their last 10 games, dropped to
17-28. Keith Van Horn led the Nets with 28 points and 10 rebounds.
Stephon Marbury, one day after being left off the Eastern
Conference All-Star team, had a poor outing. He finished with 15
points, 10 assists and 8 turnovers on 5-for-16 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the game since the second minute of the game, the
Nets lost their advantage midway through the fourth quarter when
the Hawks (17-26) went ahead, 81-80, on a jump shot by Jim Jackson,
a former Net.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Nets regained the lead a couple of times, the Hawks
moved ahead by 3 points (90-87) with 1 minute 50 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets seemed to be wilting under the pressure of yet another
close game. Marbury, the Nets' best clutch player, missed 2 of 3
free throws after being fouled on a 3-point attempt. Marbury, an
81.7 percent foul shooter, also committed critical turnovers late
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets had a chance to move within a point with just over a
minute to play when Van Horn knocked away a pass intended for Alan
Henderson. Seizing the ball, Van Horn dribbled downcourt on what
became a three-on-one fast break. He fed a charging Marbury on the
left wing, and Marbury kicked it back to Van Horn. But instead of
bringing the ball out to set a play, Van Horn took a contested baby
hook shot that barely kissed the rim. The Hawks rebounded, and
Dikembe Mutombo made two free throws to push the lead to 92-87.
When Jackson buried a baseline jumper 30 seconds later, the Nets
were sunk.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With a 13-point lead, the Nets seemed destined to avoid the type
of last-second thrillers that have plagued the team. The offense
was clicking, having shot 51 percent in the first half, and the
defense was unusually resolute, holding the Hawks to 37 percent
shooting. But after increasing the lead to 59-45 early in the third
quarter, the Nets began to slow up.
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Rider, Jackson and Mutombo, all of whom played poor
offense in the first half, began to find themselves. And soon
Atlanta was chopping at the Nets' lead.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, a one-man gang in the first half with 18 points, cut
the lead to 61-55 with a layup midway through the quarter, but the
Nets pushed it quickly back to 10 points. Atlanta would not go
away, and Jackson and Rider led a surge that pulled the Hawks
within 4 points late in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who led by 74-68 entering the fourth, lost their lead
with sluggish play on both ends of the court. After hitting more
than half of their shots in the first half, they missed 14 of 19
attempts in shooting 26 percent in the third quarter. And after
they played solid defense over the first two quarters, the Nets'
resistance became paper-thin as Atlanta hit 11 of 20 field-goal
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, riding quick 3-pointers by Kittles and Marbury, took
an 8-point advantage before the first quarter was three minutes
old. Marbury gave the Nets their largest lead of the quarter by
sinking another 3-pointer that made it 25-15 with two minutes
remaining. Shooting 56.5 percent, the Nets led by 29-21 entering
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury and Van Horn led with 8 points apiece, and Kittles (7)
and Gill (6) followed.
</P>
<P>
   It was more of the same in the second quarter, only this time it
was the reserves who did most of the damage. Scott Burrell opened
the period with a 3-pointer and went on to score 6 more points in
leading the Nets to a 13-point lead. Burrell was feeling so good
that he attempted seven shots in the quarter, more than two above
his season average for an entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Lucious Harris joined the bench brigade by scoring 8 in the
period, including a 3-pointer that gave the Nets a 54-41 halftime
lead. In contrast to their poor defensive performance in the first
quarter, the Nets buckled down and held Atlanta to 26 percent
shooting in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks' offense degenerated into the Henderson Show, as the
mediocre Atlanta forward more than matched the strong offense of
Van Horn (12 points, 8 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   Scoring in a plethora of ways around the basket, Henderson went
into the locker room with 18 points, 5 more than his game average.
Still, with little help from his teammates _ Rider and Jackson were
a combined 4 for 14 from the floor _ the Hawks did not seem capable
of making a game of it.  &QL;

FOR NEW UMKC CHANCELLOR, THE ROAD AHEAD IS ONE OF MANY
POSSIBILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star NEW ORLEANS _ It's just after 6 a.m.
Outside it's dark, but here in the fitness center, bright lights
shine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martha Gilliland, who will begin work as chancellor at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City in less than two months, sweats
on a cross-training machine, working her legs, her lungs and her
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Each step feels like a battle. It would have been easier to stay
in bed.
</P>
<P>
   But she refuses to quit because she's working to meet a goal:
getting in shape for an upcoming hiking trip.
</P>
<P>
   At Tulane University, where Gilliland has been provost for 2
years, colleagues say she handles school business the same way: She
sets a goal, then does what's necessary to meet it, regardless of
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Other people might see the hurdles and talk themselves out of
trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha thinks, `Where do we want to be in five years?' Then,
`How do we get there?' '' says Hugh Lester, a Tulane vice provost.
``If you think of the obstacles first, you won't get there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gilliland, 55, meets with people on Tulane's parklike
campus, she's all business.
</P>
<P>
   She's known as a good listener with an easy smile, but being
from the taciturn Northeast and an engineer by training, Gilliland
is direct when she talks.
</P>
<P>
   That directness hasn't always jelled with the laid-back, social
culture of New Orleans, where people love to have a good time and
tell a good story _ even to strangers _ and take their time doing
it.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch at the expensive, ultrachic Emeril's Restaurant on
the edge of the French Quarter, Gilliland is trying to convince a
Tulane alum to give money to a new project. But the man, a
successful banker and New Orleans native, is telling a story. A
long, drawn-out story with lots of details to spice it up.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland isn't shy about interrupting him to get him back to
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   She hates wasting time on trivialities. Later, a long-time
Tulane administrator is relaying why she loves New Orleans
supermarkets. Other customers at the meat counter tell everybody
what cut of meat they're buying, she says, and how they're going to
fix it when they get home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate New Orleans supermarkets,'' Gilliland says, with a
smile and a shake of her head.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Gilliland doesn't care for everything about New
Orleans, she has been curious about its culture and has tried to
adapt when she can. She's seen the Mardi Gras parades. She enjoys
standing on the levee above the Mississippi River, watching ships
from around the world sail in.
</P>
<P>
   She is a big fan of New Orleans' coffee shops and is happiest on
Sunday mornings sitting on the patio of her house along upscale,
historic St. Charles Avenue drinking coffee, reading The New York
Times and admiring the immense magnolia tree outside her window.
</P>
<P>
   She's a morning person, usually at the gym by 6 and at the
office by 8. In her first days in New Orleans, Gilliland called
meetings for 8 a.m., a reasonable hour for an early bird like her.
She soon found out that hour was impossibly early for people in the
party-happy Big Easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would wander in around 8:15 or 8:20, get some coffee,
get caught up on chit chat,'' says Deborah Grant, a Tulane
spokeswoman. ``It drove her crazy that the meetings wouldn't really
get started until 8:45.''
</P>
<P>
   So she started calling her meetings for later and used the time
before the campus awoke to keep up with e-mails and reading.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming from inside
</P>
<P>
   People at Tulane say Gilliland is warm, gracious and energetic.
She also is open with colleagues as she plans ways to solve
problems on campus.
</P>
<P>
   When Gilliland arrived at Tulane in 1997, she found two
opportunities for change: out-of-date classrooms could be
modernized to attract computer savvy students, and students could
be connected more to the city of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Across campus from Gilliland's office sits a new dormitory with
a theme created under Gilliland's guidance _ the Urban Village.
</P>
<P>
   Here, about 90 students live together and take urban-themed
courses such as ``The City as a Work of Art,'' ``Cinematic Cities:
The Represented City in National Imaginaries,'' and ``Growing Up in
the City: Urban Child and Adolescent Development.''
</P>
<P>
   The students also do volunteer work in New Orleans, living the
theory they learn in class. And they can take part in the new
``Lagniappe'' first-year experience program, also begun under
Gilliland's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the Creole word for ``a little something extra,''
Lagniappe offers freshmen tours of the city, as well as lectures
and films on New Orleans music, food and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Koritz, an English professor who directs Lagniappe and
teaches in the Urban Village, says Gilliland gets people's ideas on
what should happen on campus, then sets goals and encourages others
to lead the journey. She gives them the necessary resources and
time and expects the goal to be met.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland also likes taking chances on new ideas, all to give
students a wider life experience and keep the campus vibrant,
Koritz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way Martha understands education,'' she says. ``You
transform the students. You transform the city. But you transform
both from the inside, not the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred yards away from the Urban Village dormitory, a
professor is using a new ``smart board'' to teach his class. The
board is like a regular white board that can be written on with
colored markers.
</P>
<P>
   But this board is connected to a lectern-mounted computer. So he
projects notes from the computer onto the board and can scroll
backward and forward through the notes by just touching a button on
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   And to highlight a sentence or an image, he circles it with a
pen or his finger on the ``smart board'' and saves the changes to a
disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Martha got here, technology development was nil,'' Lester
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But with Gilliland's support, Lester, who was a professor at the
time, convinced other professors to embrace the new technology. And
Gilliland started calling in the cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Provost's Council, a group of young alumni, had given advice
to Tulane provosts for years. The provost is second-in-charge after
the president and oversees all academics on campus.
</P>
<P>
   But this time Gilliland convinced them to give direction and
dollars. The group raised $150,000 for the new ``smart''
classrooms. A premier university
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland has already been meeting with UMKC vice chancellors by
telephone and e-mail to help her identify UMKC's priorities and
determine how to meet them. She starts work as chancellor April 1.
</P>
<P>
   She believes UMKC, which has about 11,000 students, can jump
ahead of other public universities in national reputation, the
number and size of research grants and the way students learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``UMKC can step out and leapfrog over the definition of
`premier' of the past and design `premier' for the future,''
Gilliland says. ``My goal is for UMKC to be one of the few
universities that defines what `premier' means.''
</P>
<P>
   She admires UMKC's strengths:
</P>
<P>
   - A breadth of academic offerings, with schools of medicine,
nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, biological sciences, law, business,
education, music, and arts and sciences.
</P>
<P>
   - Cooperation with area institutions that do related life
sciences research.
</P>
<P>
   - A strategic plan that calls for boosting technology, embracing
cultural diversity and partnering with local businesses and
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilliland also knows she will need to address UMKC's
shortcomings and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   She will have to integrate the Twin Oaks apartment towers, which
UMKC recently bought for student housing, into the life of the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   And she'll have to boost students' emotional and physical
attachment to UMKC. The Tulane campus is a bustling place, with
students walking everywhere. Almost one in two Tulane students
lives on campus and most are between 18 and 22 years old with lots
of free time to spend with each other.
</P>
<P>
   But the UMKC campus just east and south of the Country Club
Plaza is often deserted. Many students are older than 22 and busy
with jobs and families.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her biggest challenge will be convincing Kansas Citians
to embrace UMKC as the university for the city. Many local people
overlook the school and pledge allegiance to the University of
Missouri-Columbia, the University of Kansas or Kansas State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland says the first step toward improving UMKC's visibility
will be repairing the seriously frayed relationship between UMKC
and people who live nearby.
</P>
<P>
   When UMKC tried in 1998 to tear down about 50 nearby houses for
a temporary parking lot and eventual soccer field, residents
rallied, protesting loudly and putting ``UMKC Kills our Homes''
signs in their yards. The university eventually backed down, but
distrust lingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt there's serious damage UMKC has to recover
from,'' Gilliland says. The road ahead
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland knows her plan to transform UMKC into a ``premier''
university is a long-term project. She pictures herself as
chancellor at UMKC for a decade or more, the ``capstone'' of a
career that has taken her from graduate school at the University of
Florida, where she earned a doctorate in environmental engineering,
to teaching and administrative posts at the universities of
Oklahoma, Nebraska-Lincoln and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrives in Kansas City, she will be in the public eye
and doesn't expect much time off in the first year. So Gilliland, a
former park ranger, is taking February and March off for a hiking
trip in Argentina and a visit with her daughter and newborn
grandson in Washington, D.C. Monday was her last official day at
Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland has long wanted to lead an entire campus on her own.
She will earn $175,000 a year at UMKC.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Powell, who oversees a project that gets Tulane professors
and students involved with residents of a nearby public housing
development, says Gilliland will bring consistent leadership to
UMKC.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big institution like Tulane is like the Titanic; it's hard
to change its course,'' Powell says. ``If you didn't have people
like Martha at the helm it would be hard to make corrections in
direction. She has a steady hand.''
</P>
<P>
   But having a steady hand isn't the same as being rigid,
colleagues say.
</P>
<P>
   In Gilliland's office, which has windows overlooking verdant
Audubon Park and busy St. Charles Avenue, Gilliland is meeting with
Tulane's interim provost.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbing through a file for a note she wants to give him, she
comes across one of her favorite poems. The poem begins: ``don't
establish the/boundaries/first. /the squares, triangles,/boxes/of
preconceived/possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   At meetings, Gilliland stokes people's creativity by soliciting
``crazy ideas'' that might seem ridiculous at first but could end
up sparking great change.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be very creative with Martha. Sometimes academics can
be stuffy, but Martha is not stuffy,'' Grant says.

 ADVERTISING: PUBLICIS ACQUIRING FALLON McELLIGOTT  
 (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sunday, Fallon McElligott, the creatively focused agency
known for risk-taking, rule-breaking work for brands like Holiday
Inn, Miller Lite, Timex and United, enjoyed what was deemed its
biggest day ever, running four clutter-busting spots during Super
Bowl XXXIV for BMW, EDS and Nuveen Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, though, Fallon McElligott topped its Super Sunday
lineup of imaginary auto trips, cat-herding cowboys and a
``walking'' Christopher Reeve with a real stunner: an agreement to
be acquired by a worldwide holding company after years of fiercely
declaring it would resolutely remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   It is starting to sound like a broken record _ if such a simile
is still relevant in an era of CDs and tapes _ but here Madison
Avenue goes again: another creatively oriented independent shop is
being bought by a global giant.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, the acquirer is the Publicis Group unit of
Publicis SA in Paris, the world's 10th-largest agency company in
revenue and 12th largest in billings. Fallon McElligott and its
subsidiary, Duffy Design and Interactive, will become the second
agency network of Publicis alongside Publicis Worldwide, operating
autonomously under its current name and management.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon McElligott, which was founded in 1981, joins a lengthy
list of formerly independent ``hot shops'' that includes Arnold
Communications; Chiat/Day; GSD&AMP;M; Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners;
Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos; the Martin Agency; and Hal
Riney &AMP; Partners. ``The world has changed significantly;
globalization has become relentless,'' Patrick R. Fallon, chairman
at Fallon McElligott, said in a telephone interview from the
agency's Minneapolis headquarters. ``And being independent,
self-financed, we had limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of time looking at our future, how to serve
clients better,'' he added, ``and we felt that unless we made some
sort of strategic move, we'd atrophy. Now we're in a very strong
position to compete in areas we couldn't on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon McElligott, which had been privately held, and Publicis,
which though publicly traded is reticent to disclose financial
data, declined to discuss terms of the deal apart from an aside by
Fallon that Publicis ``didn't pay enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But shops like Fallon McElligott, which have long been sought
for their creative cachet and growth potential, often sell for a
price equal to one to two times revenue. The agency's 1999 revenue
was estimated at more than $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   The daily fax edition of the trade publication Advertising Age,
quoting an unidentified individual, estimated the price at $120
million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``When it comes to money, I'm speechless,'' said Maurice Levy,
president and chief executive at Publicis, who joined Fallon for
the interview as well as to inform the agency's 650 employees in
Minneapolis, London and New York about the deal in person and by
video conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about revenue or size,'' Levy said. ``It's about
building a community of people to bring the very best ideas to
clients to build market share and brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, size does matter, particularly in the United States, the
world's largest advertising market. Since 1997, when Publicis lost
a bitter hostile takeover battle for Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &AMP;
Eckhardt to its onetime partner in Europe, True North
Communications, Publicis has frenetically increased its presence in
this country through a skein of acquisitions. Publicis has bought
agencies like Riney, the Evans Group and Frankel outright and
purchased 49 percent of the Burrell Communications Group, which
specializes in ads aimed at black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our deal with Frankel in January and this one, we double
our size in the U.S.,'' Levy said, to an estimated $400 million in
revenue of the worldwide Publicis total of about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now my favorite place,'' he added, laughing, referring
to the Midwest, the home of Publicis agencies like Burrell, Fallon
McElligott and Frankel, and Publicis clients like Whirlpool Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said he was ``very much surprised'' that he and Fallon were
able to keep the news of the acquisition from the gossipy agency
industry. They met in Minneapolis in late July, they recalled,
brought together by a mutual friend, Laurel Cutler, the longtime
agency executive who served on the True North board with Levy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three, four years ago,'' Fallon said, ``Maurice called me and
I wasn't responsive. We didn't even meet. But things were different
at that time.'' Others interested in Fallon McElligott during the
1990s included True North.
</P>
<P>
   Now as then, Fallon said, ``we didn't shop this agency,''
referring to himself and his colleagues who own Fallon McElligott
shares, ``and we didn't hire an investment banker.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he added, ``we met someone we felt understood who we
could be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To others, we represent revenue. To Maurice, we represent a
world of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   That is symbolized by Levy's decision to make Fallon McElligott
the second Publicis worldwide agency network, a resource he has
long coveted. Larger rivals like the Interpublic Group of
Companies, the Omnicom Group and the WPP Group operate two or three
global networks, which maximize growth opportunities by minimizing
the potential for client conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said he might transfer some Publicis Worldwide holdings to
Fallon McElligott, but Fallon said his ``inclination is toward
starting from scratch, building 10 or 12 great offices in 10 or 12
world business centers.'' The agency's London and New York outposts
have proved successful, landing clients like the BBC, Etour,
Georgia-Pacific, the MTV unit of Viacom and the Skoda unit of
Volkswagen.

Miller Lite beer, from Miller Brewing Co. Miller dismissed Fallon
McElligott after its offbeat campaign, once centered on an
imaginary adman character named Dick, upset wholesalers and failed
to increase sales. Fallon McElligott held onto the United account
after agreeing to replace an unusual campaign, which carried the
theme ``Rising,'' with more conventional ads.
</P>
<P>
   Billings for Publicis last year were estimated at $6.7 billion,
from clients like British Airways, Coca-Cola, the Saturn division
of General Motors, L'Oreal, Nestle , Sara Lee and Whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   Publicis will pay for Fallon McElligott with cash on hand and
debt; the deal is to close by mid-March. Publicis shares closed at
517 euros ($502) in trading yesterday in Paris, up 48 euros, or
10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With this deal, the ranks of the big creative endents have
dwindled to a handful of holdouts like Deutsch Inc. and Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he planned more acquisitions, Levy said: ``Yes, we do.
You draw up your own list and we'll compare the next time I'm in
New York.''

CLOSINGS PLANNED TO HELP MEET KC SCHOOL DISTRICT BUDGET SHORTFALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas City School
District could close as many as six schools next fall, consolidate
or eliminate seven magnet themes and redraw attendance boundaries
to meet an estimated $22 million budget shortfall.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A budget proposal given to school board members this week also
calls for cutting employee benefits, selling nearly a dozen vacant
or leased buildings and eliminating some bus routes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the cuts were needed to offset the anticipated
loss of $18 million in state revenue to charter schools and the $4
million cost of a 3 percent teacher salary increase approved this
week. A district administrator warned the board Tuesday that the
budget shortfall could swell to $31 million if another 20 charters
being discussed were to open.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended cuts only total $14.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Board members are scheduled to publicly discuss the proposals at
their meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The district also will hold three public hearings to discuss
budget issues. Those hearings will start at 6:30 p.m. on Feb. 22,
23 and 24. The Feb. 22 hearing will be at Central High School, the
Feb. 23 hearing at Paseo High School and the Feb. 24 hearing at Van
Horn High School.
</P>
<P>
   District spokesman David Smith declined to comment Wednesday on
the proposed cuts, saying it would be inappropriate before the
administration had discussed them with the board.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members reached Wednesday said they had yet to review
the proposals or needed more information before commenting. At
least two _ Sandy Mayer and Lance Loewenstein _ said they supported
the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a whole lot of sense _ good economic sense,'' Mayer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are designed to relieve overcrowding at Van Horn and
Southeast high schools, foster more community ownership and parent
involvement and allow more siblings to attend school together. The
changes also would cut the time and distance some students spend on
buses, reduce transportation costs and ease driver shortages.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes also could require the district to adjust
school-bell times, reassign thousands of students to different
schools and require nearly 2,000 high school students who ride a
district bus to find their own transportation. Changes also could
create student attendance and tardiness problems.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Elma Warrick said she was concerned the
recommendations were a piecemeal approach to solving the district's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the actions that we take should be tied to a bigger
plan, and I'm still waiting for (Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr.)
to produce that long-range strategic plan,'' Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Fifi Wiedeman said she was pleased that none of the
proposals would take effect until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the best part is we're planning this far in advance,''
Wiedeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Board President John Rios said he expected the recommendations
to prompt heated discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never pleasant when you're going to take someone's money
away,'' Rios said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for consolidating Marlborough Elementary
School, an investigative learning magnet, into Cook and Hartman
elementary schools, which offer the same theme. The district could
close Marlborough or offer other district programs in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Fairmount Elementary School would be closed. Students wishing to
continue in the foreign language theme would be offered seats at
Longan Elementary School and the Foreign Language Academy.
Neighborhood students who do not choose to continue in the theme
would be assigned to Mount Washington, Trailwoods or Sugar Creek
elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   The applied learning magnet theme now offered at Volker and
Swinney elementary schools would be combined at Swinney. Volker
would be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the visual and performing arts theme at Phillips
Elementary School would be moved to Longfellow or Meservey
elementary schools, which offer the same theme. Phillips would be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative education program at Anderson Middle School
would be moved to Manual High School, and Anderson would be closed.
The proposal sets aside more than $2.5 million for a districtwide
alternative program being developed. The district soon will seek
proposals from private entities to provide the service.
</P>
<P>
   The district also would close Bancroft Elementary School, which
is temporarily housed in the former Nichols Elementary School. The
Nichols building would be sold. Bancroft students would be
reassigned to Bryant, Graceland and Troost elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Loewenstein said those schools identified for closure lacked the
parental and staff support needed to survive in a newly competitive
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charter school kids are coming out of the schools that are
closing, in my opinion,'' Loewenstein said. ``It shows the system
does work. If a school doesn't work, it will be shut down. It's the
truest indication of school reform the district's ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for converting two environmental science
magnets _ Trailwoods Elementary School and Nowlin Middle School _
into neighborhood schools, to cut transportation costs and create
seats needed for students living in the northern part of the
district. Both schools would offer their magnet-theme activities.
Converting Trailwoods to a neighborhood school also would reduce
overcrowding at James, Gladstone and McCoy elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Both Northeast and Central high schools would be converted to
neighborhood schools, to reduce the number of Northeast area
students bused to Van Horn High School and the number of midtown
students bused to Van Horn and Southeast High School. Central, a
computer magnet high school, would retain more than $300,000 of its
magnet funding to maintain its technology. Northeast, a law, public
service and military science magnet, would retain more than
$200,000 of its magnet funding.
</P>
<P>
   Students wishing to remain in converted schools could do so, but
would be responsible for their own transportation. Eleventh-grade
students at Central and Northeast who are eligible to graduate next
school year may continue at those schools with district-provided
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for cutting the administrative budget,
utility costs, selling a dozen vacant or leased buildings and
moving some administrative offices to the closed Southwest High
School. District officials said they were considering plans to
convert part of Southwest into a staff training facility. And the
district still is negotiating with the Southwest Charter School,
which wants to lease part of the Brookside area building.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for reducing the amount of vacation and
sick leave employees can accrue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been told we weren't going to like the package coming
down the road,'' said Teachers Union President Judy Morgan, who had
yet to see the proposals. ``We figured the district was going to
try some of these kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said the leave benefits were part of the union's
negotiated contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be something we would be fighting to keep,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Loewenstein said he expected the recommended cuts to generate
less controversy than school closings and budget cuts of recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem very draconian,'' he said. ``I think this is a
fairly mild approach to a major problem.''

EDITORIAL: BUSH AND FREE ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 3: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a few months ago, New York's Republican leadership figured
that rigging the state's primary election for George W. Bush was a
smart, tough political move. But according to reports in The Times
Thursday, Bush strategists have decided that the ballot trickery
endorsed by Gov. George Pataki is working against them and playing
into Sen. John McCain's image as a reformer who does not have to be
protected from competition by the party establishment. So one of
the side effects of McCain's upset victory in New Hampshire is that
New York Republicans may now be able to vote in an open election
featuring a full slate of Republican presidential candidates in the
March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   In his palmy days as an untested front-runner, Bush made the
mistake of defending the unfair election laws that Pataki and
William Powers, the state GOP. chairman, were using to keep McCain
off the ballot in more than a third of New York's 31 congressional
districts. Now, worried Bush strategists are hoping that Judge
Edward Korman of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn will bail them out
with a court order that puts McCain and other candidates on the
ballot statewide. The emerging game plan seems to be that Pataki
would then order state party lawyers not to appeal any such ruling
by Korman.
</P>
<P>
   Korman, who has shown a laudable sensitivity to voting rights,
seems to be considering several options. He could lower the number
of signatures required of the candidates. He could allow for more
time to collect signatures, a move that might give McCain and
perhaps even Alan Keyes another chance to compete in every
congressional district statewide. Or he could simply rule
unconstitutional the complicated laws that violate New Yorkers'
voting rights and then amend the rules to allow the leading
candidates on the ballots. After all, the rules are so twisted that
in one district they may even bump Bush off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   One remarkable feature of New York politics is the degree to
which Republican members of Congress accept these ballot laws that
erase the voting rights of their constituents. Rep. Peter King, for
example, says that the two places in the world where the government
is trying to bump candidates off ballots are New York state and
Iran. Even King, however, says he is not protesting directly to the
state's Republican leadership. Reps. John Sweeney of Clifton Park,
Jack Quinn of Buffalo and James Walsh of Syracuse think the rules
are the rules, equally bad for all and thus, somehow, fair. Reps.
John McHugh of Watertown and Thomas Reynolds of Springville are
apparently so cowed by Powers and Pataki that they declined through
aides to comment on the restricted ballot. A bolder Republican,
Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island, decried the system but said it is
too late to change the rules for this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too late, of course. Albany does not even have to wait
for Korman to clean up their mess. Joseph Bruno, the state Senate
majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, could
offer a new law that opens the ballot to all recognized
presidential contenders. At the same time, Pataki could order the
party lawyers to work with the court in keeping candidates on the
ballot instead of bumping them off.
</P>
<P>
   There really is no reason to waste party money on any further
appeals or ballot challenges now that Bush and his strategists have
decided that the Texas governor needs to show that he can run on
his own two feet in New York. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore chose a dramatic way
Wednesday to demonstrate his support for abortion rights, diverting
his campaign from New York to race back to Washington to be on hand
for a possible tie vote in the Senate, jumping on a commercial
flight (with an aide ferrying the nation's nuclear codes) for the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, his vote was not needed. But that was only
because Republicans realized that the Democrats had outfoxed them,
and they gave up rather than allow Gore to showcase himself on a
matter that has tripped him up in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver whipped up a whirlwind detour in Gore's already
overloaded campaign schedule, producing one of the more bizarre
24-hour periods in this primary season.
</P>
<P>
   After winning in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, Gore flew at
midnight from Manchester to New York. He held a 30-second rally on
the frigid tarmac at La Guardia Airport at 1 a.m. Wednesday,
motorcaded into Manhattan for two hours of sleep, hit a round of
morning television shows at 6 a.m., rushed to Grand Central
Terminal to greet commuters, received a cell-phone call from
Washington that the Senate could be deadlocked, sped back to
LaGuardia to take the 9 a.m. USAirways shuttle, presided over the
Senate at 10:30 a.m., motorcaded to Andrews Air Force Base two
hours later, flew to an afternoon rally in Columbus, Ohio, then
flew to Los Angeles Wednesday night for a town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The question arose: Was this necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, said Democrats. A cheap stunt, said Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was on an amendment to a bankruptcy bill that would bar
people convicted of crimes against abortion clinics from bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday morning, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic leader, alerted Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chairman,
that they would need Gore to break the tie.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had arrived in New York on Air Force 2 but could not take
it back because the crew, expecting to leave later for Ohio, was
still at a Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   By 11:45 a.m., Gore was holding a news conference/pep rally in
the Capitol, flanked by more than a dozen Senate Democrats and
female representatives, as well as Kate Michelman, an
abortion-rights advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his decision to come to Washington reflected a
need to shore up his credentials on an issue on which former Sen.
Bill Bradley had challenged him, Gore answered curtly, ``It did
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Gore took his place in the president's chair in
the Senate chamber _ and Republicans, fully aware of how Gore has
exploited his tiebreaking vote in favor of a gun-control measure
last year, decided to deny him another opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the morning, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, had led the
charge against the amendment. But after Gore's theatrical arrival,
Hatch said: ``It's clear from today's debate that nobody in the
Congress supports violence at abortion clinics.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Hatch announced that he, Sen. Trent Lott, the
majority leader, and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who was the
bill's main sponsor, were recommending that Republicans vote for
the amendment. The amendment then passed lopsidedly, 80-17,
rendering Gore useless.

FOREIGN AID DONORS APPROVE $4.7 BILLION MORE FOR INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ International donors meeting in Jakarta gave
Indonesia's government a powerful show of support Wednesday,
agreeing to provide as much as $4.7 billion in credit to fill a
shortage in the nation's budget and keep its tenuous economic
recovery alive.
</P>
<P>
   The support, pledged as part of a $43 billion economic rescue
package being overseen by the International Monetary Fund, was
provided by members of the Consultative Group on Indonesia, an
umbrella organization of the World Bank and several foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   It is contingent on Indonesia's cooperation in stamping out what
is seen as rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The expression of support came at a critical time for the
government of President Abdurrahman Wahid. He is seeking to pull
Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country, out of
economic crisis and to assert civilian control over the previously
dominant military. Regional separatism and military resentment
threaten to divide the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who arrived in the Netherlands Wednesday on an official
visit, is waging a risky campaign to solidify control over his
three-month-old administration. He is facing resistance by the
former armed forces chief and now security minister, Gen. Wiranto,
whom the president has demanded resign. Despite that, the general
attended an Indonesian Cabinet meeting Wednesday. Wahid, questioned
in Europe, said his authority remained intact and he had ``no
personal enemies'' at home.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank's vice president for East Asia, Jean-Michel
Severino, seemed largely positive. ``There is a new sense of
optimism that Indonesia can indeed resume the path of real
development,'' he said, ``and yet events in the past six months
have shown us that stability is fragile and that optimism without
sound action and steady progress can quickly fade. The
international community has signaled its willingness to support the
new government's economic recovery program. The test of Indonesia's
resolve and the benchmark for international donor support will be
the pace of implementation of this program.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Wahid's government introduced a budget that forecast
3.8 percent economic growth this year but a deficit from April
through December of 5 percent of the gross domestic product. It
hopes to raise half that by selling state-owned assets as well as
those taken over from banks and their debtors.
</P>
<P>
   The rest will come from the consultative group's members _ most
from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and from Japan,
Indonesia's largest single creditor.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, said the
consultative group's loans had been linked to progress in settling
a case last year involving the misappropriation of government funds
to Bank Bali and to the prosecution of the former president,
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the World Bank said Indonesia had agreed to
present a program that included ``judicial and legal reforms,
actions to reduce leakage and waste in aid-financed activities, and
pilot programs for governance reforms in one or two key
ministries.'' The statement also said Indonesia had agreed to
promote conservation of its forests and to take action against
illegal logging.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The World Bank created the consultative group in 1992 to replace
a 24-year-old, Dutch-led intergovernmental group on Indonesia after
Suharto refused aid from the Netherlands in response to Dutch
criticism over the 1991 killing of anti-Indonesian activists in
East Timor. Months after receiving $4.95 billion in aid from the
new consultative group, Suharto's government arrested the Timorese
rebel leader, Jose Alexandre Gusmao. He was released last fall,
more than a year after Suharto resigned.
</P>
<P>
   More embarrassing to international donors was the widespread
``leakage'' of aid funds from projects, a euphemism for official
corruption. The latest consultative group meeting committed the new
government to plugging the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   But the attorney general told local reporters this week that
international donors had to take some responsibility for the
problem. Once Indonesia's crisis erupted, World Bank officials
began to admit that the nation's long economic success had
persuaded them to overlook the corruption in the regime to which
they were lending.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Schwarz, author of ``A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia's
Search for Stability,'' said, ``You have a lot of people in Jakarta
unhappy, and who think the World Bank should take responsibility
for the large-scale leakage of their loans.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, at least 2,000 demonstrators gathered outside the
central bank in Jakarta, where the consultative group meeting was
being held, demanding that Indonesia refuse further foreign loans.
They demanded that international donors cancel some of the
government's roughly $77 billion in foreign debt. Government debt
amounts to more than 90 percent of Indonesia's output; roughly 60
percent of the budget goes to servicing that debt.
</P>
<P>
   While Indonesia hopes to reschedule $2.2 billion in loans with
foreign donors to take pressure off the budget, it is not eligible
for debt forgiveness under rules established by the World Bank or
the informal grouping of international creditors known as the Paris
Club, according to the World Bank's Indonesia economist, Vikram
Nehru.
</P>
<P>
   With $69 billion in assets it wants to sell, a current-account
surplus and growing exports, Indonesia's budget problems can be
solved by steadfast cash-flow management, economists say.
``Indonesia has got to manage its debt by raising revenues and
managing expenditures,'' Nehru said. ``And it will have to do so
for a decade.''

GIL KANE, 73, PIONEERING COMIC-BOOK ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gil Kane, a comic-book artist who infused the Atom, Green
Lantern and other characters with vibrant new life even as his own
artistic aspirations propelled him to draw comic books of Wagnerian
operas, died Jan. 31 at a hospital in Miami. He was 73 and lived in
Aventura, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lymphoma, said his wife, Elaine.
</P>
<P>
   Known for the kinetic quality of his compositions, the
self-taught artist represented an integral part of the
resuscitation of superheroes in the 1960s, an era known as ``the
silver age'' of comic books. He gave dynamic new interpretations to
the Hulk, Captain Marvel and Spider-Man, and is often compared with
Jack Kirby, who died in 1994 and is generally considered the
greatest comic-book artist.
</P>
<P>
   Kane drew tens of thousands of pages of superheroes for DC and
Marvel comics, as well as dozens of smaller companies. It was a
never-ending grind: comic-book artists, almost always freelance,
were paid by the piece and received no benefits. Just two weeks
before his death, Kane continued to crank out comic books.
</P>
<P>
   But he elevated the form to new levels. He was a superlative
figure drawer, said Gary Groth, editor of The Comics Journal, a
monthly trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Levitz, executive vice president and publisher of DC
Comics, pointed to Kane's much-imitated manner of breaking away
from standard boxes to draw much bigger, more dramatic
illustrations. ``He was a young radical,'' Levitz said, ``and to
his death he was still on the edge of what was being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Lee, a legend in the comics world, chairman emeritus of
Marvel and creator of Spider-Man and other superheroes, said he
loved working with Kane. ``I would just give him a rough idea of
what I wanted and turn him loose,'' he said. ``He was fast, he was
dependable, he had great storytelling sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1990 review in The New York Times of his comic-book
depiction of Wagner's ``Ring'' cycle, John Rockwell said that Kane
``almost defined the shinily high-tech, extravagantly fanciful,
heavily muscled superhero look.'' Rockwell called the treatment of
the opera ``surprisingly faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   The tall, silver-haired, almost regal man was born Eli Katz in
Latvia on April 6, 1926, and emigrated to New York with his family
when he was 3. His father scrambled to make a living as a poultry
merchant, and Katz dropped out of vocational high school at 15 to
seek work penciling comic books, the first stage of the process.
Some artists would go over his lines in ink, others would add
words, and finally some would add color.
</P>
<P>
   His first job was at MLJ, the publishers of Archie. He took a
job with DC just before going in the Army in 1944. He returned to
DC after the war. The youth, who loved the swashbuckling Errol
Flynn movies and pulp fiction, was working at the dawn of the new
medium. The first comic book is generally said to have been
produced in 1933, with the industry just beginning to pick up speed
in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Kane labored to improve his drawing, practicing human forms
daily. He once said it took him 25 years to perfect the artistic
principles of perspective and figure drawing. ``He said that if you
do it often enough, the hand takes over the brain,'' said his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Kane's breakthrough came in 1959 when he drew an early follow-up
to DC's ``Flash,'' a feature that had been a hit in the '40s. He
then revamped the Green Lantern and the Atom, which resulted in
both winning their own titles. He illustrated them through the
1960s. ``That was the beginning of the resuscitation of
superheroes,'' said Groth.
</P>
<P>
   Kane often chafed at being part of an assembly-line system. He
complained, for example, that the ``inkers'' who went over his
pencil drawing for Green Lantern did not understand the diamond
shape that he intended for the costume. ``They always made it look
like a sleeveless sweater, which bothered me to no end,'' he told
The Asbury Park Press in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kane stayed in the business, going back and forth between the
giants DC and Marvel, with many stops at smaller competitors. At
Marvel, his depictions of Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, Conan
the Barbarian, Captain Marvel, the Avengers and others, drew raves.
</P>
<P>
   But he kept trying to step away from comic-book orthodoxy in
order to work with greater artistic autonomy. He took the somewhat
unusual posture for a visual artist of favoring more, rather than
less, text.
</P>
<P>
   Two products were a James Bond-style illustrated novel he
self-published in 1968. Called ``His Name Is Savage,'' the
exceedingly violent story occupied the whole book, rather than the
8 or 12 pages allowed in a conventional comic book. In 1971 he
published a similar venture, a science fiction thriller called
``Blackmark.'' Kane, who for years worked in Los Angeles, was also
involved in commercials, animated cartoons and set design. But he
never strayed far from comics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked the storytelling and the fantasy,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   Kane is also survived by two sons, Scott of Santa Monica,
Calif., and Eric, of Exeter, N.H.; a daughter, Beverly, of
Hollywood, Fla.; and two granddaughters.

EDITORIAL: PRECAUTIONARY RATE HIKE BY THE FED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Feb. 3: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Federal Reserve acted prematurely Wednesday when it
raised short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point
in order to reduce spending and thereby weaken inflationary
pressures. After all, inflation remains subdued. But the Fed has
evidence on its side, and the support of many experts. Its decision
is reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed stubbornly refuses to disclose the criteria it uses to
decide when to pump more money into the economy to drive interest
rates down, or when to draw money out of the economy to drive
interest rates up. This lack of clarity is the one knock on
Greenspan's otherwise excellent stewardship of the Fed. Many
monetary experts believe that the Fed tries to keep inflation at
about 2 percent a year. Rates much above 2 percent disrupt the
private sector and, because inflation rates can accelerate, could
force the Fed eventually to crack down hard, throwing the economy
into recession. Rates much below 2 percent flirt with setting off
deflation, when prices fall and make it hard for the government to
keep production and jobs from falling alongside.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Greenspan decide to crack down Wednesday? The
inflation rate has been running at almost 3 percent for the last 12
months and even a bit higher for the last six months. Compensation
_ wages plus medical and other fringe benefits _ rose by about 3.5
percent at the end of last year. Both wages and prices were rising
faster at the end of last year than they were at the beginning, a
worrisome trend for the Fed. The Fed also points to a rapid growth
of spending that could cause wages and prices to rise even faster.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the Fed was afraid to let the unemployment
rate fall much below 6 percent lest inflation take off. But under
Greenspan's direction, the Fed mostly sat back as unemployment fell
to close to 4 percent. Inflation hardly budged. There would have
been nothing wrong if the Fed had decided Wednesday to stay put.
But Greenspan judged the risk too high. February marks the 107th
consecutive month on Greenspan's watch that economic output has
risen, the longest uninterrupted growth on record. His judgment
warrants the benefit of anyone's doubts.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Since the beginning of the presidential
campaign, former Sen. Bill Bradley has asserted that his entire
strategy was founded on building toward ``Super Tuesday,'' March 7,
when 16 states, including New York and California, will select
nearly 30 percent of the Democratic Party's presidential delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having lost to Vice President Al Gore in the Iowa caucuses
last week and the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, those upcoming
elections will be a test of whether his insurgent candidacy will
survive.
</P>
<P>
   As he jetted from Connecticut to Manhattan to San Francisco on
Wednesday, Bradley faced numerous questions about his ability not
only to communicate his message, but also to field organizations
that can compete with Gore in a coast-to-coast match over the next
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With as much money as Gore, about $20 million, Bradley's aides
say they can keep pace with Gore in television advertising, a
critical factor in big states like New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   But they acknowledge they will have trouble matching the size
and experience of Gore's field operations, which are run in large
part by the labor unions and elected officials who have endorsed
him.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Bradley campaign, while working feverishly
to establish beachheads in every primary and caucus state, will
focus its resources, and the candidate's precious time, on certain
states where they think Bradley can seriously contest Gore, aides
to Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley provided an indication of what those states will be in
the itinerary for a three-day trip he began Wednesday: Connecticut,
New York, California, Maryland and Florida. All of those states
vote on March 7 except Florida, which holds its primary on March
14. Next week he will stump in New York and California again, as
well as two other Super Tuesday states, Ohio, and Missouri, where
he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, his campaign will be dispatching paid field
organizers to most of those states, as well as to Massachusetts,
Oklahoma and Illinois, campaign officials said. But in most other
states, his campaign will be run largely by volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, the Bradley workers, many of whom are working in
their first presidential campaign, will be pitted against seasoned
organizers from the AFL-CIO or local Democratic organizations.
While Bradley has won the support of elected officials, much of his
support is coming from political novices or former officials who no
longer lead the kinds of political operations that can call voters,
distribute literature and organize media events.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent Wednesday when Bradley addressed a large and
enthusiastic crowd in a Greenwich Village church, where the
best-known politicians on stage had left politics years ago,
including former Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's aides assert that they will be able to place
experienced field operatives in every important state. More
important, they argued, the compressed primary schedule this year
in which over half of the delegates will be chosen in March, has
created a new dynamic where traditional get-out-the-vote operations
will be less important than television commercials and news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the aides said, they will not be counting on
their state organizations to do the kind of painstaking political
work that went on in Iowa and New Hampshire, namely identifying
swing voters and getting them to the polls. Instead, their
organizations will be dispatched mainly to amplify Bradley's
message through phone calls, literature and media events.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides also acknowledge that he will try to sharpen his
message and enliven his stump style in the coming weeks to win over
more traditional Democratic voters. Exit polls of voters in New
Hampshire showed that Bradley showed strong support among young
people, men, well-educated and affluent voters. But Gore won
handily among lower-income voters and women, the core of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   To win over those loyal party members, Bradley will work harder
at animating his daily stump speeches as well as drawing clearer
contrasts with Gore, including by continuing his attacks on the
vice president's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, for instance, Bradley sought to put Gore on the
defensive by demanding that he apologize for an incident on Sunday
when, according to Bradley's aides, a crowd of Gore campaign
workers shouted insults and threw mud at Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.,
who is supporting Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said those workers called Kerrey, who lost his foot in
Vietnam, a cripple. Gore has denied that anyone from his campaign
used that word.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem with the campaign that has an attitude that
allows these kinds of things to happen and then not to take
responsibility for them,'' Bradley said at a news conference
outside his speech in Manhattan. ``I think the American people
deserve somebody who's going to take responsibility for the actions
of those he's leading.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said, ``the Gore campaign is
not aware of anyone using that kind of language. Any such language
would not be condoned.''
</P>
<P>
   In television interviews Wednesday morning, Bradley also
acknowledged that his campaign would try to respond faster to
criticisms from the Gore campaign against his record and campaign
agenda, saying he felt that his campaign would be ``smarter and
better'' after its two losses.

DEFENSE AND SHARPTON CARRY THE SPARRING OUTDOORS  
 OVERFLOW CROWD EXPRESSES OPINIONS   
 LIGHT, SHADOW AND SHUTTER SPEED  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For every battle in the courtroom, it appears
there will be another outside: between defense lawyers,
specifically Stephen C. Worth, and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently with the support of the Diallo family, and to the ire
of defense lawyers, Sharpton has been offering political and legal
commentary on the trial at recesses and at the end of each day. And
he and Worth have taken to accusing each other of playing racial
politics at every available opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he lambasted the defense, and Worth in particular, for
trying to keep blacks off the jury and then taking credit for a
diverse jury after the judge insisted that two of the black jurors
stay on.
</P>
<P>
   Worth then called Sharpton disingenuous for saying he had never
made race a factor in the case, a comment that so outraged Sharpton
that he went back to the microphones to take a second shot.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Sharpton accused the defense of trying to bash the
Bronx and blame Diallo for his own death. ``Worth keeps pulling the
race card,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he seized on the fact that James J. Culleton, the lawyer for
Officer Richard Murphy, said in his opening statement that Murphy
had never fired his gun and had never had a civilian complaint
filed against him. The defendants' prior acts are not admissible
unless the defendants bring them up themselves, and Sharpton said
that Culleton's statement meant that the record of the other three
defendants _ all of whom were involved in previous shootings _
could now be brought up.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers disagreed, saying that Culleton was speaking
only for his client.
</P>
<P>
   As Sharpton left what has become the staging area for post-trial
commentary _ a penned-in area for reporters outside the courthouse
_ he passed Worth. ``I didn't attack you tonight, Worth,'' Sharpton
said Wednesday. ``You're having a good night.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth replied: ``You may not have a good night. I'm not done
yet.'' He headed for the microphones, and responded to a question
about whether the prosecution was using race: ``I think Al Sharpton
is playing the race card, and he is trying to turn it around on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Overflow Crowd Expresses Opinions
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of protesters have not materialized, but about 50
people from New York City came here Wednesday in a bus chartered by
the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network. They were seated in
an overflow courtroom that had with two large-screen television
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Court officers had explained that although no judge was present,
the overflow courtroom was to be treated like a regular courtroom,
with no talking, no responding to testimony, no reading of
newspapers and the like. But the visitors arrived after the
instructions, and there were some catcalls from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   When Bennett M. Epstein, a lawyer for Officer Sean Carroll,
described his client's trying to resuscitate Diallo and saying,
``Don't die,'' the crowd groaned. Court officers quickly stepped in
to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   After a lunchtime prayer vigil, the New York City contingent
drifted back in, with several nodding off _ and one snoring _
during the afternoon testimony. At 3 p.m., word spread that the bus
was leaving for New York, and the overflow courtroom emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Light, Shadow and Shutter Speed
</P>
<P>
   A photography critic would have had a field day in the
courtroom. Much of the back and forth with Detective Joseph
Flannino of the Crime Scene Unit involved the reality photographs
capture. The prosecution is arguing that the street was well
lighted; the defense, that it was not. So defense lawyers tried to
show that crime scene photos of the street, taken with a flash,
distorted the light conditions. They asked Flannino what kind of
camera he had used (a Nikon 35), how his flash was powered
(battery), and more.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Patten, a lawyer for Officer Sean Carroll, pointed to a
photo in which two street lights brightly illuminate the street and
give the blacktop a yellow cast. ``By the way, do you ever see a
yellow street at night in the city of New York?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not often, no,'' Flannino replied.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over darkness and distortion continued for several
more rounds of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``No photo exactly matches what the human eye should see,
right?'' Worth asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say all photos might have some distortion,'' the
detective, who had been on the stand for more than four hours,
agreed.

UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT HOCKEY SEASON CANCELED AFTER ALLEGATIONS OF
SEVERE HAZING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ This cold college town is warmed in the winter
by hockey heat, and nobody knew it better than Corey LaTulippe. He
was the only member of the Vermont Catamounts who was actually born
here, and he grew up in a nearby suburb. A goalie, LaTulippe's
boyhood ambition was to play for the university.
</P>
<P>
   But his college career lasted only a few weeks into his freshman
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to LaTulippe, he and some teammates were subjected to
severe hazing that included coerced drinking and party pranks of an
explicit and degrading sexual nature. LaTulippe quit school soon
after and filed a lawsuit against the university whose effects are
still reverberating at the school and in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The governor demanded action after the details of LaTulippe's
accusations became public. The state attorney general started an
investigation and is expected to announce his findings Thursday.
And when it became clear that veteran hockey players had lied
during an earlier investigation of the hazing, the university
president took a bold and striking step: she canceled the college
hockey season with two months to go.
</P>
<P>
   Few actions could stir emotions here as much as the elimination
of Vermont hockey from the winter calendar. In its absence a
reasoned but passionate debate has roiled the state, from the
governor's office to the youth league rinks where children learn
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues being discussed are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The dangers of hazing, a common but controversial practice in
college sports. LaTulippe's lawyers say that, among other things,
the freshmen being hazed were forced to wear women's panties, dip
their genitals in beer and parade without clothing through the
house in an ``elephant walk'' in which they moved in a line while
gripping each other's private parts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The concept of team solidarity and the powerful hold it has on
the Vermont players, even as some of them acknowledge individual
doubts about it.
</P>
<P>
   _ The response of university officials to LaTulippe's initial
complaints and subsequent lawsuit. Critics say the university moved
slowly and discreetly, trying to keep the incident quiet.
Administrators cited federal privacy laws regarding students; since
then, the university has expressed a different interpretation of
its policy regarding those laws.
</P>
<P>
   _ The intervention of Vermont's governor, Howard Dean, who
demanded action by the university, and the state's attorney
general, William Sorrell, who conducted an investigation. The
team's players believe state and university officials are making an
example of them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The motivation of LaTulippe, who was the team's fourth-string
goalie, in danger of being cut, and whose lawyer at one point asked
for a $350,000 settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While the NCAA said it keeps no formal records on seasons
canceled by hazing, Kent University canceled its 1988-89 hockey
season when a preseason hazing incident left a player hospitalized
with a reaction to alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   University of Vermont officials said they hoped that their
experience this season would enlighten other schools about the
dangers and consequences of hazing. But in the short term, some
people are fearing for their jobs and worrying about criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's head's going to roll,'' said Mike Gilligan, the
veteran head coach who warned his players in September against
hazing. ``It's not pretty for anybody. People got hurt. Supporters,
parents and friends got embarrassed. The whole country can learn a
lesson from this.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It all took place in this small, bustling city next to Lake
Champlain and surrounded by mountains. Burlington is the
headquarters of the Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream company and it is known
for a lively rock music scene. In one recent national survey,
Burlington finished first as the most livable city in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Just 40 miles south of the Quebec border, Burlington embraces
winter and its sports. In a recent seven-day period, the
temperature reached 12 degrees below zero and the ground was
covered by about a foot of fresh, powdery snow. A story on a local
newscast told of a moose running loose on residential streets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, some citizens would have joined the capacity
crowd at Gutterson Field House for the Cats games.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The team reached the Final Four in 1996 and has sent several
players to the NHL. But the Cats season ended in mid-January
because of events that began even before the colorful fall foliage.
Jim Gernander, a junior defenseman, said: ``This thing has had a
snowball effect. It started out small and now it is overpowering
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The first figurative flurries fell on Aug. 31, when players
began preseason practice led by the team's captains. According to
LaTulippe's lawyers, LaTulippe's credit card was used without his
consent by a team captain. Older players forced him to patronize a
local bar, although, at 19, he was too young to drink legally. He
and other freshmen players were forced to wake up in the middle of
September nights, drink shots of hard liquor and run nude outside.
LaTulippe was told repeatedly that he would have sexual intercourse
with a sheep, and veteran players told him of drinking and sexual
pranks that would occur on ``the big night.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of what might happen, LaTulippe contacted a lawyer, who
communicated LaTulippe's concerns to a school lawyer on Sept. 13.
Three days later, LaTulippe spoke to an assistant athletic director
at a hotel near the campus. According to documents released by the
university, the school official, Jeff Schulman, told LaTulippe that
it ``took a lot of guts to come forward.'' Schulman and athletic
director Rick Farnham spoke with other players individually, and
the coach met with the players in a group to send the same message:
No hazing allowed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A veteran player who had previously experienced hazing was
Andrew Allen, a junior goalie who said he disapproved of it. Allen
sensed that the tone of the warnings was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely did something different this year,'' he said.
``That stuck in my mind, like, `Listen, something's probably going
on, and we shouldn't do this.''' Allen said he told the team
captains of his concern.
</P>
<P>
   But LaTulippe's lawyers say that he and the other freshmen were
told to arrive at a house party on Oct. 2 wearing women's thong
panties over shaven pubic hair and to paint their fingernails and
toenails. They were made to eat fish pie, pass chewed bread from
mouth to mouth, dip their penises into glasses of beer while
performing push-ups in the nude, and perform the elephant walk.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the new players were required to shower, dress and
lay on the floor with hockey socks over their heads, while naked
female strippers crawled over them. ``The freshmen were told the
strippers were male,'' the suit charges, ``but they later learned
the strippers were female.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kehoe, one of LaTulippe's lawyers, described the initiation
rituals as ``really dripping with homoerotica'' and said that they
traumatized LaTulippe.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days later, after a scrimmage, LaTulippe was told by his
coach that he was the fourth-best goalie and that the team would
carry only three. He was also told that he might practice
occasionally, that he could be added to the roster if a position
opened and that he could try out next season.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of October, one of LaTulippe's lawyers wrote to the
university president, Judith Ramaley, detailing many of his hazing
accusations, telling of LaTulippe's decision to leave school and
suggesting a financial settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In early November, the university made a crucial decision to
investigate the allegations through an outside law firm. School
officials said they had wanted to ascertain all the facts through
neutral investigators. But critics contend that the university was
trying to keep the incident as quiet as possible and avoid the
normal university discipline process.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gustafson, a university vice president, said, ``We wanted
to get to the truth; we just didn't know what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Kehoe said, however, that ``the university didn't follow its own
procedures or its own expectations of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   When interviewed by the outside lawyers, the players were not
under oath and they denied many of LaTulippe's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 8, after a request from a university lawyer for more
testimony from LaTulippe, one of his lawyers replied in a letter to
the university's associate general counsel that a settlement of
$350,000 would be necessary. No payment was made; no interview was
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the financial request, Ritchie Berger, a university
lawyer, said: ``UVM doesn't give in to that type of tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's own chief of police services, Gary J. Margolis,
contacted a university lawyer by e-mail on Nov. 12. He told the
lawyer, Pamela Heatlie, that he had been contacted by the local
newspaper, The Burlington Free Press, about hazing and ``rumors of
criminal activity.'' In the e-mail, one of the documents released
by the university, the chief urged the lawyer to discuss the matter
with him. ``We wouldn't want to ruin the criminal case and be
accused of botching/covering up the incident,'' Margolis wrote. But
the university shared no information with either campus or city
police, citing federal privacy regulations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The school's investigation concluded in late November, and its
findings were mentioned in a Nov. 26 memo from Gilligan that said
``each member of the team violated at least one of the team rules
against hazing,'' among other things. Gilligan instituted a plan of
one-game suspensions of all players, on a rotating basis, along
with probationary status and other sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys did something they thought was fine team building,''
Gilligan said, ``and it ends up blowing up in their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   LaTulippe filed suit on Dec. 10, alleging, among other things,
violation of civil rights, negligent supervision, assault and
battery and invasion of privacy. He sought compensatory and
punitive damages, and costs. Dean said he had read the details in
the next day's newspapers and called Sorrell, the state's attorney
general, to discuss them. Dean, a member of the university's board
of trustees, attended an executive session on Dec. 11 and urged
further action. The school then asked the attorney general to
investigate. Three days later, Dean talked publicly of ``serious
allegations'' and a ``crisis of confidence'' at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrell said his office ``would look at the issue of what the
university knew and when it knew it, and what the university did
and when it did it.''
</P>
<P>
   By early January, players were testifying before the attorney
general. They provided more details and some changed their stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to lie under oath,'' the junior goalie Allen
said. ``We may as well come clean.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When word of this reached the university, Ramaley, the
university president, ended the season on Jan. 14 _ with 15 games
left. ``We have received credible information which indicates that
a number of players were not completely truthful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, in an interview on Jan. 22, said: ``I support very
much the cancellation of the season. I'm a huge hockey fan. My son
and daughter play hockey. I'm a big fan of the UVM program. It's
very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   LaTulippe is playing junior hockey in Rochester. His lawyers
declined requests for an interview with him. In the lawsuit, the
lawyers said LaTulippe had suffered severe emotional distress,
including depression, anxiety and sleeplessness, because of the
hazing.
</P>
<P>
   Many hockey players and fans are dismayed over the cancellation
of the season and what they consider a gross overreaction to
routine initiation high jinks
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never do anything to hurt our own teammate,'' said
Kevin Karlander, a senior forward who is the team's captain and a
defendant in LaTulippe's suit. ``The governor made a political move
to end our season so he could say `Hazing will not be allowed.' The
governor? The attorney general? Are you kidding me? It's a college!
We're getting hung out to dry. We're being made an example of.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the players' critics, including the governor, are
dismayed that they feel this way. ``That, unfortunately, means that
the message hasn't gotten through,'' Dean said. ``This kind of
behavior is not appropriate. A number of people in the state think
boys will be boys. That's a 1950s mentality. This is as good a
place as any to stop it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When students returned in late January for the winter semester,
Karlander said they looked at him and talked in muted voices.
``It's nerve-racking,'' said Karlander, whose father, Al Karlander,
played in the NHL ``It's stressful. It's confusing. I don't even go
to class. I don't sleep well at night. I have nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Vermont hockey program is not the only one
struggling to confront hazing. A survey of NCAA schools released
last summer by Alfred University estimated that 80 percent of
athletes underwent some form of hazing, and that one in five
athletes was subjected to ``unacceptable and potentially illegal
hazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kidnapped, beaten or tied up and abandoned,'' the
survey reported. ``Two-thirds were subjected to humiliating hazing.
These athletes _ overwhelmingly men _ found themselves deeply
immersed in a culture of hazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazing on the hockey team has been a tradition at Vermont for
several years, LaTulippe's lawyers said. Allen, 23, and one of the
oldest players on the team, confirmed this. Having experienced
hazing when he played junior hockey in Canada, Allen said he had
gone along with it, although he didn't approve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with it, and I don't think it should happen
anywhere,'' Allen said. ``We know it was wrong, and we know we made
a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But Allen also explained why he attended the initiation,
briefly, and chose not to demand a stop to the activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team sport and a team game,'' he said. ``You go along
with your team and what the team decides to do and you support that
no matter what. You don't want to upset the team chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the veteran players do not think they owe LaTulippe
an apology. ``He went against anything that I've ever believed in a
team sport,'' Allen said. ``There definitely is resentment toward
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are skeptical about the university's decision to
allow the players to continue to hold regular practice at the
school rink. But university officials said that keeping the players
in school _ on scholarships and on ice for practice _ was
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an educational institution, not a correctional
facility,'' Ramaley said. ``It's a matter of emotion and heart and
soul. This is adversity, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlander, the team captain, takes a more cynical view. ``If
they would have thrown people out of school, they would have had to
get rid of the hockey program,'' Karlander said. ``I don't think
any player would have been willing to come here after seeing a
university kind of turn on its student-athletes to that extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another player named in the suit, Matt Sanders, has left school
and has joined a minor league professional team. Karlander said
others are considering that or transferring to other colleges. He
and other players spoke late one afternoon at the rink. They took
the ice, along with members of the women's team, to skate with
local schoolchildren in an annual event to promote respect for
authority and to discourage substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Under the eyes and smiles of local police officers, who stood
alongside the rink boards, the athletes skated with the children.
The female players wore their team jerseys and seemed animated, but
the male players, wearing jackets or sweatshirts in the team color
of green, seemed tentative at first. Some gradually joined in the
fun, a few playing tag and shouting with the children as the group
flowed in long laps, counterclockwise around the ice. For a brief
time, they all seemed like kids at play, skating on a frozen pond
on a winter day.

MARKET PLACE: INVESTORS GREET FED RATE INCREASE WITH A YAWN
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS stock prices in 11th graf) 
 (With FED-RATES and graphic) 
(rk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who's afraid of the Federal Reserve? Not Wall Street,
it would appear.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's fourth increase in interest rates since
last summer was greeted by investors with a collective yawn
Wednesday. Stock and bond prices rose before the announcement and
then bounced around within relatively narrow bands. By the end of
the day, stock prices were mixed while bond prices were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was more restrained than those that followed two of
the three increases last year. Then stock prices soared as
investors concluded _ wrongly, as it turned out _ that the Fed was
through with increases. This time the Fed's statement warned of
``inflationary imbalances'' and hinted strongly that at least one
more rate increase was coming.
</P>
<P>
   If so, one might ask, why not do it now and get it over with?
``If they did everything at once, the markets would rally,'' said
Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist of Merrill Lynch. ``By doing
this Chinese-water-torture effect, the Fed keeps the markets off
guard. It wants the markets to help slow down the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Off guard the markets may be. Worried they are not. There was a
time when the Fed's rate actions were viewed as crucial, and the
saying ``three steps and a stumble'' was well known. It meant that
if the Fed raised interest rates three times, stock prices would
probably fall. But the Fed's raises last year did not slay the
bull, and fear of the Fed seems to be waning.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Wednesday's meeting of the Fed's Open Market
Committee, the consensus forecast had been that the Fed would raise
rates a quarter-percentage point, but some had thought a half-point
increase was possible. Now there is a general expectation that the
Fed will raise rates again in March, and some think it will do so
again in May.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an expectation that the Fed won't stop there, said
Dan Bernstein, the research director of Bridgewater Associates, a
money management firm. The September Fed funds contract closed
Wednesday at 6.575 percent _ much higher than the rate of 5.75
percent that the Fed set Wednesday. That level suggests at least
three more tightenings. But the prospect is not alarming investors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the evidence is that the Fed's previous three rate
increases _ in June, August and November of last year _ have done
little to slow the economy, which has continued to boom. Even
construction spending, which traditionally is very sensitive to
interest rates, has recently been rising at an impressive clip.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, the record is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, traditionally the most widely
watched barometer, has made little headway since the first Fed
action. On June 30, that first increase led to a 155-point gain,
leaving the Dow at 10,970.80. Wednesday, the Dow fell 37.85, to
11,003.20, barely higher than the June figure. Higher interest
rates have hurt many stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But a completely different picture emerges when one looks at the
Nasdaq composite, an index dominated by so-called new economy
stocks attuned to the Internet. It closed at 2,686.12 on June 30.
Wednesday, it rose 21.98 points, to 4,073.96, or 52 percent higher
than it was after the first rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   The market's assurance appears to be particularly frustrating to
the Fed, which is worried that the economy is growing too rapidly,
raising inflation concerns and causing a huge and growing trade
deficit as consumers buy far more than the American economy can
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, thinks that the wealth
effect _ the feeling by investors that they are richer because the
value of their portfolios has risen _ is a major reason for that
spending, and he has forecast that the markets will slow the
economy down. So far, they have not. Higher interest rates have
slowed the market for old economy stocks, but not for the stocks
that are pacing this bull market.
</P>
<P>
   And now, interest rates are not even rising. Even as the Fed was
raising short-term interest rates Wednesday, the bond markets were
cutting rates. The biggest decline was in 30-year Treasury bonds,
where the yield fell from 6.42 percent to 6.28 percent. But some of
the decline was because of concerns that there will not be enough
bonds to go around. The Treasury Department announced it was
planning to reduce the amount of such bonds it issues and buy back
some of the bonds that are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in yield was smaller on 10-year bonds, where supply
factors are less pronounced, from 6.62 percent to 6.57 percent, and
there were also declines on the short end of the spectrum, with the
yield on three-month Treasury bills falling from 5.71 percent to
5.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rates are up substantially since they began rising last year,
but it appears that the Fed will have to do a lot more if it wants
to raise rates enough to scare investors. The fact that investors
are not easily alarmed is a tribute to just how much confidence
they have that Greenspan and his colleagues will keep the economy
in good shape. That confidence makes it all the more difficult for
the Fed to slow the economy, no matter how much it wants to do so.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the CIA, George J. Tenet, acknowledged
Wednesday that the agency had been too slow in notifying the
Justice Department and Congress about evidence that his
predecessor, John M. Deutch, had improperly placed large amounts of
classified material on unclassified computers in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no excuse for that,'' Tenet said at a hearing before
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Notification of both
the Justice Department and the Congressional Oversight Committees
``should have been done promptly, certainly by the spring of
1997,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet's comments came a day after he had issued a statement
defending his actions in the Deutch matter. But at the Senate
hearing, he came under sharp questioning from lawmakers about the
Deutch case. The committee chairman, Sen. Richard C. Shelby,
R-Ala., said the Deutch case was one of ``grave concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have a keen interest in the performance of
senior officials charged with upholding our laws and policies with
respect to the protection of classified information, '' Shelby
said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was prompted by an article in The New York Times on
Tuesday concerning a classified report from the CIA's inspector
general that was critical of the way the agency's internal
investigation into the Deutch case had been handled.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the actions of some senior agency officials
had the effect of delaying a ``prompt and thorough'' investigation
by CIA security officials. It also says they failed to inform the
Justice Department that Deutch may have broken the law until 1998,
more than a year after the discovery of classified material on
Deutch's computers in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That delay had the effect of avoiding ``the potential
application of the independent counsel statute,'' according to the
inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   The report remains classified, but its contents have been
described to The New York Times by several intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites the agency's former executive director, Nora
Slatkin, and its former general counsel, Michael O'Neill, saying
their actions ``had the effect of delaying a prompt and thorough
investigation of this matter.'' It also cites Tenet as saying he
``should have involved himself more forcefully to ensure a proper
resolution of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutch served as the agency's director from May 1995 until he
resigned in December 1996. After security officials discovered
classified material on Deutch's computers as he was leaving the
agency in December 1996, an internal investigation was begun. But
within weeks of the discovery, CIA security officers came to
believe that senior agency officials seeking to protect Deutch were
blocking their efforts to conduct a thorough inquiry, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Deutch refused to be questioned by security
officials, and the senior officials allowed him not to be
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill kept four computer cards containing files from Deutch's
computers in his safe for about three weeks, rebuffing efforts from
the security staff to gain access to the material, the report adds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the security staff ultimately wrote a report on the
Deutch matter in the summer of 1997, the report was effectively
shelved and a security official later complained that it had been
an investigation ``in name only.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutch has expressed regret for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Wednesday, Tenet denied that he deliberately
delayed an investigation into Deutch's computer practices. He also
said that the CIA could not exclude the possibility that other
countries had gained access to the classified material on Deutch's
computers. Although there is no evidence that the classified
documents had been taken by anyone, ``I can't give you a statement
that it absolutely didn't happen,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch was accessing the Internet via unsecure services with the
same computers on which he had classified material, according to
the inspector general's report. Others in Deutch's home also had
access to the computers, which had been issued by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that someone using the computers accessed what
it describes as ``high-risk'' Web sites. It also says that e-mail
from a former Russian scientist was found on one of Deutch's
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The report describes some vulnerabilities faced by information
in computers connected to the Internet and says Deutch was aware of
such risks. It also says that someone using the computers at
Deutch's house accessed ``high-risk'' Web sites, making them easier
for hackers to gain entry. While they are not familiar with the
specifics of the Deutch case, some computer experts note that
visiting some online sites may make a computer vulnerable to
programs that are unknowingly planted on the hard drive. Such
programs can monitor the keystrokes of users to gain passwords or
read the contents of the hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet noted Wednesday that Deutch ``was sloppy in what he did.''
But he added that Deutch ``worked around the clock,'' which he said
helped explain why he had so much classified material on his home
computers.
</P>
<P>
   While the material was highly sensitive, most were documents
written by Deutch himself, Tenet added.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, after receiving the inspector general's report on
the Deutch case, Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearances
indefinitely. Tenet also created a special panel inside the CIA to
review how the case was handled by agency officials.
</P>
<P>
   That panel completed its report on Tuesday, and its findings
will soon be presented to Tenet, he said.

ANNE HEBERT, 83, WHO WROTE OF RURAL QUEBEC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, France)  (rk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Hebert, a poet and novelist who brought the violent
passions of her native rural Quebec to wider audiences in France
and the United States, died on Jan. 23 at a hospital in Montreal.
She was 83 and lived in Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a post-World War II generation of Quebec intellectuals
who breathed new life into fading language and cultural links with
France, Hebert spent most of the last half century in Paris,
explaining once: ``Montreal is too American, Quebec City is too
small, and Paris is very, very beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the distractions of Paris, Hebert set seven of her eight
novels in the rural Quebec she had known as a child. Reflecting on
her trans-Atlantic vision, she once told an interviewer: ``You need
distance. It helps you to better reflect on the issues and places
you are writing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1916 in a village outside of Quebec City, she spent her
teen-age years battling a series of life-threatening illnesses _
appendicitis, pleurisy and scarlet fever. Often isolated in
quarantine, she voraciously read books and poetry, with many of the
volumes supplied by a favorite cousin, a poet. In 1939 she
published her first poems. In 1999 she published her last work,
``Un Habit de Lumiere,'' a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Writing ``poetry is not the relaxation of the seventh day,'' she
once said. ``It is thirst and hunger, bread and wine.'' Reflecting
this serious, lifelong commitment to the writer's craft, she won
Canada's most prestigious literary award, the Governor General's
Award, at regular intervals: in 1960, in 1975 and in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The tortured isolation of her adolescence resurfaced in poems
and novels that revolved around violent themes, rape and murder, in
rural Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stripped bare the lives of bourgeois families who hid
their little hells,'' said Denise Boucher, a poet who is president
of the Union of Quebec Writers. ``It was writing that rebelled
against conformism.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 Hebert won wide acclaim for her novel ``Kamouraska,'' a
tale of adultery and murder set in a small northern Quebec village
of her ancestors. In 1973 Claude Jutra turned the novel into a
critically acclaimed movie, casting the French-Canadian actress
Genevieve Bujold in the lead. Yves Simoneau based a movie on
another of her novels, ``Les Fous de Bassan,'' translated into
English as ``In the Shadow of the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 France awarded the Prix Femina to this book, a dark tale
about the disappearance of two teen-age girls from an isolated
English-speaking community in Quebec's Gaspe peninsula in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used words like jewels, like gemstones that were sharp,
clear and fine,'' said Sheila Fischman, who translated Hebert's
last seven novels into English. The most recent translation was
published last year under the title ``Am I Disturbing You?''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, who never married, often said she would have liked to
have had children but could not reconcile the demands of writing
with the demands of motherhood. &QL;

PFIZER AND WARNER-LAMBERT ARE SEEN IN MERGER DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON and MELODY PETERSEN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pfizer Inc. has reached a tentative agreement to buy the
Warner-Lambert Co. for a sweetened price of $87 billion, people
close to the companies said Wednesday, potentially ending a
contentious battle that began more than three months ago when
Warner announced another merger only to be surprised by Pfizer's
bid.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal still faces a large hurdle: Warner-Lambert must win
the approval of the American Home Products Corp., the partner with
which it already has a merger agreement. And no deal is guaranteed
until the boards of the companies have approved it.
</P>
<P>
   Should Warner-Lambert's board agree to the new offer of 2.75
Pfizer shares for each Warner share _ a 10 percent increase from
Pfizer's original 2.5-share offer _ it will end a drama that had
more twists and turns than a soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 4, Warner-Lambert, a maker of drugs and consumer
products, agreed to buy American Home for $70 billion in stock.
Hours later, Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, made its $82.4
billion hostile offer for Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from shareholders, Warner-Lambert reluctantly
agreed last month to talk with Pfizer. About the same time, the
Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., the consumer products giant, emerged as a
possible white knight to save Warner from Pfizer's embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, though, P&AMP;G called off those talks _ which included
buying American Home _ after watching its own share price plummet
almost 20 percent when investors panned the suggested combination.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Warner-Lambert, Pfizer and American Home all
declined to comment Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said that Warner-Lambert has offered
American Home a breakup fee of $1.8 billion, but American Home
executives have said that amount is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Because its merger deal stipulates that American Home can
receive as much as $2 billion, the company is holding out for
another $200 million in stock, cash or possibly a product line from
either Warner-Lambert or Pfizer. Such an agreement could take
several days to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Traversa, an analyst at Mehta Partners, a firm that
invests in drug stocks, said the company should be able to obtain a
fee higher than $1.8 billion. ``American Home is in a strong
position,'' he said. ``I think they'll be able to get more.''
</P>
<P>
   Traversa called Pfizer's new offer a good one for both
companies. Based on Pfizer's closing stock price Wednesday, the
offer equals $99 a Warner-Lambert share _ a premium of more than 40
percent from the level at which the stock traded before Pfizer's
bid. The purchase price of $87 billion is based on 883 million
fully diluted shares outstanding, according to Warner-Lambert's
most recent financial report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fair price for Warner-Lambert shareholders,'' Traversa
said. ``And, for Pfizer, it's also a good deal.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Adrian Lajous Martinez, a finance official who
resigned his cabinet post in 1982 to protest the nationalization of
the banks, died of a heart attack here Jan. 24. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Lajous' refusal to endorse President Jose Lopez Portillo's
takeover of the financial system ended his 32-year government
career but earned him widespread respect. Mexican presidents have
enjoyed kinglike powers, and few senior officials had ever dared
disagree publicly with them.
</P>
<P>
   After Lajous (pronounced lah-ZHOO) left, he became a newspaper
writer. He referred with wry wit to the vast powers of Mexican
presidents in a column published in 1992, during the presidency of
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. In 1964, when Lajous was living in
England, Salinas, then a university student, visited his house in
London accompanied by Salinas' brother and by an Irish wolfhound,
Lajous wrote in the column. Salinas asked Lajous to keep the hound
in his garage overnight, but the dog was howling and Lajous
refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known that one of those two boys was going to be
president, the dog would have slept in my bed, and I on the floor
of my garage,'' Lajous wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lajous was born in 1920 in Argentina. His father was an
executive for Ford Motor Co. there, Lajous earned a law degree from
the national university here. In his 20s, he bought a small radio
station and built it into a nationwide network. After joining the
government in 1950, he was the Mexican representative to the World
Bank and Unesco. He headed the Foreign Trade Bank of Mexico when
the banks were nationalized.
</P>
<P>
   Lajous' son, Adrian, who was president of the government oil
company, Pemex, until his resignation in December, is now the
president's international adviser on petroleum. Lajous' daughter
Luz, a former senator, is a fellow at Harvard. Another daughter,
Alejandra, is director of the public television station here, and
another daughter, Roberta, a former ambassador to Austria, directs
the Foreign Service training academy.
</P>
<P>
   Also surviving are his wife, Luz Vargas Burgos, three brothers
and sisters and seven grandchildren.

HOBE MORRISON, 95, A DRAMA CRITIC FOR VARIETY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hobe Morrison, a longtime drama critic for Variety,
died on Jan. 22. He was 95 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison was a fixture of opening nights on Broadway for more
than four decades, often writing two reviews a day: one for the New
York edition of Variety, and a second for the West Coast edition.
The former would examine the play as a play, the latter its
prospects as a movie.
</P>
<P>
   His approach was as straightforward as his prose, which at
Variety meant short and to the point. ``It is a critic's obligation
to be readable, authoritative, well-informed and discriminating,''
he wrote in 1941. ``But it is also his function, I think, to
recognize worthwhile plays,'' a species of art that he considered
rare and precious.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Philadelphia, Morrison began his career as a reporter
for The Philadelphia Record, serving as drama editor and assistant
to the paper's theater critic. In 1937 he moved to New York to
cover vaudeville and film for Variety, a move that led to his
position as drama critic.
</P>
<P>
   He prized the job for its importance. Even so, he often attended
glittery openings dressed casually in a sweater and a tweed jacket.
John Chapman, a theater critic at the Daily News, once remarked
that Morrison dressed for the theater like a football coach. The
next week, Morrison returned fire, referring to Chapman as the
``News' critic and men's fashion editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Such jousting was common when New York supported a half-dozen
newspapers and Broadway was the biggest business in entertainment.
While Morrison was friendly with many actors, playwrights and
reviewers _ he and Brooks Atkinson, critic for The New York Times,
shared a passion for bird-watching _ he was far more skeptical of
producers.
</P>
<P>
   He was proud of noting that he always paid his own bill when
Broadway producers invited him to lunch. He also made a point of
double-checking the box office figures supplied by productions,
penalizing producers he found to be inflating their figures by
subtracting the extra amount from the next week's figures.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison retired from Variety in the mid-1970s but continued to
write a freelance column about Broadway for a regional newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Randy, of Manhattan, and
Christopher, of Middletown, Conn.

JAMES V. NEEL IS DEAD AT 84; LEADING GENETICS RESEARCHER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. James V. Neel, whose work helped uncover the genetic basis
of sickle cell anemia and who led extensive studies of radiation's
effects on the survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, died on Tuesday at his home in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said the University of Michigan, where he
was an emeritus professor of human genetics and internal medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In an approach that seems brilliantly prescient now that
scientists are poised to map the entire human genome and so lay
bare the genetic basis for many diseases, Neel foresaw the
importance of inherited factors in understanding and treating a
wide range of disorders, said Dr. William J. Schull, an emeritus
professor at the University of Texas Human Genetics Center.
</P>
<P>
   Neel's most recent research focused on viruses perhaps
associated with genetic mutations that some researchers speculate
could lead to cancer. He is also known as the founder of one of the
nation's first departments of human genetics, at the University of
Michigan, and as the director of an early clinic for counseling
patients about genetic diseases they may carry.
</P>
<P>
   For all those reasons, said Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of
the National Human Genome Research Institute, ``Dr. Neel can be
said to have birthed the field of human genetics.''
</P>
<P>
   James Van Gundia Neel was born in Hamilton, Ohio, on March 22,
1915. Reared largely by his mother, after his father's death, he
earned an undergraduate degree from the College of Wooster in Ohio
in 1935. He moved to the University of Rochester in New York, where
he received a Ph.D. and an M.D.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Neel completed his residency in medicine at
Rochester, President Harry S. Truman authorized the National
Research Council and the Atomic Energy Commission to ``undertake a
continuing study of the medical and biological effects of the
atomic bomb on man.'' This meant studying survivors of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, both of which Truman had ordered destroyed with
atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1947, Neel was named acting director of field
studies for the council's Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission, which
set about examining thousands of survivors for evidence of genetic
damage caused by radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we knew that DNA was the ultimate source of genetic
information, we clearly didn't have the tools to explore variation
in DNA in any kind of biochemical way,'' said Schull, who joined
the study team two years later.
</P>
<P>
   So, Schull said, the commission looked for evidence of genetic
mutations through basic physical exams of exposed people and their
children. The study was especially thorough because, at a time of
severe food shortages in Japan, the commission registered people
for examination when they signed up for food rations.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the scientific reasons for the study, Schull said, it
was undertaken to ``give us some sense of the potential public
health problem'' and how to prepare for it, if it occurred. As it
turned out, once people had recovered from the immediate effects of
radiation sickness, they did not show an unusually large number of
catastrophic results like early death or stillborn children. In
reporting on the findings, Neel emphasized that the children of
survivors showed no abnormalities that might be attributable to
damaged genes.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, however, increased incidence of leukemia and tumors
did turn up in people who had themselves been exposed to the
radiation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, Neel also began studying black families
particularly prone to the blood disease called sickle cell anemia.
He was the first to show that people with the most severe form of
the disease had inherited two genes for the trait, a discovery that
proved immensely valuable in providing couples reliable statistics
on the likelihood that their offspring would have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during the 1960s, Neel introduced the concept of the
``thrifty gene.'' That concept held that genes for disorders like
obesity and diabetes were actually useful at an earlier stage of
human history, when food was much less abundant. More recently he
and colleagues studied severe genetic damage in what he called
``rogue cells'' in some human populations, including the Yanomama
tribe in the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked, `Could viruses have something to do with these
chromosomal aberrations?''' said Dr. Eugene O. Major of the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who
collaborated with Neel on the work. ``The answer seems to be, `Yes,
they could.'''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence came by studying people who had been infected with
the viruses and carried the rogue cells, and by directly observing
genetic damage caused by viruses in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   One speculative possibility is that viruses related to those
could cause genetic damage that leads to cancer, Major said.
</P>
<P>
   Neel is survived by his wife, Priscilla; a daughter, Frances
Neel of Ann Arbor; two sons, James, of Santa Rosa, Calif., and
Alexander, of Dodge City, Kan.; a sister, Mary Ann Blackwood of
Atlanta, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Neel's influence is likely to grow with today's intense
worldwide interest in genetics. In fact, as the genome project maps
out the entire length of human DNA with the goal of laying bare its
workings, and its disorders, Neel's focus on inherited diseases is
looking more and more like a major theme of clinical medicine in
the new century, Schull said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems that were once associated with infectious
diseases have become, in the main, significantly less,'' he said,
adding that this development supports ``very strongly Jim's vision
that genetic disease was going to become a very large and very
significant fraction of the health care problems to which persons
are prey.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CRANBURY, N.J. _ For generations of Cub Scouts, the Pinewood
Derby has been a rite of passage _ a pint-size version of a Soap
Box Derby in which each Scout saws, whittles, sands and assembles
his model race car from a simple kit.
</P>
<P>
   And for all that time, 44 years, Arthur Hasselbach Sr. has been
a high priest of that rite, as the designer and official
manufacturer of the kits, which contain four plastic wheels, two
axles and a 7-inch-long block of Ponderosa pine.
</P>
<P>
   He visits derbies all over the country each year, studying the
aerodynamics of the small vehicles, dispensing advice and marveling
at the creativity of the boys in blue uniforms who, with the help
of their parents, turn the blocks of wood into colorful model
vehicles they race down inclined lanes.
</P>
<P>
   But in December, the Boy Scouts of America _ the only customers
for his Beta Crafts Inc. factory here in this small central New
Jersey community _ informed Hasselbach that they would not renew
his contract, which lapsed with the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Boy Scouts would not say why, after all these
years, they no longer wanted him to produce the kits, which he sold
through the Scouts catalog for $3.40 apiece. Hasselbach, who is 87,
said that the only explanation came to him in an informal
conversation with one of the procurement officials for the Boy
Scouts and that it was related to his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were worried about what would happen to my company,'' he
said. ``But it's a family business. We have plans for it to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the Boy Scouts national headquarters in Irving,
Texas, said Wednesday that the decision had nothing to do with
Hasselbach's age and that she did not understand why the change was
attracting attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a block of wood and some wheels,'' said the spokeswoman,
Renee Fairrer, associate director of external communications for
the Scouts. ``That's the wonderful part of it: you create the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we were pleased with the quality of work Mr.
Hasselbach was producing,'' she said. ``But like in any other
business where there's a vendor relationship, you re-evaluate that
relationship periodically, and you choose to renew it or not renew
it. It's nothing more and nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Hasselbach, it is a lot more: a $1 million-a-year
business that employs 20 people, as well as a tie to a tradition
that has included three generations of his family.
</P>
<P>
   In the modest and cluttered front office of his factory here, he
has copies of a Boys Life magazine article that featured one of his
six grandchildren racing Pinewood Derby cars with other Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbach said he attended many of the derbies, where he
gathered ideas for ways to improve his product. The new supplier,
he said, would probably not have that direct contact with Scouts
and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time out there,'' he said. ``I enjoyed it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hasselbach said he was mystified by the abrupt ending to a
relationship that had lasted half his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he said, he made 1.4 million kits for the Scouts, in
addition to 20 other products, including kits for model space
rockets and catamarans.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbach, who was raised in the Bronx and ran a model airplane
company there, was a Scoutmaster when his two sons were young, and
he put on model aviation shows for the Scouts in the 1950s. In
1955, Scouting officials approached him about making a miniature
racing kit.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, many boys competed in the Soap Box Derby, riding
in 6-feet-long vehicles they built. Scouting officials, concerned
that Cub Scouts were too young for Soap Box Derbies _ they are 7 to
10 years old _ wanted a less elaborate outlet for their competitive
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinewood Derbies, with rules requiring smaller and lighter
cars and shorter tracks _ the cars cannot weigh more than 5 ounces,
for example _ grew into hugely popular events with Cub Scouts and
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbach and his sons Arthur Jr. and Stephen have been in
business together for years, and the model kit business will
continue in the family, they say. The sons now run a plastics
business next door, and the father runs the derby business mostly
on his own. Arthur Jr. said he had tried to get his father to
retire, but the elder Hasselbach said that would happen ``when I
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbach, who also raises pond fish and is a deep-sea
fisherman, lives in a house in front of the factory, and his sons
and their families live a few yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbach has continued to produce the derby kits and has been
selling them to local Cub Scout packs. He said he planned to sell
more through the Internet. His son said the family had already set
aside a World Wide Web address.

DIRECT-MAIL SOLICITATIONS GET MOST MONEY IN SENATE `NONCAMPAIGN'
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Va., Texas, Mich., Nev., Ky., Calif.)  (With NY-SENATE-GIULIANI) 
(nk) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Direct-mail campaigns by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary
Rodham Clinton have cost the two candidates for the U.S. Senate in
New York more than $3 million in the last six months, by far the
largest chunk of spending in what is on track to become the most
expensive Senate race in history.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani alone paid more than $1.4 million to seven direct-mail
firms based in Virginia and spent $258,000 more on postage to send
out letters nationwide urging conservatives, according to one
mailing, to send in donations or risk a future with a senator in
New York who is the ``champion of every left-wing cause you can
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, spent at least $1.4 million in consulting
fees and postage on her own fund-raising appeals, telling voters
that ``getting off to a strong start is very important,'' and
reminding them that ``your decision to help right now would mean so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton and Giuliani each raised more than any U.S.
Senate candidate ever had in the year before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spent $3.9 million and raised $8.9 million during the
second half of 1999, leaving him with $7.4 million in cash on hand
on Dec. 31, according to his campaign finance report, a printed
copy of which was released to reporters late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign collected $8.1 million during the same six
months, while it spent $3.3 million, leaving her with $4.7 million
in the bank, her finance report said.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Giuliani's direct-mail letters and his reliance upon
firms in Virginia that have a reputation for appealing to staunch
conservatives has elicited repeated criticism from Clinton's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $1.4 million Giuliani's campaign paid to direct-mail
firms in the second half of 1999, nearly $800,000 went to American
Target Advertising Inc. of Manassas, Va., a firm run by Richard A.
Viguerie, a legendary conservative fund-raiser who has worked for
candidates like Jesse Helms and George Wallace. Another $141,240
went to Chester Mailing List Consultants of Fairfax, Va., which is
owned by Earl Chester, a former employee of Viguerie.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani defended himself Wednesday against charges by the
Clinton campaign that he was aligning himself too closely with the
Republican Party's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Clintonesque spin, not reality,'' Giuliani said during
a visit to Washington. ``I guess they started this about a week
ago, the vast right-wing conspiracy, which is like a deja vu all
over again. It has no application to me, my policies, my record, my
background.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the direct-mail effort, Giuliani's campaign has also
used its war chest over the last six months on television
commercials ($790,000), fund-raising consultants (more than
$65,000) and on staff, including his campaign manager, Bruce J.
Teitelbaum (more than $23,000), according to the records.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's mail campaigns have been handled in part by Emily's
List, a group in Washington that backs female candidates for
Congress who support abortion rights. Other direct-mail efforts for
Clinton have been run by Names in the News, a San Francisco firm,
and O'Brien McConnell &AMP; Pearson Inc. of Washington. Clinton has
also spent more than $130,000 for polling in the last six months.
At least $46,000 has been paid to The Ickes and Enright Group, run
by Harold M. Ickes, a former top aide in the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates typically spend heavily on direct mail early in their
campaigns, as they focus on raising the millions they will need to
wage statewide television appeals as the election nears.
Direct-mail efforts also take up little of the candidates' time.
</P>
<P>
   As for contributions, thousands of donations came in for both
candidates from across the United States, although the lack of
access to a computerized version of the reports made immediate
analysis difficult. What was obvious from both candidates' reports
is the large number of out-of-state donations that are fueling this
campaign, which has already attracted media interest nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   For Giuliani, out-of-state contributors include a Shell Oil Co.
lawyer from Kingwood, Texas, a real-estate agent from Grosse
Pointe, Mich., and an investment banker from Laguna Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's hundreds of out-of-state contributors include a
chemist from Frankfort, Ky., a carpenter from Henderson, Nev., and
a Miramax film executive from Los Angeles.

BRODEUR IS STAR IN DEVILS' DOMINATION OF RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For nearly two periods at Madison Square Garden on
Wednesday night, the New York Rangers did everything they could to
show the New Jersey Devils that there is not much difference
between the teams anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But by game's end, the Rangers had still gone more than two
years without beating the Devils in the regular season. Martin
Brodeur and the Devils' top line made sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur turned aside 36 shots to outduel his All-Star teammate
Mike Richter (31 saves) in goal. And Patrik Elias and Jason Arnott
scored New Jersey's first and last goals to lead the Devils to a
3-1 triumph, extending their unbeaten streak against the Rangers to
17 games (12-0-5).
</P>
<P>
   The Devils did so with Larry Robinson acting as head coach in
place of Rob Ftorek, who served a one-game suspension imposed by
the league for throwing a bench on the ice in a game against
Detroit last Saturday night. Ftorek insists the Devils do not have
a No. 1 line. Elias, Arnott, and Petr Sykora try to prove him wrong
almost every game.
</P>
<P>
   When Elias scores, the Devils are almost automatic. Wednesday
night, they improved to 16-0-1 this season when Elias scores a
goal. And it was Elias' assist on Arnott's goal at 14 minutes 32
seconds of the third period that put the game away, insuring
Brodeur of his league-leading 31st victory this season, and making
sure the Devils would not lose three consecutive games for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who have not beaten New Jersey in the regular
season since Jan. 12, 1997, tied a franchise record for futility
against one team with the defeat. They also went 17 games without
winning against the Montreal Canadiens from 1944-46.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After a scoreless, hard-hitting first period, the Rangers
outplayed the Devils for much of the second, but the Devils somehow
exited the ice with a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur had something to do with that, of course. Brodeur, who
has started in goal in each of the last 31 meetings between the
teams dating to Dec. 26, 1993, was superb in stopping 27 of 28
shots over the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   The only one that eluded him was off the stick of Adam Graves,
who planted himself just off the crease and knocked in a nifty pass
from Theo Fleury from the bottom of the right circle at 2:08 of the
second period for the game's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Graves' 17th goal of the season _ which came eight seconds after
a roughing penalty to New Jersey's Scott Stevens as the first
period ended _ gave Graves 468 career points as a member of the
Rangers to move him past James Patrick into 12th place in franchise
history. The assist was Fleury's team-leading 34th this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, of course, were expecting goals from Fleury when
they signed him. Before the game, Fleury, who has just 12 goals
this season, none on the power play, was asked about his reluctance
to shoot for most of the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury traced the downturn back to Nov. 26, when he was slashed
on the right wrist by Florida's Lance Pitlick. The wrist is still
sore. ``But I lost a little confidence, too,'' Fleury said. ``I've
been looking to pass more than to shoot. That'll happen when you
hit 15 posts.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night began a stretch in which three of the Rangers'
four games would come against a New Jersey team the Rangers had not
beaten since Mark Messier left New York for Vancouver following the
1997 playoffs. That was the summer that an overtime goal by Graves
bounced the Devils out of the second round in five games.
</P>
<P>
   When Patrik Elias and Claude Lemieux scored in the second half
of the second period, it looked as if the Rangers would have to
wait until next week for another shot at ending the skid.
</P>
<P>
   Elias' 22nd goal of the season was made possible by Brodeur,
whose kick save with his right skate not only denied Eric Lacroix
from the right circle, but also enabled Brian Rafalski to chip the
rebound out to Elias and free him in on Mike Richter on a
breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Elias beat Richter at 12:23 of the second period with a wrist
shot from the left circle that found the upper left corner of the
net. It was his 16th goal in 17 games, and it tied the score at
1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took the lead at 19:04 on something of a fluke.
Lemieux retrieved an errant Scott Gomez shot off the boards behind
Richter. Skating counter-clockwise around the back of the net,
Lemieux threw the puck toward the front of the goal. It banked off
Kevin Hatcher's right skate and past Richter for Lemieux's 18th
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS

<P>
   MANNY MALHOTRA rejoined Coach JOHN MUCKLER and the Rangers on
Wednesday morning under the belief that he would be back in the
lineup. But TIM TAYLOR, who was bothered more by the flu than by a
knee that buckled on him Monday when his skate caught a rut in the
ice, felt good enough to play. And so the 19-year-old Malhotra was
scratched. ``I had a meeting with Muck this morning and he said
it's going to be hard to find a place for me to play a regular
shift,' Malhotra said. ``He just said, `Stay positive. We'll work
you in wherever possible.''' Muckler said of Malhotra's status:
``He has to be prepared to get in if things don't go properly or if
we run into injuries. And it's always been my experience that those
things happen.'' &QL;

   Robert John Milano, a self-made millionaire industrialist who
briefly served Mayor Edward I. Koch as deputy mayor for economic
development, died Jan. 29 at a hospital in Palm Springs, Fla.,
where he lived. A former New York resident, he was 87.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1978, a newly inaugurated Koch introduced him as a
Horatio Alger he had recruited to head the office that the mayor
said would produce the city's salvation. Ten weeks later, the two
men announced their parting at separate news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Both said Milano had not been dismissed, but the circumstances
left little doubt that the mayor had asked for his resignation.
Coming but 74 days into the Koch administration, his was the first
casualty in the mayor's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Milano certainly did not need the $1-a-year compensation he was
to be paid. At the time, he was selling a business he had started
from scratch to Gulf Oil Co. for $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   A native of the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood on Manhattan's West
Side, Robert Milano was born on June 14, 1912. He attended the High
School of Commerce and studied business administration and
financial law in evening sessions at City College. In 1930, he went
to work as a bookkeeper for E.I. du Pont de Nemours &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   After scraping together extra cash by selling insurance and
holding a part-time accountant's job, he started his own venture
selling chemicals in 1936 at the age of 24. It prospered even
through his four-year Army service in World War II and, by 1975,
evolved into Kewanee Industries, a conglomerate with sales of about
$500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, Milano's business activities were slowing, and he
devoted his energies to a role as the businessman in civic and
governmental groups. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed him in
1971 to the Scott Commission, which the governor created to
investigate the city's fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
   Serving on that panel and on a State Charter Study Commission
for New York City gave him enough experience with the workings of
the municipal government to enable Koch to draw on his talent.
</P>
<P>
   He helped expand the New School for Social Research into the
present New School University. He joined the New School's board in
1976, served as vice chairman and remained a trustee at his death.
In 1995, the university named its Graduate School of Management and
Urban Policy for Milano.
</P>
<P>
   Milano's survivors include his wife of 61 years, Sidonia
Friedsam Milano; their son, Robert S., of Los Angeles; and two
grandchildren.

FTC BLOCKS MERGER OF OIL GIANTS BP AMOCO, ARCO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move cheered by consumer advocates in California, the
Federal Trade Commission scuttled the proposed $30 billion merger
between BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield Corp., fearing that the
combined company would dominate the West Coast's retail gasoline
market.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted 3-2 to seek an injunction blocking the
merger, triggering what could be the biggest antitrust oil case
since the Standard Oil breakup a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Arco and its suitor, London-based BP Amoco,
had planned to complete the merger Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Parker, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition,
said the government could initiate legal action as early as Friday
in federal court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular merger is anticompetitive,'' Parker said at a
news conference in Washington following Wednesday's vote. ``We're
going after this merger and we're going to try and stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arco spokeswoman Linda Dozier said the companies would fight the
FTC's decision in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have a compelling case in support of our
combination, which we will argue vigorously in court,'' BP Amoco
and Arco said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer activists were surprised by the decision, noting
that the FTC has recently approved several large oil industry
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government prevails, the gasoline industry in
California can only benefit from more competition,'' said Linda
Sherry, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Consumer Action.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco and Arco account for about 70 percent of Alaskan oil
production. Their combination would create the world's
second-largest publicly held oil company, behind Exxon Mobil, which
completed its merger in November. The proposed deal was announced
last April and has been approved by the European Union and
shareholders of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement was also reached with the state of Alaska
committing the combined company to reduce its ownership of Alaska
North Slope crude oil production. The agreement also calls for the
company to sell off exploration acreage and interests in the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline and marine tankers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these proposed divestitures, the combined company would
still account for 55 percent of the oil flowing from Alaska's North
Slope, the FTC estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the proposed company could dictate prices to West
Coast refiners who rely on Alaska crude oil. Other critics of the
merger, including Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., have argued that
such dominance could translate into higher retail prices in
California, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky and he assured me
that preventing higher gas prices in California was a key factor
behind the commission's decision,'' she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco said although it remained willing to try to negotiate a
settlement that would appease FTC officials, ``the only course open
to us is to resolve the issue through litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   If the request for an injunction is successful, the case is
expected to go before an FTC administrative law judge, whose
decision can be appealed in federal court. The litigation could
take months and could end up before the Supreme Court.

EDITORIAL: GOOD START IN THE DIALLO CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Feb. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Almost exactly a year after Amadou Diallo's death in a fusillade
of 41 police bullets prompted an outpouring of anger over police
tactics in minority communities, the trial of four white New York
City officers charged with killing the unarmed West African
immigrant got underway on Wednesday in the Albany courtroom of
Justice Joseph Teresi of State Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Opening arguments by lawyers for the prosecution and the defense
offered starkly different accounts of events in the vestibule of
Diallo's Bronx apartment. Eric Warner, the chief prosecutor, told
the packed courtroom that the four officers killed Diallo without
calling out any warning, like ``Stop! Police!'' or ``Don't move.''
They continued firing even after Diallo was on the ground, Warner
said. The defendants, he concluded, ``acted recklessly with a
depraved indifference to Amadou Diallo's life. . . . For that they
are guilty of murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys called the death a tragedy, but not a crime.
They said Diallo caught the attention of the officers with
suspicious behavior and then, after failing to stop on their
command, turned and pointed a dark object at them. It turned out to
be a wallet. But in the split second for decision-making in a
vestibule said to be dimly lit, the officers believed the wallet
was a gun and began firing their rapid-fire weapons in
self-defense. After realizing their mistake _ described by one
defense attorney as ``every police officer's nightmare'' _ they
tried to resuscitate Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the trial is likely to turn on which scenario the
jury believes, and how it applies the state's law of self-defense
as refined by the state's top court in the case of Bernhard Goetz,
the so-called subway shooter. Under New York law, a person is
justified in using mortal force only when he or she reasonably
believes such force is necessary for self-defense. The key word is
reasonably.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi got off to a good start in presiding over the tense
proceedings. He opened the trial to television coverage and
maintained tight control of jury selection to produce a diverse
panel consisting of four black women, two white women and six white
males. Both steps should help ease concerns about the shift of
venue from the Bronx to Albany, and make it easier for the public
to accept whatever verdict the jury ultimately hands down.
