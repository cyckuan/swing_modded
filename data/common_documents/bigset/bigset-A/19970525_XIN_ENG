XINING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China has started work on the
principal part of the second-phase renovation of the only highway
that links Qinghai Province and the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase construction is expected to cost 500 million
yuan (62.5 million dollars). The state has spent 850 million yuan

At the world's highest altitude, about 740 km of the 1,147-km
highway are built in the permafrost zones at an altitude ranging
from 4,500 meters to 5,000 meters, which has eight months of
freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications launched from 1995 to July this

<HEADLINE> New Trend Found in Teen-age Smoking in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A new trend has been found in
teen-age smoking in the United States, which is shifting from
cigarettes to more dangerous cigar.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey conducted by the Federal Centers for
Disease Control an Prevention shows that an estimated 6 million
American teen-agers -- more than one-quarter of the boys and girls
from 14-19 -- smoked at least one cigar last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 16,117 young people also found that 3.9 percent
of the boys and 1.2 percent of the girls were frequent cigar
smokers, having consumed more than 50 in the last year.
</P>
<P>
This tells that the cigar industry has really penetrated
adolescents, an expert on teen tobacco use warned.
</P>
<P>
One cigar has more nicotine than one cigarette and about as
much tobacco as 15 cigarettes, according to the National Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times in a report Friday described the trend as
"disturbing" though the number of teen-age cigar smokers may seem
small compared with the 22 percent of high school seniors who
smoke cigarettes every day.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that a person who smokes one or two cigars a day
has more than twice the risks of cancer in the oral cavity and
pharynx than nonsmokers and three to four times the risks of
cancer of the larynx.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 3,000 kids in this country have
become regular cigarette smokers every day. Against this
background, the Federal government is fighting a legal battle with
the tobacco industry over its plan to regulate cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Experts urged the government to act quickly to regulate sales
of cigar. Otherwise, they warned, an epidemic of teen-age cigar
smoking could erupt.

Farmers should immediately report to the nearby agriculture
office any sign of existence of the pest and apply traditional
preventive methods on grazing land, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the army worm damages crops like
maize, sorghum, teff, barley, wheat and grass on grazing land.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that his country does not plan to apply for
membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Moscow has never received an invitation from the military bloc,
he added.
</P>
<P>
If Moscow made such a bid, NATO would have to take in many
other countries as new members, Primakov told the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
An indefinite enlargement of NATO was not conducive to world
stability. He pointed out that some Middle East countries recently
indicated they would not reject NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Although the text of an agreement between Russia and NATO was
ready, Moscow was still opposed to the military bloc's planned
eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
He threatened that Russia would take appropriate action if NATO
should go beyond the Russia-NATO agreement on issue of the
alliance's military presence in the territories of its new
members.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes Congress on Disaster Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
criticized Congress today for going on vacation without providing
long-term disaster aid for flood-ravaged areas.
</P>
<P>
"These people are in dire need, and Congress has failed to act
for them," Clinton said in his weekly address.
</P>
<P>
The president blamed Republican leaders, who recessed Congress
Thursday for a 10-day break. Clinton said he was dismayed that
Congress failed to consider legislation that he and lawmakers from
the besieged Dakotas and Minnesota had offered to provide
long-term help.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry to say some members of the majority tried to use
this important bill for different purposes," Clinton said. "And
without taking action, Congress left town, and our people were
left in the lurch."
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders argued last week that enough emergency aid
was available to help flood victims get through the next few weeks
and said they wanted to spend more time considering long-term
relief legislation.
</P>
<P>
Republicans also want to use any disaster relief bill for
riders that would prevent Clinton from shutting down the
government if negotiations over the budget break down. Some
Republicans fear any concession on disaster relief without the
no-closure provision would work against them in averting another
politically damaging shutdown.
</P>
<P>
In his address, however, Clinton praised both the Senate and
House for passing balanced budget bills last week.
</P>
<P>
"Our balanced budget agreement shows what we can accomplish
when we work together, across party lines, in the interest of
American people," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Ten Thousand People Sing to Greet Return of HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 people gathered at the
Beijing Workers' Indoor Stadium this evening to express by chorus
their joy at Hong Kong's return to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and other senior Party and government
officials Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Ding Guangen, Li
Tieying, Qian Qichen and Wei Jianxing were present at the party.
</P>
<P>
The singing has expressed the aspirations and wishes of the
entire Chinese people, said Jiang at the end of the chorus.
</P>
<P>
Hanging opposite to the rostrum at the stadium, a banner read
"welcome the return of Hong Kong and share the love for the
motherland", and the number "1997".
</P>
<P>
On both sides of the hall were other banners, which affirmed
the significant role of the "one country, two systems" policy in
the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and extended best
regards to the future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life, including workers, farmers,
soldiers, government employees, intellectuals, people from
minority ethnic groups, college students, artists and children,
joined in the chorus.
</P>
<P>
The party started with the strains of the national anthem sung
by all present in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
The solemn anthem expressed the Chinese people's determination
to unite around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) with Jiang Zemin at the core, holding high the banner
of Deng Xiaoping's theory, adhering to the basic line of the
Party, and advancing along the road of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.

<P>
"Finally comes the day, we have long expected", "Blessings on

</P>
<P>
The audience was exceptionally touched by the song "We are in

</P>
<P>
"I have been to Hong Kong, and have made quite a number of good
friends there," said Li Yangyang, a middle school student who
attended the performance. "I hope they can hear the song, which is
sung from the depth of our hearts."
</P>
<P>
The audience burst into deafening applause while hearing a
well-known song, "The Story in Spring", which highlighted Deng
Xiaoping's contribution in the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The applause showed that the Chinese people cherish the memory
of Deng, who passed away on February 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
The party ended with a popular revolutionary song "Unity is
Strength".
</P>
<P>
The party was jointly organized by the Propaganda Department of
the CPC Central Committee, the Central Committee of the Communist
Youth League of China, the Work Committee of Central Party and
Government Departments, the General Political Department of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal
Committee of the CPC.

<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China has built a nationwide
network of duty-free shops at some 80 major ports of entry and
exit, serving overseas tourists and seamen visiting the country,
and embassies and consulates to China.
</P>
<P>
Gai Zhixin, deputy general manager of China Duty-Free Products
Corporation, said that the company has seen the sale of 200
million US dollars, which makes it the 18th among the 50 biggest
duty-free sellers in the world.
</P>
<P>
The company is now China's exclusive seller of duty-free
products, and also the administrator of the sector with
governmental authorization.
</P>
<P>
"My company is the only channel for overseas duty-free products
sellers, if they hope to get entry into China market," Gai said.
</P>
<P>
The company now represents its 119 subsidiaries nationwide in
signing contracts, ordering and setting uniform retail prices of
duty-free products, and pays the bills for goods ordered.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that there is great potential for duty-free shops,
as the country's tourist industry continues expanding quickly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of 51 million entries from
overseas people into China last year, including 6.74 million
overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas tourists to China will increase
marginally in the coming years, and this creates a big potential
market for sellers of duty-free products, Gai said.
</P>
<P>
Both Hong kong and Macao's return to the motherland will also
bear positive effects upon development of the sector, he noted.

HARARE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The latest political situation in
the Great Lakes area, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Angola
will dominate the agenda of the Organization of African Unity
Council of Ministers 66th ordinary session, which is to begin in
Harare on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by a draft agenda released today by
Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Great Lakes area has slightly improved
with the recent takeover of power from Mobuto Sese Seko, former
president of Zaire for 32 years, by the forces of the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire led by
Laurent Kabila, who on May 17 proclaimed himself president of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Situations in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Somalia are still
unstable while the new government of unity in Angola is working
towards restoring peace.
</P>
<P>
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) entered into a power sharing agreement with the
government on April 11, formally ending two decades of civil war
which started at independence from Portugal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also examine the latest political
developments in Palestine and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Other issues to be discussed are activities of the OAU from
February to May this year as well as activities of the regional
and sub-regional offices.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also consider the financial situation of
the organization and progress on its structural reform.
</P>
<P>
They will also examine the issue of landmines and
international efforts to reach a total ban, Africa's external
debts, the all Africa trade fair, special emergency assistance
fund for drought and famine in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers meeting will precede the OAU heads of

<HEADLINE> UK Launches First Multi-university Bond Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's first "multi-university"
bond issue was launched Friday by Varsity Funding backed by
Bankers Trust, the American investment bank.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the event, City experts said that British
universities could soon be rushing to the capital markets
following the launch of the first "multi-university" bond issue.
</P>
<P>
The bond issue, worth 49 million pounds (78.4 million US
dollars), means universities will be able to raise what are, by
international investment standards, relatively small amounts of
money for capital projects such as student accommodation. Varsity
Funding, a joint venture company established two years ago by
Bankers Trust, has repackaged a portfolio of long-term loans to
three universities.
</P>
<P>
A second tranche, worth another 50 million pounds (80 million
US dollars), together with some "single university" bond issues,
designed on a bespoke basis, are expected to be launched later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Since a bid to develop a "multi-university" bond collapsed last
year, universities have become nervous about the capital markets
and institutional investors uncertain about the security of the
university sector.
</P>
<P>
The key to Varsity Funding's deal is the fact that the
university-based bond has been given an AAA credit rating,
traditionally attributed to top-grade investments.
</P>
<P>
Idris Pearce, chairman of Varsity funding, said this had
allowed investors to buy the bonds "safe in the knowledge that the
investment has been structured to protect investors from the
political and financial risks to which the UK higher education
sector is exposed."
</P>
<P>
Pearce was former chairman of the Higher Education Funding
Council for Wales.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Khatami, Iranian President-elect (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Seyed Mohammad Khatami, a
black-turbaned clergyman, was declared today the winner of the
country's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is soon to be crowned with the presidency after winning
a landslide and surprise victory in the most exciting presidential
election in the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Under Iran's Constitution, the president is the next highest
official after the leader. The president is responsible for the
execution of the Constitution except for matters which directly
relates to the leader himself.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's victory in the presidential election comes from his
moderate image of being open-minded, well-educated, tolerant to
different views, kind and honest with a clean background, media
here said.
</P>
<P>
The competition between Khatami and his arch challenger
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri has proved the popularity
of the once-disgraced minister of culture and Islamic guidance
among the Iranian people who have been eager for changes.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who had been obscure from Tehran's political scene for
four years, seized about 20 million votes of the 29.7 million
votes cast in Friday's election.
</P>
<P>
This is a miracle for the 54-year clergy, who rose from
obscurity less than four months ago, to gain so much popularity
and support in the 62-million populated country.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has become a new idol of millions of intellectuals
ranging from professors, artists, university students, government
employees to the middle class in big cities.
</P>
<P>
Although being a black-turbaned clergy which means that he is
descending from the lineage of the prophet of Islam, Khatami is
widely regarded as a liberal clergy who helped the growth of
Iranian cinema, literature and press with his liberal policies
while he was the minister of culture and Islamic guidance.
</P>
<P>
Khatami holds BA and MA degrees in philosophy and speaks
English, German and Arabic. He has so far published two books
entitled The Fear of Wave and From the World of City to City of
World. He has also written a book on political thought among
Muslims, which is ready for publication.
</P>
<P>
The son of the late well-known Ayatollah Ruhollah Khatami
(former Friday prayer leader of the city of Yazd) is currently the
advisor to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and head of the
National Library.
</P>
<P>
Declaring his candidacy for the 7th Iranian presidential
elections on January 29, Khatami has been nominated by the two
political groups -- the left wing called the Society of Combatant
Clergymen (SCC) and the pro-Rafsanjani technocrat group called G-6.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is believed to follow the same policies as
Rafsanjani but has promised reforms on controversial issues such
as freedom of the press and literature, women's rights and
effective solutions for the problems of the youth.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom under the Constitution and rules of the law in the
civic society" is his motto, which attracts more and more
educated people who seek to have more freedom and social justice
under the Islamic rule.

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns Taliban Against Border Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia today warned the Afghan
Taliban militia not to violate the borders of former Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
To do so would immediately set off a collective security
mechanism which links Russia to these nations, the Itar-Tass news
agency quoted a Russian declaration as saying, according to the
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, all Afghanistan's
neighbors, are former Soviet republics that signed a joint
security treaty with Russia in 1992 during a summit of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
The warning followed reports that the Afghan Taliban militia
took Mazar-E-Sharif, the headquarters of northern warlord Rashid
Dostum, and that Dostum had fled to Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian leadership declares that in the case of violation
of the borders of CIS countries, the mechanism agreed upon for
collective security of the signatory nations will immediately go
into effect," the declaration said.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Addressing university students at
Tehran University early this month, he said, "The government
should provide a safe environment for the people so that they may
express their opinion on internal issues and economic affairs."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on development and reconstruction in the country,
Khatami said, "We should study the West, a foundation of all
transformations ... and analyze the developments according to
Islamic values."
</P>
<P>
As to his foreign policy, he said, "Iran is an independent
country capable of recognizing its own interests" and willing to
have normal relations with any country that accepts these basic
principles.
</P>
<P>
He even holds critical attitude toward the present foreign
policy, noting "Iran should not get involved in matters that
cause international friction and should refrain from actions that
may create such an impression."
</P>
<P>
"We would like the international community to be free of
any friction, and we are fully prepared to use the Islamic
Republic's good offices to remove any tension within the world
community," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, local observers analyzed that Khatami is a good
professor and decent man but he is not a wise politician or
powerful statesman.
</P>
<P>
In comparison to his rival, Khatami is inexperienced on
international issues and his lack of management was also
witnessed during his ministerial years.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who is father of a son and two daughters, was born in
1943 and raised in the dry and arid city of Yazd. After
graduation from high school, he left Yazd for the religious city
of Qom to pursue Islamic studies at a theological school.
</P>
<P>
In 1965, he transferred from Qom to Isfahan in central Iran to
study philosophy at Isfahan University and received a BA degree
there. He also continued his advanced theological studies at the
theological school in Isfahan.
</P>
<P>
He continued his graduate studies in philosophy in Tehran and
received his MA degree at Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he went to Hamburg, Germany, to run the Islamic
center there.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, after the victory of the Islamic revolution,
Khatami was elected by the Ardakan and Meybod constituencies to
the Islamic Consultative Assembly (parliament). In 1980, he was
appointed by late spiritual leader Khomeini as head of Keyhan
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was appointed minister of culture and Islamic guidance
in the cabinet of former prime minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi in
1982. He held the portfolio for almost 10 years, three years of
which he served in the cabinet of President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
He was sacked by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei because
he was labeled as "a liberal-minded minister" and not close
enough to the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami was appointed by Khamenei as member of the
Supreme Council for Cultural Revolution early this year.

</P>
<P>
He said his visit to Kuwait came within the strategic policy of
"peace and international cooperation" now being followed by his

<HEADLINE> China Beats South Korea 5-0 to Retain Sudirman Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion China
retained the Sudirman Cup for the world mixed team badminton
championship here on Saturday by beating South Korea 5-0 in the
final.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in 48 hours that China had beaten South
Korea, their first win having been at group level. The score then
was 3-2.
</P>
<P>
China's mixed doubles pair of Liu Yong and Ge Fei set the tone
for the match with a rout of Kim Dong Moon and Ra Kyung Min.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans were constantly on the defence, with Liu Yong
smashing powerfully and, when they tried to keep the shuttle low,
Ge Fei outplayed them from the front court. They won the match
15-7, 15-8.
</P>
<P>
Dong Jiong, the All-England champion, who is the top seed in
the individual event, increased China's lead by beating Park Sung
Woo 15-9, 15-11.
</P>
<P>
Dong trailed 7-1 in the second game but rallied with his
deceptive shots and clever tactics, which a jaded Park lacked.
Dong now held a record of four victories and two losses in all
their encounters.
</P>
<P>
Gong Zhichao, the world number two who beat Lee Joo Hyun in
straight games on Thursday, rolled over the South Korean 11-2 in
the first game of the women's singles.
</P>
<P>
Lee once led the second game 7-1. But Gong, who had not lost to
Lee since the China Open in 1993, staged a comeback to win 11-7
and secure China's second consecutive title at the championship
since the biennial event began in 1989.
</P>
<P>
China won the cup for the first time at last championship in
Lausanne, Switzerland, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the men's doubles, Lin Liwen and Chen Xingdong beat South
Korea's Ha Tae Kwon and Kang Kyung Jin in 15-7, 15-2.
</P>
<P>
World top women's doubles pair Ge Fei and Gu Jun then defeated
Ra Kyung Min and Kim Shin Young 15-7 and 15-10 to keep China's
winning record clean, sending over 200 Chinese fans in Scotstoun
Leisure Center into ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
"If it was a surprising performance that brought us to victory
at last championship, we won today with our true strength and the
team's solidarity. We deserve the cup," Chinese coach Li Yongbo
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Denmark, which lost to China and South Korea
respectively in the semi-finals, are both placed third at the
championship.

<HEADLINE> Afghan-Writethru: Last Major Afghan City Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia today captured Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of northern
warlord Rashid Dostum, dealing a heavy blow to the anti-Taliban
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The victorious Taliban fighters on jeeps and tanks have entered
Mazar-e-Sharif, capital of Balkh Province, about 300 kilometers
northwest of Kabul, late in the day, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
Afghan sources in Pakistan said Dostum, who is allied with
former military chief of the ousted Afghan government and a Shiite
faction leader, has fled Afghanistan by helicopter to neighboring
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Mazar-e-Sharif, the only major city which the
Taliban had not gained control after they ousted the Kabul
government last September, came hours after the Taliban and their
allied forces took Sheberghan in the next-door Jowzjan Province,
which is Dostum's hometown and regarded as the most secure
military base.
</P>
<P>
The defeat of Dostum, considered the strongest warlord in the
anti-Taliban alliance, was brought about mainly by the defection
of his right-hand man, General Abudul Malik, who staged a
disastrous revolt early this week against his former boss.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion cleared the way for further northward advances by
the Taliban which already controlled two-thirds of Afghanistan
including Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban claim that they have linked up with Malik's forces
to fight the Dostum-led opposition alliance, which includes the
forces of ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and the
Shiite Hezb-i-Wahdat faction.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Malik's revolt, the Taliban launched a
two-pronged offensive against the anti-Taliban forces, capturing
three provinces in northern Afghanistan including Faryab, Samangan
and Jowzjan.
</P>
<P>
With the fall of Mazar-e-Sharif, the Taliban have seriously
impaired the morale of the opposition and removed one of the
strongest fighting forces in the grouping, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
However, it means only an end to the northern warlord but not
to the war in the country, they noted.

UAE's exports to Pakistan included petroleum and petroleum
products while imports from Pakistan covered rice, textiles,
carpets, fresh vegetables, spices and leather products.

in the UAE, accounting for around one-sixth of the total UAE's
population. The number of workers from Pakistan in UAE is second
only to that from India.

ADDIS ABABA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Vice Foreign
Minister Tekeda Alemu today said his country's image has improved
remarkably over the last six years.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today to mark the sixth anniversary
of the overthrow of former Mengistu regime which falls on May
28, Tekeda said Ethiopia's foreign policy has won the support of
the international community which is important in ensuring peace,
stability, democracy and fostering economic growth in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said, Ethiopia along with the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) and the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD), has been working towards the prevalence of
peace and stability in neighboring Somalia as well as the
realization of regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
He said, "with no peace and government, Somalia could be a hot
bed of terrorists who are a threat of the existing peace in
Ethiopia and other countries of the region."
</P>
<P>
Referring to regional cooperation, Tekeda said Ethiopia is
committed to the consolidation of the IGAD which is vital to
bring about economic integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) to which Ethiopia and other countries in the
region are a party is not dynamic makes it imperative to
strengthen IGAD," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat telephoned Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein this afternoon on the latest
development of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The phone conversation was held during the enlarged session of
talks between the Egyptian and Jordanian sides at the Jordanian
port city of Aqaba, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak flew to Jordan today for a few-hour meeting with
Hussein, as part of his intensified diplomacy to salvage the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which collapsed in mid-March
after Israel started Har Homa settlement project for Jews in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held after the summit, the Egyptian
president refused to divulge any details of Egypt's new
initiatives before further discussions with the Palestinian and
Israeli sides.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he will send top advisor Osama el-Baz to Israel
tomorrow to continue talks held with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian and Israeli leaders agreed to meet in the Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Tuesday, the second this year, to
discuss "constructive" ideas to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot confirm that our efforts will succeed one hundred
percent as circumstances are difficult," he said, "but the current
situation is worth a drive by any means."
</P>
<P>
According to Israel TV, Netanyahu, during talks with Baz
Friday, offered a compromise under which Israel will finish
infrastructure for Har Homa, but the house building will stop for
several months.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu spokesman Shai Bazk today denied that Israel is
ready to freeze the construction in a move to end a crisis with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has recently proposed a six-month freeze on the
construction of settlements while negotiations on the future
of Jerusalem are underway.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries that have signed
peace treaties with Israel, are serving as mediators in the
Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> International Climbers' Meet to Be Held in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- An international climbers' meet
is to be held in Nepal this week to mark the first human ascent of
the world highest Mt. Qomolangma 44 years ago, organizers said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event from Wednesday, hosted by the Nepal
Mountaineering Association (NMA), will be attended by about 60
climbers and officials of mountaineering agencies from some 20
countries including Britain, China, France, Germany, India, Japan,
Mongolia, Russia and Switzerland, NMA president Dawa Norbu Sherpa
told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the meet is regarded as the most important
event in the mountaineering field in Asia since the 50th general
assembly of the Union of International Alpinist Association
(UIAA), which was held here in 1982.
</P>
<P>
In addition to commemorate the first ascent of the 8,848-meter
Qomolangma summit by Nepali climber Tenzing Norgay and British
Edmund Hillary via the South Face on May 29, 1953, participants at
the meet will also discuss the problems and trends facing current
Himalayan climbing activities, Sherpa said.
</P>
<P>
The participants will include French climbing veteran Maurice
Herzog, who first ever scaled a Himalayan mountain above 8,000
meters in 1950, and Swiss geologist Toni Hagen, who has
contributed most of his life to the geological study of Himalayas,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the NMA president, a 10-point declaration adopted
by the 1982 UIAA meeting on the protection of mountain culture and
environment will also be reviewed during the meet.
</P>
<P>
The participants are also scheduled to visit the site of the
International Mountain Museum, which is under construction in the
western Nepali city of Pokhara, about 120 km west of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The NMA hopes that the International Climbers' Meet would help
garner International support for future NMA programs like clean-up
of Mt. Qomolangma and other expedition peaks and training of local
youth mountaineers, Sherpa said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China's top leader Jiang Zemin
today called on the nation's film makers to produce more excellent
works in keeping with the needs of the people and the times.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Chinese film artists can live up to the
expectation of the people and China's film industry is promising,
said President Jiang Zemin, who is also General Secretary of
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of the Chinese filmmakers who "have recently
produced a number of excellent movies which received widespread
public acclaim."
</P>
<P>
In a discussion with veteran artists of motion pictures along
with other senior Party and state leaders at a ceremony of the
annual Huabiao Award, China's highest tribute to films today,
Jiang said the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics has given Chinese movie-makers a wide playing
field with which they can make the most of their talent.
</P>
<P>
"It is the pressing need for the artists to depict, reflect and
eulogize the greatness of the cause, and display it in a poetic
way," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged China's filmmakers to learn from life and people,
increase their understanding of China's reform and opening-up
drive as well as the creative activities of the people so as to
"produce more excellent works that can meet the requirements of
the people and the times, edify people and give joy to them."
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's meeting were Liu Huaqing, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of Central Committee of

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Welcomes Egypt's Peace Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel Meguid today welcomed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
diplomatic move with the Arab leaders to salvage the Mideast peace
process which is experiencing its "toughest stage."
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian peace drive is welcomed by all the Arab leaders,"
Meguid said in a press statement issued here, noting the Arabs'
keenness on preventing the peace march from falling apart.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League backs any Arab peace drive that aims at
bringing the peace process back on track and maintaining regional
development and stability," he added.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief said that Saturday's summit meeting in Aqaba,
Jordan, between Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein falls within the
framework of Egypt's peace-saving efforts.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had a few-hour meeting with Hussein, in a bid to revive
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which collapsed in mid-March
after Israel started Har Homa settlement project for Jews in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Arab solidarity is very much required to back up Arab efforts
to establish a just and comprehensive regional peace," Meguid
added.
</P>
<P>
While voicing hope that the ongoing Arab consultations would
make a breakthrough in the stalled peace process, Meguid denounced
"Israel's intransigent stands" on continuing settlement building
on occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's top advisor Osama el-Baz flew to Israel today to
prepare for the president's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has reportedly proposed a five-point plan to revive the
negotiations, under which there should be a "political solution,"
instead of a temporary suspension, to the Har Homa project.
</P>
<P>
Other points include the resumption of security cooperation, a
halt of Jewish settlement construction in the West Bank, and
immediate restart of talks on the next stage of Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank and the final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the U.S. and the European Union apparently support the
plan. But it is still unknown whether Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat has endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries that have signed
peace treaties with Israel, have been serving as active mediators
in the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin in Discussion with Chinese Film Artists (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said that the good films have proved that Chinese
filmmakers work with a responsible attitude toward the nation and
people, and to history and future, as well as art.
</P>
<P>
Motion picture making, as a comprehensive art form widely loved
by the people, plays a special role in the socialist ethical and
cultural progress, he said, adding that an excellent film can
greatly educate, inspire and enlighten people of a generation and
sometimes several generations.
</P>
<P>
He called on the film industry to be always oriented to the
Chinese people, and reflect their historic achievements and hail
the Chinese spirit of hard-working towards the progress and
prosperity of the Chinese nation. Only those films with Chinese
characteristics and based on the needs of and loved by the Chinese
people in the first place can win genuine recognition in the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, he encouraged the filmmakers to learn from all the
outstanding and progressive achievements of art in the world,
including those of western countries, with a view to ultimately
enriching the national culture of China.
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong to be blindly arrogant and refuse to learn the
good things from others, and it is wrong and dangerous too to turn
such learning into sheer imitation, with no creativity of our
own, even become appendages of foreign cultures," he noted.
</P>
<P>
While the orientation of "serving the people and serving
socialism" must be adhered to, the policy of "letting a hundred
flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend" should
be carried out, he said, adding that film-makers should be
encouraged to freely choose the themes of their work and explore
different artistic styles.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that the approaching 21st century will be a great
era for China's socialist construction, when there will emerge a
new horizon of prosperity for country's film industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the conference, China has witnessed marked
progress in the industry of motion pictures, particularly since a
project to encourage production of high-quality films was launched
nationwide last year.
</P>
<P>
Such efforts have paid off, Sun Jiazheng, minister of
Broadcasting, Film and TV, said. He added that some outstanding
films have been praised by film critics and movie-goers alike.
</P>
<P>
Chinese film artists attending the ceremony agreed in a later
discussion that the most important source for artistic expression
is simply life itself. "The fundamental way to lift China's film
industry out of the doldrums is to produce movies for the people,"
said Feng Xiaoning, a film director.
</P>
<P>
"Heroism should be the everlasting theme for film and Chinese
film-makers should put Chinese heroes on screen," said screenwriter
Wang Xingdong.

ALGIERS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed
Attaf has called upon the African states to provide all the
necessary conditions for peace and stability on the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Attaf made the remark on the occasion marking the 34th
anniversary of the signing of the charter of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) on May 25, 1963.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Radio today quoted him as expressing concern over the
existence of conflicts in many African states, saying that losses
in human lives, increasing numbers of refugees and displaced
people on account of these conflicts, necessitates the
mobilization of genuine efforts on the part of all Africans.
</P>
<P>
He said Algeria attaches great importance to enchancing
inter-African cooperation and is seriously endeavoring to
strengthen cooperation and exchanges with other African states.
</P>
<P>
Though confronted with its own crucial problems and conditions
at home, Algeria will relentlessly extend its share in the
collective efforts undertaken by the African community to
implement the ideals in the OAU charter, said Attaf.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Algeria considers peace, stability and
development as supreme objectives of its foreign policy, and is,

<HEADLINE> Interview: PLC to Play Bigger Role in Serving HK People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) is expected to play a bigger role in serving the
Hong Kong people in the coming months, said Rita Fan, president
of the PLC.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the 52-year-old Rita Fan
said that the PLC of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) is essentially different from the Legislative Council
under the British Hong Kong authorities.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan, who served on the Legislative Council under the
British authorities for nine years, said that as stated in the
Letters Patent and Royal Instructions, the legislature under the
British Hong Kong authorities is merely a consultative body
without genuine legislative power.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the Basic Law grants the legislature of the
HKSAR more powers in legislation and supervision over the
administration.
</P>
<P>
"According to the Basic Law, for example, the PLC shall endorse
the Chief Executive's appointment of the Chief Justice of the
Court of Final Appeal and Chief Judges of the High Court of the
HKSAR, while the British Hong Kong legislature has no right to
discuss matters like that," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Rita Fan noted, "We shall be very prudent in using the
power and always show a sense of responsibility for the Hong Kong
people."
</P>
<P>
As a way to show commitment to the interests of the Hong Kong
people, the PLC has taken measures to enhance transparency of its
work. All PLC meetings are open to Hong Kong citizens as well as
the news media.
</P>
<P>
"Thirty visitors can sit in on the PLC's plenary meetings as
well as meetings of the House Committee, Finance Committee and
some Bill Committees," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong citizens are also welcome to examine the registration
of the interests of PLC members, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, I stand for a new 'parliamentary culture' in the PLC,
that is, to discuss and study matters in a pragmatic and positive
way," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This does not mean a requirement for a uniform voice, but
features rational and reasonable opinions based on mutual trust
and mutual respect instead of personal attacks or insults," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone disagree with a specific policy, he or she should
raise constructive suggestions in addition to criticism. That will
help the PLC reduce empty talks and win the recognition of the
citizens," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The PLC's work is for the interests of the majority of the
Hong Kong people and for the implementation of the principle of
 'One Country, Two Systems' in Hong Kong," she said, adding that
the PLC members are expected to always bear in mind their
responsibility and the overall interests of Hong Kong's future
and HK citizens.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan was elected a PLC member at the end of last December
and its president in late January this year. Before the
elections, she discussed her participation in the PLC with her
family.
</P>
<P>
"My family supported me and I decided to stand out," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is at a critical moment of transition, and I have no
time to consider personal losses," she said.
</P>
<P>
"People will see that the principle of 'One Country, Two
Systems' is implemented in Hong Kong and Hong Kong will become
more prosperous and stable under this principle," she said.

ALGIERS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen human heads, including
those of two women, were found on a road in Djelfa, 300 kilometers
south of the Algerian capital of Algiers, reported the Algerian
daily El-Khabar today.
</P>
<P>
The heads were found by a taxi driver on a road at Ain Maaabad,
15 kilometers north of Djelfa, which links Algiers with the
extreme south of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The heads were then brought to a local hospital to be

JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Software piracy in South Africa
has dropped by 30 percent over the past four years, the local daily
Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The piracy has dropped from 80 percent in 1993 to just below 50
percent, spokesman for South African chapter of the Business Software
Alliance (BSA) Gordon Frazer was quoted as reporting
</P>
<P>
It is an "encouraging sign" as South Africa used to have one of
the highest computer software piracy levels in the world, Frazer said.
</P>
<P>
BSA is a group of computer software companies around the world
dedicated to fighting the theft of their products.
</P>
<P>
Frazer expressed that although piracy in South Africa has
diminished, the country still lags behind the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We know we will never get rid of Software piracy entirely, but
South Africa is showing signs that it is a mature market.
</P>
<P>
"To get the piracy level from 80 percent to less than 50 percent
in four years shows that consumers are aware of the piracy probelm
and are doing something about it," he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Gun Craze Sweeps S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The face of legal gun
ownership in South Africa has taken on a new hue.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by South Africa's largest small arms
retailer, E'Gunshop, a local weekly magazine, City Press,
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed a dramatic trend towards purchase of small
arms by black people," E'Gunshop Director Cavin Stead told the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
He said his six branches in Johannesburg are experiencing
tremendous growth and plan to expand new network of dealerships
to other regions.
</P>
<P>
Stead said according to a rough estimate, about 280,000
firearms licences were issued in 1993, of which about 95 percent
were to white buyers.
</P>
<P>
But the buyer profile has now changed completely, with 80
percent of about 250,000 licences being issued to black gun
buyers last year.
</P>
<P>
This situation, the arms sale director said, "is indicative of
crime situation in our country, where even the police are at
times reluctant to enter dangerous areas in some townships".

George Fivaz of his administrative burdens and allow him to
concentrate on managing and controlling policing operations.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, although Kahn, believed to be an
outstanding businessman in South africa, would be reporting to
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, there would a
direct link to President Nelson Mandela and his deputy Mbeki.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Double Oil Price by 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is considering a
proposal to increase the country's petrol price from 11 Naira (0.13
US dollars) a liter to 25 Naira (0.29 dollars) by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Punch reported today that the proposal was contained in a
report to the government by the Vision 2010 Committee, Nigeria's first
long-term planning body.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the petrol price will go up to 15
Naira a liter by the end of the year, and to 20 Naira in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the reform is to gradually remove the gap between the
prices of oil products in the domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil supply to the country's refineries is currently priced at
17 dollars per barrel, while the international market price has been
averaged at 20 dollars since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The unification of the two markets will pave for the way for the
deregulation of the refinery sector, which will not only result in
increased production, but also allow free import to make up the
supply gap, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ill refineries and controlled import have been producing petrol
scarcities time and again in this largest oil-producing nation in
Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Urgent: S. Leone Army Takes Over Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leone soldiers today
ousted the civilian government and President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah
fled by helicopter to neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here this afternoon quoted Corporal Gborie,
a military spokesman, as saying in a broadcast on State Radio
that the army is now "in control of the state."
</P>
<P>
The report said the army had taken control of parliament and
the government offices at the State House as well as the
National Radio and Television.
</P>
<P>
Gborie said a round-the-clock curfew had been imposed on the
capital.
</P>
<P>
He warned Nigherian troops stationed in the west African
country not to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troops should surrender their weapons and return to
their bases as what was happening was an internal matter, Gborie
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Nigerian troops had tried to prevent
the Sierra Leone soldiers entering certain areas.
</P>
<P>
Gborie called for the return to Sierra Leone of Foday Sankoh,
former leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
Sankoh is currently detained in Nigeria, earlier reports said.
</P>
<P>
The coup leaders also want the return from exile of Captain
Solomon Musa, a former deputy military leader linked to coup
allegations in 1993, and of General Julius Maada Bio, who led a
successful coup in January last year before handing over power to
Kabbah in March the same year.
</P>
<P>
Heavy gunfire broke out soon after 0500 GMT in the Sierra
Leone capital today. Shooting continued this morning. However, no
casulties had been reported so far. Freetown's streets were
deserted.
</P>
<P>
Solders broke into housing compounds of United Nations staff
and Lebanese businessmen, taking cars and fuel and in some
cases looting the houses. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Cameroun will again appear
before the International Court of Justice, or the world court, next
month over the disputed Bakassi peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Both parties are to argue their cases in the court in June after
they submitted their contentions to the court on the oil-rich area
early last year, the Sunday Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, underground bilateral talks are going on between them at
government level to explore the possibility of settling the matter out
of court.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Equitorial Guinea is also involved in the
peace talks which take place from time to time because of a border
line from Nigeria that cuts through Cameroun to Equitorial Guinea.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say what have been achieved from the talks.
</P>
<P>
Dispute over Bakassi has caused repeated clashes between nigeria
and Cameroun since 1994. The world court has ordered a cessation of
hostilities by the two countries pending the final determination of
the case before it.
</P>
<P>
But hostilities have persisted. The latest took place last Tuesday
when, according to Nigerian military sources, Cameroun soldiers
attacked Nigerian troops at the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Bakassi has also been tabled before the United
Nations Security Council.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Hopes for Cooperative Ties with Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan looks forward to a
meaningful and cooperative relationship with the Afghan Taliban
government in the interest of peace and security of the region.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub
Khan here today at a news conference when announcing Pakistani
government's recognition of the Taliban government.
</P>
<P>
Asked about development of the relationship between Pakistan
and Afghanistan, Gohar said that "there were no major disputes
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is observing closely the developments in Afghanistan,
he said, predicting that in the next few days Taliban will bring
the whole country under their control.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan supports the takeover of the whole Afghanistan by
Taliban," Gohar added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Afghan people have gone through immense
sufferings and have seen their country ravaged by an 18-year-old
war.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the major task facing the Afghan people is
mass reconstruction of the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister also said that there are now still 1.4
million Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Along with the improvement of the situation in Afghanistan,
these refugees will be requested to go back home, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Ambassador will go to the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif Monday morning, the Foreign Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Gohar said that the Pakistani envoy together with a media group
will leave for Mazar-e-Sharif, capital of the northwestern Afghan
province Balkh, which was captured by Islamic Taliban militia
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister also said that Pakistan is to reopen its
Embassy in Kabul shortly.
</P>
<P>
In answering a question, Ayub Khan said that Pakistan is the
first country in the world to have recognized the Taliban
government.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the response from the Iranian side about the
Pakistani move, the Foreign Minister said that "the response is
favorable".
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan announced earlier at the press briefing that "the
Pakistani government has now decided to accord formal recognition
to the new government of the Islamic State of Afghanistan" led by

the territory of Afghanistan and is representative of all ethnic
groups in that country," he said.
</P>

The Foreign Minister also expressed the hope that following the
recent developments in Afghanistan, the United Nations, the OIC
countries and other international organizations would also "take a
just decision of recognizing the new government of the Islamic
State of Afghanistan."

<HEADLINE> PLC Chief on PLC's Contributions to HK's Smooth Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) and what has been done by
the PLC are meant entirely for Hong Kong's smooth transition, said
Rita Fan, PLC president.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Rita Fan said that
through joint efforts of its 60 members, the PLC has been focusing
on legislation which is imperatively indispensable for the
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
She said that the PLC has passed the Holidays (1997 and 1998)
Bill and is examining seven draft bills including the National
Flag and National Emblem Bill, the Regional Flag and Regional
Emblem Bill, bills on Public Order and Societies (Amendment) and
bills on the Provisional Urban Council, Regional Council and
District Boards.
</P>
<P>
"The PLC is expected to read more bills submitted from the
Chief Executive's Office of the HKSAR and approve them by June 30
after debate," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Rita Fan, the bills passed will be further
confirmed by the PLC when the HKSAR is established and become
effective after the Chief Executive's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan noted that "The PLC's work is indispensable to the
effective operation of the HKSAR."
</P>
<P>
In order to keep legislation going and to coordinate with work
of the Chief Executive Office, Rita Fan meets with Tung Chee Hwa
once a week to discuss relevant matters.
</P>
<P>
The chairman and vice-chairman of the PLC House Committee also
meet with officials of Tung's office weekly to discuss matters
concerning the bills to be handled or tabled at PLC's weekly
meetings, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said, "Time is pressing for the PLC to undertake its
legislative work and PLC's work has proven the necessity of the
establishment of the PLC."
</P>
<P>
The formation of the PLC in fact resulted from the British
Hong Kong authorities' stubbornly clinging to the "Constitutional
Package" which contravened the Sino-British Joint Declaration,
the Principle of Convergence with the Basic Law and the agreements
and understandings reached between the Chinese and British sides,
she said.
</P>
<P>
"As there is no 'through train' for the existing Legislative
Council, there must be a legislature to examine the necessary laws
and ordinances for the normal operation of the HKSAR in order to
avoid a 'legal vacuum'," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan said that a number of options for the legislation of
the HKSAR had been taken into consideration, including legislation
by the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's
Congress, by the Preparatory Committee, and by the Chief
Executive's instructions, but the best choice was made to set up
the PLC.
</P>
<P>
The PLC, made up of 60 permanent Hong Kong residents, will
fully manifest the principles of "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy", she said.
</P>
<P>
However, "the establishment of the PLC represents just an
expedient measure to make necessary laws for the establishment of
the HKSAR," she said, adding that when the first Legislative
Council of the HKSAR is established, the PLC will stop functioning.
</P>
<P>
She said that since the British Hong Kong authorities dislike
the PLC, it had to meet in Shenzhen, a South China city bordering
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But, she said, the PLC will not affect the administration of
the British Hong Kong authorities nor the functioning of the
existing Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
As 33 of the PLC members now serve at the HK Legislative
Council, "all PLC meetings are held during weekends so that those
members can perform their duties in the Legislative Council," she
said, citing it as an example of arrangement meant for Hong Kong's
smooth transition.

<HEADLINE> US, Gulf Forces Begin Joint Air Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Air forces from the United
States, Bahrain, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) today
began joint air exercises as a step to boost their military
cooperation, the United Arab Emirates' Wam news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency gave no details about the exercises, but
informed sources here said it was held in Bahrain and will last
for several days.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the mock battles are likely to face Iran's
recent military exercises and its threat to close the Strait of
Hormuz, an important thoroughfare for oil exporting from the Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
Observers note that the joint exercises follow at the heels of
an Iran's military drill in the Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman,
close to the Strait of Hormuz, starting on May 11.
</P>
<P>
Earlier more than 200,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards staged a
drill along the entire Iranian Gulf coasts, a move coupled with
the military's threat to close the strait in case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the Gulf states which include the UAE, Bahrain,
Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman have expressed their serious
concern over Iran's moves.
</P>
<P>
Binford Peay, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Central Command,
who visited the region after Iran's exercises, said that
Washington will continue to commit itself to the Gulf security and
warned Iran of actions if it closes Hormuz Strait.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. forces are watching the region closely to maintain
security and stability and counter any dangers and challengers
that might face it in general," said Peay during his visit to
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Strait of Hormuz is not only important to
U.S. interests but also to the world and U.S. will never allow the
strait to be closed.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe Iran can do that (close the strait). Access
to the strait is very important not just to the U.S., but it
is vitally important for the entire world. I can assure you that
we are going to keep the strait open," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> France Holds First Round of Legislative Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 39 million French voters were
casting their votes today to choose 577 deputies of the National
Assembly from 6,351 candidates in the first round of the
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The voters will choose between the "new shared elan" proposed
by President Jacques Chirac to push forward the country's economic
growth and to join a single European currency, and "changing the
future" called for by the opposition socialists.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac today cast his vote in Sarran, the central
department of Correze, where he is a deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
Because the number of candidates in the election is the highest
of all legislative elections since 1958, the votes are expected to
scatter from mainstream political parties to marginal parties
coming up in the French political stage, making vague the outcome
of the first round.
</P>
<P>
According to the last poll published in France on May 17, the
outgoing ruling majority of Rally for the Republic and the Union
for the French Democracy will have a shoulder-to-shoulder run with
the opposition Socialist Party and Communist Party in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
But President Chirac's allies will finally secure a new
majority in the National Assembly with 30 to 135 seats more than
the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, the polls showed.
</P>
<P>
In the last legislative election in 1993, the ruling majority
won 93 seats in the first round. But this time, the number of
seats to be won by them in the first round is expected to be
smaller considering the large number of candidates.
</P>

ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan announced here today that his government has now decided
to accord formal recognition to the new government of the Islamic
State of Afghanistan led by the Islamic Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the new government fulfills all criteria for de

"It (the Taliban government) is now in effective control of
most of the territory of Afghanistan and is representative of all
ethnic groups in that country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Meets President-Elect Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
today met with Mohammad Khatami, the president-elect, to give
"appropriate guidelines."
</P>
<P>
The meeting came one day after Khatami declared a landslide
victory in Friday's election to win the presidency. Iran's
official news agency IRNA reported the meeting in a short and
brief story, giving no details.
</P>
<P>
Last night, Khamenei congratulated Khatami on his victory after
the election results were announced and urged the supporters of
the other candidates to help the president-elect.
</P>
<P>
The supreme leader was said to be in favor, or at least in
tacit support, of Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, Parliament speaker and
candidate of the conservative wing and Khatami's chief rival in
the race. To some, Khatami's overwhelming victory came as
a surprise.
</P>
<P>
Khatami won more than 20 million votes, 69 of the total, in
Friday's presidential election, about three times the votes
received by Nateq-Nouri. This was the highest supporting rate for
a president since the victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that the real challenge for the new president
lies in his relations with the leader. The relatively moderate
clergy stresses freedom within the framework of the Constitution
and laid greater emphasis on the rule of the law, which risks
being interpreted as defiance toward the legitimacy of Velayat-e
Faqih (Islamic religious jurisprudence) held by the leader.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has to be very cautious and prudent. In Iran,
presidents can come and go but the supreme leader is for lifetime.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was sacked by Khamenei in 1993 as cultural and Islamic
guidance minister because he was labeled as "liberal-minded" and
not close enough to the supreme leader. However, he was appointed
by Khamenei as a member of the Supreme Council for Cultural
Revolution early this year.

BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 children gathered at
Tian'anmen Square in the heart of Beijing today to celebrate the
upcoming Children's Day and Hong Kong's return through a favorite
form of artistic expression: drawing pictures on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Many pedestrians on the square were attracted by the colorful
chalk illustrations of China's national flag, the flag and the
emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), as
well as other designs symbolizing world peace.
</P>
<P>
"I am expecting Hong Kong's return to our motherland, and I
hope people all over the world will live peacefully," said Song
Xu, a Beijing primary school pupil, as he pointed at his paintings
depicting doves of peace flying over the national flag and the
flag of HK SAR.
</P>
<P>
Li Ai, a Hong Kong girl living with her father in Beijing for
two years, said she is looking forward to going back to Hong Kong
on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"I love Beijing and Hong Kong, and I think Hong Kong will
become more beautiful at that time," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not the first time such activities are held for children
to celebrate a festival of their own," said Yin Yan, a Beijing
official in charge of organizing celebrations for International
Children's Day, which falls on June 1.

"But this year's celebration is special and more meaningful
with Hong Kong's return," she said.

BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A Catholic church in the northern
German city of Luebeck was destroyed early Sunday morning in a
fire suspectedly set by neo-Nazis, German media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that the fire was first noticed by passers-by
at about 1:30 a.m. local time (00:30 GMT Sunday). Initial
investigations showed that the fire started at a wooden
construction connected to the church and quickly spread to the
roof. Fire fighters were still battling the fire several hours
later.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was injured in the fire, they said.
</P>
<P>
Police linked the incident to neo-Nazis because the church's
wall was smeared with swastikas and the name of a Luebeck pastor
who once granted an Algerian family asylum inside the building.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Envoy Heads for Israel for More Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
sent his top advisor Osamz el-Baz to Israel today for further
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on new
proposals for reviving the flagging peace process.
</P>
<P>
Baz will continue his talks with Israeli officials held last
Friday in preparation for the convocation of Mubarak-Netanyahu
summit in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Tuesday,
which will be the second this year.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot confirm that our efforts will succeed one hundred
percent as circumstances are difficult, but the current situation
is worth a drive by any means," Mubarak told a press conference
after a meeting with Jordanian King Hussein at the Jordan's city
of Aqaba Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak flew to Jordan for a few-hour meeting with the
Jordanian monarch, as part of his intensified diplomacy to
salvage the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which collapsed
again in mid-March after Israel started the settlement project
for Jews in Har Homa of Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian head of state has recently proposed a six-month
freeze on the construction of settlements while negotiations on
the future of Jerusalem are underway.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's initiative, according to an anonymous Arab diplomat,
also envisages the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli security
cooperation, the immediate resumption of talks on Israeli troops
redeployment in the West Bank and the start of final status talks
between the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Israel.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown whether the Egyptian proposal has been endorsed
by PNA President Yasser Arafat, who paid a two-day visit here
early this week and had a telephone call on Mubarak and Hussein
during the Aqaba summit.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak refused to divulge any details of Egypt's new
initiatives before further discussions with the Palestinian and
Israeli sides.
</P>
<P>
"We still cannot talk about initiatives till we see the
Israeli side and the ideas they have and carry them to the
Palestinians. If they agree, they will sit together and engage in
negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel TV, Netanyahu, during talks with Baz
Friday, offered a compromise under which Israel will finish
infrastructure for Har Homa, but the house-building will stop for
several months.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesmen for Netanyahu has denied that Israel is ready to
freeze the construction in a move to end the two-month-old crisis
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, in
1979, has been a key mediator in the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Iran's New President Faces Uphill Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The election is over in Iran and
Seyed Mohammad Khatami, the moderate candidate of the ruling
establishment, is now the president-elect of the Islamic
Republic. The victory has been overwhelming, but the winner seems
to have no reason to be overwhelmed with joy.
</P>
<P>
Political specialists pointed out that Khatami, who will become
Iran's 5th president since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in August,
now faces a uphill task much more difficult than the presidential
race itself; the situations are more complicated and thus the road
ahead more tortuous.
</P>
<P>
There is a list of hot issues to be tackled, to name few,
political freedom, democracy, moderation, inflation, unemployment,
Iran-European Union crisis and Iran-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The subtlest and sternest challenge of all perhaps will be the
new president's relations with the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,
who has reigned the country for eight years since the death of
late spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, presidents can come and go but the leader is for
lifetime. Apparently Khatami has to adjust and improve his
relations with the leader, who sacked him as minister of culture and
Islamic guidance for alleged "liberal-mindedness" in 1993 and who
was at least in tacit support of his major rival, conservative
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri during the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, considered relative moderate and well-educated,
stresses freedom within the framework of the Constitution and the
rule of law. But this risks being interpreted as defiance toward
the legitimacy of Velayat-e Faqih (Islamic religious
jurisprudence) held by the leader.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said it would be a political suicide for anyone to
try to question the Velayat-e Faqih in this Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
Moreover the new president has to do something to cater for
those who had rallied behind him, mostly young people, women,
university students and those living in big cities, who have a
strong sentiment against the extremist religious rule and are
eager for changes in a country where political democracy, freedom
and moderation are taboo.
</P>
<P>
Therefore any action to be taken by the new president in that
respect would possibly spark clashes with the country's
conservative wing, which enjoys a majority in the parliament and
vows to stick 100 percent to the Islamic doctrine and value "day
and night."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Iran's New President Faces Uphill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 25 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
Economically, the job can proved to be as hard as hot political
issues. Millions of Iranian citizens have been crying out about
their economic hardships, namely the runaway inflation, increasing
unemployment, heavy taxation, high prices but low income.
</P>
<P>
Economic concerns had been on top of a list of 15 issues in a
public opinion poll conducted on the eve of the presidential
election by the National Center for Studies and Assessing Public
Opinion, affiliated to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic
Guidance.
</P>
<P>
As oil price dropped in 1993 and 1994, Iran's oil export
revenue fell so greatly that it ran into a big foreign debt
problem, which has given rise to the drastic devaluation of the
local currency Rial and triggered double-digit price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The exacerbated economic situation tampered with the incumbent
government's control over the financial market and retail goods
market. Western economists estimated the inflation rate at 48
percent in 1993, 52 percent in 1994, 67.5 percent in 1995, and
65.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However the rise in minimum wage has failed to keep
track. Government employees have to seek more extra jobs to make
their families' ends meet; youngesters joining the growing labor
force soon find it hard to get a job.
</P>
<P>
These are the long-standing problems awaiting the new
president. Khatami, relatively inexperienced compared with his
strong cultural, educational and religious background, would be
under tremendous pressure to deal with these problems.
</P>
<P>
Foreign affairs seem to be a dangerous tract full of mines.
Although Khatami advocates good relations with world countries,
the objective is no easy to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati had hinted that it
is the supreme leader who defines the foreign policy. The new
president has to exhibit his diplomatic shrewdness through dealing
with crucial issues such as the diplomatic crisis between Iran
and Germany as well as other EU members, the isolation and
potential military threat by the U.S, the Middle East peace
process and many other disputes and problems between Iran and its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is not expected to bring about drastic changes in
Iran's relations with Western countries; however, he has his own
vision of a moderate foreign policy, which was declared as
"abandoning hostile and extremist characteristics."
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old black-turbaned clergy said in his campaign for
the presidency that "Iran is an independent country capable of
recognizing its own interest and should not be involved in
matters that cause international friction."
</P>
<P>
Iran "should refrain from actions that may create such an
impression. We would like the international community to be free
of any friction, and we are fully prepared to use the Islamic
Republic's good offices to remove any tension within the world
community," he promised.
</P>
<P>
Of course it is easier said than done. With the massive
support he enjoyed during the election, the new president can make
good use of his mandate to benefit the country and its people.
This task requires wisdom, expertise, and often more importantly,
caution.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Continue Present Policy, Says Rafsanjani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today expressed his support to his successor
President-elect Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing president said at a two-hour press conference
that "with the large number of votes, I hope that he will be
successful in pursuing the goals of the revolution."
</P>
<P>
In replying a question from Xinhua, he affirmed "the
policies of the new government will be continuation of the
present ones."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that the future president will be able to
continue development of the country and materialize goals of the
Islamic revolution through the popular backing and cooperation of
other sectors of the country.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on the heavy turnout in presidential
election Friday, he rejected the interpretation that this means a
wide protest against the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
"People took part in the elections and picked their president
on the basis of platform of the four contenders," he said,
"Hojatoleslam Mohammad Khatami's platform was found more
appealing."
</P>
<P>
Khatami was a joint candidate nominated by the two political
groups -- the pro-Rafsanjani technocrat group called G-6 and the
left wing called the Society of Combatant Clergymen (SCC).
</P>
<P>
Political analysts thus believed Khatami's election as
president also means victory for Rafsanjani who was believed to
have cast vote for Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that Khatami's election to the top executive
post has strengthened the position of the outgoing President
Rafsanjani who is expected chair the State Expediency Council
after steps down in August.
</P>
<P>
It also maintains the subtle balance in Iran's political arena
in which the moderates keep their hold on the executive branch as
the conservatives reinforced control over the legislative and
judicial branches.
</P>
<P>
Although Rafsanjani said that he would not interfere in
Khatami's program and all cabinet members would be designated
by the new president, observers believe that the new president
will surely give some ministerial posts to Rafsanjani's followers.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was elected the 5th president of the Islamic Republic
Friday by scoring a landslide victory, winning more than 20
million votes, 69 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Parliament deputies today issued a message of
congratulations to the president-elect and pledged to fully
cooperate with him.
</P>
<P>
In the message read at the open session of the Parliament, the
deputies said, "no doubt this great epic is a reinforcement of
ideals of the late Imam Khomeini and a renewal of allegiance with
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei."
</P>
<P>
Only 70 deputies backed Khatami as more than 170 deputies
of the 270-seat Parliament had thrown their support behind his
major contender, conservative Parliament Speaker Nateq-Nouri
during the elections.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Rejects US Allegations on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani today rejected U.S. charges of transfer of
Chinese chemical weapons to Iran, terming it as "a sheer
allegation."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said at a press conference "the United States is
usually trying to resort this sort of news in order to inculcate
that Iran is after manufacturing chemical weapons."
</P>
<P>
"This is a sheer allegation against Iran. We are not
interested in any sort of chemical weapons," said the Iranian
president.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran would never think of having or employing
the chemical weapon since "We have had such terrifying
experience during the Iraq-imposed war," apparently referring to
the 1980-1988 Iraqi-Iranian war.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the use of chemical weapons by Iraq during the
war, the outgoing Iranian head of state stressed "I hope the
experience would never happen (again) in any part of the world."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Iran's permanent representative to the U.N. Kamal
Kharazi also rejected the U.S. allegation in Washington, saying
"Washington has once again resorted to baseless claims in an
irresponsible manner in connection with the peaceful activities
of the Iranian chemical industries."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the
Senate Appropriation Subcommittee Thursday that the
U.S. administration "will cut off trade with two Chinese
companies and individuals for at least a year" on grounds of
their providing Iran with chemical weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi stressed that such statements, like similar cases in
the past, are aimed at depriving Iran of the legal right to
expand its chemical industries for non-military purposes in
accordance with the articles of the chemical weapons treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is a signatory to the Treaty on
Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and a victim of
these weapons during the Iraqi-Iranian war. Iran rejects all
allegations any plan to produce chemical weapons in the
country, he added.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani: German Ambassador Has to Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that Iran wants normal relations
with European countries but the German ambassador has to wait
to come back to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said at a press conference that decision to
refuse the German ambassador to come back to Tehran was made
by Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei. "So, he should stay away for
a while."
</P>
<P>
"I was bitter to see a friendly country mistreat us at
the instigation of the United States and Israel. So, the
Germans have to wait. Patience is constructive," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also attacked Germany for supplying chemical weapons
to Iraq during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq from
1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Rafsanjani blasted out at the Berlin court
ruling, terming the court "sinister" and "disgraceful".
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old president attacked Germany for "destroying
100-year friendship with Iran because of baseless verdict by
the Berlin court on April 10.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court ruled that the top political leadership in
Iran was behind the assassination of Kurdish opposition leaders
in Berlin's Mykonos restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The court gave life imprisonment to one Iranian national
and a Lebanese and sentenced two other Lebanese to long prison
terms on charge of assassinating the four Kurdish dissidents.
</P>
<P>
The verdict sparked diplomatic battle between Iran and
Germany as well as other European countries. EU has recalled
their ambassadors, suspended ministerial level contact and stop
critical dialogue.
</P>
<P>
However, it would be an imminent job for the new
government headed by President-elect Mohammad Khatami to deal with
the diplomatic crisis between Iran and the European countries.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan, who returned home early today from the United States,
termed his visit to that country as "highly successful."
</P>
<P>
Gohar also said he was "highly satisfied" with his visit as he
found a high degree of understanding and appreciation for the
policies of the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Gohar said his meetings with U.S.
government officials and key members of the Congress and the
Senate were "highly successful."
</P>
<P>
"Both sides welcomed the close and friendly relations which
happily exist between Pakistan and the United States, and
reaffirmed the desire to further broaden and strengthen bilateral
ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Views were exchanged on areas of mutual interest including the
Kashmir issue, the Indo-Pakistan dialogue, the situation in
Afghanistan, Central Asia and joint efforts to eradicate drug
trafficking, he said.
</P>
<P>
The initiative taken by Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif for
talks with India, he said, "was highly praised."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government reiterated its willingness to support this
process and recognized the need to address all issues that exist
between the two South Asian countries, including the Kashmir
issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gohar said the U.S. also promised to "energize" efforts towards
reimbursing Pakistan for the purchase of F-16 fighter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government also told him that it would continue to
make "good faith" efforts to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had indicated that
she would be taking a trip to Pakistan later this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Afghanistan, Gohar said he told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan during a meeting that "Taliban were a reality which could
not be wished away."
</P>
<P>
He called upon the world body to keep the seat of Afghanistan
vacant in the General Assembly, as done by the Organization of
Islamic Conference, to show its neutrality in the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The (U.N.) Secretary General was also apprised of the
situation in Afghanistan and the ascendancy of the Taliban" who
controlled Kabul and almost three-fourths of Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gohar said he also expressed concern to Annan over the reported
move to abolish United Nations Military Observers Group in India
and Pakistan (UNMOGIP).
</P>
<P>
"UNMOGIP is a peace-keeping operation decided upon by the
Security Council, and it can only be discontinued by the Security
Council itself after the fulfillment and implementation of
Security Council resolutions," he said.

<HEADLINE> Exercise Can Alleviate Parkinson's Disease: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Exercise is recommended not
only for keeping fit, but for improving the physical and
mental conditions of Parkinson's disease victims, today's
Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Naomi Klarfeld, an experienced
physiotherapist in Lin Clinic in Tel Aviv, as saying that
exercises can moderate the symptoms, make muscles more flexible,
help the patients to relax and reduce their anxiety.
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's disease is a slowly-developing disorder that causes
 damage to brain cells, and its first symptoms include tremors, a
mask-like face and movements of the fingers that look like one
that is rolling pills with them.
</P>
<P>
Later, patients may develop a shuffling gait, a slightly
bent-over posture, rigid muscles and weakness, and they may
drool, find it difficult to withstand heat and be emotionally
unstable.
</P>
<P>
There is a growing variety of drugs to ameliorate the
condition, but these may cause side effects, and nothing has yet
been found to cure Parkinson's whose cause is not really
known.
</P>
<P>
"It is really a difficult disease, but patients can be helped
by exercise," said Klarfeld, who specializes in exercise with
old people, adding exercise can also reduce patient's drooling
and improve speech and diction.
</P>
<P>
In many cases involving old people, patients who exercise
find that they have appetite, sleep better and feel good enough
to get out and go to their pensioners' club again, Klarfeld
noted.
</P>
<P>
A Hebrew-language booklet and videocassette, authored by
Klarfeld, demonstrating exercises that Parkinson's disease
patients can especially benefit, were released this week by
Israel Parkinson's Group.
</P>
<P>
Klarfeld often consults with neurologists from the Parkinson's
Group, as well as other doctors, when she is confronted with a
particularly difficult case and wants to suit an exercise regimen
to the patient.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Does Fall of Warlord Stronghold Mean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic militia
Taliban have ended the era of General Rashid Dostum as the most
powerful warlord in northern Afghanistan following their capture
of his headquarters of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The victorious Taliban fighters and their allied forces on
jeeps and tanks entered Mazar-e-Sharif, capital of the Balkh
province, about 300 km northwest of Kabul, on Saturday afternoon
without meeting much resistance, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
But analysts were quick to note that an end to the era of
Dostum, who is believed to have fled Afghanistan by helicopter to
a neighboring country, is a far cry from an end to the war in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Mazar-e-Sharif, the only major city over which the
Taliban had not gained control after they ousted the Kabul
government last September, came hours after the Taliban and its
allied forces took Sheberghan in the next-door Jowzjan province,
which is Dostum's hometown and regarded as the most secure
military base.
</P>
<P>
The downfall of Dostum, who was allied with former military
chiefs of the ousted Afghan government and considered the
strongest warlord in the anti-Taliban alliance, was brought about
mainly by the defection of his right-hand man, General Abudul
Malik, who staged a disastrous revolt early this week against his
former boss, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Malik's dramatic rebellion, which triggered defections of many
other commanders from the Dostum ranks, cleared the way for
further northward advances by the Taliban who already control
two-thirds of Afghan territory including Kabul.
</P>
<P>
With the fall of Mazar-e-Sharif, the Taliban have seriously
impaired the morale of the opposition alliance, which includes
forces of ousted Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani and the
Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat faction, and removed one of the strongest
fighting forces in the grouping.
</P>
<P>
After occupying the six northern provinces once controlled by
Dostum, the Taliban, who have vowed to impose strict Islamic law
on the war-torn Afghanistan, seems to be in a better position to
complete their three-year campaign to control all of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, it would be unrealistic to believe that the downfall
of Dostum marks the end-game in Afghanistan. Analysts here believe
that it may mark an end to the era of the warlord in the north but
cannot possibly to the war in the country.
</P>
<P>
It would be a shortsighted view that the ouster of Dostum may
finally herald in some peace and stability in Afghanistan, they
added.
</P>
<P>
It is self-evident that Afghanistan, a country composed of
multi-ethnic groups, cannot function smoothly under the complete
domination of one particular group even though it might be
militarily the strongest, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Given the deep divisions among the people on political, ethnic,
ideological and tribal lines and different groups fighting one
another for power and control, it is impossible that in the
absence of a political power-sharing arrangement, a military
victory alone will restore peace and stability on a durable basis,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, permanent peace, which has eluded the war-torn
country for a long time in the historical context, is not likely
to return even if all the provinces fall under the sway of the
Taliban militia in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here warned that the fall of the northern Afghanistan
to the Taliban would further recede the chances of a broadly-based
government at Kabul, which is regarded as the best choice to
restore peace and stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
And it would also prompt the defeated forces to wage a
prolonged and destabilizing guerrilla war against the Taliban
forces from their border retreats, they said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Syndicate Presidents Resign in Protest of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The amendments to Jordan's 1993 Press
and Publication Law continue to trigger off uproar as four
professional association presidents resigned Saturday and the rest
threaten to do so a month later, local newspaper Jordan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of the Jordan Bar Association (JBA), the Engineers
Association (JEA), the Writers Association (JWA) and the Dentists
Association (JDA) submitted their resignations Saturday night and
the remaining nine members of the Council of Presidents of
Professional Associations (CPPA) decided to withhold their
resignations until June 22 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
All of these came in protest of the amendments which they
think were not born of legal procedures and will kill freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
The former JEA President, Laith Shubeilat, said that The
government has been successful in turning over permanent laws,
turning temporary laws into permanent martial laws and has
persisted on this path. "I've taken a personal decision -- which
was once a collective decision -- to resign immediately."
</P>
<P>
"Our political system has to negotiate with the
representatives of the people in order to rectify this
situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The amendments were earlier enacted by King Hussein and later
introduced as the third temporary law under the current
government. They are widely believed to target the weekly tabloids
which have been infamous for slinging mud on the royal family,
leaking military secrets and intruding citizens' privacy.
</P>
<P>
Under the new articles of the law, each violator will be fined
some 21,186 U.S. dollars to 35,311 dollars which are a substantial
hike over the fines under the former law. And most of the dozen
weekly tabloids will have to close down because they can not
accumulate the demanded capital before the deadline set in the
amendments.
</P>
<P>
Government officials defended the amendments as "saving
national fabrics" and said that the government would not make any
concession with the press in pushing them through.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government promised Saturday to raise the
allowances for those employees who are members of professional
associations.
</P>
<P>
One day after the amendments were approved by King Hussein last
Saturday, nine members of the Jordan Press Association's (JPA)
10-member council submitted their resignations, but they revoked
their decision three days later under government pressure.
</P>
<P>
JPA also called a small-scale demonstration in front of the
prime minister's office last Tuesday, which resulted in nine
people jailed and six injured.

KUWAIT CITY -- The Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) said Saturday that
a  new technical agreement with the U.S. oil giant Chevron is
still under study, thereby indicating that accords with other
countries may be an alternative.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Al-Arbeed, executive assistant of the Managing Director

State owned by the Kuwaiti Petroleum Corporation, said that Kuwait
had "no plans to develop technical service agreements signed with
the U.S. Chevron company," the Kuwait News Agency reported.

<P>
A KOC-Chevron technical agreement, by which Chevron develops
oil fields in Kuwaiti largest Burgan oil fields, is due to
expire in February 1998. Burgan accounts for 70 percent of the
Kuwaiti oil production.
</P>
<P>
The KOC is currently negotiating with the French Total Company
to sign a new technical services agreement aimed at getting KOC
acquainted with the best international technology for developing
the oil fields.

<HEADLINE> Scrips Suffer Setback on Selling Pressure on BSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the scrips
suffered a setback following heavy selling pressure by operators
as well as foreign institutional investors and local institutions
during the week on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market.
</P>
<P>
The sentiment was affected by fears of a substantial hike in
prices of petroleum products on the eve of a United Front Steering
Committee meeting Sunday on the mounting oil pool account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The operators were unwilling to make fresh commitments as they
were disappointed by the not-so-encouraging performance of large
corporate houses, especially ITC Ltd and TISCO.
</P>
<P>
Though ITC posted an impressive 31 percent rise in net profit,
the share price fell during the week as the company failed to
announce dividend and the issue of bonus shares at its annual
general meeting in Calcutta on May 20.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index showed a fall of 53.27 points, closing
the week at 3,706.37 as against last week's close of 3759.64. The
national index also dipped by 83.92 points to end the week at
1,537.73 from 1,621.65 in the last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and the US dollar index were fractionally down at
359.78 and 167.41 compared with last weekend's close of 364.79 and
169.46 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Foreign institutional investors and local institutions were
sidelined as they preferred a wait-and-watch policy due to the
political developments.
</P>
<P>
Brokers showed their disappointment by keeping a low profile
due to poor showing by several blue chip companies, and limited
their purchases to companies with really good potentials.

<HEADLINE> German Finance Minister Says Tax Increases Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
indicated today his government might have to consider raising
taxes in order to plug widening hole in its budget.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sideline of a meeting of finance ministers of
Germany, Switzerland and Austria in Regensburg, Germany, Waigel
said a responsible-minded finance politician would not rule out
any possibilities, including unpopular tax increases, in the
current situation.
</P>
<P>
He expected that a decision on the issue would be made by Bonn
this summer.
</P>
<P>
But Waigel also admitted that a solution would have to be found
with the junior partner in the German ruling coalition, the Free
Democratic Party, which expressed strong opposition to any tax
increases during its national congress on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Faced with an expected tax shortfall of 18 billion German marks
(10.6 billion U.S. dollars) this year, Bonn may have to consider
emergency fund-raising measures to avert a budget crisis and to
meet the strict financial benchmarks to qualify for the single
European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Apart from tax increases, other measures being considered
include revaluing the central bank's gold reserves and selling
government's holding in the German telecom giant Deutsche Telecom.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in an interview with
the German business daily Handelsblatt Friday that Bonn could sell
all its 75 percent stake in Deutsche Telecom soon to enable the
nation to qualify for the Euro due to be launched on January 1,
1999.

<HEADLINE> Security Urged for Local Polls in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's Election Commission (EC)
today asked the government to hold Monday's local elections in a
free, fair and peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
Voters go to the polls on Monday in Central and East Nepal in
the the second phase of local elections following the first phase
in West Nepal held over last weekend.
</P>
<P>
In instructions issued today, the EC asked the government to
check human movement between polling stations, prevent undesired
activities and take immediate action against those attempting to
disturb the elections on polling day.
</P>
<P>
The Commission also demanded that mobilization of army soldiers
be increased in southern border districts and other sensitive
areas and action be taken against the security personnel
neglecting their duty at polling stations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Home Ministry, some 35,000 police personnel,
nearly 90 percent of the country's total police force, will be
deployed in different polling areas on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The polls are to be held in 35 districts of Central and East
Nepal including 34 municipalities and over 2,000 villages.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared Monday as a public holiday in the
polling regions to ensure the smooth proceeding of the polls,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has accused the government of tacitly
encouraging workers of a major ruling party to resort to violence
during the first phase local elections.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel and election officers often acted as mute
observers when clashes between activists of different political
parties erupted at polling stations, the opposition claimed.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Communist Party Calls to Safeguard Socialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban communist party is calling
on Cubans to safeguard socialism and preserve what the political
system has achieved for the island nation in the past 38 years.
</P>
<P>
The appeal is made in a draft document prepared for public
review before approval by the 5th congress of the party to open on
October 10 and published today by the official "Granma" newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The document identifies the continuity of the Cuban Revolution
in 1959, the development of the party and the characteristics of
democracy under the Caribbean nation's specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
An important part of the document, considered to be a
centerpiece of the coming party congress, analyzes the evolution
of the confrontation between the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Describing the U.S. intention to liquidate Cuba and enslave its
people as "an enormous challenge" for now and a threat for future,
it calls on Cubans to strengthen unity and their will to resist.
</P>
<P>
There will not be a restoration of capitalism in Cuba, because
the revolution will never be defeated, says the draft, adding that
revolution, motherland and socialism are the one and same thing.
</P>
<P>
It also reviews the progress in Cuba's social and economic
sectors in the past three decades and says the arrival of the
so-called special period has changed the situation abruptly.
</P>
<P>
The country now faces shortages of food, dress, footwear,
medicines, electricity and fuels, and has great difficulties in
transportation, housing and communal services.
</P>
<P>
These problems have put the will of Cubans to test, says the
draft document, which calls on the people to show their patriotic
and revolutionary determination by working more and better.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican Health Ministry
today issued an alert in 37 communities to prevent the incidence
of dengue from rising at the start of the rain season.
</P>
<P>
The population of a mosquito called Aedes Aegypti, a carrier of
the infectious disease, grows dramatically during the rain season
in these communities, Deputy Health Minister Fernando Marin said.
</P>
<P>
Marin stressed the need for all private homes and public
facilities to prevent the insect's reproduction by eliminating
anything or any place in which rain water can accumulate.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica confronts the danger of four varieties of classic
dengue, and if preventive measures are not in place, the deadly
hemorrhagic dengue could spread, said the health official.
</P>
<P>
"Although the cases of dengue have diminished in recent months,
we cannot cross our arms and lower the guard," Marin said.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has registered 115 cases of classic dengue so far
this year, compared with 2,289 cases in 1996 and over 5,000 in
1995.

HAVANA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuban media said today the United
States had secretly drafted changes to an anti-Cuba law to tighten
a 30-year-old sanction against the island country.
</P>
<P>
The changes, drafted by the U.S. House of Representatives'
Foreign Relations Committee, would harden the Helms-Burton Act --
a law designed to drive foreign investors away from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Named after its sponsors and passed last year, the law gives
Cuban Americans the right to sue, in U.S. courts, companies doing
business on their properties confiscated by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear fuel sales to Cuba, even for medical or scientific
uses, will be forbidden under the new legislative changes, said
media reports here confirmed by Cuban parliamentary sources.
</P>
<P>
Also as part of the new measures, the United States is to spend
4 million dollars to support anti-Havana agents and 44 million
dollars to finance anti-Cuba radio and television broadcasts.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Needs Malaysia's Help in Fighting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai National Assembly President
Wan Muhamad Nor Matha has said it was time for Thailand and
Malaysia to thrash out the issue of cross-border terrorism, which
was damaging economic growth in the south.
</P>
<P>
Terrorist raids by separatists have caused insecurity and
adversely affected development in southern border provinces, Wan
Nor said.
</P>
<P>
He added that although terrorism in Southern Thai border
provinces was internal affairs, he did not think it could be
solved without Malaysia's help.
</P>
<P>
Separatists often take refuge in Malaysia after carrying out
raids in Thai border provinces, the Bangkok Post today quoted Wan
Nor as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wan Nor said security problems had driven away potential
investors and stunted growth in the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand
Growth Triangle.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some leading members of separatist
movements still reside in Malaysia.

BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese enterprise is to provide
a typesetting system for a Japanese company, marking the entrance
of China's copyrighted, home-developed software products into the
world market, according to a software sales contract Beijing
University Founder Group signed with Japanese Recruit Co. Ltd.
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The deal involves a volume of "several millions of US dollars,"
it is said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuan, member of Chinese Academy of Sciences and founder of
Founder Group, said that efforts of the enterprise in the Japanese
market had paid off.
</P>
<P>
Besides this contract, IBM (Japan) Inc. has agreed to cooperate
with Founder to jointly promoting hardware and software products
for Japanese newspapers. Other cooperative projects with
electronics enterprises, such as Fujitsu Corporation, and
advertising companies, have already been on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Even having grabbed an 80 percent market share of the
Chinese-based typesetting systems worldwide, Wang considers this
deal the marker for Founder "really entering the international
market."
</P>
<P>
Founder has developed a Korean-based typesetting system. A test
version might be introduced in the Korean market later this year.
</P>
<P>
Founder's branch in Malaysia also registered in the Multimedia
Corridor, one of the key electronic projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a Founder official, only the pre-print market
volume in Japan may hit more than 10 billion US dollars a year,
"offering great potentials for Founder to tap in the future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1988, Founder Group has become one of China's
key hi-tech enterprises. The group last year posted a total
industrial turnover of more than 4 billion yuan, ranked 198th
among China's top 500 industrial enterprises.

JAKARTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The mortality rate of mothers in
Indonesia has reached 3.9 per 1,000 births and is the highest
among the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member
countries, an Indonesian official said.
</P>
<P>
The high rate was due to a delay in medical treatment given to
mothers in addition to a lower educational level, West Sumatra
Governor Hasan Basri Durin said Saturday, according to reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate of mothers in Indonesia reached 3.9 per

</P>
<P>
"If calculated in a day, the mortality rate on average is 75
mothers," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The mortality rate concerned is regarded as the highest
compared to that of other ASEAN member countries," he said, adding
that at the end of the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan in 1999,
the government was striving to minimize the figure to 2.25 per
1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
To that end, the government has launched a "Love Mother

<HEADLINE> Dredging Project to Turn Lancang-Mekong River Into Trade Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Transportation authorities in
southwest China's border province of Yunnan are conducting a
dredging project on Lancang River, whose lower reaches outside of
China are known as the Mekong.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing project has made it possible to turn the river into
an international economic corridor, according to a report in
today's "China Daily" (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
The project, involving 500 million yuan (60 million US dollars)
of investment, will enable 300-ton ships to travel to the
South China Sea from Saigon, Viet Nam, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The river, the eighth longest in the world, flows 4,800
kilometers through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and
Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
It is valued for its undeveloped natural and tourist resources
and promising trade route. However, ships can not sail on the
Lancang River for much of the year due to rapids, sharp curves and
shallow water during the dry season.
</P>
<P>
The dredging work in the river's upper reaches is finished.
When the whole project is completed, more vigor will be injected
into the already booming border trade, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Program
and companies form Europe, the Unites States, Hong Kong and Japan
are interested in investing the project, it said.
</P>
<P>
The annual cargo trade on the Lancang-Mekong River climbed to
60,000 tons in 1996, from 1993's 10,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for border trade has become more favorable because
of Chinese, Lao, Myanmar and Thai governments' eagerness to tap
the potential of the river, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Besides conferences and joint investigations, they are
negotiating a multilateral cargo transportation agreement to allow
direct shipping, it said.

<HEADLINE> Riot in Indonesia's S. Kalimantan Kills Dozens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Police in Banjarmasin, capital of
South Kalimantan, have found dozens of scorched bodies in debris
of the burned Mitra plaza building which was set ablaze during a
riot on Friday, the official Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police chief of the Banjarmasin Precinct, Lt. Col. Friedy
Tjiptoadi, said last night that the number of alleged human skulls
found in the debris was 60.
</P>
<P>
An investigation conducted by a team of doctors of the
Banjarmasin police precinct showed that skulls were mostly found
in three locations near the exit of the building.
</P>
<P>
Some of the skulls were difficult to identify and collect,
because they were still heating on the fire, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The riot began Friday afternoon when the ruling party Golkar
supporters, staging their final round of campaigns, were attacked
by unidentified people.
</P>
<P>
At least 80 people were injured and hundreds of shops and
houses were burned in the riot, the news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar, the United Development Party (PPP) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) started their campaign on April
27 for the general election scheduled for May 29. May 23 was the
last day of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, about 130 people were killed and
hundreds injured during the campaign, mostly in campaign-related
traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Officials said all the three parties had violated campaign
rules by showing strength in the streets, such as staging motor
parades and marches.
</P>
<P>
About 124 million voters are eligible to take part in the
forthcoming general election, the sixth in the country since 1971.
The three parties will vie for 425 of the 500 parliament seats,
with the remaining 75 seats reserved for the armed forces who do
not vote in the election.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou: Southwest China's Biggest Coal Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou Province
will put five billion yuan to open coal mines in the next
five years to increase the province's coal output to 80 million
tons by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to ship 20 million tons of coal to
other areas of China and export another three million tons by the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou, the biggest coal producer and distributor in southwest
China, produced 61.54 million tons of coal, ranking seventh in the
country, and dressed 2.6 million tons of coal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The province now ships 10 million tons of coal to the South
China provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, and exports some to
southeast Asian countries and to Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou is estimated to have 241.9 billion tons of coal
resources, with a proven coal reserve of 51 billion tons,
surpassing the aggregate total of 12 south China provinces and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Coal Industry announced recently that it would
give priority to the construction of two major coal production
bases, one for Guizhou and the other being for the
Shanxi-Shaanxi-Inner Mongolia region. Panjiang Coal Mine of
Guizhou has been included in the country's plan to develop eight
key coal mines.
</P>
<P>
Coal mining began in this southwest China province as
early as in Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), but by the year of 1949,
when New China was founded, coal output of the province was only
300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial bureau of coal industry says
that Guizhou has great potential for the development of its coal
industry, as the province has abundant coal resources which are
easily exploited, and conditions are also ideal for
building large shaft mines.
</P>
<P>
The demand for coal has kept growing following the economic
expansion of coastal areas of southwest China, putting Guizhou in
an advantageous position in competing with other interior areas of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with improvement of transportation conditions,
especially the operation of Nanning-Kunming Railway Line which
links the Panjiang Coal Mine with the outside world, Guizhou has a
much brighter prospect for development, as the central government
has decided to shift its development strategy from concentrating
on east and coastal areas to central and western China, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, an increasing number of overseas
investors have kept coming to inspect Guizhou with the hope of
finding investment opportunities, and some have begun to discuss
cooperative ventures this year.

<HEADLINE> Santiago to Spend 2 Million Dollars to Combat Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean capital of Santiago
has a budget of about 2 million U.S. dollars in 1996 and 1997 for
drug-related prevention, rehabilitation and research projects.
</P>
<P>
The figure is a record high for the city's drug prevention
operations, said Mayor of Santiago German Quintana, adding that
some extra funding will come from private contributions.
</P>
<P>
Quintana said one million local residents will benefit from the
operations in the two years.
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug projects, he said, are aimed in essence at
helping children and teenagers, especially pre-school children and
teenagers who have never or once consumed some drugs.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the Chilean government is reportedly earmarking
more than 5.6 million dollars this year, or almost double the
amount of 1995, for fight against drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10 percent of young people in Chile consume some
kind of narcotics and four percent of the country's work force are
believed to be addicted.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks Partners to Develop Nuclear Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China does not rule out the
possibility of cooperating with any country with advanced nuclear
technology as long as it provides competitive techniques and
products, a China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
Today's Business Weekly of China daily quoted Li Donghui,
Deputy Director General of CNNC's international cooperation, as
saying that China would continue to seek foreign cooperation in the
next century when nuclear power will become an important
alternative energy source.
</P>
<P>
As China is relying more on itself for future nuclear power
industry development, whether to help China realaize localization
of nuclear power equipment manufacturing and self-reliance in
designing, operating and managing nuclear plants will be one of
the major considerations in choosing further partners, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Besides the current partners -- France, Canada and Russia,
companies from the US, Japan and Republic of Korea have shown
interest to enter the Chinese nuclear power market.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China is willing to explore cooperation with these
countries, but locationization is a strategic priority in China's
long-term nuclear power development.
</P>
<P>
The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, the first Sino-French unclear
cooperation project, went into commercial operation in 1994 and
the construction of the Ling'ao Nuclear Power Plant, the second
one with the French cooperation, began this month.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Foreign Reserves Down in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's foreign exchange
reserves were down by 292 million U.S. dollars from April 30 to
stay at 15.64 billion dollars on May 19, the press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The biggest reduction was registered during the first week of
May, when the reserves dropped from 15.91 billion dollars to 15.77
billion dollars, Banco Central de Venezuela was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, said the central bank in a report, 138 million
dollars was slashed from the balance sheet from May 12 to 19.
</P>
<P>
The bank authorities attributed the lower foreign reserves to
the interest payment of the country's external debts, a decrease
in earnings from oil exports, and the outflow of capitals.
</P>
<P>
The recent developments appeared to have broken the trend
observed during March and April this year, when foreign reserves
at the central bank were up by more than 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the South American country's foreign reserves had
grown by 5.85 billion dollars anyway since the liberation of the
Venezuelan foreign exchange market in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
And the government and the central bank were expecting the
total to reach 16 billion dollars by the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> China to Lower Price of Unleaded Auto Gasoline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
lower the price of unleaded gasoline in a bid to phase out leaded
gas in Chinese cities, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
State Bureau of Environmental Protection (SBEP) is consulting
the Ministry of Finance and other ministries, state commissions
and national corporations about the new price reform, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"The new policy will ensure unleaded gasoline costs less than
leaded fuel for the next two years", it quoted Li Pei, a project
officer from SBEP's air pollution control department, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The low gas prices are particularly important because Beijing
and Tianjin will ban leaded gasoline downtown early next month,"
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Unleaded gas costs about 15 fen (about two US cents) more per
litre than leaded gas at present in China.
</P>
<P>
However, rapid growth of the number of motor vehicles and wide
use of leaded gas have led to serious air pollution in Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
Auto emissions contribute to the smog enveloping the cities,
and lead containing in the emissions is blamed as one of the major
"criminals" doing harm to urbanities' health.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Beijing and Tianjin, other big cities, including
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Shenzhen vow to ban leaded gas in
the next year.
</P>
<P>
Li told "China Daily" that they need unified action nationwide
in order to implement such significant price reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The policy will help ensure state revenues do not decrease and
to ensure refineries are enthusiastic about increasing
production," Li said.

<HEADLINE> China Tops the World Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China topped the world
again after lifting the Sudirman Cup for the world mixed team
badminton championship in Scotstoun Leisure Center here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Unlike two years ago at Lausanne, Switzerland, where China as
challengers fought with the inspiration, ingenuity and zeal to
upset star-studded Indonesia, the Oriental power spoke with true
strength this time.
</P>
<P>
Claiming a luxury line-up of three world number ones, China
carried on the winning momentum at the All England Open to sweep
past Indonesia in the semi-final on their way to a 5-0 victory
over South Korea in the final showdown.
</P>
<P>
The power of South Korea, especially in the women's doubles,
was apparently weakened by the retirement of Gil Young Ah and
injury-haunted Jang Hye Ock. But they still had the
determination and power to wear down pre-tournament favorite
Denmark in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had similiar problems. World number one combination
of Trikus Heryanto and Minarti Timur played only one match and
Heryanto was replaced by Limpele Flandy in the key semi-final
match against China.
</P>
<P>
Their men's singles players are either too old or out of form,
while their women's pair unstable.
</P>
<P>
Badminton queen Susi Susanti was still superb in performance
and Olympic men's doubles champion Rexy Mainaky and Ricky Subagja
played flautlessly. However, winning only two rubbers is not
enough for taking a match.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese victory also have historical meaning. In the past
four championships, it was usually the biggest favorite who lost
the final as the weight of expectation was often too heavy to
bear.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Li Yongbo guided to dismantle the bizzare
logic. "We got to have confidence in addition to our outstanding
level above others," he warned his team before the final.
</P>
<P>
Li's words worked and the former world doubles champion was
happy to see China excelled again.
</P>
<P>
"If it was surprising performance that brought us to victory
at last championship, we won today with our true strength and the
team's solidarity," Li said after the match.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to see hard work paid off. We deserve the win."

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Residents Keen on Book Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of bookstores in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, has
increased to more than 2,000, or one bookstore for every 3,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
The number of books per capita in the city has always been
the highest among other Chinese cities since the reform and
opening-up policies were introduced in the late 1978.
</P>
<P>
When business is slack, people still buy books because
improving themselves through reading may help them avoid being
laid off.
</P>
<P>
"Money spent on children's toys may be the first to be cut from
the family budget, when the family's income drops," said the
manager of a children's shop, which has seven counters, including
a book counter.
</P>
<P>
"But the sales volume of the children's books always grows
steadily, whether it is Children's Festival, Spring Festival, or
ordinary days," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many department stores try to attract customers with books on
sale.
</P>
<P>
"We have found that books with 10 percent in discount is a
bigger temptation for customers than other commodities, even sold
at a half price," explained a business owner, "because books have
the original prices printed on the cover, while the prices for
other commodities are decided by the stores."
</P>
<P>
A bookstore opened this year in Tianhe Shopping Center, the
largest of its kind in the city. The bookstore in Wangfujing
Commercial Plaza expanded to over 1,000 sq. meters. The new
bookstores have a more comfortable shopping environment than the
old ones.
</P>
<P>
More and more people today prefer to read books on professional
skills, social relations, economic management, and science and
technology, according to bookstore owners.
</P>
<P>
They said books for entertainment also have fewer buyers,
because people's spare time is occupied by the television
programs.

<HEADLINE> Pantani Falls in Giro D'Italia Cycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian star Marco Pantani sustained a
leg injury as he fell in the eighth stage of the Giro d'Italia
cycling race on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Six riders fell off in a chain of collisions after a cat ran
onto the road in front of Pantani's group.
</P>
<P>
Pantani managed to complete the final 20 kilometers of the
day's route south along the Amalfi coast from Mondragone to Cava
de' Tirreni, finishing over 26 minutes behind Mario Manzoni, an
Italian who won the stage in a solo runaway ride.
</P>
<P>
Pantani was taken to the hospital, where X-rays revealed a
muscular lesion of the left leg -- the same limb he broke in an
accident during the Milan-Torino road race in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Manzoni clocked five hours, nine minutes and 20 seconds and
countryman Stefano Giraldi placed second with 23 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Defending Giro champion Pavel Tonkov of Russia retained the
overall leader's pink jersey. He came in with the main group,
14:01 behind Manzoni.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (103-104) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (103-104) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Why members of the last British Hong Kong Legislative
Council cannot all get on the "through train"?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to the Decision of the National People's
Congress on the Method for the Formation of the First Government
and the First Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, implementation of the "through train"
arrangement must meet the following three conditions:
</P>
<P>
1. The composition of the last British Hong Kong Legislative
Council must conform with relevant provisions of the NPC Decision
and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
2. Its members must uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR,
are willing to pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR and meet
such qualifications as set forth in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
3. They must be endorsed by the Preparatory Committee for the
Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the first condition is a prerequisite for
the implementation of the "through train" arrangement. When Chris
Patten pushed ahead with his political reform package, the
British side did not seek consultations with the Chinese side in
advance and refused afterward to accept the views and admonitions
of the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
And the composition of the last Hong Kong Legislative Council
is not in conformity with relevant provisions of the NPC Decision
and the Basic Law. These have destroyed the basis for implementing
the "through train" arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Because of the sabotage of the British side, the "through
train" arrangement is no longer viable. As a result, members of
the last Legislative Council are unable to get on the "through
train."
</P>
<P>
Question: Why is it not contradictory to encourage Hong Kong
patriots to participate in local elections on the one hand and to
re-organize Hong Kong's three-tier political structure on the
other?
</P>
<P>
Answer: As the "through train" has been derailed by the British
side with its unilateral execution of the political reform
package, the NPC Standing Committee adopted a resolution at its
ninth meeting held in August, 1994, authorizing the Preparatory
Committee for the Hong Kong SAR to organize the first legislature
of the Hong Kong SAR in accordance with relevant decisions of the
NPC and provisions of the Basic Law, and declaring that the last
British Hong Kong three-tier political structure will cease on
June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China encouraged patriotic people in Hong
Kong to actively participate in the three-tier elections
there. These two moves are not contradictory because:
</P>
<P>
First, all the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong are Chinese
citizens, and the right to vote and stand for election is one of
their inalienable fundamental political rights.
</P>
<P>
Second, through participation in the elections, Hong Kong
compatriots may have greater involvement in Hong Kong affairs and
gain experience during the transitional period, which is favorable
for the implementation of the policies of "one country, two
systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Third, as the main objective of the British political reform
package is to make way for its proxies in Hong Kong to control
political power so as to perpetuate its influence in Hong Kong
after 1997, active participation of Hong Kong patriots in the
elections and their winning of some seats may serve as a
constraint on the British Hong Kong authorities bent on
manipulating the Legislative Council and sabotaging a smooth
transfer of government. This is conducive to maintaining Hong
Kong's long-term stability and prosperity and to re-organizing the
three-tier political structure there.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- England beat South Africa 2-1 in a
soccer friendly at Manchester on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ian Wright scored a controversial winner 16 minutes from the
end in the first ever soccer match between England and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Wright seemed to control the ball with his arm before turning
to fire the ball home from 12 meters.
</P>
<P>
Despite the South African protests, the refree allowed the goal
to stand.
</P>
<P>
England went 1-0 ahead after 20 minutes as Philip Neville
collected a cross from Teddy Sheringham. He slipped the ball to
Robert Lee who drove it between two South African players from 10
meters.
</P>
<P>
Phil Masinga levelled the score with a header before the
halftime.
</P>
<P>
England took this match as a warm-up chance for their crucial
World Cup qualifier against Poland next week.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Croats Set Up Community of Gerzeg-Bosna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Bosnian Croats
today formally adopted a resolution on establishing the Croat
Community of Herzeg-Bosna.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed at the First Assembly of the Croat
Community of Herzeg-Bosna which was meeting at Neum, a
Croat-controlled seaside town of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the Croat Community of
Herzeg-Bosna will be the "umbrella institution of the Croat people
in Bosnia-Herzegovina" to ensure the development and protection of
the national, economic, social and other interests of Bosnian
Croats.
</P>
<P>
The Croat Community of Herzeg-Bosna was formed after Bosnian
Croats had to abolish the "Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia" under
pressure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bozo Rajic, chairman of the Croatian Democratic Union in Bosnia
and head of the committee for establishing the Croat community of
Herzeg-Bosna, said that the organization would not have
state-level attributes.
</P>
<P>
But Bosnian Muslims were apparently angry at the move of
Croats. The establishment of the Croat community "shows the
continuation of the Croat tendency towards separation," said a
commentary in the Sarajevan daily OSlobodjenie Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nine Croats, including Rajic and Kresimir Zubak, the Croat
member of the Bosnian presidency, were elected to the executive
council of the community, but its president, who will be the most
powerful in the community, will be elected next week.
